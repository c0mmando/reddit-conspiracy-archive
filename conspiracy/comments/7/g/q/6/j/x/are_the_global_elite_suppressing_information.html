       "Intuition is a very powerful thing, more powerful than intellect." - Steve Jobs
      </p>
      <p>
       So I've been thinking, since we live in a world of secret societies that rig the educational system to form a caste system of elite who are getting special educations, could intuition be a key to one of their secrets? They actively look to suppress information about Nikola Tesla who supported the idea that intuition was a key factor to his success.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Instinct is something which transcends knowledge. We have, undoubtedly, certain finer fibers that enable us to perceive truths when logical deduction, or any other willful effort of the brain, is futile." - Nikola Tesla
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched a YouTube video about this, where the poster posits it's because of his beliefs about intuition and free energy for all that the government raided his apartment after his death, to keep their electricity interests intact and maintain a monopoly on energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does the idea of subtle energy scare them? Because it's part of a mystery they don't want solved, that the power of intuition is very strong and can give us answers to questions they don't want us asking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       This got me thinking of who uses intuition to succeed, and it's the world of business. There are books about intuition and using it to fuel business desicions, but most of the books are about developing a psychic ability or sixth sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I thought of MK Ultra and the Deep State's will to mind control us, and how our media and internet is plastered with propoganda in an effort to control us through subconscious methods. From what I've heard about intuition is that you don't use your logic or whatever controlling influence you're under to reason out the explanation, the thought comes to you in a moment of brilliance or a gut feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've told myself in the past that you can't listen to your intuition or gut feelings, that you have to reason everything out according to what we've been programmed to think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there a deeper level to our subconscious mind which instinctually knows the right answer? More and more I see people going with their intuition when it comes to the Deep State's lies, a shift in consciousness thinking. Are we waking up, finally?

       Pretty sure this is why the put fluoride in the US water. It is known to gather at the pineal gland in large doses when it is ingested. And all of the ancient civilizations were obsessed with the pineal gland making loads symbols depicting like the eye of horus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fluoride fucking up your glands:

       That's always been my question. Are they and their families all drinking and showering with special filters that remove fluoride? Surely the top people in power are aware of the importance the pineal gland plays in realizing the true nature of our existence and the grand scheme of things and wouldn't want the gland to be destroyed by fluoridation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes for those who claim that chemtrails are real. The elites also breathe the same air and live under the same skies as the rest of us, so how would they possibly shield themselves and their families from the effects of chemtrails?

       Was fluoride added before or after WW2 in the West? Might be a Nazi discovering considering they were testing its docility effects. Plus all of their research into mysticism.

       Other physical effects on the third eye is entrainment and radiofrequency. I cited papers on radiofrequency in my comment below. Psychic entrainment is flickering by candle light and bon fires. Mind control entrainment is flashing and flickering. Digital alarm clock on bed stand and digital clock in car flash : between the hour and the minute. Why? Totally unnecessary. Analogue alarm clocks do not flash. Electronic equipment flash their indicator light. Totally unnecessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fluorescent light, computer screens and TV screens flicker which creates flicker fusion. A form of entrainment:

       I agree! One thing I've started pondering lately is that it's become so difficult to know what is and isn't lies, you know, what with the mainstream media being so decpetive, and with there being 'controlled opposition' in the alt-media, and with these LARPS and leakers and whistleblowers, some of whom might be genuine, some of whom might be attention seeking, some of whom might be disinfo agents etc - it's just so so difficult to work out who is honest, that it's almost becoming necessary to use your intuition to guide you when it comes to these things - honing our intuitive skills has never been more necessary, or at least it's never been more obvious that it's necessary. Most people understand the concept of intuition and have had experience with it personally - experience that it does genuinely work, it's a real thing. Yet it's also kind of waved away as though it's silliness. I think the biggest problem leading to poor intuition is confidence and a lack of trust in your own ability to intuit, and that's what this pervasive idea of it being a bit 'silly' or not really 'real' promotes - a lack of trust in our own gut instincts.

       The biggest suppressing force is not the government. It is your own family and incarnational karma. The problem is that it's so unconscious you can't even begin to imagine its immensity. It spans thousands of years. All those lifetimes you had where you didn't clean up properly after. All the unconscious family control programming will block your inner vision unless you clear it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest conspiracy on this planet isn't by any government, company, or organization. It is run by the transmedium beings (beings without bodies) who are so stuck on control that they can't get out of everyone's space. Many of these beings are ancestral. Some are alien, and other kinds, but mostly they are family beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are stuck on your genetic line, energetically, and unconsciously blocking your inner vision. Anyone who has meditated even a little bit can feel, communicate, and see that level of energy. It is not fun. It feels like you are being punished/controlled until you clear it out. But you are not a victim. You elected to work that level of energy because your genetic line had matches with what your spirit needed to work out. So it is an opportunity, but only if you have psychic tools and understand how to use it as an opportunity for growth. Otherwise, you will just stay stuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Combine all that family energy with 2,000+ years of religious programming/control, and all your past lives that you haven't cleared out yet from your space, as a spirit, and it is no wonder that no one can see anything clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of meditation it takes to move that much crap out of your inner space takes 5-10 years minimum, working energy close to every day. I have worked with hundreds of psychics. I have seen how long it takes most people. There is no way you can do it alone, and no way you can do it without knowing how to end karma or deprogram energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes it does not help that most "food" is actually poison and education and entertainment are dumbed down distractions. Intuition is a very low level self-communication space. Ideally, you should be able to close your eyes and see perfectly clearly what you are attempting to ascertain or view. It takes a long time for people to get to that level though. There is a very high level of permission for men to use their inner vision in a business context. That is very insightful for you to have discovered that on your own.

       Thinking is limited because it operates within the box of data that we have already acquired. Intuition is quite literally "thinking outside of the box," except it's not really thinking at all because we simply don't  know what we don't know. So we can never think for new data, we have to receive it. Think the allegory of the cave. The ones in the cave can never know what's outside of it. They have to leave and see for themselves. This is basically what intuition is. Leaving the cave and directly experiencing what is out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Intuitive moments/inspiration(same idea) can come in many different ways(meditation is the most popular and effective) but I'll tell you how you definitely won't experience and that's by thinking or trying to figure it out.

       Many humans are experiencing a spiritual awakening right now, intensified by the sun. We have done surveys in some of the more out-there subs I love and a large correlation is found in the Meyers Briggs personality profile. Those awakening are usually introverted intuitive types, with some extroverts thrown in the make sure we keep talking!

       Our intuition is the connection with our highest self. Try meditation and opening your heart chakra.

       Thanks for the advice. I put on a 1 hour binaural beat for heart chakra and I felt the love during meditation. I happen to be introverted intuitive also. Syncrinacity for sure. And thank you for the compliment.
