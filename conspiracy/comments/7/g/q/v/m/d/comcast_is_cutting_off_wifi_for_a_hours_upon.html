        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For the past few months my wifi has gone out for an hour(or more) at night, everyday. I run on Xfinity Wifi, and every night (or so) my wifi cuts out and doesn&#39;t come back on for the next hour. I&#39;ve thought, &quot;Oh I just live in a bad area for wifi, I do live where a lot of accidents and storms happen, maybe the radio towers are just having maintenance done,&quot; but then I started talking to people who live an hour, 2 hours, or 30 minutes away and they said they&#39;ve been having this problem too. I live in the sub-urbs, and with some google searches, I saw there are a lot of radio towers around me. So I know its not maintenance. 
    At one point, it got too often that my parents called in. And it put us through a complicated and long call. We talked to a representative and all they said was that they were doing all they can and it will be back on shortly. But also, that it WAS maintenance, and they&#39;ve been working on fixing it.
     Still, maybe it was just a odd coincidence, but then it started happening at school. My school also runs on Xfinity and have been experiencing wifi outages also. specifically during the day. Never at night. When all my experiences, have happened during the day.
     I think that they are purposefully cutting off the wifi. Proof :
1)Outages occur during the day in schools (when most people are there and affected by it), and outages occur during the night out of school (when most people are at home doing homework or watching youtube/netflix and are affected by it). </p>

<p>2) There really isn&#39;t a reason why they&#39;d need to do maintenance, which would mean they are lying.</p>

<p>3) This is happening to many people, even people not in my area.</p>

<p>Reasons I think they may be doing this :</p>

<p>1) As reddit knows, ISP&#39;s (including Comcast) have been trying to make a ban on Internet Neutrality rules, maybe they are trying to show a flaw to the people. For the people who don&#39;t know how the internet works (or the majority of the voters/citizens), maybe they are trying to show them that there is a flaw in how the internet is. To make them think that it is the internet&#39;s fault, not theirs. Influencing their decision on what we should do. &quot;If the internet keeps shutting down and having problems, than that means that the internet is doing bad, it needs to be fixed&quot;</p>

<p>2) Maybe the ISP&#39;s are being hired by President Trump to run this case again, Because he knows that they will loose. All this bad news about trump, maybe he thought that he could be known as the person who made the internet safe forever. After all these loses that the public sees, maybe I can show the public a win that would affect all of them the most. And what is something the people need the most, that will make them the most concerned? The internet</p>

<p>3) With the same idea as reason 2, maybe instead of the President having the idea, it was everyone the legislative branch. With all the crime and bad ideas that has been happening, maybe they wanted a win to be a distraction from all that. a very important win. But what about the &quot;maybe&quot;, the maybe that the ISP&#39;s win. Well, then the people have to blame someone for letting that happen. They can&#39;t blame themselves, no, people are selfish. And they can&#39;t blame the ISP&#39;s, they wanted it, but they didn&#39;t necessarily have to have it. So who&#39;s to blame? Who has so much trash on them that adding on more thing, won&#39;t affect anything. President Trump. The president that hates the Net neutrality rules.</p>

<p>There are of course flaws in these theories, but every conspiracy theory has some truth in it.</p>

Also,
My school&#39;s admin retired a year ago and the new one is really good, and though I care about being online for school, most things are offline. And I don&#39;t want to make her feel bad about having a hard time doing her job, and being told by a student. But thanks for the advice. If it becomes so bad, than I will but yeah.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to login to your router. Use the ip address in the address bar. Just google the model of your router and its default ip address. From there just use your wifi password to login. After that somewhere in the admin menu will be the option to change the dns address. There are much harder ways to do it. But that should be sufficient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have Xfinity and called two days ago regarding this. The only thing they would say is call back when it’s on for a refund. At this rate they need to refund for the total bill because ours never works. It’s constantly kicking us off WiFi or going down completely. Same response every time I call. Reset modem. Unplug devices. Bullfreakingcrap. It has gotten so bad this month it’s beyond irritating.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t used comcast in years but I assume people are still getting charged for the modem rental fees. You will have to look at your bill.</p>

<p>I&#39;m about to get cable cards to stop paying Verizon for TV boxes for the same reason. Fees are getting stupid for their crappy boxes.</p>

<p>I would head over to <a href="/r/comcast">/r/comcast</a> or <a href="/r/homelab">/r/homelab</a> or a similar sub to get a recomendation on a cable modem so you can ditch the comcast one.</p>

<p>The technology has changed over time so you want to make up you get the right replacement. Ideally you shouldn&#39;t pay any rental fees if you have your own equipment, you will just be paying for the service.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can confirm. Xfinity is a piece of shit, and within the last few months it has become unbearable. For me, it started cutting out at night time...no connection at all. It sucked because I like having Netflix on before I go to bed...but I figured we just had old equipment.  After the first time it was cut out all DAY, we had a service technician come out. Our equipment is fine and he gave us some mumbo jumbo about wires installed on their end...and it seemed to be fixed (but that didn&#39;t last long).</p>

<p>This past 2 weeks has been HELL. When the internet is up the speed is snail like and continuously cuts in and out. Some days the internet doesn&#39;t work AT ALL during the day all morning through late afternoon. This has been really hard for me because I work from home (internet based) and have also been applying for jobs....you have no idea how many times I&#39;ve had to refill applications I was almost done with but lost it all because the internet took a shit (or wasn&#39;t able to fill them out at all).</p>

<p>These people have balls and I&#39;m right about ready to squish them into oblivion. Fuck them for screwing people over so hardcore. I mean, it&#39;s not like their service is free ffs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your &quot;wifi&quot; goes down, or your <em>internet connection</em> goes down? </p>

<p>Listen kid, if it&#39;s just your wifi going down then that has nothing to do with Comcast.  That&#39;s just your router being a piece of shit.  If you&#39;re INTERNET connection goes down, then thats Comcast.  </p>

<p>I actually don&#39;t care which one it is for you, the fact that you don&#39;t make any distinction means you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, which means your entire rant is meaningless.  </p>

<p>Your wifi router going down is not a grand conspiracy manufactured by Donald Trump.  It&#39;s just the shitty router that Comcast sent you.  Go ask your parents for an advance on your allowance, and buy your own router.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, calm down, I didn&#39;t mean to offend you in anyway. This is a theory, theories can be wrong and they definitely are a lot of the time. I didn&#39;t mean for people to take this really serious, it was just a stupid idea for a big problem. I made this theory because initially I just wanted to ask if people had the same problem, but I thought it would be more fun to expand the idea. Ive been thinking about net neutrality rules a lot for the past few months, and a big company against it (Comcast) is also doing something weird mainly only during the months of the debate. So the more I thought about it, the more I thought it would fit better on the conspiracy sub. Also, if I was inferring that my router was malfunctioning than I would. I used the term Wifi loosely, but I meant the internet connection. This was a fun idea. So anytime you hear something about trump, stop being extremely desperate to protect him, grasping at straw to make me seem like an inexperienced asshole. And even if this was true, what says it is a bad thing if it is never figured out? If anything it would make us happy with our politicians. And even though you don&#39;t care, it is the internet connection. </p>
