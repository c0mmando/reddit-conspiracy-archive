    <div class="md"><p>Problem is, Trump isn&#39;t the good guy here. He merely represents a different faction of the Elites. He only deserves our help as far as it concerns protecting the Office of the Presidency itself from trumped up charges within the Press and elsewhere, because that will set the precedent that any President going forward can be driven out on lies and innuendo.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Trump doesn&#39;t deserve our help beyond this. He&#39;s going to continue looting the country, just like HRC would have. He has appointed Goldman CEO&#39;s and CFO&#39;s to his cabinet and advisory board...the same Goldman that has 3 former CEO&#39;s/CFO&#39;s on the DNC Unity Commission...he is opposed by the HRC/Obama faction of the Corporatist Elite but that doesn&#39;t mean he isn&#39;t a Corporatist surrounding himself with Corporatists also...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It will hurt the economy, history shows that. &quot;Trickle-down&quot; economics has never worked. It only balloons the national debt and reinforces the class divide. I&#39;ll tell you what will happen:</p>

<p>The rich will keep the money they save, and won&#39;t invest it or distribute it to their employees. They&#39;re already sitting on record amounts of liquid assets right now, but aren&#39;t using it in any socially beneficial way. </p>

<p>This shrinkage of tax revenue will result in less government spending on social programs. Average Americans will have to pay more out of pocket for healthcare, school, and other services. This means the bulk of Americans will become financially screwed. They&#39;ll spend less. Companies will lay off employees because people are buying less. And another recession will come forth.</p>
