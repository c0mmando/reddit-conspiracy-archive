        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">125</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-12-01 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/005A9C.html">005A9C</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With NN being what it is and how it has taken over Reddit (thankfully) everyone posting their Senators, Reps etc that are against NN.</p>

<p>So I dug around, found that Fienstein is NOT <strong>FOR</strong> NN, but rather is for what it could help, women. (Nothing wrong with that we get a win) I posted to <a href="/r/California">/r/California</a> her accepted payments from Comcast and Time Warner (combined for nearly 40k).</p>

<p>She&#39;s been in office since 96, since then Time Warner, now Spectre, has a monopoly on LA and Comcast on SF and Sacramento. Sonic fiber can&#39;t expand anymore, Google can&#39;t even upgrade their own internet. The only constant thing during all of this is her.</p>

<p>I was shadow banned and all other threads removed.</p>

<p>However that is where it stops for Dianne.</p>

<p>She has no news on her site about it, last one was May 8th. She has no tweets about it, except maybe 2 in July.</p>

<p>Here is her history with NN. I&#39;m on mobile, sorry if I don&#39;t fix all the links. I pulled various sources so there is no bias here.</p>

<p>This old hag needs to go, she&#39;s running a 6th fucking term and now she has someone really running against her that is a threat, especially after Sen. Harris was elected.</p>

<p>Are the mods shills/astroturfering/campaigning for Fienstein?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are definitely deleting comments and threads, but yea not just about Feinstein. There is a verge article that is linked on just about every remaining thread, though.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that hard to takeover a subreddit. Most local political parties have people running facebook/twitter pages. Those same people will naturally become active on reddit. For someone like the social media manager of a senator/representative of california, r/california is the most obvious place to set up shop. They&#39;ll beat out any other user in activity because it&#39;s literally their job, and when it comes time for mod additions they&#39;ll usually be a shoe-in. However, there arises a problem for a sub like that in that they may not need new moderators indefinitely. At that point you can do a number of things all of which I&#39;ve seen happen before:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Post massive amounts of spam to the subreddit (particularly at night so it lingers for hours) to create the need for new mods</p></li>
<li><p>Attempt to hack/rat the head mod</p></li>
<li><p>Offer to buy the account straight up</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But the most important thing to remember is that the people most invested in this site are no longer normal everyday users but paid political entites, &quot;journalists&quot; (u/washingtonpost), and quite frankly people trying to sell you a product or service.</p>
