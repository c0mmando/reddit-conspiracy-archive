       I’m for whatever makes the internet the most open and free. Look into the Obama era net neutrality legislation. You’ll find it does the opposite, giving big government massive power to police the internet. It’s concerned with neutrality about as much as the patriot act is about patriotism

       If it gives big government massive power to police the internet...why aren't they policing the internet? If the Trump administration had the power to control the internet already, they wouldn't be trying to dump net neutrality to begin with. And not only that, but they have control over it regardless of net neutrality thanks to the FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION. The FCC

       The control of whether or not the internet remains traffic neutral or is subject to corporate gatekeeping.

       I don't know what you're trying to pull, but you're talking to the wrong crowd. You're not going to convince anyone you're right, because you aren't. Anyone with one ounce of knowledge of how the internet works knows you are egregiously wrong-headed. You've fallen for the hype and propaganda and accuse others of doing that same. That's called projection. That's called being an idiot.

       I don't trust anyone, including the Government. I live in the DC area; I live a block from Andrew McCabe. My neighbors are your Government, and frankly, you don't want them to be. Stop buying into ideologies and look at the actions of whoever it is that you're judging. Try to dig deeper and make less generalizations vs. opinions based upon taking the time to read further.

       First off that the net neutrality legislation made the net neutral. Second off that the repeal of “net neutrality” will lead to the destruction of the internet as we know it, thirdly, that every single sub shaming their politicians is an organic, non-brigaded reaction to the possibility of neutrality repeal

       Interesting.  I was always skeptical about the claims of "neutrality".  In your opinion, how is not neutral?  IMO, searching the internet, the results I get, the speeds are different in the past few years.

      <p>
       Is there really a good argument the shamers have other than the possibility of a tiered internet?  Do you see deregulations spurring innovation or the ISPs using it to consolidate control?

       Let's assume the worst case scenario. ISPs destroy the Internet in some way that has never happened in history. You should consider this scenario in the light of an FCC Chairman that has been pushing for nationwide multi-gig wireless since 2012 and it might take something like that to force the technology to cut the wire.

       The Internet was designed to survive a nuclear attack. It sure as hell can withstand lesser degrees of human stupidity and just keep routing around it.

       Are you losers so socially stunted that you can't understand the very simple concept of people copying memes? People feel like reddit is a community that they are a part of. They care deeply about NN. They see other people in the community post a popular meme about NN. They copy it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're hoping on a trend that the community feels is important.

       The control of whether or not the internet remains traffic neutral or is subject to corporate gatekeeping.

       I don't know what you're trying to pull, but you're talking to the wrong crowd. You're not going to convince anyone you're right, because you aren't. Anyone with one ounce of knowledge of how the internet works knows you are egregiously wrong-headed. You've fallen for the hype and propaganda and accuse others of doing that same. That's called projection. That's called being an idiot.
