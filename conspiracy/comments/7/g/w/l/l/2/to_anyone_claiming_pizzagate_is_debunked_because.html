        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Copying from a comment I made:</p>

<p>The basement is in Buck&#39;s Fishing and Camping, where he stores &quot;tonnes&quot; of pizza sauce. That&#39;s coming from Alefantis himself. The &quot;pedo ring in the basement&quot; angle was manipulated by media outlets to discredit and instantly &quot;debunk&quot; pizzagate.</p>

<p>Did you know Alefantis also has a diner in Berlin with a Pagan inspired menu?</p>

<p>Did you know he owns Pegasus Museum, which is closed to the public? What kind of museum is closed to the public?</p>

<p>Did you know James Alefantis was implicated in a blackmail lawsuit involving Media Matter&#39;s David Brock? </p>

<p>Did you know he attends dinners with Rothschilds?</p>

<p>Did you know one of the properties he owns used to be a Rothschild&#39;s?</p>

<p>Did you know Carole Greenwood, ex co-owner of CPP left due to &quot;urgent family issues&quot;, which was actually Alefantis abusing her 16-17 yr old son, who was an employee. Did you know he did an AMA on Reddit?</p>

<p>Did you know Alefantis threatened the life of Ryan O&#39;Neal for finding the location of the &quot;kill room&quot; in Pegasus?</p>

<p>Did you know James is close friends with someone who manufactures children sized coffins?</p>

<p>Did you know the street cameras were turned away from CPP a day before the shooting? Why is there no footage? Did you know the shooter also hit the computer tower? causing $10,000 worth of damage (according to the official report), allowing quick disposal of evidence.</p>

<p>Did you know Alefantis commented &quot;nice!&quot; On a painting of a naked infant statue with it&#39;s rear end in the air?</p>

<p>Did you know Alefantis also owns multiple properties not mentioned by him EVER? How does a self admitted college drop out who &quot;only knew how to cook pizzas&quot; accumulate so much wealth and property?</p>

<p>And this is just scratching the surface. NONE of this is mentioned by MSM. Why didn&#39;t Megyn Kelly ask about any of this.</p>

<p>So they shorten it to just &quot;pizza&quot;.</p>

<p>Also, couldn&#39;t cheese be a way to denote a certain age or ethnicity of the child? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could literally be anything within the realm of pedophilia. You could exchange &#39;pizza&#39; with &#39;pedo&#39; and it&#39;d work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Would love to get a pizza for an hour? Or come over&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>would translate into</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Would love to share a kid for an hour? Or come over&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Suggesting it might not happen in their homes by default, which would be smart in case feds or cops get a warrant for those places.</p>

<p>Then we have the email &#39;815 dinner at Marta&#39; <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55930">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55930</a> , wherein Tony asks John;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>29 st between park and Madison right around corner</p>

<p>Let me know</p>

<p>Or I could bring a pizza home</p>

<p>Tony</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know where Marta lives, but the Podesta&#39;s live in DC, right? Well, I&#39;m not from DC and this email chain by now is over a year old, but I couldn&#39;t find a 29th St near anything Madison (st, hotel, LLC, etc), only 1 was near a park, but not near anything Madison. The only Madison related locations I could find are nowhere near 29th, (Madison Hall on 22nd St, Madison &amp; CO LLC on the corner of I St and Connecticut Ave, Madison Place NW across Lafayette Square, Madison St runs from 1st to 16th St, The Madison Washington DC Hilton hotel on 15th). Suffice to say,</p>

<p>you&#39;d be lost with those directions. Someone on their side however, they might know what else to do with them.</p>

<p>The way John replies is eerie too,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m going to pass. I have too much to do before heading to Michigan tomorrow. No need for pizza.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He has <em>so much</em> to do, he can&#39;t even eat a slice of pizza before leaving for someplace <em>tomorrow</em>. Unless, y&#39;know, they&#39;re not talking about that kind of pizza. As a matter of fact, he has no <em>need</em> for pizza, and unless he had no other plans for dinner, he has no <em>need</em> for eating in general.</p>

<p>So, by my crazy conspiracy theorist logic, these mails would translate too:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here are coordinates for tonight</p>

<p>Let me know</p>

<p>Or I could bring a kid home</p>

<p>Tony</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To which John&#39;s reply would make a bit more sense, at least imho.</p>

<p>Then we have the handkerchief emails, which are just weird. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55433">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55433</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can a simple square, black and white handkerchief have a map that might &#39;seem pizza-related&#39;? </p>

<p>Mind you, all the realtor really said was </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a square cloth handkerchief (white w/ black) that was left on the kitchen island.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a pretty big jump to deduce from that line that it &#39;seems pizza-related&#39;, unless you know what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>Why isn&#39;t he worried about it? Perhaps he left it there on purpose. Perhaps, as with the &#39;directions&#39; earlier, it might be useless to randos without insider knowledge, or the map has expired, hence not being of concern to Podesta.</p>

<p>For me it translates into</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The realtor found a handkerchief, I think it might have co-ordinates/code related to pedophilia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of people are arguing over whether &#39;pizza&#39; means boy or girl, or whether that&#39;s supposed to be &#39;hotdog&#39; vs &#39;pasta&#39;, but I think that might be up to the smaller circles to decide. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a &#39;National American Dictionary for Pedophiles&#39;, or whatever. I think this angle is being treated a bit too autistically. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not exactly &#39;<em>cheese</em> pizza&#39; so it doesn&#39;t mean that at all!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, because talking in code with like-minded people requires you to speak out everything, you cannot drop a word whilst maintaining context lest all is lost. (/s)</p>

<p>What else was there... Right, Urban Dictionary listed &#39;pizza&#39; as a pedophilia related word in 2010, the emails came out in 2016, some going back to &#39;08, though not all seemingly related. It suggests it&#39;s been wiped prior. This is where some people tie in the Madeleine McCann case, but that&#39;s a whole other can of worms. I&#39;m not equipped to do more intensive searches, lest I want visitors.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the whole Alefantis angle, the R-rated musicians performing at his &#39;family friendly&#39; establishment, the creepy art in his house and on his insta depicting underage people or very sexual(ised) images related to pizza, or McCauley Caulkin&#39;s band The Pizza Underground and their imagery, we all know what allegedly happened to him.</p>

<p>When you put it all together, it&#39;s pretty messed up to say the least.</p>

<p>But this is just my p.o.v. of this particular part of the theory, even I think the whole &#39;Alefantis = J&#39;aime l&#39;enfants&#39; for example is far fetched.</p>

<p>No. If pizza means pedo, it would mean &quot;Would love to get a pedo for an hour? Or come over&quot;</p>

<p>How would that make any sense?</p>

<p>So you cannot actually say what the code meqns and you just make it up so you can twist the emailsminto something pedo-related.</p>

<p>You are literally just making this up to make it fit your bias. You can neither show that there is any code nor assign consistent meaning to the alledged code. You actually admit that it means whatever it needs to mean so you can reinterpret the emails in the way <em>you</em> see it fit. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a pizza related napkin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true. Are you familiar with Ryan O&#39;Neal at all though? He had a great acting career in the 70s, but blew it with his addictions and terrible temper. </p>

<p>One of my favorite films of his is &#39;Paper Moon&#39; which he starred in with his young (8 or 9 at the time)daughter Tatum. He was abusive with her, her mother(they later divorced and she had several other relationships with abusive men) and her brother and eventually hit on Tatum at his wife&#39;s(Farrah Faucett) funeral, claiming he didn&#39;t realize it was his daughter even though she&#39;d lived in his home off and on through her  childhood. Not to mention that she was also famous and the average person at the time would have recognized her, let alone her own father.</p>

<p>Give him some brief research and see if he seems like a credible source or someone grasping at a chance to get back in the spotlight and/or the public&#39;s good graces.</p>
