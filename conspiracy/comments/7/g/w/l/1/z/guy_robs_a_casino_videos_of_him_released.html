       Never posted here before. But, not sure where else I could post this. Just saw them release videos of the person who robbed the Bellagio. They have quite a bit of footage. But, there’s absolutely nothing of Stephen Paddock anywhere? I don’t fucking understand.

       Makes perfect sense the biggest mass shooting in the most heavily video camera'd cities in the world should be able to provide at least one fucking image of Paddock in the casino.  Not even one though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rob a casino?  Yup, videos and images of him entering and exiting the casino within 24 hrs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perform biggest mass shooting in us history?  Nah, no photos or videos of Paddock entering and leaving.  Don't need to see that.

       Not to mention, there’s video of him when he slipped and fell at the Cosmo readily available. Granted, he sued them, and they had to use it for defense or whatever. So, it was probably stashed somewhere in their records, but still. I don’t understand the apprehension of releasing video. People that were saying that it was because it’s an on-going criminal investigation...well, so is the Bellagio robbery, and video was released.

       I believe LVPD's Lombardo said something along the lines of "we don't want the victims to have to re-live the tragedy by having footage of the perp looping over and over through the media" during one of his press conferences.

       It assumes that the casino/authorities want to send us these videos. Its almost certain that they do have them and i speculate that the reason they havent been shared yet is due to ongoing investigations.

       This. Either

      <p>
       (a) they don't want to share them (because the corporation is afraid of more lawsuits due to negligence or something)

       What leads do you think they're "investigating", with the lone gunman dead two months already? How could releasing five seconds of Paddock alive in the casino within the relevant timeframe compromise those leads or further incriminate the casino of civil liability? These questions need plausible answers in your scenario. Not saying they don't have any, but I can't think of them.

       I mean, but what does it matter? I could understand them not releasing video if he blatantly walked in with all his firearms out in the open or something and they just missed it. But, bringing them in on different days and in small batches, no one would have been able to notice that. So, do you think the casino or the police are the ones hiding the video surveillance? The casino had to turn video over, I’m sure. But, why would the police not want to release it?

       Well the police really have no reason to release it as it wouldn't serve to further their "investigation" whatever that means at this point. I am not sure what legal recourse a casino would have against the LVMPD for releasing their security footage but I do know that the casinos are pumping money in the pockets of every major political figure in the area.

       The other thing is that police often don't release certain info while the investigation is ongoing because they don't want potential suspects / persons of interest / other to know how much they know or do not know. Classical information asymmetry.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is similar to the reason they never released 9/11 security camera footage from the Pentagon other than one crappy camera by the parking lot guard shack.  They REALLY do not want information out there about what kind of security cameras they use at the Pentagon and what they are capable of. Simply having that info out there means that some bad actor might be able to find a weakness and exploit it.

       No, I mean every word.  Let's dispense with the conspiracy theory around 9/11 just for a moment. (For the record, I don't believe the official line.  This is outside that argument and simply looking at the actual release of the camera footage.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If we just look at only what we're given, everyone freaks out that the 9/11 Pentagon footage that was released is so poor.  They say "It couldn't possibly be that bad." "They doctored it." "They are not releasing it because it shows evidence of a missile." "There is something they aren't telling us." Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignoring the missile part...  In this case I am making no statement about whether there actually was a missile or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Showing the world that you have HD cameras installed (before they were in wide use by the media) is release of information. Telling the world how many cameras you have is release of information. Telling them where they are is release of information. Telling them the frame rate of the cameras. Telling them whether they have night vision. Telling them how far apart they are spaced. Telling them if they are hidden or in plain sight, or both.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now your potential enemies (or spies) know something about your capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they know, for instance, that the cameras are 480i VHS-quality black and white cameras with 10 FPS and no night vision, they are spaced 200 yds apart, are completely unhidden, and have a view angle of 40 degrees, that is one data point.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they know that they are 4K remote pan/tilt/zoom cameras with 60FPS and night vision that are hidden every 50 feet, that is another data point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming they knew the former was true, they would know they could walk in in broad daylight and the video security would be very easy to beat. Lax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming they knew the latter was true, they would plan accordingly and know their target better. They'd take time. They'd practice. They'd carefully find and exploit weaknesses.  (In this case, I'm probably more referring to Russian spies or some other bad actor infiltrating than Al Queda crashing a plane into the Pentagon.)
      </p>
      <p>
       As you can see, allowing any information at all about your security out into the wild exposes you to more risk. It's better if your enemies don't know anything at all about your capabilities.

      <p>
       Information asymmetry.  If you look for it, it's out there and being used by very smart people.

       They only released a very limited amount of columbine video. I personally have always been super curious to see the full "Basement Tapes" , but the sheriffs office never released them, and supposedly destroyed every known copy of it. They basically said it was toxic, and they didn't want to inspire copycats.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we take that same logic with Vegas, someone visually sees how easy it was for him to move his shit through the casino, it could simply inspire them.
      </p>

       Personally do I want to see it? Yes. Do I understand why they don't release it? Yes.

       I can only assume these conspiracy nuts just using any excuse to have death caught on camera for their own masturbatory purposes, or else claim "cover up!" when police sensibly decide not to release footage that could cause more pain for the survivors/families of the dead.

       Like I said, ‘I don’t know where else to post this’. It doesn’t fit into any other sub I’m subscribed to. I don’t believe it was a false flag. I don’t believe it was staged. I don’t believe there were actors or that it was MKUltra or any of that shit. All I’m trying to say is that the whole situation and how it’s been handled has been really fucking weird.

       Your suggestion is only one possibility. The presence of actors other than or in addition to Stephen Paddock is another.

       I think the late author Dave McGowan made the most compelling argument in his essay about
       <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/gowan1.html">
        the massacre at Columbine High School
       </a>
       - the overarching motive is psychosocial:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The true goal is to further traumatize and brutalize the American people. This has in fact been a primary goal of the state for quite some time, dating back at least to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on that fateful day in Dallas on November 22, 1963.
       </p>
       <p>
        The strategy is now (as it was then) to inflict blunt force trauma on all of American society, and by doing so to destroy any remaining sense of community and instill in the people deep feelings of fear and distrust, of hopelessness and despair, of isolation and powerlessness. And the results have been, it should be stated, rather spectacular.
       </p>
       <p>
        With each school shooting, and each act of 'domestic terrorism,' the social fabric of the country is ripped further asunder. The social contracts that bound us together as a people with common goals, common dreams, and common aspirations have been shattered. We have been reduced to a nation of frightened and disempowered individuals, each existing in our own little sphere of isolation and fear.
       </p>
       <p>
        And at the same time, we have been desensitized to ever rising levels of violence in society. This is true of both interpersonal violence as well as violence by the state, in the form of judicial executions, spiraling levels of police violence, and the increased militarization of foreign policy and of America's borders.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have become, in the words of the late George Orwell, a society in which "the prevailing mental condition [is] controlled insanity." And under these conditions, it becomes increasingly difficult for the American people to fight back against the supreme injustice of 21st century Western society. Which is, of course, precisely the point.
       </p>
       <p>
        For a fractured and disillusioned people, unable to find common cause, do not represent a threat to the rapidly encroaching system of global fascism. And a population blinded by fear will ultimately turn to 'Big Brother' to protect them from nonexistent and/or wholly manufactured threats.
       </p>
       <p>
        As General McArthur stated back in 1957: "Our government has kept us in a perpetual state of fear ... with the cry of grave national emergency. Always there has been some terrible evil at home or some monstrous foreign power that was going to gobble us up if we did not blindly rally behind it...."

       Another motivation is expanding the powers of the psychiatric system (and thus the profits of its pharmaceutical suppliers).
      </p>
      <p>
       The companies providing security systems and services also do very well, as do the defense contractors providing military issue weapons and equipment to police departments across the U.S. who see their budgets increase. The news outlets enjoy a boost in ratings.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this applies to 'serial killings' and high-profile murders as much as it does to spree killings.

       No casino would ever want to be associated with a mass shooting, but most wouldn't hesitate to be associated with the capture of thieves. If you put out a video of a thief being caught, it's not very likely another will come by any time soon. If you put out a video of a mass murderer camping out your halls, it's not very likely you'll have more customers any time soon.

       Why is everyone insinuating something so sinister? Geezus fucking Christ. The whole situation is just fucking odd. From the fact that the best pictures we have of Paddock are years ago, one where he looks stoned out of his mind and the other where his eyes are closed. There are no better pictures of him during his life? And then I at least expected a still or two showing him in the hotel, maybe him entering with large bags or something. Fucking Christ. Not everyone is a goddamn weirdo.

       Mass killers aren't posted everywhere because it glorifies them to other potential murderers who want the attention.
      </p>

       The guy was old. Did he even have a social media account? Maybe all his pictures are physical like most old people's picture collections.

      <p>
       Showing him with large bags or getting the valet to just carry them up on a cart would only show how easy it is to actually do something like that which gives copycats ideas.

       he gave one TV interview then vanished off the face of the earth same as 'Campos' did.

       Can't smoke. Got a job. Still. You know what I'm saying and getting a video of a dude walking to an elevator is hilariously retarded. They would attack the valet and you know it. Most people don't even believe it was paddock and instead an Arab or Mexican.

       Look at the LAX hoax. and if you can stomach the beyond obvious hoax  Sandy Hook.       so much security and no fucking footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is beyond a safe bet to call bullshit.   As if they had the footage of a real crime they shove it down your throat. but  they even the footage they release of these so called mass shootings are scrutinize. and only real footage is accepted.  and the fucking hate that facts rule and bullshit fades away.  if it is real it is shoved down your throats and if it is fake they want you to accept the facts without seeing anything.  even when the live footage says it is all bullshit.

       The gun fire timeline is strange to say the least. If nobody had the mainstream media in their heads and just listened to the video, you would say there were two shooters. Did Paddock go Rambo with an automatic weapon under each arm? My theory is, they killed many to get one. Of course the non-conspirator part of me always asks....How many would have to be in on it?

       Personally I’d like to know why ISIS claimed responsibility and then the FBI (I think it was them), quickly disagreed. It makes me wonder how the FBI claims to know very little about this ‘lone wolf’ but instantly knows he’s not Muslim. It also makes me wonder if whoever  is doing the ISIS PR automatically claims responsibility for any event since the FBI rebuttal suggests ISIS didn’t have any evidence to back up their claim and got it wrong. I’m also curious why ISIS just shut up and went away after the FBI statement rather than pushing back. Looks dodgy to me.

       They have something to gain by releasing the video. They hope he’s caught and doesn’t do it again. This instils confidence that others won’t try the same attack. 
Maybe even get their money back too, although I doubt they care about a little cash.
