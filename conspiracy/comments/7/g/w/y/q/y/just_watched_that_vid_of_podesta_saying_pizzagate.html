       I explained this months ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       The email chain is from a real estate agent to the Podestas who had just been viewing properties with her. She, like any normal person, asked if they wanted the handkerchief returned. John replies that no, he doesn't want it back.

       OP asked for a debunking and you commented "Don't hold your breath". You're really gonna act like the lack of debunking is suspicious and then also declare it suspicious when you do receive one?

       I'll agree with you there. These PG threads are fun to read, but I usually don't participate because the discussions always play out in the same unproductive manner.

       He never has been asked about the code words in his emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, for the shills who like to hack away at the "code word" argument and say there is no proof, the Arizona Human Trafficking awareness site has examples of chat room screenshots where pedophiles are using pizza and cheese pizza as code language for pedophilia and kiddy porn.

       Yes, "Cheese pizza" is widely recognised as sometimes being used as code for child pornography.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you highlight where podesta uses "Cheese pizza" as a code word for child pornography?

       Pretty much.

      <p>
       People keep asking why Podesta won't explain the handkerchief, but I have yet to see any video footage or any audio recording where he is specifically asked about the handkerchief.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, he hasn't been given an opportunity to address the handkerchief, and he probably doesn't even know that the handkerchief thing is part of the conspiracy theory because he dismissed it as complete bullshit from the start because
       <em>
        he knows the whole thing is bullshit

       But honestly that email is not the most damning. The weirdest one said something like "is it better to play dominos on cheese or pasta?" Like, definitely codewords there.

       I think there is explanation for both. I see both damning. But if we had to go to court I would choose the handkerchief because there is possible physical evidence and better breadcrumbs to a location and possible event.

       The e-mails were just the catalyst. They got people digging and we found a lot more damning info, from creepy Instragram accounts to pedo-friendly business alliances. The e-mails could be completely fake at this point and it wouldn't matter. Nothing rests upon them.

       It's a (boring) inside joke.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Herb Sandler, who is Podesta's benefactor as well as his friend, rented a house on Martha's Vineyard in August 2014. Sandler is a widower, but he was joined there by his adult daughter, Susan, and possibly other family. John Podesta and his wife joined them for almost a week.
While Podesta was there, he taught them how to play dominoes. 
• 2014-09-01 Susan Sandler: "I so enjoyed having a chance to spend time and relax with you and Mary. Thanks for teaching me the domino game-I'm going to get a set!"
The following year, the Sandlers were back on Martha's Vineyard and were playing dominoes again. Herb Sandler jokes about Podesta changing the rules (Herb is over 80 years old).
• 2015-07-10 Herb Sandler: "Everything has been fine, except that we missed you and Mary. ... Today-dominos. We won't be calling you for the rules."
• 2015-07-11 Herb Sandler: "Last day in MV. Missed you. Susan whipped Sherry and me at Dominos. Using the Podesta method, she made up the rules as we played."
So, in December 2015, John Podesta sends Herb Sandler a Christmas present.
John Podesta had been in the practice of sending pasta and/or sauce as Christmas presents. We know from the thank you email from Herb Sandler the previous year: "I just received the holiday package of pasta and sauce. If only I could make it turn out as special as you guys do." And from an email from Jennifer P. where she sends regrets about not being able to get back to DC in time to attend a dinner party at Podesta's house because she got caught in weather and traffic and she says: "Suffice to say we will not make it tonight, I am sad to say. Have to settle for the pasta john gave us at Christmas. Really sorry to miss."
But this year Podesta sent a box of cheeses, instead—perhaps he's too busy getting ready for the primaries in January to make presents himself.
Herb Sandler writes a humorous thank you note in an email.. It's occurred to me that millenials may understand it better if I add in a few "lol"s.
Mary and John
I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been long in place lol. I immediately realized something was different by the shape of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the square shaped box lol. Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, Yummy. I am awaiting the return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that we can demolish them.
Thank you so much. I hope you and your gang are well.
I miss you both
Best wishes fro a merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
Herb
Ps. Do you think I'll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta lol?
So, there's the truth. It's a thank you note for a box of cheeses written by an 83 year old man.
Here's the code needed to decode it:
cheese = cheese
pasta = pasta
dominos = dominoes

        I just came from checking the Field house and I have a square cloth handkerchief (white w/ black) that was left on the kitchen island. Happy to send it via the mail if you let me know where I should send it.

       Saying Pizzagate has been
       <em>
        debunked
       </em>
       is false. The truth is that there
       <em>
        isn't anything to debunk
       </em>
       because you can't prove a negative.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's kind of like saying the existence of Santa Claus has been debunked. Well, you can't prove that Santa Claus doesn't exist, so his existence can't be debunked. Not to mention the fact that every year children wake up to toys from "Santa" under their trees. You can claim it was the parents all you want, but there isn't any way to prove that
       <em>
        every single gift
       </em>
       with "From Santa" on it was put there by someone who isn't Santa.
