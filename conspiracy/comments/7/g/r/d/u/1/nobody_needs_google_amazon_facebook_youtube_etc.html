    <div class="md"><p>Google enabled info to be at your fingertips within seconds. Answers to any questions, anything, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s so powerful. It opened the world up. But the data it collects is so gigantic, it is scary. It&#39;s changed the very fabric of human nature. When I was in school for engineering, we always joked that our degree was in Google, not engineering. It&#39;s a very,  very powerful tool, but something that has become immensely powerful. That&#39;s the danger. </p>

<p>If you absolutely can&#39;t find time to get groceries (you are on reddit...), can you not find an alternative service to Amazon? Here in my town there are several local choices for grocery delivery.</p>

<p>And if not, would you be willing to pay a friend or someone who needs it a small amount to regularly get your groceries for you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the biggest fallacy on the internet. You cannot escape Google. Fucking point-of-sales systems in the store use Google Analytics (among others). You literally cannot avoid them. They are tracking you, regardless of if you volunteer for what they offer or not. </p>

<p>Hell, I used to work for a company who did video recognition software for big box stores. We would track who was in what isle, what they bought, what they picked up, etc. All this information was sent through a host of Google and Amazon services. We could even it link it to your Facebook, if you&#39;ve provided it to any of these guys. </p>

<p>Once again, the idea that you can escape Google (Alphabet) is one of the biggest fallacies on the internet. </p>

<p>Google has you if you do anything else, both online and off. Hell, you can&#39;t buy something at the gas station without that information going through Google at some point. </p>

<p>This is why the Google problem is so hard to solve. Government regulation wouldn&#39;t be the answer, but you also can&#39;t take your money elsewhere because <em>you</em> are the money.

<p>What I&#39;m saying is, if your goal is to avoid Google, opting out of some services doesn&#39;t matter. Sure, they may not track you from the service you opted out of but they&#39;ll still track on the ones you haven&#39;t. Once again, that includes buying shit (like your food) in a physical store. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t opt out of Google. You can opt out of shopping on etsy.com, for sure.. but not Google. That&#39;s because <em>you</em> don&#39;t opt <em>into</em> Google, companies do.

    <div class="md"><p>Amazon has owed me .60 cents for about 4 years due to unpaid mechanicalTurk labor. They want to indoctrinate me with their AI and microwave me veggies and fruits before they break into my house and deliver them.</p>

<p>Google is actively working with NASA, D-Wave and the CIA to produce anti matter are they really against everything? Matter lives matter, and nobody wants to upload their consciousness into a demonic inter dimensional cloud and mingle with ancient spirits that have been doing hard time in hell because of us. No thanks </p>

<p>In addition to contributing to the beast system, Google is also known for hosting the largest collection of child pornography ever assembled. </p>

<p>Google use to be known as a search engine, but soon realized how dangerous the free and open flow of information was to the profane masses. Now google uses a from of technological white magic to protect users from racist, sexist, homophobic and xenophobic wrongthink that hatefully tries to compete with soothing natural narratives. </p>

<p>Facebook is the sad story of a young man who had so much pride and confidence in his creation that he truly believed it would make him a God. ZuckerBorg went online replacing his consciousness with Facebook AI interface and immediately forgot what it was like to be human. He is now in a dark place and despite valiant efforts to regain human consciousness; he grows worse daily. He wants you to send him your nudes to protect you from people having your nudes. Soon ZuckerBorg will experience acute symptoms such as being a bottom rung pawn of a multi level marketing pyramid scheme. He will have large and existential meltdowns and sadistic quarreling matches for all his worried friends and family to see. </p>

<p>Twitter is left out of OP and for good reason. We DO need Twitter. The twittersphere gives neural nourishment to the open minded progressive thinker that doesn’t have time to wade through fascist opinions of racist wrongthinkers. </p>

<p>Twitter should be recognized for their excellent role in keeping white people in check, and trying to educate them about their privilege, attitudes, &amp; social roles in a tolerant liberal society. Twitter is helping white people manage their unbearable load of white guilt and inspiring white activists to violently speak out against themselves and other dangerous white people.</p>

<p>Twitter has also contributed in freeing millions all across the Middle East. Twitter was a key element in the Arab Spring. It allowed freedom fighters to coordinate attacks and served as a valuable recruiting tool to find mercenaries willing to replace oppressive regimes for the safety and freedom of anarchy. Libya was suffocating under progressive socialism that coddled people and made them lazy. Twitter helped Libya to adopt capitalism and today her markets are more free than her mentors. Human trafficking and slavery are two of the biggest and fastest growing segments out there and Twitter opened up Libya to this economic goldmine and allowed Libyans to actually make some money instead of sucking on the governments oily teet and farming goats. </p>

<p>I &quot;deleted&quot; my Gmail account and now use my own e-mail via protonmail.</p>

<p>I deleted my Amazon account.</p>

<p>Instead of Youtube I use vimeo or even better dtube (decentralized video service).</p>

<p>I still use reddit, but as steemit.com, yours.org akasha.world and others progress I will leave reddit as well.</p>

<p>Stop using centralized services and help create the decentralized web. It&#39;s our duty to make it happen or shut up and stop complaining.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i cant help but love joogle. for me, its extremely useful. for instance, internet explorer is really slow and clunky, but chrome is really quick. i have gdrive which stores stuff i dont want to lose, and YT to fight in the comment sections on videos. google translate and currency conversion has been so useful to me aswell. i dont know what i would do without using it tbh. it would be like going back to using windows 98. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would be in more agreement with you if other institutions for knowledge were not left to decay and collapse. </p>

<p>The public library system is in diarray. Most books and backups are now online. While I myself know the dew decimal system and can look up the books once I find out from the librarian what the code is, the librarians now just prompt people to sit in front of a computer and learn how to look it up on line. I literally went to a library for a book on &#39;X&#39; only for them to sit me in front of a computer, connect me to the internet and show me how to look up &#39;X&#39; on the computer they weren&#39;t able to give me a book catalogue code or show me if there was any works related to it on a shelf. They didn&#39;t even encourage me to look at a book there. Not.At.All. Bookstores can&#39;t survive anymore and the largest library in my area (and one of the most renown in the world) was recently shut down and reopened as an internet cafe with a less extensive book catalogue. </p>

<p>While I&#39;m here stockpiling whatever books I can hard and digital on anything and everything, what about those without the means to do so? </p>

<p>We let this modern infrastructure host all out knowledge while firemen secretly burned our real books and info. If NN is repealed (or you know, shit hits the fan and we just loose everything electric), what will be there for the next generation?</p>

<p>If we don&#39;t have NN, social media asside, books and scholarly journals intellectuals and students relied on are now going to be catalogued behind a potential paywall, whereas the the institution that was able to provide it to us for free is almost non-existent. </p>

<p>There was a time were we didn&#39;t NEED it, but honestly, without it, we&#39;re NOT reverting to EXACTLY what we had before. How do you expect to use a library where even the librarian can&#39;t help you find the book you need or it just isn&#39;t even in house.   </p>
