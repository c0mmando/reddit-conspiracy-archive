<p>All three of these countries have central banks, they all sell bonds, they all engage in international trading, even north korea, I live in northern china where there is a huge NK community, they have currency in NK and housing market, they have loans and houses and cars.  They buy iPhones from china and they have union pay credit cards- these are things you need money for.</p>

<p>Regardless of how extreme north korea is, iran has a huge central bank, they are becoming a giant economy- why is this a prevalent myth?</p>

<p>the websites for them are right on their wiki pages, you can look at them yourselves</p>

<p>edit- first people told me how they don&#39;t have central banks, then they said they don&#39;t count because they are government backed, then they said its because they are not rothschild owned, then it became rothschild &quot;controlled&quot;- i am asking this then- Why do the rothchilds get to control china but NOT NK? Why do they control Russia but NOT Iran and Syria?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get it- why do they control all the trading partners of these countries that DO have central banks, that are not purely government backed, but these three countries are magic and only they are not controlled? Why?</p>

<p>second edit- top comment says it is about rothschild control- will not answer about how/why the rothchilds control russia and china but can&#39;t/won&#39;t control iran, syria and nk?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it says right in your article syria has a public/private central bank</p>

<p>also why isn&#39;t china on the list?</p>

<p>I think the list is silly because its leaving china off on purpose because it knows no one is going to war with them so it ruins the conspiracy and that this is just an a- hey we need to come up with something to explain how every country has a central bank issue</p>

<p>because every country does have a central bank</p>

<p>also, irans central bank is hardly a socialist or communist institution, its a sharia law backed government institution, its not reinvesting that money into social programs- its a little disingenuous</p>

<p>also, i looked at the websites for the chinese central bank and they have only chinese nationals on their board, how can a rothschild own the state owned bank of china? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Becasue people FEEL like theyre getting fucked, and so ASSUME there must be a conspiracy that&#39;s hidden away, and since finance and economics and how banks work or what a bank is are all too complicated to actually understand, that makes a good place to mentally place a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Yes you ARE getting fucked. It isn&#39;t a secret conspiracy. It is blatantly out in the open, and it has nothing to do with central banks. You&#39;re getting fucked because today there&#39;s more concentration of wealth in the hands of the few than ever, ever before. That&#39;s a result of the tax code and other very blatantly obvious economic policies that is the subject of lots and lots of analysis and dispuyte and argument. No conpiracy. Just ugly complicated technically complex reality. Deal with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, thats how i feel, i think people just don&#39;t want to accept that they either have made bad choices in their life or are just trapped in shitty situations so they want to remove their own agency from the situation.</p>

<p>Like I lost a whole decade of my career to the recession and it hurt, but i never thought it was because of the rothchilds, the most conspiracy i got on it was the media not calling out obama for not handling the recession right. </p>

<p>eventually i accepted things in america would never improve and i left, i got a job working as an auditor for an american accreditation agency in china auditing schools- its a hard and miserable job in a lot of ways, but it pays good and thats life, but its better then the past 10 years of suck i dealt with</p>

<p>I think a lot of people on this sub are just in the middle of their own misery and don&#39;t want to deal with how they have to look in the mirror like i did and just deal with it themselves and just keep waiting for some revolution that is not coming</p>

    <div class="md"><p>a little melodramatic </p>

<p>income inequality is actually at a world wide low currently, its ticking up in western economies because of fairly bad economic policy over the past few years</p>

<p>i am not a huge fan of the chinese government but no one can deny that the poverty rate is greatly reduced in china currently, as it is in india and brazil and most of the emerging economies</p>

<p>the problem is really no one in america has any real plan- or even commitment to a bad plan- like i would respect the gop more if they just committed to say &quot; hey we are getting rid of the fucking safety net because we really think it will fix everything&quot; or if the democrats committed to a real expansion of welfare- but the fact is neither side has really any agenda, which is why everyone in america is pissed</p>

<p>i am not happy about the recession that cost me a decade, but i am not signing up for redistribution, no thanks, i just wanted a job, america is a failed state and i left- it needs to fix its own economic policy- eventually it will either self correct or people like me will continue to leave and the quality of life will go down till it becomes a non-factor as an economic power (i am pretty sure its the second, there is no correction coming, just a slow decline to irrelevance on the global scale for the average worker in america)</p>

<p>I hate to break it to people, but, Royalty never stopped ruling, they just found ways to hide better in the shadows (international corporations), giving the illusion of personal freedom and wealth. <em>The best slaves are the one&#39;s who think they are free.</em> </p>

<p>like literally you think the pope runs chinas foreign and economic policy- how is that possible? china is the number one foreign lender on earth and the largest economy on earth and they have virtually no catholics- their largest catholic community is in Macau, their Las vagas</p>

<p>It just does not seem likely that president xi would really take calls from the pope particularly seriously, or even particularly understand the concept of a divine royalty ruling the earth, exalting even the chinese royalty is a crime in china</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats what i said to one of the people in the thread, but the are now claiming its &quot;rothschild controlled&quot;</p>

<p>My question if its rothschild owned or controlled or w/e- is if china and russia are owned and controlled why not Iran, Syria and NK? they are client states of those countries? why are they firewall? that does not make sense</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the opium wars where pre-great leap, they are not relevant to today</p>

<p>Also, hong kong has been rendered powerless, they are literally DAILY riots in hong kong about how they have lost their rights since reunification- maybe back in 1999 their might have been a thought that HK was going to have major influence on the mainland but that was before the economic boom- now its very much the reveres, HK is just another political zone like macau.</p>

<p>as to the actual rothchilds website, they are actual bankers, and china is the largest lender on earth, they should have an opinion on it.</p>

<p>also, I have a very good history of the opium wars and china, and just say, well the rothchilds did it, is ridiculously reductive of the complex situation that was going on at the time- you should read more diverse sources</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why I said idk if they pull strings now. You are right I don&#39;t everything about the opium wars but I know enough to understand why and what happened. Also if the Roth child&#39;s are still in China now they forsure have an influence in China they may not run the show but they have influence. also on Hong Kong they used it as base of operations no? With Internet there&#39;s no need for it. I just mentioned cause it was important for them. The rothchilds have a finger in everyone&#39;s pie they made sure of that that&#39;s why they are who they are just because China&#39;s all powerful doesn&#39;t mean there immune to one of the most powerful and influential families in history you say your self how currupt China has become why is so hard to believe that the banks system is influenced by the most successful bankers in history </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the rothchilds did not use HK as their base, it was used by the East India Company first as well as the british government, but to say it was just ran by the rothchilds is insane, they where not even ever present in HK at that period. I am sure that Rothchilds Du Banc has dealings in china, they are a huge bank and china is a huge lender, but I doubt they are any more import then Sheldon Aidelson who is the largest single non-chines investor in china- he owns casinos in Macau.</p>

<p>Also, china has BECOME corrupt- it always was corrupt! thats the problem. it was corrupt before the great leap and then it got MORE corrupt! its never not been corrupt! Thats why people thought communism might be a good idea- and now that there is lots of money in china the people are even less interested in real reform because this the golden age for your average chinese person </p>

<p>If you talk to one who is over 40 he will tell you how broke they where in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s, if you talk to one over 70 he will tell you about how they fucking ATE PEOPLE because they had no god damn food!</p>

<p>now they all have iPhones and electric cars, not a lot of SJW types demanding reform because of that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are asking good, logical questions. What passes for conventional wisdom in conspiracy circles is almost always misdirection. When you cut through this one you realize two things: </p>

<li><p>Those three countries are indeed controlled.</p></li>
<li><p>Controlling or &quot;owning&quot; a country&#39;s central bank is hardly a necessary precondition for taking control over a country. It helps, but it&#39;s not a requirement.</p></li>
