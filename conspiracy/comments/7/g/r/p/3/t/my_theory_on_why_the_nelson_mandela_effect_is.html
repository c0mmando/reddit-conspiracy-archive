        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So this may sound dumb, and you&#39;ll have to be a believer of crazy things, but hear me out. So the Nelson Mandela effect, if you don&#39;t already know, is when a group of people remember a thing or event happening a certain way, when in reality it never happened. Starting when Nelson Mandela died, and many people clearly remembered him dying years before in prison. I always thought this was an interesting topic, especially when I started to research different ideas on the topic and found out I remember a lot of things happening that supposedly never did. For me, starting with the fact that the BerenSTEIN bears, has actually been the BerenSTAIN bears all along. Something else being Oscar Meyer, is actually Oscar Mayer and always has been.  I&#39;ve known about this for quite awhile, but the other day upon hearing another one, I started to question this and came up with a theory. The one I heard, is that the all so famous line from star wars, &quot;Luke, I am your father.&quot; well, what if I told you, that this entire time, he NEVER said luke. The line was actually &quot;No, I am your father.&quot; this one blew my mind because I actually vividly remember seeing this movie in theatres as a child with my father and remember him saying luke. And that&#39;s when I started to wonder about this whole thing. Why is there so many things that I remember that are completely different from what I think happened, and so many other people share those EXACT same memories, yet they never occured? 
Well if you&#39;ve ever watched the tv show The Flash, and/or you believe in time travel, you might be interested to hear my theory. I believe that this may be happening because a time traveler(s) decided to go back in the past to change an event that they suffered from, like a loved one dying for example, and therefore changed the current timeline. In the show, Barry (the flash) runs back in time using his superspeed, stops the flash 2 from killing his mom, and lives a normal life with his parents. He decided to come back to the present, where he finds that although everything SEEMS the same, very little, but important, details about everyone&#39;s life is completely different. Like iris and Joe&#39;s once close bond, was now them not being able to stand each other. Digels son, was now a daughter. Barry&#39;s bestfriend, now hated him because of something Barry doesn&#39;t remember doing. This is a thing called flashpoint. By changing the past, he created an alternate timeline, and now everyone else is effected because of it? It seems crazy but i do believe in time travel. Of course even if it was possible they would never release that kind of information to the public as that could be very dangerous. What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes paragraphs.<br/>
However, if you are 12 years old, your writing is not bad. 
If you are older than 12 read a book about cognitive psychology. 
There you will learn about concepts like chunking and categorization. 
Human memory relies on shortcuts so it makes mistakes every once in a while.  This is why witness testimony in court can often be very unreliable. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re into divergent universes you should check out Anathem by Neal Stephenson. It&#39;s fiction but based in a lot of theory. I&#39;ve read it twice. Mindblowing journey.</p>

<p>Nope, Stain doesn&#39;t even make sense for a German-Jew name. Berenstein, pronounced BerenSTEEN. Like I said, I really don&#39;t care what people think. People used to tell me that voting actually matters, lmao... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yes the Mandela Effect. It&#39;s one of the primary TAVISTOCK disinfo pieces at the moment, right alongside flat earth. It&#39;s to keep people from thinking their reality is real, so that they don&#39;t question any real corruption people are doing on earth but instead are confused by mind games. </p>

<p>Most of the comments thinking it&#39;s real are probably plants, with a few useful idiots and true believers thrown in. TAVISTOCK works by creating the appearance of consensus about nonsense issues, thus making you think everyone has gone crazy and thus people cannot be trusted, and thus cannot unify and overthrow the people at the top. It&#39;s poisoning the well of conversation so no one can talk about anything that matters, it just gets lost in the noise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mandela effect doesn&#39;t make sense as fallible memories only because they are failing in a fashion that is clearly not random, the false memories are too consistent and many times the memory is logically consistent in a way the actual reality isn&#39;t. For example the Star Wars quote said by Darth Vader was more dramatic and made more sense cinematically, there was a dramatic pause and classic loud breath between the &quot;Luke&quot; and the &quot;I am your father&quot; that played totally different in the scene as it is now. Sex in the city makes more sense as the women are having sex in the city in the show, sex and the city has a completely different feel and makes less sense as the show is not about sex and the city in a separate or independent fashion, maybe &quot;Women, Sex, and the City&quot; but not Sex AND the city. We are the champions has the epic ending which obviously adds to its fame, without the epic &quot;of the world!&quot; Its not the same grand feeling when you finish hearing it. Shaggy&#39;s Adam&#39;s apple with the hairs sticking out of it was iconic and reflected his unkept stoner character and it moved up and down during the big gulps him and scooby would take. Berenstein vs Berenstain I think was discussed elsewhere in this thread and makes more sense ending in -stein. the forest gump
quote makes more sense in the present tense that the past tense as his mother would have spoken in the present in the direct quote, she wouldn&#39;t say life used to be like a box of chocolates or else it wouldn&#39;t be relevant she would say it is like a box of chocolates now. At this point the ME is an undeniable phenomenon, the question remains of why and how and when did it start. </p>
