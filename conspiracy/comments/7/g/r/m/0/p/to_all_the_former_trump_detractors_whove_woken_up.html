<p>Their conspiracies to brainwash us, and turn us into lifelong believers were the very poison we had thought we were fighting against.</p>

<p>Bigoted is just not being able to entertain the idea that another&#39;s viewpoint may be correct.  Of course, you will never admit your own bigotry when it comes to this discussion.  You will never admit that the people who think Islam is a scourge that should be cleansed from the Earth <em>might be right</em>.  So even you changing the terminology to bigotry is completely hypocritical and disingenuous.</p>

<p>How about you try to form an opinion that isn&#39;t just a series of poorly thought out propaganda and buzz words?  Or is that racist, fascist, anti-semitic , bigoted  and trans-phobic to ask of you?</p>

<p>Oh noes, you busted me, I’m bigoted against bigots. I don’t think that the people who think Islam is a scourge might be right, and I <em>genuinely</em> never will. You can save it. I know a ton of moderate Muslims, and they’re great Americans. In fact, I just had Thanksgiving dinner with a very cool Palestinian family.  It was great. So again, just save it. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Islamophobes are bigots. I’m not sure what you want me to tell you, but me saying that is neither hypocritical or disingenuous. I’m actually not even sure you know what disingenuous <em>means,</em> because this context doesn’t make sense. </p>

<p>You are almost smarmy enough to write for Buzz Feed.  Keep at it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Literally the definition of bigotry.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Never once did I claim to hold that opinion.  It was just a convenient tool that I <em>knew</em> would force you to undeniably reveal your bigotry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Islamophobes are bigots.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As are racismphobes.  Bigotry is not something that can be assigned along partisan lines.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>disingenuous means</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;not candid or sincere, typically by pretending that one knows less about something than one really does.&quot;</p>

<p>I think you <em>know</em> that you are attempting to spread an ideology that falls flat in the face of logic.  You aren&#39;t wrong by accident.  You want to convince us to be wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Islamophobes are bigots.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps.  But bigotry exists on a scale.  Refusing to agree that gays are deserving of the death sentence and that women should be stoned for adultery is <em>less bad</em> than believing those things <em>aren&#39;t true</em>.</p>

<p>So call me a bigot, and I will show you how my bigotry is humanism while yours is a disregard for the lives of your brethren.</p>

<p>And I don’t care that I’m bigoted against bigots! I’m not even taking a moral high ground or some shit. Quit projecting that on me. I literally don’t care if you think I’m a bigot for “being bigoted against bigots.” I could care less. Again, <em>this isn’t a gotcha.</em> </p>

<p>What the fuck is a “racismphobe?” Did you just make up a word saying “someone who’s afraid of racists?” Lol</p>

<p>Your bigotry isn’t humanism, your bigotry is fear. You’re scared of Muslims, we get it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The comments are easily found by you.  Why don&#39;t you read them (again) and try and fail (again) to refute any of the points?  Oh that&#39;s right, you can&#39;t offer any refutation because you are too big a bigot to entertain any of the ideas long enough to think through anything worth saying, besides a litany of smug sounding holier than thou buzz words.  I mean, if you honestly can&#39;t understand how typical your self righteous ad hominem attacks and Buzz Feed-esque appeals to authority sound to people looking for discussion sound, I can&#39;t help you.</p>

<p>Let me be honest though.  I don&#39;t think you are capable of forming any salient opinions because you are terrified of losing your place in the progressive hierarchy.  You know that as soon as you attempt for even an instant to think for yourself you will lose your place as an &quot;ally&quot; in the progressive stack and be shunned by your community.  All you are therefore willing to allow yourself is a hollow rehashing of propaganda and identity politics, founded on and backed by nothing more than hysterical fear that is being used to co-opt your vote and your voice.</p>

<p>It&#39;s transparent enough to be painful to watch.  I am sorry you have come to this, but let&#39;s be honest, you never had much to contribute in the way of thought to begin with.  You are just a useful idiot at this point.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, no salient points, all feels, and back to the ad hominems. lol! You’re all buzzwords and no original thoughts - can you really read what you wrote and not see the massive irony in you trying to put that shit on me? It’s projection at its finest. </p>

<p>I admitted to using the word racism wrong, I had another argument with another guy about it and bowed out - I already told you that, and it’s why I didn’t feel like arguing with you about it because I’d already gone over it. You felt the need to inject your talking points into a conversation that had already happened and that you didn’t need to have, because you’re feeling extra smarty smart and wanted to get dem libruls in some sort of poorly thought out and barely argued conundrum. </p>

<p>I didn’t use bigot wrong, and that was never your point - your point was that I’M the real bigot for being bigoted against bigots. Which is a talking point from the right! I’m really starting to think you’re just a semi aware chat bot. </p>

<p>That thing you quoted? That’s STILL not a point, it’s an ad hominem attack and a straw man. </p>

<p>I don’t have Twitter, I don’t read buzzfeed. You’re honestly projecting, and it’s getting fuckin weird. Go outside and get some fresh air, dude. </p>

<p>What about if we despise his foreign policy? Ya know, like ramping up tensions in NK, adding more fuel to the ME fire in Syria and Iran?

<p>I agree.</p>

<p>Does public education qualify as “education” though? That’s the underlying and unstated assumption.</p>

<p>Are the products of the public education system capable of critical thinking?  Do they understand <em>how to learn</em> and and <em>how to adapt</em>?</p>

<p>Or are public education alumni usually more like production line drones perfect for a life of mundane employment, paying taxes and posing no threat to the incumbent powers?</p>

<p>We all know the answer. Perhaps Trump’s goal is to crush common core education and replace it with something better, something that actually enables students to reach their true potential.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the current PS system creates mere cogs in the machine. It isn&#39;t designed to engender critical thinking or people who question authority. But gutting PS in exchange for pay to play private charters isn&#39;t the way to go. It will just guarantee that the rich get a better education, which they already do by paying for private schooling for their kids.</p>

<p>Instead, we need to work with the framework of the PS system. We need to fix the curriculum, not gut public funding. We need to, in my opinion, instill the spirit of the Trivium and Quadrivium into every level of the system, k-12. We need to completely revamp and overhaul the entire curriculum, but keep it within the PS system. Devos hates PS and wants to gut it in favor of Charters. This fixes nothing and makes it so that the education gulf between the haves and have nots is even larger. </p>

<p>Therein lies the debate.</p>

<p>It’s presumptuous to assume the end state will include payment barriers that are worse than those that already exist. One can of course lazily extrapolate based on a different set of capitalists taking over, but crony capitalism is what we have already. The incumbent benefactors are simply bilking the system via layers of government service providers and contractors instead of “private” schools up front.</p>

<p>The question boils down to: do you want the illusion of fairness in education where the real costs are baked into higher taxes for everyone, or do you want actual fairness in the form of choice, market forces and transparent pricing. The more efficient and cost-effective approach in our current economic system is the market-based approach.</p>

<p>In a perfect world, yes, but human nature is a thing. It is the fool who believes we should run things based on how things should be, rather than how they are.</p>

<p>People require incentives to do things. If schools have to compete for funding(students), they can do so in 1 of 2 ways, either by lowering prices, which won&#39;t matter under a school voucher system, or by improving their product(the school). This, as competition has shown, for the past 200 years, will lead to a rise in the quality of the product being sold, across the board, as it has in every sector that needs to compete for money.</p>

<p>I can cite you countless studies that show that school choice/voucher systems are objectively better than what they have now, as I have done many times in the past.</p>

<p>Listen to yourself. What happens when you &quot;get rid of bad schools&quot;? Where do those kids go? To the &quot;better&quot; schools? How do you judge teachers? With more standardized tests?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>See, this is the exact mentality that has gotten us to this point. No one wants to strive for perfection anymore, in life or politics. No one wants higher standards, no one wants to pursue the world the way we all know it <em>can</em> be. We want to settle, under pathetic slogans like &quot;tha&#39;ts just <em>how it works</em>&quot;. I think it&#39;s more than time for idealism and a striving for the perfect to return to our society. Too much &quot;compromise&quot; has lead us to our current social and political state.</p>

<p>We shouldn&#39;t be making schools even more money oriented. We should be changing the culture from the ground up, to promote critical thinking, and to celebrate teaching and teachers. We need to improve the curriculum, and return to the Trivium and Quadrivium, not gut the PS system. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>And that entirely depends on the community. Affluent Middle Class suburbs have excellent school districts funded with high taxes and they love them and are very protective of them. We shouldn&#39;t make schooling even more about the monetary incentive. </p>

<p>Better schools will be opened if bad schools fail.</p>

<p>The laws of supply and demand state that if there is demand for a product(like an education) that can be realistically provided, it will be met with equal supply. Especially considering that 7+ thousand per year government subsidies.</p>

<p>I want ahigher standards. Just like it has always done, a free market will provide those higher standards.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>we should be able to jump off buildings and fly, but instead we settle for pathetic slogans like &quot;thats just how gravity works&quot;</p>

<p>Now think about what would happen if every parent had access to all the funds given to those schools, per child and could choose the best school possible for their kids to allocate those funds, rather than having the government arbitrarily decide where their kids go.</p>

<p>If parents of inner city kids now have the same spending power as those rich suburb parents, and the ability to choose where those funds are allocated, it will benefit everyone, but the poor most of all.</p>

<p>What you&#39;re not getting is that school vouchers don&#39;t take any money out of education. The government currently provides schools with x amount of money, per student, and tells them where to go. All that changes with school vouchers is that now parents can choose to which school they send that money, and to which school their kids go to.</p>

<p>Inner city kids will no longer be forced to go to the hell holes that are the current inner city schools. No one is going to choose to send their kids to places riddled with gang violence.</p>

<p>As such, schools have to be the best they can be, if they want to attract any funding</p>

<p>The reality of the world, and of human nature is that money is a really powerful incentive, altruism is not. That is why communism and socialism fail every time and why capitalism is the most successful and productive ideology to ever exist.</p>

<p>Now the Cult of Trump can peacefully continue cheering on genocide as America helps Israel achieve its own manifest destiny! How is this America first, one might ask? </p>

<p>Triggered leftists don’t understand that America is one nation under God, and Israel is The Holy Land that God promised to mainly white European Jews. America first is about putting God first, and if we don’t help The Zionists with greater Israel then it makes God look like a liar. </p>

<p>America will be great again once we help Gods chosen people reclaim the promised land and finally bring all nations together to form a utopian world government under the watchful all seeing eye of the ancient Hebrew overlord. </p>
