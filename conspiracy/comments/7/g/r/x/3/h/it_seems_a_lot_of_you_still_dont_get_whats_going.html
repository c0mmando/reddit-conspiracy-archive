        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Trump is the one leaking all of the names of sexual predators. Yes Trump. Where did he get this information?  Remember the file on Jewish Anthony Weiners laptop named &quot;Insurance&quot;? </p>

<p>For YEARS myself and others have been telling you powerful Jews are controlling our government, media, and even Hollywood through bribery and blackmail. </p>

<p>Trump is now ending it and taking back control. Remember &quot;America First&quot;? Remember &quot;Make America Great Again&quot;? These sayings was said for a reason! </p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe me?  How many &quot;predators&quot; have been democrats?  Nearly every one.  How many have been Jewish?  Id say about 80%.  It looks like he started with Weinstein as a big bang. Then he released some older stuff. Now we are at a point where big stuff starts dropping. Franken and Lauer are big freaking deals!  Did you notice the shit was coming out about Blumenthal, but all of a sudden it was all ended?  Trumps Art Of The Deal. Blumenthal thought he was bluffing, Trump started releasing info and Blumenthal apparently decided to play by Trumps rules. </p>

<p>Havent you seen all the crap Netanyahu is in?  All of that started after Trump left Israel. More than likely he gave the real Jewish leaders Intel on Netanyahu and told them to cut him off or he would himself. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m sure the shills will be drawn here like flies on shit, but it is the last day of the month so maybe not. Have you noticed on the last day of the month its pretty nice here with the lack of shills?  Tomorrow starts a new month so expect a lot of new agendas to be pushed. Mark my words tomorrow is going to be shill heaven here. All kinds of new Anti Trump propaganda, watch.  </p>

<p>Edit:  I wasn&#39;t clear I think. No I don&#39;t think this sexual blackmail is only Democrats. It is definitely both Democrats and Republicans. What I was trying to say is Trump will have no problem making an example of of the Democrats and will eventually as a Republican make deals with other Republicans in said predicament to get them to do what he wants. </p>

<p>After investigation, a grand jury in Douglas County (of which Omaha, Nebraska is the largest city and county seat) determined the abuse allegations were baseless, describing them as a &quot;carefully crafted hoax&quot; and indicted two of the accusers on perjury charges.[4] The grand jury also suggested that the abuse stories originated from a vindictive employee terminated by Boys Town, the famed refuge for troubled youths.[4] Later, a federal grand jury concluded that the abuse allegations were unfounded and indicted 21-year-old Alisha Owen, an alleged victim, on eight counts of perjury.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...in a post saying that this is Trump&#39;s doing. And that he&#39;d knock off people that oppose him first. Context is important.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not saying that there are no Republican predators (hence the quotation marks). He&#39;s trying to say that the ones getting in trouble are Democrats because Trump is the one selling them out and is putting bias first.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with his theory, but it helps to know what you are arguing about before you start arguing.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re okay with the POTUS blackmailing people for his own personal gains? He&#39;s spent his life using his daddy&#39;s money to climb over the little guys, and you think it&#39;s a good thing if he has the ability to blackmail the only people that could possibly constrain him?</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t even mentioning how flippant you seem to be about Republicans raping children and <em>Trump helping them get away with it</em> just so he can give himself tax cuts and avoid facing justice for his crimes.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t care about politicians raping kids and covering it up, and you don&#39;t care about a reality TV millionaire blackmailing the people who have oversight over his power, what <em>do</em> you care about? What is the end game of the politics you&#39;re endorsing here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking this for a while now. Trump is using/blackmailing them all to get his promised policies enacted. I believe he has dirt on all of them, and will not release everything, only enough to get the right people to do what is necessary.</p>

<p>Without his major campaign policies passed the people may not justify his second term. Without a second term, he&#39;ll lose the protection of the military and leave his family exposed to danger from the other powerful families he has made enemies of. That&#39;s why he is pushing really hard, maybe using unconventional means, acting like a buffoon,   and resorted to indirect blackmail, don&#39;t blame him considering their huge influence.</p>

<p>Still, 3 more years left ... going to be interesting</p>
