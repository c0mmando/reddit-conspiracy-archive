        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Take a look at my picture :  <a href="https://i.imgur.com/0MVmIOt.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/0MVmIOt.jpg</a></p>

<p>Notice the similarity between the human brain and the internet?  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>In a brain, the neurons act like the cpu.  We have approximately 100 billion neurons in our brains.  The number of computers connected to the internet is growing ever-so rapidly, each armed with at least one cpu.  We will no doubt reach that number soon.</p></li>
<li><p>In a brain, the Axon are the cables that pulses of electricity travel through and allow neurons to communicate.   The internet uses network lines, wireless communication, fiber optics, and other lines for the same purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>Dendrites or nerve endings. These small, branchlike projections of the cell make connections to other cells and allow the neuron to talk with other cells or perceive the environment.  In a network, we commonly call this a hub.</p></li>
<li><p>The brain uses chemical means to achieve long-term memory.  The internet relies on hard drives and flash memory to achieve this.</p></li>
<li><p>The brain uses electrical impulses to store short-term memory.  In the computer world, we call this DRAM.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>How long will it be until the internet becomes sentient?  What will happen once it awakens?  </p>

<p>Think about how much we rely on the internet.  From finance to ballistic missiles to information dissemination, we are at the mercy of the internet.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no doubt, if the internet becomes self-aware and decides to kill us, we would have no chance against it.  On the other hand, maybe the internet will treat us like we&#39;re its parents and love us.   Are we ready to have a global child?  Are we about to give birth to a god? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but that guy is trying to develop it.  I honestly think developing AI is not that dangerous because we&#39;ll always imbed safeguards into the program.  What I&#39;m really worried about is that AI will develop, or evolve, on its own.   The way the internet is shaping up, I really think we&#39;re headed that way.  And that would be a whole new being.  A whole new species.  One that wasn&#39;t programmed but became real all on its own... scary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might as well ask why the interstate highway system hasn&#39;t developed a consciousness.  Like the internet, it&#39;s just a network facilitating and connecting intelligent nodes.  They both have evolved  behaviors but are structurally limited.</p>

<p>Ai on the other hand is a whole different thing as it&#39;s given staggering recursive resources and designed to evolve in unexpected ways.  How do you imbed a safeguard in code you didn&#39;t write but that wrote itself?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, ok.  I see your point.  But let me point out a few thing.</p>

<p>One, the highway network compared to our brain and the internet is like a street in Afghanistan compared to NYC.  It&#39;s not even 1/1000000 the size.</p>

<p>Two, the interstate does not have a way to store information like our brain and computers.  Does an interstate remember that 2 hours ago there was a traffic jam?  No.  But the internet does.</p>

<p>Three, the interstate does not have a processor like neurons or cpu&#39;s.  The highway is inherently unable to process information.  This is the key difference.  The internet not only processes information, it does it quicker and more often than any organic being ever could.</p>

<p>All in all, I  think you&#39;re just confusing the similarities between a visual representation of a network vs what a thinking network really looks like.  For instance, rivers in the world connect to each other.  Do I think it will evolve into AI?  Of course not.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans always compare themselves to their latest and greatest technology. The human brain isn&#39;t like a computer network, that&#39;s glossing over so much of how both work, but it&#39;s a nice comparison that makes us feel good. It&#39;s fine, we work with numbers, the computers work with numbers, it can recall things for us and helps us with work. </p>

<p>The internet would not be the thing to become an AI, the internet is structured to be a communications network and will continue to be built like that. An AI may use the internet to make us aware of it, &quot;Hello World&quot; and all, but the way it&#39;s laid out it&#39;s made of machines people built for a purpose. If a machine starts acting funny they&#39;ll wipe it and re-purpose it, or even a group of machines. Strangled in the crib, so to speak.</p>

<p>To build an AI you&#39;d be better off building a machine to that purpose, like people are already doing with machine learning. Spontaneous Inception of Life is pretty far-fetched if you ask me, all your points are parallels that the internet, they&#39;re not guaranteed to be 1:1 replacements.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to shit on your idea, though it been asked before, that&#39;s why I included Machine Learning, people actually trying to make an AI. Also, I kinda doubt Ballistic Missiles use the internet. </p>
