<p>FUCK! That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve heard that .... and, it makes NO sense whatsoever <em>except</em> to &#39;remove&#39; them from &quot;locals questions&quot;</p>

<p>OR they were never &#39;real&#39; victims in the first place</p>

<p>Yes, <em>very</em> &#39;interesting&#39;</p>

<p>Y&#39;know it&#39;s been said that trump and the saudi king were having talks at the Four Seasons and were <em>attacked</em> by a group of G4S mercenaries who were trying to ASSASSINATE both of them</p>

<p>The shots into the crowd came from a helicopter to create a &#39;diversion&#39; while the attack went on</p>

<p>that&#39;s why DT went to Asia shortly afterwards ... he was too vulnerable <em>until</em> he made the arrests he has ...</p>

<p>And now there are 4000+ <em>sealed</em> indictments waiting in the wings for .... hmmmm?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Shit just doesnt add up. Im waiting for the indictments to hit. Should be able to make a few more connections. </p>

<p>The most recent thing that had me thinking was what my mom told me. She said that in vegas they are saying &quot;He (paddock) was picking off the ones who were standing up&quot;. Now tell me. How many people are that accurate at 400+ yards with a bump stock. Now I&#39;d buy the fish in a barrel just spray and prey* scenario. But your telling me someone with as little training as paddock just naturally has that kind of accuracy. Now I&#39;m starting to believe the Saudi snipers that were in the building did it. </p>

<p>Also I saw a couple of articles saying the Al-Waleed &quot;admitted he had his snipers in the building during the shooting&quot;. Anyone have a confirmation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah bro I agree. I&#39;m a lot older than you (early Gen x) and as long as you guys get red pilled and support <em>positive</em> changes, things will get better</p>

<p>It might sound crazy but &quot;we <em>create reality with our thoughts</em>, be they thoughts of kindness or thoughts of greed. On this planet there IS <em>more than enough for everyone</em> BUT the Rich/elite wouldn&#39;t BE &#39;elites&#39; If <em>everyone could have</em> &quot;enough&quot;</p>

<p>The problem is, TPTB/elites have done a great job getting the average person to believe &#39;communism&#39;=death ,, when in reality &#39;communism/socialism&#39; means <em>sharing</em> the wealth, something TPTB <em>really don&#39;t want to happen</em>!</p>

<p>So, they&#39;ve made this Grand Illusion called &quot;capital-ism&quot; that most people believe is this wonderful way for <em>everyone</em> to be able to &#39;succeed&#39;, the Great American Dream, ... which it <em>is</em>, a dream.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t already, watch that movie that&#39;s stickied here called &quot;Everything is a Rich Man&#39;s Trick&quot; ... it explains the &#39;whole banking scam&#39; brilliantly. It   takes 3.5hrs to do so BUT it&#39;s <em>so complex</em> that, even not wasting a word, it takes that long to tell the Full story</p>

<p>It&#39;s well worth the watch and would likely &#39;red pill&#39; anyone who who does watch it. It&#39;s not for your mom though ;D</p>

<p>Stay strong my young friend from across the globe, &#39;we&#39; <em>can</em> do it IF we keep our thoughts positive and try our best to be good to each other</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t agree more. Thoughts are extremely powerful. I believe ideas, opinions, and thoughts are going to continue to be paramount to the progression of society in the future...as they always have. I think the elites recognize this. That&#39;s why they will do everything they can to censor us and Suppress the truth. Its our ability to think that continues to put their fabricated illusion in jeopardy of being exposed day after day. Our thoughts are the biggest threat to everything they so selfishly strive to control. </p>

<p>I appreciate the support. And don&#39;t worry about me. I&#39;m in this. I&#39;m not the type to give up. I sure as hell can&#39;t give up on my city. Our ideas are gaining traction. Pretty soon we will have proof. Were gonna expose them. Were gonna make the changes in the world that need to be made. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Bingo!</p>

<p>and y&#39;know what? TPTB make &#39;plans&#39; <em>for everything</em>, some super long term (to maintain control of everything) and they take <em>everything</em> in account when making these plans</p>

<p>BUT they <em>never thought that</em> &#39;computers&#39; would ever become &#39;personal&#39; to any degree beyond the odd geek, <em>and they never even imagined</em> the Internet and the effect it would have upon the <em>people</em> ... esp those like us and those who are &#39;seeking&#39;</p>

<p>to have &quot;the library of the world&quot; <em>at your fingertips</em> to learn from (and verify things you already know or have &#39;heard about&#39;)</p>

<p>Then, the fact that we can <em>share these IDEAS</em> is absolutely frightening for them and something they&#39;d LOVE to put a stop to</p>

<p>BUT it&#39;s too late. They&#39;re gone into &#39;damage control&#39; as far as the internet and all that goes with it goes. It&#39;s unprecedented territory and what&#39;s &#39;worse&#39; ,, <em>it unifies people</em> ,, like us here now!</p>

<p>The funny thing is, &quot;cyberspace&quot; Is a &quot;unified world&quot;, it has no &#39;borders&#39;, so in a way when we do shit online, we&#39;re participating in a &quot;one world <em>place</em> .... BUT that&#39;s a BIG difference from a &#39;one world <em>government</em>!</p>

<p>thanks  for being the cool kid you are, if you ever think of coming to Oz for a trip, hit me up here by pm and I&#39;ll see what I can do ;D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that there were crisis actors and real people getting shot is the dumbest, most idiotic concept you can possibly entertain.</p>

<p>We know there were crisis actors.  We know there&#39;s utterly no evidence of anything or anyone being shot.</p>

<p>If you want to believe the unsubstantiated claims of someone on the internet, never mind the question of why so many people with direct connections to a real shooting would be lurking around in a conspiracy forum after the fact, that&#39;s your malfunction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His story about his &quot;buddy&quot; being shot three times in the chest (and surviving) is enough to know he is lying, because at a distance of about 900 yards, the slightest millimetric deviation of the gun barrel will translate into differences of several feet or more where the bullets actually strike. The gun recoils slightly anytime a shot is fired, therefore hitting a target the size of a human torso three times is impossible even with a tripod that was not even there. </p>

<p>Of course, there is no reason to think any bullets were fired anyway. No one can show any images or videos of anything being shot or anything or anyone that has been shot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean all we really know is what you know. They actually reported a lot less in Vegas. I go to college out of state and I&#39;d see stuff on the news and my mom would say she never heard it. I think they are trying to suppress the info where it matters the most. People in Vegas are mad. They know they are being lied to...But as sheeple always are they domt care enough to research on their own. I still think its tied up with the saudis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s crazy. Yeah, sounds like that kind of operation w saudi backing was what happened. We are so mad too!</p>

<p>Couple of questions for you.</p>

<p>Do you have any way to go to Mandalay Bay and get up to the 32 floor to see if they have it opened up yet?</p>

<p>Any chance you could find some security guards that were working that event and ask them some questions about multiple shooters?</p>

<p>Can you go ask the hotel if Jose Campos is still working there and just play it like &quot;hey he&#39;s a big hero and I wanted to thank him and get his autograph!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m extremely curious, are most of you Las Vegans? Veganites?... completely aware that there was some seriously shady shit going on. Like to completely believe the mainstream narrative was filled with such disinformation. Like WHAT THE fuck actually happened there? Like a casino didn’t capture a single image of the “lone gunman?” It’s like insane how much shit needs explanation. I was just curious what the local population in Vegas is feeling when you say the word “conspiracy.” Aka, know that something is fucking wrong here. Anyways, praying for you guys. &lt;3</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My questions boil down to one hinge point</p>

<p>Given basic principles of investigation and ruling out suspects, how (with what evidence) did the FBI so quickly determine (before morning) that Stephen Paddock acted entirely alone?</p>

<p>What we do know based on the story we have been given: </p>

<p>*There were other people actively moving about on floor 32 during the attack</p>

<p>*In contradiction to the original story, the cops did not show up until after the shooting ended, meaning until more evidence is released there were periods during all this unfolding where someone could have gone up or down the stairwell to escape without being seen by the cops who went on 60 minutes</p>

<p>*No one actually witnessed Stephen Paddock shooting, and for some unknown reason he just stopped and shot himself mid-attack</p>

<p>*Not one, but two handgun shots are heard clearly on multiple videos shortly after the automatic fire ends.</p>

<p>*that 2 windows were broken, not one, and the amount of guns and ammo in the room is unbelievably large for use by one person. (please don&#39;t respond to me saying it&#39;s still possible for one person to get and transport all the guns and use 2 windows. I know, but the point here is that it at the very least suggests more than one person, which warrants further investigation)</p>

<p>I could go on but any one of these points should be enough by itself to warrant an investigation into the possibility of conspirators. The resounding insistence that it was just one guy and DEFINITELY NOT TERRORISM from the get go is what has made me so distrustful of the story from the start. It was clear the Sheriff was being forced to lie and that more than anything they didn&#39;t want this event labeled terrorism. Couple this with it&#39;s total disappearance from the news in less than 2 weeks, and the fishiness is hard to ignore. For me, it started with their swift insistence it was only one person despite all the compelling avenues of questioning they clearly had not had time to pursue. </p>

<p>From there the questions explode</p>

<p>*Why still no footage of Paddock in the casino?
*Who did he order room service with?
*What is the monetary value of those guns? 
*Is it 100k?
*Why did ISIS claim responsibility and again, how was it so quickly ruled out?
*Who was staying in The Four Seasons that night, and has that hotel been a part of the investigation?
*Why did Jesus Campos go straight to Mexico right after the shooting, and how did he even drive with a right leg that had just been shot?</p>

<p>I could go on, but I&#39;m out of time.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>How many stairwell exits did each floor have?  I know there was one at the end of the 100 hallway next to Paddock&#39;s suite.  I&#39;m assuming there were others at the end of the 200 and 300 hallways.  Was there one more at the elevator banks?  If someone had escaped from the area near Paddock&#39;s suite, it couldn&#39;t have been through the stairwell right by his door because that one was barricaded.  So someone would have had to go at least as far as the elevator banks (if there was a staircase there.) </p>

<p>If there was no stairwell at the elevator banks, then someone would had to have walked the full length of two wings to get to either the 200 stairwell at the end of the 200 wing, or the 300 stairwell at the end of the 300 wing.</p>

<p>Also, with all the talk of explosives I’ve been curious if it would be possible to blast a hole into the stairwell from paddocks suite. I know that’s very far-fetched, but I can’t help but think it’s not a coincidence that the suite shared a wall with the stairwell. </p>

<p>Paddock&#39;s suite is where the man&#39;s thumb is.  Look at the other wing and locate the red dot.  That is a hotel room.  Look directly across the hall and it looks like a room that is twice as large as the two on either side of it.  That is where the service elevators were.  There were for of them.</p>

<p>how (with what evidence) did the FBI so quickly determine (before morning) that Stephen Paddock acted entirely alone?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>being these sort of shootings tend to always be a solo shooter. The rare times it&#39;s not a solo shooter there is always a long drawn out barricade/hostage/negotiation sort of cycle and/or it&#39;s robbery gone wrong. Oh sure here people love to say how every mass shooting is done by small teams of black ops and then some fall guy blah blah blah. Yet statistically your mass shootings event, as in just shooting people to shoot them is a solo perpetrator maybe, pulling numbers out of no where here, 95% to 99% of the time.  </p>

<p>Rattle off the ones that are not a solo shooter in the USA. You have Columbine, San Bernardino, North Hollywood shootout but that&#39;s robbery gone wrong and that&#39;s about it. </p>

<p>So right off the bat the police pretty much figure it&#39;s a solo shooter. No hostage, no drawn out barricade, no nothing, just like the pattern for the other solo shooters in the past. Then despite not breaching the door right away it seems like they at least have decent control of the other floors/hallways as they did their sweep. Could of someone been with Paddock, moved up or down a floor and into a random hotel room to hide in plain sight? Maybe, I don&#39;t know. Given the pattern of these sort of crimes it that really likely? No.  </p>

<p>So they quickly say he was solo given the crime scene and history of these sort of crimes, putting the public at ease to some degree. Being no one else was actively shooting so even if the police were/are found to be wrong later it not going to really mater at the time of the press conference. They were not hunting an active 2nd, 3rd, 5th. 10th shooter anyways. </p>

No cameras at the pentagon?  This Las Vegas shit makes me want to give up.  I’ve been in Vegas more than 20 times in my life.  I assure you, there are a zillion cameras.  Everywhere.

    <div class="md"><p>Most theories flow to something like an arms deal gone bad and or the shooting being a diversion to escape. Isis claimed responsibility for this attack. The Four Seasons shares the same building and was part owned by the richest Saudi in the world. The one who got arrested in Nov in that purge. Anyways, I’m being very general here, but say Paddock is a spook of some sort or even just an fbi asset. How do you think the FBI would react if one of their gun running stings crashed into a cia sting on ISIS and it resulted in the largest mass shooting in living memory? Would they admit that? Or cover it up? </p>

<p>That’s one of a million possibilities. But where I think most people will agree their skepticism  lies in the disbelief that he did this by himself and the belief the authorities are hiding something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although I respect your efforts. I&#39;m  not buying this scenario. Where is the proof of all these shoot out with automatic weapons, Helicopters taking off while having shoot outs, all these dead people, the massive amount of bullet holes, the video from inside the casino, etc. Although assassination attempts do happen, Las Vegas was not. This was a drill put on by the Department of Defense, and covered up by the FBI. They don&#39;t care what you really think about the &quot;shooting&quot;, as long as you believe there was really a shooting.  It was a PsyOp. Under the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012, which was passed under the NDAA act, it is legal for them to do this , and not get in trouble. If they tell you it was a hoax, then that would defeat the purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Shit just doesnt add up. Im waiting for the indictments to hit. Should be able to make a few more connections. </p>

<p>The most recent thing that had me thinking was what my mom told me. She said that in vegas they are saying &quot;He (paddock) was picking off the ones who were standing up&quot;. Now tell me. How many people are that accurate at 400+ yards with a bump stock. Now I&#39;d buy the fish in a barrel just spray and prey* scenario. But your telling me someone with as little training as paddock just naturally has that kind of accuracy. Now I&#39;m starting to believe the Saudi snipers that were in the building did it. </p>

<p>Also I saw a couple of articles saying the Al-Waleed &quot;admitted he had his snipers in the building during the shooting&quot;. Anyone have a confirmation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah bro I agree. I&#39;m a lot older than you (early Gen x) and as long as you guys get red pilled and support <em>positive</em> changes, things will get better</p>

<p>It might sound crazy but &quot;we <em>create reality with our thoughts</em>, be they thoughts of kindness or thoughts of greed. On this planet there IS <em>more than enough for everyone</em> BUT the Rich/elite wouldn&#39;t BE &#39;elites&#39; If <em>everyone could have</em> &quot;enough&quot;</p>

<p>The problem is, TPTB/elites have done a great job getting the average person to believe &#39;communism&#39;=death ,, when in reality &#39;communism/socialism&#39; means <em>sharing</em> the wealth, something TPTB <em>really don&#39;t want to happen</em>!</p>

<p>So, they&#39;ve made this Grand Illusion called &quot;capital-ism&quot; that most people believe is this wonderful way for <em>everyone</em> to be able to &#39;succeed&#39;, the Great American Dream, ... which it <em>is</em>, a dream.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t already, watch that movie that&#39;s stickied here called &quot;Everything is a Rich Man&#39;s Trick&quot; ... it explains the &#39;whole banking scam&#39; brilliantly. It   takes 3.5hrs to do so BUT it&#39;s <em>so complex</em> that, even not wasting a word, it takes that long to tell the Full story</p>

<p>It&#39;s well worth the watch and would likely &#39;red pill&#39; anyone who who does watch it. It&#39;s not for your mom though ;D</p>

<p>Stay strong my young friend from across the globe, &#39;we&#39; <em>can</em> do it IF we keep our thoughts positive and try our best to be good to each other</p>
