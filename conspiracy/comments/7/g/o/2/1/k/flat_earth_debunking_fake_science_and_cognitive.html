       In 250BC, the Greek scientist Eratosthenes made first known measurement of the size of Earth
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       I believe his experiment is meaningless for the reasons I will describe
      </p>
      <p>
       When Eratosthenes measured the angle, he used non-euclidean geometry.
      </p>
      <p>
       By doing so,
       <strong>
        he went in assuming that the earth was round
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Had he used euclidean geometry, he would have gone in assuming that the earth was flat.

       Now, we also have to accept that
       <strong>
        mathematics is not a science
       </strong>
       , as it is unfalsifiable.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The natural sciences investigate the physical universe but mathematics does not, so mathematics is not really a natural science.
       </p>
       <p>
        In mathematics... the ultimate arbiter of correctness is proof rather than empirical evidence. This reflects a fundamental difference in what one is trying to achieve: mathematics is concerned with finding certain kinds of
        <em>
         necessary
        </em>
        truths.

       or, to put it another way, we would all agree that one plus one equals two, and that one plus one does not equal three, and by showing that one apple plus one apple equals two apples, we have proven that 1 + 1 = 3 is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, mathematics can prove that
       <strong>
        1 + 1 = 3
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       as shown :

       <strong>
        Q.E.D. mathematics is not a science.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, the very language in which the natural sciences aspire to describe and analyse the universe, can be called into question.
      </p>
      <p>
       to go further into the rabbit hole, we look for proof of existence while going in assuming that the world around us exists.

       Its a false proof.

       Divide by zero error. If a=b then you cant have this part of the equation a(a-b) = (b+a) (b-a)
      </p>
      <p>
       It would look like
      </p>
      <p>
       1(1-1) = (1+1) (1-1)

       Its a trick because you can factorialize against a and b but not real values.

       there are two things, which have to be divided between zero people, how many things does each person get? zero.

       mathematical example :

      <p>
       2/0 = ∞
      </p>
      <p>
       ∞ + ∞ = ∞

       Right. So your proof in the image above comes out to 0=0

       You just said that 2/0=0 and your proof shows us a(0) = (a+b) (0)

       since a = b, b-a must be 0.  So this is really a*0=(b+a)*0 which could also be written as a*0 = 2a*0

       Here's where this goes off the rails.  (a*0) / 0 is not equal to a.  (a*0)/0 = 0/0 which is undefined.  So that inference step (the division by zero) is not mathematically valid.

       2/0 is undefined. 2/x would approach infinity as x approaches 0, but one can never actually take infinity to be a value like you are doing. Furthermore, your practical example is nonsensical. I could just as easily argue that you're not dividing anything because there's nobody to divide it amongst.

       if the sky is a dome, with a super hd projection of the sky, then Mars is just a projection, and it can be made any shape they like.
      </p>
      <p>
       where does all the information for Mars come from? The Man.
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA, ESA, Soviet space programme.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we, in a practical sense, send a probe to Mars? no, it is prohibitively expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we have to take on faith that the evidence they provide is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kind of like Joseph Smith, saying that God spoke to him, in a bag, through magic gold plates, that no one else can see, and you have to take it on faith that it is the way he says it is, because he holds the only proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       you have to accept that Mars exists, and is as is shown in the photographs, because they are the only ones taking the photographs.
      </p>
      <p>
       at this time, it is non-falsifiable to us, therefore not science.
      </p>
      <p>
       yes, you may argue, that it is only a technological problem, and eventually, we will be able to all go to space, and pass by Mars and be like, look there it is, up yours flat earthers, but until that is the case, you cannot personally prove the point, like I said, you cannot personally prove, using only the angles, that the earth is round, because if using another (accepted mathematical) system, it shows that it is flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is no way for a theory to disprove itself, it must be disregarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, to avoid any, 'your theory can't be disproven either' arguements, I am not trying to prove that the earth is flat, I am trying to show that the evidence I have provided, which is claimed as proof of the flat earth, is based on nothing more than a self-proving hypothesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       if the facts disprove the theory, change the facts to suit the theory, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       therefore, 1 + 1 = 2 but it also can equal 3, 0, 1, infinity, or whatever you want it to be, and you can prove that it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       the theory has proven to be unfalsifiable, as in you can get whatever result you want, therefore must be rejected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ergo, the entire basis of proving that anything exists is based on the incorrect assumption that things do actually exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, prove that anything exists, before you try to prove that the earth is round.
      </p>
      <p>
       What empirical evidence do you have that reality is in fact real?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's get all meta up in here.

       Can you send a probe to Mars? Prob not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know anyone who can? I highly doubt it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know anyone, other than the government run science institutions, who can launch a probe to mars? not that I have heard of. Yes Elon says he can, but can he right now? no.
      </p>
      <p>
       so no one, except The Man, can send a probe to Mars, to find out, directly, that it is actually a thing, right? right.
      </p>
      <p>
       all we can do is look at it through a telescope.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if the sky were a massive HD display, you could see images in your telescope or whatnot fine and dandy, like you can look at a tv through a telescope.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then, beyond that, what about this bombshell (stand back) :
      </p>
      <p>
       if astronomers looked into the sky, with their high powered telescopes, and discovered that, in fact it WAS a screen, or if someone went up there, and showed that it WAS a dome, then, boom their whole industry collapses, because for over 100 years, you all didn't know you were looking at a screen?
      </p>
      <p>
       and then, it's a domino effect from there, telescope businesses go under, because no one needs them anymore, and then it's Chinatown, and you put your hand into a pile of goo that used to be your best friends face, then you'll know what to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for JS, I am saying he said,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "yeah I can see the magic plates, oh yes, indeedy, the magic plates, they certainly are in this hat, believe me you, and I can read them, and this is what they say... wait, what's that about special underwear?"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       (
       <em>
        no offence to the Church of Latter Day Saints, believe whatever you believe, peace
       </em>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       and that is
       <strong>
        EXACTLY
       </strong>
       like
       <em>
        The Man
       </em>
       sending a probe to Mars, and then saying :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Chekkit dawg, photos from Mars, legit"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and accepting that, without question.
      </p>
      <p>
       What other proof do you have that Mars exists?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to crack this whole thing so wide open they'll have to call it Marsgate.
      </p>
      <p>
       *get it? open? cause it's a gate?"
      </p>
      <p>
       yeah, you get it.

       That’s a lot like saying the Earth is flat because David Icke was commentating when Steve Davis lost the world snooker championship using David Bryant’s pipe to record a maximum break of four touchdowns in 1983.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because David Icke, Steve Davis, David Bryant, Snooker and touchdowns existed in 1983 I can’t equate all of them together to come up with a way to make Cliff Thorburn the winner.

       I thought I understood it, but since, have come to understand that, although hypothetical such as a and b can be brute forced into behaving in ways they were never intended to, when they are real numbers, the rules do apply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, dividing by zero turns out to be a lot harder than I imagined.
      </p>
      <p>
       I accept that I was wrong, and have made that point at least a couple of times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thankyou to everyone who has helped me understand that, just because it is a logical argument, it is not a mathematically correct one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, however much we want it to be, logic cannot win all battles. Some things are just inherently illogical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although one should be able to divide by zero (2/0 should equal either 2, 0, or infinity), sadly it doesn't work that way, and thusly, this theory falls apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks again :)

      <p>
       a equals b, 1 = 1, sweet, now we're set, we can enter the mysterious world of pure mathematics

      <p>
       therefore, a x b = b
       <sup>
        2,

       as we have established that a and b are equal and both equal 1.

         2

       as a matter of fact, it can, I present the Qbit :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         the quantum analogue of the classical bit. A Qbit is a
         <em>
          two-state quantum-mechanical system
         </em>
         .
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         In a classical system, a bit would have to be in
         <em>
          one state or the other
         </em>
         .
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         However, quantum mechanics allows the Qbit to be in a superposition of
         <em>
          both states at the same time
         </em>
         , a property that is fundamental to quantum computing.
        </strong>
       </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       right?
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        good, let's press on with our plan to lift the curtain on the fabric of reality and look deeply into the essence of existence
       </em>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        a = b + a
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       0 = 0 + 0
      </p>
      <p>
       0 = 0
      </p>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <p>
       1 = 1 + 1
      </p>
      <p>
       1 = 2
      </p>
      <p>
       so, 1 can be shown to equal 0, 1, 2, or ∞.
      </p>
      <p>
       the rest follows pretty straightforwardly :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        a + 1 = b + a + 1
       </p>
       <p>
        a + 1 = 2a + 1
       </p>
       <p>
        0 + 1 = 0 + 1
       </p>
       <p>
        0 + 0 = 2
       </p>
       <p>
        therefore 0 = 1
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       so, as we have shown, there is no true value for these numbers, as it can be shown that :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         0 = 0, 0 = 1, and 0 = ∞
        </strong>
        as well as
        <strong>
         1 = 0, 1 = 1, 1 = 2, and 1 = ∞
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       therefore we have shown that :
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        1 + 1 = 0
       </li>
       <li>
        1 + 1 = 1
       </li>
       <li>
        1 + 1 = 2
       </li>
       <li>
        1 + 1 = 3
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       and you can keep proving away all day, until you reach :
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        1 + 1 = ∞
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Therefore, I contend that this is mathematical evidence that we live in a quantum simulation.

       No but without substitutions, how do you get from step 3 to 4? You should be able to do it with just a and b since the equation is just a and b.

       I feel that the only way to believe in flat earth is if you don't believe in any other life elsewhere in the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can look off our planet and every body in space appears to be globe shaped. Flat earthers believe that earth is the only flat planet? The only exceptions in the visible universe?
      </p>
      <p>
       If that is the way of thinking then the earth must be extraordinarily special and probably is also the only place life exists because of how unique and special the flat planet is. No globe planet could mimic the physics or properties of a flat planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't get it. I believe in other life and globe planet. However I do believe that planets are hollow.

       Flat Earth is a psyop to make the conspiracy theorist group look stupid.

      <p>
       That CT in a rocket to prove the earth is flat that never happened. It's just mindless brainwashing for the masses to make what we do look crazy.

       That said, we must really be on to something if we are getting our own psyop.

       That's a lot of mental gymnastics to connect that to FE. I don't pretend to know everything but I know even implying 1 + 1 = 3 in some math equation has nothing to do with the physical reality of determining a flat or round earth. I get your point but it only makes things more fucky.

         However, quantum mechanics allows the Qbit to be in a superposition of
         <em>
          both states at the same time
         </em>
         , a property that is fundamental to quantum computing.

      <p>
       right?
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        good, let's press on with our plan to lift the curtain on the fabric of reality and look deeply into the essence of existence
       </em>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        a = b + a
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       0 = 0 + 0
      </p>
      <p>
       0 = 0
      </p>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <p>
       1 = 1 + 1
      </p>
      <p>
       1 = 2
      </p>
      <p>
       so, 1 can be shown to equal 0, 1, 2, or ∞.
      </p>
      <p>
       the rest follows pretty straightforwardly :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        a + 1 = b + a + 1
       </p>
       <p>
        a + 1 = 2a + 1
       </p>
       <p>
        0 + 1 = 0 + 1
       </p>
       <p>
        0 + 0 = 2
       </p>
       <p>
        therefore 0 = 1
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       so, as we have shown, there is no true value for these numbers, as it can be shown that :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         0 = 0, 0 = 1, and 0 = ∞
        </strong>
        as well as
        <strong>
         1 = 0, 1 = 1, 1 = 2, and 1 = ∞
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       therefore we have shown that :
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        1 + 1 = 0
       </li>
       <li>
        1 + 1 = 1
       </li>
       <li>
        1 + 1 = 2
       </li>
       <li>
        1 + 1 = 3
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       and you can keep proving away all day, until you reach :
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        1 + 1 = ∞
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Therefore, I contend that this is mathematical evidence that we live in a quantum simulation.
