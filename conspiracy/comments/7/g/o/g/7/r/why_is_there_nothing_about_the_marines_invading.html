       i'm not saying this did or did not happen.  However, if it did happen i'd expect a blackout on it...i can't imagine the bedlam that would erupt if the general public (who mostly hate trump) found out he had the military invade CIA hq

       People need to stop assuming stuff either is or isn't true based solely on where it is published. Make a decision about whether each story is true or not based on evidence. Having said that, there's not any evidence for this particular story that I've seen. But just because it has blogspot in the title doesn't mean anything. That's lazy thinking.

       No, but the source is otter garbage. Journalist do fact check and have integrity. These anonymous blogs have nothing big a hidden agenda. So there is a huge difference between their claims and an article in WSJ.

       No, because youtube is owned by the same people who own the CIA.  They wouldn't let it out, just like they did with any footage of the 9/11 pentagon explosion until over a year later

       You’re justifying the lack of evidence to support this conspiracy theory, by citing deeper conspiracy theories suppressing and destroying the evidence. Very convenient. You’ve totally convinced me now!  Go Marines! Good job men! Semper Fi!

       P.S. There are plenty of videos of WTC 7 falling still on YouTube. How come those haven’t been deleted by YouTube’s secret masters?

       You calling something a conspiracy theory doesn't make it any less credible considering how often CTs end up being based on facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       You wanna switch gears and talk about 9/11?  You know at this point, people have moved on from 9/11.  There's been endless evidence showing foul play or at the least big holes in the official stories.  People are so gullible and lazy that it's almost like they want to be told what to believe.  Doing their own research takes work and believing something nefarious may make it hard for them to sleep at night or live in their happy little bubbles.

       I brought up WTC 7 collapse videos on YT as an example of evidence that supports the conspiracy theory that the official 9/11 story is bullshit.  IMHO that footage discredits the official story, and yet those videos don’t get deleted by YT. I’ve seen well produced presentations by structural building engineers and related experts challenging the official story and countering with facts in a believable manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       This marine CIA coup story doesn’t have any eye witness testimony or video footage indicting irrefutable proof that an actual attack/counter coup occurred.  All I’ve seen is footage of marine aircraft from a distance flying above the base, and YT conspiracy theory channels claiming they’re hearing from anonymous marines saying they seized computers and papers from the CIA. That’s not good enough for me.

       Well it's enough evidence for me.  There are several reasons that I believe what Q has to say, but to each their own.  I'm so far jaded by the MSM, I automatically disbelieve anything they report, so I certainly wouldn't expect them to report anything like this.

       I don't think the fact that there's no footage of the CIA headquarters on YouTube is evidence that it didn't happen, I mean I doubt many people would be able to get close enough to record and especially if there wasn't prior notice that something was going down.

       That said, I haven't seen any evidence that it did happen either. Who knows where these rumors came from.

       I don’t need proof for it not happening, I need proof that it did happen. I haven’t seen any credible sources or evidence to suggest that it actually happened.  The best “evidence“ I’ve seen comes from conspiracy theory YouTube channels and similar platforms who make the case that a counter coup went down and offer up supposed eye witness anonymous marines claiming that they were there and did it, as well as pictures of marine aircraft flying around Langley.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t buy it. That’s not enough evidence to satisfy my burden of proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want me to believe it’s not a bogus, wishful-thinking make-believe story, then the burden is on whoever claims it happened to provide sufficient evidence to convince people it’s true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having lived most of my life around military bases I can tell you that the military does perform exercises with thousands of servicemen from time to time—shocking I know.  Occam’s Razor applies most of the time and it think it applies in this case too. It’s far more likely that it it was just some sort of exercise involving a few 1,000 marines rather than DT secretly sending in marines in sort sort of secret counter coup against disloyal CIA deep state people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You believe what you want, but I’m not buying it.

       In this specific case, I’d need to see interviews  from several individuals that can prove they were on base at the time this supposed counter coup occurred asserting that it in fact happened. There are over 10,000 employees who work on that base, and Trump loves bragging about his victories on Twitter, and yet all the “evidence” I’ve seen is from anonymous sources.  I don’t easily believe accounts from anonymous sources being filtered through conspiracy theorist channels who seem to believe in just about every CT under the sun, like chemtrails.
      </p>
      <p>
       I need to see more concrete/reliable evidence before I’d believe that anything excited happened at Langley.

       I gave you both a dictionary definition and a contextual definition to be throughout; not to be a dick.

      <p>
       The MSM definitely is biased and definitely pushes their agendas, but they have to report the facts from time to time so saying that no MSM is credible is a bit of and over stretch.  It’s not 100% disinformation 100% of the time. When certain stories are big enough/important enough, then they have to report degrees of the truth.  The trouble is picking through the facts from the spins and BS. So I’m very slow to trust the MSM too. I treat their reports with a similar level of skepticism as I do with CTs.  They did the whole BS anonymous sources bit for a year trying to push their fake Trump Russian collusion nonsense for over a year. They dropped that fake news propaganda once the real evidence surfaced and proved that their anonymous sources were full of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump really had the marines raid the CIA, then CNN could easily have spun it in such a way as to make Trump look like he was exceeding his constitutional authority and demonize him. For crying out loud they demonize every damn word and tweet of his that they can. I trust the MSM enough to believe that if this story had any truth behind it that the MSM would be doing everything that they could to convince us all that  Trump went too far and that the Democrats would be screaming bloody murder for his impeachment. But they haven’t reported squat. Is it possible that they’re silent because TPTB are afraid and are desperately trying to regain control? Yes, I suppose it’s theoretically possible, but I seriously doubt it. It’s far more likely that it’s just an invention of extreme conspiracy theorists making a mountain out of a mole hill.

       calling it a larp is so lazy.  Anyone can discredit something.  It's so easy, costs nothing and puts the onus on the other party to convince you.  You wanna believe it's a larp, I really don't care.  It doesn't change the fact that things are happening.

       This one is very simple to put to bed. Other countries intelligence services and news media would have no incentive to stay quiet about the CIA being raided. None of the USA's enemies would pass up such a once in a lifetime opportunity to destabilize things. Furthermore wealthy business interests would be hitting the eject button causing ripples through the global economy.

       The moment I heard this it sounded like a mole hunt. They released some info to a group of folks to see if someone would leak it.

       Yup, looks like it stands for Global current reset/Revaluation.  Also found this about GESARA (Global Economic Security and Reformation Act):

       People need to stop assuming stuff either is or isn't true based solely on where it is published. Make a decision about whether each story is true or not based on evidence. Having said that, there's not any evidence for this particular story that I've seen. But just because it has blogspot in the title doesn't mean anything. That's lazy thinking.

       I brought up WTC 7 collapse videos on YT as an example of evidence that supports the conspiracy theory that the official 9/11 story is bullshit.  IMHO that footage discredits the official story, and yet those videos don’t get deleted by YT. I’ve seen well produced presentations by structural building engineers and related experts challenging the official story and countering with facts in a believable manner.

       This marine CIA coup story doesn’t have any eye witness testimony or video footage indicting irrefutable proof that an actual attack/counter coup occurred.  All I’ve seen is footage of marine aircraft from a distance flying above the base, and YT conspiracy theory channels claiming they’re hearing from anonymous marines saying they seized computers and papers from the CIA. That’s not good enough for me.
