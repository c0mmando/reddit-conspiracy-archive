        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I often see/read about our most ancient civilizations (Egyptians, Babylonians, etc) more than likely originated from a small group of survivors from Atlantis. This is supported by the same ancient technology, astronomy, arcitecture and symbols seen all around the world.</p>

<p>But my question is what was humanity like before Atlantis existed? Did &quot;elites&quot; that we know of today exist? Was humanity actually free? Would love to hear what you all have learned or hypothsized. I do not see this discussed as much so I was curious. Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ignatious Donnelly wrote a book about Atlantis. Its really good. James Churchward wrote a book about Lemuria, which is pre-Atlantean. Steiner also goes into pre-Atlantean history but you have to be dedicated to reading alot more Steiner than just stuff about Atlantis before you will understand fully. Hancock and Tsarion and Childress and all the rest of that crew are only looking at physical evidence of Atlantis and since it was so long ago, and was swallowed up by the ocean, there is nothing left of a physical nature to prove it&#39;s existence. The Bimini road may be real but Atlantis was supposed to be just outside the Straits of Gibraltar and not near the  American continent. Plus Cayce was a somnambulist and when he talked about it he was posessed by a being who may or may not have been telling the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not sure exactly what you are asking. What was life like? Nobody knows, it&#39;s faded into the mysterious fog of history. </p>

<p>but people have always looked back at the far past as an elevated time when people lived in harmony and walked with the Gods. For a long time it was the past that was seen as holding the promise of Eden/Utopia, Not the future as it is nowadays. </p>

<p>Civilizations seem to go in cycles and this is likely the case for eternity or until civilizations lift themselves above it, if that&#39;s even possible. </p>

<p>So we see the rise and then fall of Sumeria, Egypt, Rome, ect... </p>

<p>It would seem that during the fall periods  the government and elite become corrupted and evil. One would guess that during the Rise periods life was harmonious and in balance with nature and government or leadership was made up of the best in society and not the worst, as is so common now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You knew exactly what I was asking and gave a good answer! </p>

<p>I have heard this &quot;humans walked along gods&quot; and complete peace and freedom essentially a golden age of hunanity.</p>

<p>The quote of walking with Gods seems so strange and out of place when compared to today. There is nothing similar to godly status. We&#39;re they actually gods? Aliens? David Blaine?</p>

<p>If civilization is indeed cyclical, which I do believe it is aswell. Then what is the catalyst to propel ourselves to the next golden age? Is it an actual God walking among us? And I don&#39;t mean a Renaissance, I mean an actual golden age of truth, love and compassion for all of humanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Atlantis truly proceeded all other civilizations then something radical happened that evolved humanity to reach such a civilization so early on. </p>

<p>Humans were likely genetically modified at some point in the past. Whether it was selective breeding, some freak evolutionary trait, or we advanced enough to modify our own DNA, or aliens I can’t really tell you. But something happened hundreds of thousands of years ago where modern humans just kind of randomly get injected into the timeline of existence without an explanation or missing link. </p>

<p>So it’s possible Atlantis was a colony for ETs, where humans were either living alongside them or even possibly their slaves. It’s also possible it was purely just a human city, but again with unknown origins and how they became so advanced we don’t know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have read up before that an ETs came to earth and genetically modified primates to essentially become the new human to mine gold for the ETs. I am not so sure about all of this as it seems to be heavily extrapolated. But the RH negative blood is a strange anamoly among humans that it seems there could be a possibility of DNA altercations. I also read somewhere that the human chromosome #2 has a bunch of oddities when compared to other close relatives of us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve come across both of those anomalies in my own research as well. </p>

<p>The #2 chromosome is baffling. As is Rh negative blood types. There’s also certain bloodlines that trace back to as few as 4 women (the Ashkenazi Jews). </p>

<p>Humans also contain anywhere between 2-3% Neanderthal DNA. Even remote tribes in Africa that never came in contact with Neanderthals still have up to .5% Neanderthal DNA.</p>

<p>Basically, we are a hybrid species. It’s almost as if someone or something came to earth, took hominid and primate DNA, spliced it all together, possibly mixing in some DNA from somewhere else, and created a new species. I just can’t imagine an evolutionary timeline where a hybrid species was able to cross breed with everything from a monkey to a Neanderthal even if the timeline was hundreds of thousands of years. It’s just not probable to get an entirely new species as unique as humans are intellectually and physically. </p>

<p>What caused these genetic mixture of all these different species into humans I can’t tell you, but the evidence does seem to suggest we were modified selectively by choice at some point in the past. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same reason your dog can’t fuck your cat and create a hybrid species. </p>

<p>When you cross breed species and intermix DNA the resulting defects if a pregnancy can even occur typically result in a hybrid species that is infertile and unable to reproduce. The odds of hominids fucking a bunch of other hominids and producing offspring that can reproduce and spread their genetic mutations to form an entirely new species that then becomes the only remaining hominid species on the planet is simply not probable. </p>

<p>I’m not saying it isn’t possible, I’m just saying it isn’t likely. It’s far more likely we were bred selectively or our DNA was tampered with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, I&#39;m not ruling it out. It is a possibility that our ancestors were rapey hominid fuckers, but again theres other anomalies like RH negative blood types, and 2nd chromosome anomalies that suggests something else played a hand in our evolution.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a few people talking about ancient, advanced civilizations, Graham Hancock immediately springs to mind. Not many seem to tackle exactly how we developed that civ, what it was like, or what came before. It&#39;s an interesting subject I definitely need to read more on.</p>

<p>For me the most compelling idea is when you look at the timeline of modern civilization. The older estimates put the Indus Valley civilizations at 8000 years old. So in 8000 year we went from early agrarian civilization to the modern world. Humans are at least 180,000 years old, with more recent findings pushing the origin of modern humans back even further than that potentially. It doesn&#39;t seem unreasonable to me that a highly developed civilization could have formed long ago and been wiped out in a cataclysm (the sinking of Atlantis being an allegory for this). What we now view as the birth of civilization would then be a resurgence of it rather than the beginning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I concur with that. Cosmic Memory by Rudolf Steiner also talks alot about Atlantis. I would argue that Steiner&#39;s book gives us more indications about the nature of the Atlantean people than Donnelly&#39;s does but Donnelly&#39;s book is still amazing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t really know anything about humanity leaving this solar system and returning to this planet multiple times. </p>

<p>Nor do I agree we’ve reached some kind of peak physical superiority. Tell that to everyone who has died of cancer or who is born with genetic diseases. </p>

<p>While I agree we are the dominant species on this planet today, at least on the surface of the planet, we are not even well suited for that. Leave a child in a backyard for 3 days and it will probably die. Even a few hours of sun exposure and we get sun burnt. </p>

<p>We’re barely capable of surviving even the most mild of conditions let alone extreme conditions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve come across both of those anomalies in my own research as well. </p>

<p>The #2 chromosome is baffling. As is Rh negative blood types. There’s also certain bloodlines that trace back to as few as 4 women (the Ashkenazi Jews). </p>

<p>Humans also contain anywhere between 2-3% Neanderthal DNA. Even remote tribes in Africa that never came in contact with Neanderthals still have up to .5% Neanderthal DNA.</p>

<p>Basically, we are a hybrid species. It’s almost as if someone or something came to earth, took hominid and primate DNA, spliced it all together, possibly mixing in some DNA from somewhere else, and created a new species. I just can’t imagine an evolutionary timeline where a hybrid species was able to cross breed with everything from a monkey to a Neanderthal even if the timeline was hundreds of thousands of years. It’s just not probable to get an entirely new species as unique as humans are intellectually and physically. </p>

<p>What caused these genetic mixture of all these different species into humans I can’t tell you, but the evidence does seem to suggest we were modified selectively by choice at some point in the past. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ignatious Donnelly wrote a book about Atlantis. Its really good. James Churchward wrote a book about Lemuria, which is pre-Atlantean. Steiner also goes into pre-Atlantean history but you have to be dedicated to reading alot more Steiner than just stuff about Atlantis before you will understand fully. Hancock and Tsarion and Childress and all the rest of that crew are only looking at physical evidence of Atlantis and since it was so long ago, and was swallowed up by the ocean, there is nothing left of a physical nature to prove it&#39;s existence. The Bimini road may be real but Atlantis was supposed to be just outside the Straits of Gibraltar and not near the  American continent. Plus Cayce was a somnambulist and when he talked about it he was posessed by a being who may or may not have been telling the truth.</p>
