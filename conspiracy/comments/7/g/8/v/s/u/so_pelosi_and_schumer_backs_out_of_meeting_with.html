    <div class="md"><p>Well.. foreign entities supplying them with technology/know how. I believe eastern bloc European countries and Pakistan have both been cited before (can look into this if needed)... it’s also a 70 year old technology at this point, as well as Missile technology having been around for a long while as well. Every failure brings with it a lesson as to what went wrong, and learning from their own mistakes would be a natural course of progression. Are they controlled? Maybe. Did our agencies give them plans and assistance with weapons development? Probably not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all: fuck you and your condescending tone. If you can’t have an adult conversation without acting like a cunt, don’t bother trying to have a conversation. Where didI claim that i had done “masterful research”? Your entire post is just making arguments and putting words in my mouth that weren’t there. Ya god damn douche. </p>

<p>Second: they’ve been working on missile technology for longer than two years. It’s been in the news. Military sources have been saying for a long long time “they’re working on it”. They’ve been working on nuclear capabilities for a very long time as well. This has been a goal. We <em>have</em> known about it. You’re not even disagreeing with what I’m saying. Your initial assertion was that the US and our assets helped them. Mine is that “probably not, some evidence points elsewhere”. They’ve had the materials to create and do these things for a LONG time. They have their own reactors to create their o n
Materials as well. Every international source puts them at “50 years behind everyone else”.. thinking they developed their own tech now in 2017 is completely reasonable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, anyone who kicks puppies hard is a hairy cheese crusted dry cut.  2nd, having the username I Kick Puppies Hard is a good indicator to your capacity to hold a mature adult conversation. So fuck you /s</p>

<p>Say all you want about the intelligence we had on NK and their resources and abilities to build micronucluer capability.  I can name other countries who have more industrial and natural resources that have been trying for years.  Some entity helped and of those possible (and likely) would have been under our watch.  Ask yourself, what value does NK nuclear power bring to the CIA and the deep state agenda? Their geographical location is one.  Having outside nuclear power to intimidate US is another, but what additional value to a shadow government known for starting wars would it bring?  Then look at the role NK plays in trade and in APAC politics.  Their economy to major set backs have had more valleys than peaks.  When you put the nodes and lines together it&#39;s pretty fucking obvious where the red flag sits.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How the message of their actions are delivered to the masses are one thing - never letting a crisis go to waste and all that. In reality the deep entrenched government/assets elements have less to gain in this situation by their actions, so they spin those in a way conducive to their agenda as best they can. The true beneficiaries are our global rivals because of the uncertainty it creates both economically and for the beneficiaries of our defense treaties. This creates both political strife and by proxy devaluing of our currency in a manner.. if we can’t back our political and military obligations the full faith and credit in the United States loses some intrinsic value, and as we see with regional trad agreements, theyre all trying to get off of the dollar for all trade they can. Their actions destabilize the region for the allies of/and America and are likely caused by them and only opportunistically used by other players, our own agencies amongst them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points but I don&#39;t believe our rivals (US) are the same as CIA when you look at their agenda outlined back in the 60&#39;s.  They have a globalist view way different than what most think. 
They do the blood work for the elite but we are told it&#39;s for the people.  Yet we see few benefits and they gain everything.  Our rivals are in on the game. We have propaganda pushing beta males for fucks sake.  They are destroying us from within and have other supporting organizations, corporations and religious factions aligned and infiltrating our political system.  Look at the loopholes for foreign funding and influence alone in politics.  Why push gun control so hard? Why the division efforts through propaganda?  I&#39;m sorry but my gut says CIA and it&#39;s been pretty accurate.</p>

<p>&quot;Given that the President doesn&#39;t see a deal between Democrats and the White House, we believe the best path forward is to continue negotiating with our Republican counterparts in Congress instead,&quot; Pelosi and Schumer said in their joint statement. &quot;Rather than going to the White House for a show meeting that won&#39;t result in an agreement, we&#39;ve asked (Senate Majority Leader Mitch) McConnell and (House Speaker Paul) Ryan to meet this afternoon.&quot;</p>
