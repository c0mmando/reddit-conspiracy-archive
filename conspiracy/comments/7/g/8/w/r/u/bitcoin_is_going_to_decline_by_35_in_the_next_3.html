        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>DONT GET LEFT HOLDING THE BAG WITH BITCOIN!</p>

<p>Here are some simple examples as to why Bitcoin (and other altcoins) are going to plunge in the next coming weeks. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Market Manipulation. Check out the volume from about 3 months ago, the volume exploded and some people where saying someone with a unlimited amount of money was buying up the market (JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, etc etc) if they bought about 1 million coins around $3,600 area, they could easily cash them out for a very nice gain at $10,000.</p></li>
<li><p>Hopefully you already know, Bitcoin is NOT the only Cryptocurrency out there. You can create an unlimited amount of coins. There is also about 5 Main competitors Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, ripple, Monero and Ethereum. So not only do you have choices in where to transact your fiat, you have an almost unlimited amount of places to transact your fiat in the 1000&#39;s of other cryptocurrencies out there. This can easily move excitement into other coins from one day to another, that is when you will see Bitcoin crashing over 30% to 40% in one day.</p></li>
<li><p>look at what the TV has been telling you NON-STOP everyday, they are literally gushing over bitcoin, when has state run TV ever been so kind to their Fiat Competition (ie tv is run by the banks, corporations, etc etc) - this can also be seen with how Bitcoin Cash has been treated. Character Assassination. TPTB arent attacking Bitcoin Cash, they are attacking Roger Ver. A true indication TPTB dont want their game to be messed with.</p></li>
<li><p>the Price of Bitcoin has risen over 900% since this Spring of 2017 (6 short months). What has to happen to something that goes up so quickly without any impediments, it has to correct itself. Where it corrects itself, only time will tell, but you can probably guess around 4500 and 3600. From there it will be a lot more difficult for it to recover in time to attract more investors all the while bag holders wont want to stick around and people who got in early are going to throw their hands up and take whatever profit they can. From 4500 to 3600 the time to recover will probably take another 6 to 12 months to recover and people can get their investments back.</p></li>
<li><p>Coinbase has seen a HUUUUGE influx of retail (basically, mom and dad and immature young investors taking out 10,000 to 25,000 loans) bringing their fiat into Bitcoin in the past 2 months alone! Just heard Coinbase has more customers than Charles Schwab now! Never borrow money you dont have on an investment that is already up almost 1,500% in 1 year. </p></li>
<li><p>As you probably know, $10,000 is a key psychological barrier right now, there is wall of about $100 Million dollars ready to be sold around the 10K price level (on GDAX). Not a good sign for someone trying to make money on their recent investment at $8500-$9,500. These people would need that investment to reach $12,000 to $14,000 to see real gains worth while.</p></li>
<li><p>The CME is gearing up to list Bitcoin Futures. The funny part is, they wont actually be listing any Bitcoins? Everything is settled in cash and only goes off the daily price of Bitcoin from the exchanges. This alone should make you scared of the current price (could see price manipulation from large holders). While youre at it, look up the Saudi Aramco IPO delay. Notice what happened there, the Saudis were going to publicly sell 5% of its oil in the open market in 2018, it seems they were asking too much, so what happened? someone took the price of oil down and made the IPO look worse and worse, the IPO has been delayed and they are looking for more investors and for the price of oil to come back up. The IPO is set to come out in 2019 now.</p></li>
<li><p>TPTB are going to try (probably will) and wreck their competition (bitcoin). Listen to what they all say (all the banking CEOs on tv), they like the underlying technology of Bitcoin (blockchain) they dont quit get Bitcoin, but they like Blockchain. What better way to destroy Bitcoin, than to destroy all the new investors rushing into this recent run. Show all the investors how bad their choice was to follow something so unstable then create something more stable backed by their liking.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Once TPTB are done screwing over all the new investors (dropping their investments down 30-40%) they will roll out a new competitor that people will fell more secure in.</p>

<p>This might not happen in 3 weeks, but with all these factors the chances look better and better than 6 months ago of Bitcoin being a little overextended. </p>

<p>This also could go to 30K before TPTB pull the plug this could happen in the next 3-6 months), but Hogs always get slaughtered. </p>

<p>So, with these factors coupled in, many who got in under $2000 are going to fell happy with 9x the amount of money they put in sooner (cashing out at $10,000), rather than later (cashing out at $8,500 to ,$6,600).</p>

<p>Just some things to think about in the next coming weeks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely would have bought a few months ago, but now seems a little riskier. You could always put in a little bit of money. Either it tanks and you lose a little, or it takes off and you gain a lot.</p>

<p>The main value in Bitcoin is new users. Since there is only a finite amount of bitcoin, the percentage of the bitcoin economy you have is approximately equal to that percentage of the total amount that bitcoin users have in fiat money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, then the beer money i&#39;m putting into btc will get me more btc over the next three weeks!  </p>

<p>The idea that the soros-types can tank a cryptocurrency with their buying power like they can with actual countries/stocks almost gives them too much credit.  Since btc was created to be outside of the control of politicians/governments/banks that means a more leveled playing field.  Insider trading, mergers/acquisitions, ponzi/boiler room schemes won&#39;t work the same way (a lot of alt-coins feel ponzi-esqe already).</p>

<p>The rampant us debt and corruption now has some competition.  Hell yeah, I support it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaha, are you kidding me? Dude, do some basic research, here i&#39;ll do it for you since you are not old enough to understand how to find answers on your own ;) </p>

<p>This post literally called it almost perfectly! (it was a 25% correction not 35%) Nov 29th (12:20am post written) 11,485 HOD Nov 29th - 8,595 LOD on Nov 29th, Nov 28th - 9,945 couldnt breach 10K first time and next day blew right past 10K wall all within a couple hours, market was due for a correction once it went past 10K. Hence this post, sure i missed the market going up by $1,000 an hour but if you were watching the 10K breach the market was going absolutely nuts, and incase you are not familiar with bitcoin it went from 16K to 20K all within a matter of hours, so yeah when you see that you know a correction is right around the corner, any 13 year old with basic math skills could have called this, the hard part is getting the timing right.</p>

<p>But, yeah i got it right, do some better research.</p>
