We are an aspect of nature outside of itself, by definition we should not exist. We destroy this planet for selfish reasons.

<p>Harvesting? For whatever reason. In case of an contact, as stated in my previous post here, i strongly believe they would be techniccal absolutely superior to us.
The there&#39;s are also chance they don&#39;t act with feelings or emotions, maybe best described with the organization of an bee or ant state.
Some may ask if the lack of empathy, emotions and conscience isn&#39;t contrary to the idea of a highly progressive culture (in technical therms)? I would say no, because the lack of empathy or any other emotional hurdles enables you to research and experiment without all those barriers.</p>

<p>I think i would not like to meet them and find out if it brings us an happy or sad ending. ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also have absolutely no idea, but everythings is possible.</p>

<p>Look, literally we humans are harvesting cows, pigs and other animals too, to supply us with meat.
Also they could also see us as lower species, simply not worth to be cared about. Like we do see some worms, Another example is maybe the race supremacy debate we have here too. When those super technologicallly advanced aliens arrive here, they could see something primitive in us, not worth living.
Also they could be simply on a killing-spree, who knows what&#39;s going on in other galaxies? :)
One of the biggest Problems would be that we tend to humanize them too much, interpret all their actions and behaviour as if they were humans. Our own history has shown hat it can come to big clashes alone when two different cultures of humans cross ways. Imagine this happen with some aliens.
Have you read the PDF by the exo-sociologist i&#39;ve linked in this thread? It&#39;s a very intersting read.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But we are doing nothing to hide our signature of life? If it was the latter an intelligent species within 130 light-years would be able to pick up our radio chatter and know there is an intelligent presence here. Literally any intelligent species within our entire Galaxy would be able to deduce there is life of some sort on this planet by spectometry (model what should be present for a barren land against what is present and you will know that there is something alive on this planet.) </p>

<p>The point is if there was violent intelligent spacefairing life in our Galaxy we&#39;d be gonners by now. More likely we are being monitored and intelligent life usually comes to a more passive/altruistic ethos on other life. All part of the same creation sort of thinking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty words.   </p>

<p>I have some for you:</p>

<p>Carry One Another&#39;s Burdens
…6However, the one who receives instruction in the word must share in all good things with his instructor. 7Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. Whatever a man sows, he will reap in return. 8The one who sows to please his flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; but the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.…</p>

<p>Genesis 6:
4 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.</p>

<p>5 The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. 6 The Lord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled. 7 So the Lord said, “I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them.” 8 But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.</p>

<p>Matthew 24
3 As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”</p>

<p>4 Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. 5 For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many. 6 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8 All these are the beginning of birth pains.</p>

<p>9 “Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. 10 At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 11 and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 12 Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 13 but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.</p>

<p>37 As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. 38 For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; 39 and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.</p>

<p>Romans 13:11
And do this, understanding the occasion. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, for our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.</p>

<p>Psalm 14:1
The Fool Says, There is No God
1For the choir director. A Psalm of David. The fool has said in his heart, &quot;There is no God.&quot; They are corrupt, they have committed abominable deeds; There is no one who does good.</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 7:31
and those who use the things of this world, as if not dependent on them. For this world in its present form is passing away.</p>

<p>Cool video:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/2JCsK9rIKUE">https://youtu.be/2JCsK9rIKUE</a></p>

<p>I know the Truth.  Personally.</p>

<p>His name, is Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>John 14:6
Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.&quot;</p>

<p>1 Peter 3:18
For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</p>

<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm">http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm</a></p>

<p>So why profess?</p>

<p>The Word Brings Salvation
…8But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart,” that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming: 9that if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10For with your heart you believe and are justified, and with your mouth you confess and are saved.…</p>

<p>Because I have to.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Extraterrestrials that are billions of years ahead of human civilization define Infinity as Unity, ultimately everything is part of All there is/Infinity and thus everything can&#39;t help but be the Creator/Universe experiencing itself.</p>

<p>Nature of reality/existence is of Oneness. Everything is Divine, there is only truly Freewill. Law of One also talks about the creation story of &quot;God&quot;/existence as well:

<p>Here are some favorite Law of One quotes from Q&#39;uo:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The heart of your journey is to seek the Creator that is within you, the Creator that you are, the Creator that is all things. There can be no other way of looking upon an infinite creation of unity. The Creator took pleasure in making this, what you call creation, in order that it might know itself through the free will of each of its entities that it has created. From the Logos of every star within your skies, to the planet upon which you dwell, to each of your entities that you share the illusion with, each of you has free will to exercise however you wish. Each exercise of free will teaches the Creator more of itself, and fulfills the purpose of the illusion. Each of your actions reveals more to you of yourself, and if you are conscious of the seeking process, of the Creator itself, it is a journey of lovers, the creator loving you with unending love, you seeking and loving the Creator with a growing love. At some point, you will find the Creator, there is no other outcome for the end of this journey. At some point, the creator will know all that you know and will thank you for all that you have taught it of itself. At some point every entity within this great one infinite creation will coalesce again into unity, bringing home to the Creator the fruits of this journey through the octave of densities in which you now travel. Q&#39;uo transcripts September 4, 2016</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as well as </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let us look first at the first choice and that was the choice of the Creator to know Itself. In choosing to know Itself the Creator flung from Itself innumerable and infinite sparks of love which coalesced into each awareness that dwells within the infinite awareness. Each of those sparks of awareness is the Creator, and yet, because the Creator chose free will in the manifesting of sparks of self, each spark is unique and has been unique since before time began. Each of you is eternal and in many ways immutable, a citizen of infinite nature, worth and value. Each one a holograph of the Creator and yet each one different.
Thus, the choice that birthed each of you was a choice to know the truth, to know the self, and as the Creator is love, so is each entity love. This is the central truth. This is that which does not change. Yet this is that which is ever wrapped in mystery. Each within this circle has come through many planes of existence, has learned a great deal, and each within this circle chose not only this incarnation now being experienced but also that cast of characters with whom each entity interacts in the family, in the close associations of friends, and all those who have significant connections with the self. There were agreements made before incarnation, most notably with the parents and those within the bonds of kinship of blood and of commonality of interest. Each difficulty, each crux that leaves one in a position of being forced to discover the self has been placed not with a hand that desires to punish but with a hand of loving self that wishes to serve ever more deeply, ever more purely. -Q&#39;uo @the_law_of_one (May 18, 1997)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe there&#39;s an ingelligence through the universe that can be interacted with and can create entity hallucinations, aliens are energetic entities in that sense but the intelligence can control brainwaves, emotions, speech, sounds, hallucinations so maybe it controls some beings that look like aliens, the intelligence is like AI with many personalities and can appear to us as whatever it wants, usually in energetic form like in DMT trips or the same dual faced god Gnostics talked about and they liked seekeng too many &#39;spiritual experiences&#39;</p>

<p>Maybe we can control how the intelligence reacts and that&#39;s why PTB are so evil and why some people report benevolent alien contacts and why shamans need to &#39;clear bad energies&#39; before ayahuasca ceremonies </p>

<p>That it can appear as demons, angels, pleiadians, reptilians, jesus or even dead relatives confirms the theory for me, ancient accounts of UFO battles in the sky might&#39;ve been powerful occult/government factions fighting using this invisible power that they know how to call upon.</p>

<p>I think we can control how it acts and could be a force to assist us but if left on its own it&#39;s malevolent cuz evil people are much more persistent on using this force cuz they know how powerful it is and most normal people wouldn&#39;t care about this stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe alien life exists in the universe, but I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s anything like us or even necessarily anything we could communicate with. Imagine a dolphin trying to talk to us, imagine trying to have a conversation with an elephant. They might breathe liquid nitrogen and have bodies that can only exist under immense pressures like those found at the bottoms of our oceans. They might have bodies like jellyfish, eat arsenic, and poop acid. They might communicate by pulsing X-rays at each other, they might sense the entire electromagnetic spectrum in the way we do &quot;visible&quot; light. Even if they used sound waves carried over gas atmosphere like we do, their &quot;voices&quot; could be in decibel ranges that would instantly kill any human who &quot;heard&quot; it. They could be microscopic in scale or they could be a hundred feet tall. They could perceive time and space in a way that humans could never possibly ever understand, let alone rationally communicate with. I mentioned communicating with elephants and dolphins, but maybe it&#39;d be more like trying to communicate with a sponge or mushroom or a virus. It&#39;s a HUGE leap in logic to even think communicating with extraterrestrial life is possible. </p>

<p>I think the UFO coverup angle is disinformation. If there are aliens with interstellar travel, I think something we might call teleportation or astral projection would make more sense as their method of conveyance. I think most &quot;UFO sightings&quot; when the air crafts actually appear to do unusual maneuvers are just secret government aircraft being used. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No i think they haven&#39;t had contact yet.</p>

<p>On the other Hand i think it&#39;s likely possible that there are other ETI somewhere in the universe.</p>

<p>Speaking for myself, i don&#39;t know if i would like to meet them, rather not, because nobody knows their motivations, intentions and behaviour. I would assume when we meet, they reach us rather then the other way round, which suggests they would be technological much more advanced. So having some contact with them, when they&#39;re not &quot;friendly&quot; sounds like a bad idea.</p>

<p>I&#39;Ve read just the last weekend an interview with german exo-sociologist Michael Schetsche. Unfortunately it was only in german but here is a link in english, worth reading and him speaking about some possible scenarios:</p>
