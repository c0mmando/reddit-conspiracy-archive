       What the freak are these people even talking about?  We have a huge national debt that is growing every day.  Now is not the time for tax cuts....unless...
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump comes forward to say "we've defeated ISIS"
      </p>
      <p>
       "We're leaving, we're saving a bunch of money, and that is how we can afford these tax cuts"
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump ended the wars and returned the money to the American people, he would be a national hero.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump doesn't do it, Pelosi and Shumer can say the same.  They can tell Trump if he wants tax cuts, he has to end the wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if the government keeps dragging us further into debt with the wars Bush and Obama started...yet are offering tax cuts....what the freak are they talking about?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this how they manage their finances?

       Actual the debt matters very little regardless of who is in power. As long as it stays mostly stable as a proportion of GDP it's a very, very good thing, especially right now as interest rates are so low.

       The trouble is, the debt is no where near stable as a percentage of GDP.  See the first graph at

       . It's nearly as high as it was at the end of World War II and is climbing.  The difference is that in 1946, the war ended and our budget went into surplus.  That's impossible now, especially with the Boomer retirement.

       Interesting side-thought:
      </p>
      <p>
       There's an awful lot of questioning (and apparently wiggle room) around exactly how and for how long the POTUS can unilaterally engage the US Military in "active operations" without a Congressional declaration of war.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's been very little questioning of whether or not the President has the unilaterally dis-engage "active operations" without any input from external sources (intelligence, pentagon, congress). I would assume that he
       <em>
        CAN
       </em>
       just tell the Military at any point in time, "stop fighting, wind down logistics, come home, NOW, ASAP".
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure there might be some blow-back. But I believe it would take no more than a single order given by the Commander-in-chief. Does anyone know if this is not the case?
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Agreed on this point, for sure. I believe that a large part of the massive growth during the Clinton years was due to reduced military costs from winding down from Iraq 1.0.

       Muh muh tax cuts, taxing the rich absurdly high is retarded no matter what you tax them enough they’re gonna store their money off shore like in the panama papers and then what’s that money doing to help the economy? It’s not circulating it’s just sitting in a bank. Also the national debt honestly doesn’t fucking matter as much as people think It does.
