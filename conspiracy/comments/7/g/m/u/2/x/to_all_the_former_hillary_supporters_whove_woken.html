       If it was a cult (its not), at least it was a fairly sensible one.  If your a Trump supporter, you're part of a cult too,but a fucking stupid one that's like a circus and the ring master is a drooling mad man.

       <strong>
        Fun Fact

       No President has been
       <strong>
        as unpopular
       </strong>
       as Trump during this part of his presidency. Since records began.

       No worries man/lady, the intent has been conveyed. I'd rather someone donate a scarf or a warm hat or something anyway. I'll see if there's any way I can use the gold for something nice.

       Good luck opening more eyes. Divide and conquer is keenly effective as it preys on people's lack of trust, but I feel through persistence it's possible to undo much of the work done to widen the gap in the base of the pyramid. Left or right, we're all still on the bottom, being squeezed and kept down by the top.

       Totally agree. He is an entertainer and a marketeer only. He is a conman by trade who is driven by ratings more than anything. He is no different than the rest of the swamp.

       So your saying he wants to do a good job and be popular?
Why not get conned by CNN, the media, and itellignece community who are leaking information to try and over throw the sitting president. The president who is calling out he Deep State and saying whatever the fck he wants..
      </p>
      <p>
       I know people hate when others say this. But pick a side.. Because one of them will be ruling your ass one way or another and I definitely donâ€™t want European Socialist policies in the freest creative nation in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it is all a con.. than the message is still better than acting fake and politically correct. The news media is getting the light shined on them more than ever. The curtain is being pulled back as everyone is becoming more engaged (for better or for worse) and thatâ€™s all because of the Trump effect.

       No I am saying he wants to be popular and take as much money as possible into his familyâ€™s coffers through any means possible.

       The media is not leaking they are reporting on leaks. The leaks are coming from sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just saying deep state randomly doesnâ€™t mean shit. If there truly is a secret cabal of Satanist baby killing globalist profiteers hiding in the shadows pulling levers they will just laugh off nebulous statements.  If you have real actionable information let it out otherwise it is worthless.

       I don't believe it either. There is a Special Counsel with an open ended timeline and budget to investigate any corruption, including Trump. With the mainstream media's open opposition to Trump and the amount of leaks we had early on, we would have heard by now if something were found that implicated him.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really frustrating to listen to the constant attacks from the mainstream media while they completely ignore something like Uranium One. That right there should set off alarms for anyone with half of a brain. The fact that most networks won't even mention it should at least prompt people to ask why. When you ask "why?", the only logical conclusion that you can come to is that the Clintons, Obama, etc. are all protected by the media for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, the way they are resisting Trump is unprecedented. With the lack of evidence for anything they claimed he was involved in, it leads me to believe they are fighting tooth and nail to crush him and get one of their puppets back in place so their crimes can remain hidden and they can resume their agendas in a few years.

       Yeah not to Trump supporters. But to everyone else who sees his history of fucking over contracters who didn't have enough money to sue him and stacking his cabinet with billionaires who write him legislation to help their elite class, yeah he seems pretty corrupt.

       The general consensus before either of them were voted for was that they're both corrupt and that hasn't changed except now we have a small contingent of trolls pretending Trump never was because they're cosplayers gone wrong.

       Saying both are corrupt is true but also dumb. People chase money. Money is an illusion. Life is too short to worry about anything like this.
