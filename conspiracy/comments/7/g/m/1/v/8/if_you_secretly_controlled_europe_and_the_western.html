       Are you denying they happen and that there has been an increase since it started? All you need to do is search around and you'll find enough examples of how they are a scourge to society. Keep burying your head in the sand.

       Of course there is going to be increases if you import poor refugees from a war zone, there is no denying that. But scale is important, just saying something went up isn't the whole story, especially when trying to generalize millions of people. C'mon "Hordes of violent invaders"??

        On 4 December 2005, a fight broke out between a group of volunteer surf lifesavers and youths of Middle Eastern descent. These incidents were widely commented on in the Sydney media and are considered to be a key factor in a racially motivated confrontation the following weekend.

       Notice the slanting done on this, Aussie stuff is all lined up very clearly while Muslim offenses are completely left out of the timeline, only reported when talking about injuries that happened to Aussies (which are extremely violent, stabbings, etc.). Otherwise on the official Wikipedia timeline you’d think only Aussies attacked Muzzies

       I've removed myself from political "walkthisline".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I can do whatever I want and have no-one telling me I did wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I heard from the Democrats I was aligned with in the 90's that helping the homeless does not help them get off the streets. So I left and became a Fiscal-Conservative with Liberal tendencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then I found out that the majority of our Reps support the growth of the empire at the behest of the lives of innocent women and children of other nations,
       <strong>
        for resources
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So I came to the conclusion that the only way I to keep myself from feeling like a murderer, was to turn against the murderers. Even if that means turning away from my government to protect the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        From enemies both foreign and Domestic.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, the enemy to a free people resides in the Free Peoples government. Trying to destroy US from the inside-out!

       History has shown that the people screaming about “invaders” and that spend day and night casting the people against each other are usually the ones with sinister motives.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, you’re looking all around for explanations when the scheme is right in front of you. People who are poisoning your mind against your neighbors, co-workers, friends, family and everyday people around you and have you utterly convinced THEY are the bad guys are the ones you need to be on alert against.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean really, do you see how stupid it is to sit there and listen to some mega rich fuck blame all your woes on some poor people, fleeing from God knows what calamity, with all their worldly belongings on their back and in their pockets for all your ills... like THEY’RE the ones stealing your 401k? Or foreclosing on your house?

       Nationalism is such a useful tool to use on idiots. You can literally rob people blind and fuck em sideways and make them feel proud of it the entire time you’re doing it. And the best part is, once the morons wise up and figure it out, they’re so embarrassed they let it all happen they just double down on their beliefs.

       I think it's localized government. As minimal as possible with people just doing the work needed. With globalization there still needs to be an international network of governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Legitimate nationalizing of resources is needed to take society to the next level. A legit government that uses profits and puts it directly back into the society bank. Not socialism. A democraticly controlled government where almost no taxing would be needed. Between government taxes, debt, and profit margins we are creating a huge excess of labour and goods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about what a piece of wood cost to get to you. How many companies touch that wood and how many times is it taxed. Then you pay for it with a form of debt. Through imaginary math that is economics 1 hour of actual labour is turned into 10-20 hours of labour. Mind you I look at money as directly correlated to labour.

       Obviously this is not a perfect solution but please stop talking like there is no hope. That is the ultimate lie.

       The western world is comprised of individual nations, many of which have had nothing to do with said wars, yet have to apparently shoulder the responsibility of the immigrant flood.
Saying 'the western world' is responsible for the shitty situation is as intellectually dishonest as claiming all rapes are made by arabs.

       i agree that there are a handful of western nations that have no direct responsibility for said wars. i suppose the United States should really be shouldering most of the responsibility here eh?

      <p>
       and hell, you're right about that intellectual dishonesty too. i just wish everyone would put more nuance into the situation. the solution lies deeper than "let everyone in" or "let no one in." but i still think the latter view tends to be clouded in xenophobia and a touch of white supremacy.

       If you had secretly controlled Europe, i would say you've lost Control over it.
Brexit, Front National, AFD and UKIP growing, different opinions within the EU. Catalans going for independence, Greece still in a miserable economic Situation,etc.
Yes then it makes sense to push the situation towards escalation and throw in some migrants, to get rid of the governments that don't follow you anymore.

       The easiest way to put it is: humans are pretty terrible, especially the ones that are attracted to the cesspit of power and corruption that is government. We've seen too many governments plunder and pillage their way through their own people and across the world. There are good governments and there are bad governments. Do you really think the good guys would get to the top? That's why governments become corrupt and evil in the first place, because the bad ones are the ones who are willing to play ball to get to the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       A one world government is just asking for the most predatory and depraved to rule over us.

       lol are you serious?  Would a one world government be some kind of a democracy?  If not, then obviously that's bad.  If it would be some kind of democracy, and if there are no borders, then everyone from poor (nonwhite) countries would flood into the rich (white) countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at China and India. Together they make up 35% of the world's population.  If your country is made up mostly of Indian people, Indian workers, Indian voters, then guess what, you pretty much live in India.  Laws are made by people, and a one world government would either be totalitarian, or mob rule, and unless your Chinese/Indian, than mob rule won't be very fun for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have news for you that you might not have learned in your gender studies class.  The rest of the world outside of white Christian nations for the most part doesn't value free speech, doesn't value property rights, doesn't value innocent until proven guilty, etc.  If you want the entire world to collectively form a government because it would be awesome, then why not just go move to China?  Because that's probably pretty close to what it would be like.

       I did answer your question.  The government of China is comprised of Chinese people.  The government of Canada is comprised of Canadians.  The government of Bolivia is comprised of Bolivians.  Under a world government, the government will be comprised of a people who don't share your language, culture, or religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does the world government allow gay marriage?  If so, good luck telling people in the middle east that.  If not, good luck telling people in France that.  Does the world government allow people to own guns?  If so, good luck explaining that to the Japanese.  If not, good luck explaining that to the Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe the world government has different laws for different regions, based upon the peoples and their cultures and customs?  Maybe you can even draw an invisible line around these groups of people based on culture, and allow them to form their own governments and laws.  We can call these things "countries."
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, do you really need someone to explain to you why Sweden has different laws than Yemen?
      </p>
      <p>
       To deny the importance of allowing ethnic people to govern themselves is to deny the importance of their ethnicity.  If you want to see how a "world government" looks on a smaller scale, look at the European Union.   A bunch of elites in Belgium get to decide that people in the countryside of England will live with savages from the Middle East.  Forget about the fact that they culturally are nothing alike.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I have some questions for you?  Who would a world government benefit?  Who would it hurt?  Do you believe culture/language/religion is important?  Do you believe it is meaningless?  Do you believe the world would be a better place if the Soviet Union was the world government?  What about Nazi Germany being the world government?  What about the current US government being the world government?  What about Putin?  China?  Mexico?
      </p>
      <p>
       How would one government even make a set of laws that could apply to both Iceland and Saudi Arabia?  Either you are completely delusional, or you are really advocating for open borders and the elimination and homogenization of all ethnicities on earth, which means you're really advocating Communism.  Yea I'm sure Communism on a worldwide scale will turn out great.

       Totally agree I'm in New England. I don't share a language or culture with people from Los Angeles anymore than I do with someone from Germany. I'm closer to Canadian than I am the vast majority of other Americans. Just saying, a one world government is just as flawed as a national one, only on a smaller scale.

       So you want division, such as borders and countries. Why pretend that "TPTB" want to divide us when you're perfectly happy with the divisions that currently exist. You just like living in the exploiting country and not the exploited country, even if you're still exploited yourself. You blame immigrants for your alienation from society (and therefore claim society is in decay) but the reality is that you , just like the immigrants are workers who's labour they can exploit and a consumer who's wealth they can extract. Maintaining these imaginary divisions like borders is just a way to keep the exploited fighting each other instead of the real fucking enemy

       It's about creating as much chaos as possible, so that the people

        demand

       a solution of a one world government. A new world order. That's the end game.

       When shit goes south, people tend to demand local rule though. They will tend to stick to tribalism and trust other people like them, far more than some bureaucrat on the other side of the globe. In fact if you want take power away from the people, you want them to feel safe and satiated, not under immediate threat. Then they will not care. So if you want world government, chaos is your enemy. What you need is order, or, failing that, a common external threat.

       Imo, what happened is western countries realised they cannot, demographically speaking, fight the high casualty conflict they think might be coming. A rather well-off society with 1-2 son households will absolutely collapse and revolt when coffins start coming in by the tens of thousands. It needs fighting age males with no strong family ties into the voting population. Guess who they're bringing in by the boatload? Why would they expect the newcomers to have enough loyalty or gratitude to fight for their newfound homelands is anyone's guess, but, most likely, nobody is planning to ask for their opinion.

       Put another way - If you secretly controlled Europe and the Western world and you wanted to remove all cultural and national obstacles to a global &amp; homogenous market, wouldnt it make sense to let in hordes of people and then using identity politics suppress any criticism of your plan and educate the local population to despise their own culture therefore removing those barriers. Wait a few decades and the ultimate serf/consumer is born with no sense of identity other then that provided by their masters.

       what? that doesn't answer my question lol. you say globalism would lead to people with imposed identities, but that's exactly what nationalism is. without nationalism, people would be free to be who they want to be rather than who their culture dictates they should be.

       This sub is hopeless. It's no wonder the dumbest fucking conspiracy are accepted here because the dumbest most gullible idiots are here. Let's just ignore the capitalist and geopolitical interests of Western nations in the middle East which has led to war and mass displacement of people from their homes and mostly relocated to other middle Eastern countries with a small percentage relocated to Western countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's ignore all that and just claim these new refugees are violent hordes sent to our societies to destroy them under some vague understanding of globalism. The goal here is to turn us against a new scapegoat while ignoring the ruling class is using us all as pawn to further capitalist extraction of wealth. But fuck that, can't talk about capitalism here. Or the fact that the only real war going on is class war. No, let's pretend it's a fucking culture war so us plebs can fight each other while the capitalists continue to suck us dry like the vampires they are

       Except these divisions are based upon dramatic differences in world view, including but not limited to the political process, government structure, legal framework of civic and criminal code, cultural heritage, political and metaphysical ideology etc. There are immense differences in the way of life of these people, and the people living there have the right to control whether they preserve their way of life or let it fall to the wayside to serve an ideology.

       To paraphrase Mao Zedong, a 20th century communist guerrilla fighter who eventually took over and ruled over China, you should love your enemy, for they will provide you with the means to defeat them.
      </p>
      <p>
       See, for a smart revolutionary, you'd take in some of the more isolated and unsure "violent invaders", and feed them, befriend them, train them in how to rise up and fight the system you hated. Then you'd have an expendable, but expedient, army of mercenaries that would work for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rich don't know what they're doing. Many people are scared of that realization, so they'd rather believe they're much smarter and better than they truly are.

       They don't need immigrants to divide people. There's always race, politics, religion, class without mass immigration. This immigration thing is so the 1% can depress wages further. No longer will slave labour be confined to the 'third world', it will be everywhere pretty soon. Welcome to our world.

       Because Germany's population was declining and in capitalism you need never ending growth, but it's hard to do that with a shrinking workforce. Germany took in more refugees for economic reasons not because Merkel is in some cult to destabilize Europe by letting in "violent hordes"

       Because, like I said, I understand the intricacies of these viewpoints. I see exactly where it breaks down. Even then, it's mostly oriented as "every Jew is capable or complacent with this evil goal of world domination." It's simply anti semitic. Forget the Soros shit, look into the Rothschild's conspiracies if you want the juicy shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall point is, this shit is peddled by right wingers who want the average Joe to ignore all of the historical evidence as to how they're being fucked for money.

       Absolutely correct. I thought when the 99% ordeal happened it would fucking solve something. Nope.
