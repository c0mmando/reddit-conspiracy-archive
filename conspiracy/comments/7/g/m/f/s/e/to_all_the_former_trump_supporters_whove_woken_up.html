       Edit: the weirdest thing... I had up to about 60 pts, and now back down to 25? Seems like i got heavily brigaded. But from where...
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally know dozens of former Trump supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       You saw through all the Russian troll posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       You saw through all the lies that Trump &amp; Co. is.
      </p>
      <p>
       You left a cult, something you had invested a lot of time, money, and given up friends and family to pursue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've left a cult before.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was painful.
      </p>
      <p>
       I couldn't believe i had been deceived by the cult leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their conspiracies to brainwash us, and turn us into lifelong believers were the very poison we had thought we were fighting against.
      </p>
      <p>
       I applaud every one of you.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a former cult follower, i know your pain. You're not alone. You are still strong.

       There is R/Trumpgret subreddit and his approval rating is extremely low. Of the 20 some odd people I know that voted for Trump there is 2 who are still okay with him, they're both slowly being disenfranchised as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ever even attempted to disprove your own beliefs maybe you would understand why he's not going to do anything to help you, but this is Reddit so I assume not. Just, man, try to keep it together when he's Impeached next year okay? Maybe practice counting backward from 10, that helps a lot.

       that is absolutely false. they found a microscopic particle of molybdenum in some dust.
      </p>
      <p>
       guess what? 316 structural steel (which the towers were made of) is an alloy that contains molybdenum. that's where it came from. it wasn't like a big chunk of the stuff that melted into a puddle of something.

       I’m noting on a remarkable trend i’ve witnessed on this sub where pro-government/pro-state waves of users are swarming all over and controlling (or attempting to control) the narrative. I came here SPECIFICALLY because I wanted to see you guys sitting on new. I’ve been coming through new periodically observing this because I kept telling myself “couldn’t be”.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if anyone else wants to experiment with it, I invite you to do so. Just drop in to the new and watch what gets upvoted, what’s allowed to pass through harmlessly and what gets targeted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve seen this:
Pro trump/right wing news and propaganda is upvoted and allowed to flow up. Sometimes it’s garbage and fizzles up, sometimes it’s good stuff that makes FP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neutral shit, like aliens, viruses, mind control, church abuse, “classic” conspiracy floats through harmlessly. It fizzles out quickly though to make room for the propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anti-trump/anti state. This shit gets downvoted heavily within MINUTES. Comment bots/accounts get activated no matter what time of day to harass, taunt and intimidate the poster. Occasionaly, mods will remove the post for some arbitrary reason (ie “no memes”— despite literal Ben Garrison cartoons, pics with text and Trump tweets routinely making FP). The ONLY time anti trump stuff gets to the FP is when the news is so acrid that people manage to overcome the initial downvote wave. And even then, it’s controversial as fuck and you can see the battle in the upvote percentage.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to see actual community opinions, the comments are best. It explains why so much pro trump right wing propaganda is upvoted to FP here and the comments are so against it. Comments are harder to shut down and stifle. The posts you can bury easily with 10 downvotes in 5 minutes and, unless it’s exceptional, it won’t see the light of day.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s some fishy, coordinated stuff going on here. And it probably has a lot to do with brigading and coordinated vote manipulation. Remember when u/fishnet or whatever that disgraced mod was called cried he had evidence of “brigading” but never released anything? Probably because, while there is brigading from r/politics and r/topminds .... it probably pales in comparison to the brigading coming in from r/t_d crosspostere.

       People are going to come from all over to push an agenda. Rather than throw out accusations of shilling, post statistics. It's far more difficult to argue against a quantitative argument than a qualitative argument.

       Also, this is a shitpost. There's no conspiracy here. It should rightfully be downvoted. And yet, there it is, with no conspiracy, on the front page of this sub.

      <p>
       I'd say your comment is a drawn out explanation of your confirmation bias. There's plenty of anti Trump shit that hits the front page when it's not inaccurate or a shitpost.

       It’s not a conspiracy. There’s so much anti-trump stuff posted, it floods new and controversial every day. Of course it gets a lot of traction and, in return, a lot of response.

       While you’re riding your high horse, so sure that there are 3 dudes somewhere controlling all narrative about politics, keep in mind that the vote one year ago was divided almost 50/50. It’s not just a few people; about half the country disagrees with your opinion (same for the other side).

       Not half the country. 45% of people who voted.... which was maybe half the country. So... i mean, just saying, if you’re using that logic... it’s more like 25% support AT BEST.

       As for the anti-trump comment, I was speaking about Reddit in general. Front page, sort by new or controversial, every morning it’s about 20% pro, 60% against, and 20% non-political.

       This is such a tired talking point. It's just blatantly false.
      </p>
      <p>
       The polls last year were fine. They were accurate. The results were within the margin of error basically everywhere. What was not accurate was the interpretation of those polls by some people (although 538 was pretty spot-on). Also, that's not how statistics work. If you predict there's a 1% chance of something happening and it happens, that says
       <em>
        literally nothing
       </em>
       about the accuracy of your prediction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusion: there is literally not a single valid argument for saying "polls suck" based on last years election.

       I’ve always said polls suck. If you like polls, fine, keep liking them. Not my fault you think a small sample taken by some random out of touch dudes can somehow represent a broad population. Your poll was wrong? “Oh it’s within the margin of error.” I’m going to start balancing my bank account within a +-50% margin of error.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nate was the only one that said “Trump has a chance here” and was blasted for it. All the polls were so far in Hillary’s favor, no one could believe the single poll that kept tipping trump’s direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get calls all the time from pollsters. They constantly ask me shit like who I’ll vote for between trump and Hillary (neither). Independents are virtually ignored in the polling I get.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who are so confident in trump’s abysmal ratings are going to be shocked when we elect that moron AGAIN. Keep sitting back being so confident of those numbers, just like before, and watch it happen.

       Trump is almost universally hated. You would have to dismiss ALL the polls, ALL the people, ALL the news, ALL the everything in order to construct yourself a little world where that guy is actually popular.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is AS hated as Bush... if not more. And it’s only his first year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the polls didn’t suck. The polls told us pretty much exactly what happened. See any poll 2-3 days before the election and they were more or less right on the money.

       And guess what those polls predicted it correctly. They just couldnt factor in the electoral college. Look at the vote totals compared to the pre-election polls and you will see they are not far off. 40 out of 45 presidents predicting the popular vote lets you figure out who will be president. So no its not some grand conspiracy to crown Clinton before the election. It was just normal pre-election predictions.

       i'd argue that people who didn't vote at all are probably more likely to be supportive of Trump than not... I mean, they already don't give a shit about politics as they aren't voting. Why would they care if it's Trump or anybody else - the reason they don't vote is because they already acknowledge it's all corrupt?

       Trump’s approval rating at inauguration was 48%. The same percent as the vote he won. It’s at 37% now. No where near half the country disagrees with op’s opinion. Barely over a third. It’s funny in a sub dedicated to conspiracy you’re unwilling to look at the very real possibility there is a conspiracy to control the dialog here. Especially with all the known Russian influence on social media and forums.

       It’s also funny that by your own numbers (which I won’t bother disputing, because I don’t need to do that to prove my point), you think it’s impossible for this to be anything besides a conspiracy of the few when there are literally over 100 million people in your quoted 37% figure.

       I support Trump and browse rising and new because it's the only place organic content can be seen in this sub for long stretches. And yes, I down vote nonsense like this because it's simply an attempt to stir the pot and has 0 to do with a conspiracy.

       Lol, last year trump supporters accused of the left of spamming with shill accounts, and they said that's impossible.

       There's also the possibility that the majority of People who followed this sub were Trump supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/conspiracy gets berated just as much as Trump supporters. If you follow the default subs as intensely as you seem to follow this sub, you'll notice T_D, conspiracy and Rick and Morty fans are constantly belittled and told they are idiots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gee wiz... I wonder if a few of them could be the same people? Do people actually have  more than one interest? That's an r/conspiracy we should look into!

       I’m sure you’re right. But only to an extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that a wide swath of this subs users are “super pro-government, pro-authoritarian when it’s my agenda” is either laughable... or depressing.
      </p>
      <p>
       My impression is that this sub is full of people who don’t trust ANY authority or anyone in power. Speckled in there, however, are the people who are like you say, those who
       <em>
        use
       </em>
       this place and it’s users to advance their political interests and visions.

       I think youre confusing what your idea of a conspiracy theorist is with what the people who believe in conspiracy actually are.
      </p>
      <p>
       To assume the people that are in this sub are basement dwelling off the grid anarchists with a collection of tin foil hats and hentai posters on the wall is to assume that your friends, co-workers and family aren't capable of conspiracy.

       I have followed this sub since I joined Reddit. I have noticed an uptick in political posts as with
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       off Reddit, but to imagine this sub has done anything other than attract people of a like mind (the intention of subreddits) is to assume people wander here just to pick political fights.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's ok to be skeptical of your government and support one or more politicians. Especially when that person is doing things that impact your life in a positive way.

       There's nothing wrong with this country. All tangible metrics are through the roof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Polls are showing Trump isn't a likeable guy? Dang, too bad we can't vote to change his personality...
      </p>
      <p>
       Stocks are up. Foreign relations with the
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       power players are up. Taxes are going down. The $1200/mo for Health Care I pay is going down to abround 300. The economy is booming.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this country's success was based on the feels, we'd be fucked. Luckily it's based on legislation, taxes, bills, cash flow and trading.

       Wrong. Read this and then tell me they’re not getting anything through. You and other Trump haters assume that he’s an idiot and nothing is being done, meanwhile the courts are being filled with his judicial picks at a historic rate.

       How many pieces of legislation and tax bills has Trump been part of passing since he took office? 2017 economic performance is based on legislation enacted under Obama. As far as I can tell, "feels" is literally all you base your worldview on

       Obama wasn't immune to criticism on nearly the level that trump is. Right now about 1/3 of this country will literally justify anything trump says or does, even if it's completely flip flopping on what he campaigned on. Did anyone think he'd be able to get all of his supporters to rally AGAINST net neutrality or FOR tax cuts for Wall Street? Anyone who has the ability to step outside this situation can see how crazy it is. This IS a cult. Trump is the personality, and the Republican party is just taking advantage of it at this point.

       Immune from criticism? Trump? What are you talking about you ignoramus you? Anytime trump says a word he is labeled as racist, CNN reports his twitterfeed on an hourly basis explaining to the masses that he"must be stopped", that his impeachment is imminent, and that he was elected because of some  white national conspiracy or because putin wanted him there. What cult figure would allow that sort of criticism, the demagogue Obama certainly never allowed that. Hell evens networks that are supposed to not even be political shit on trump when just years ago they sucked obama's mostly white dick (see ESPN). Liberals hate any threat to their aspiring socialist utopia that Obama spearheaded and that Bernie was supposed to throw into overdrive, now that trump is deregulating, everyone on the left who controls the media is ad honineming anyway they can to stop the mad man who is ruining their good time

       There are blind followers behind every politician, but because u are a leftist you  think that trump is some unique figure. The point is when Obama was in office, the media was part of that blind following, and now that the president isnt a fully pledged leftist, they cry everyday that the sky is falling, and idiots like you believe them

       Right. It's not like we as individuals just get to pick a president. We get two choices. Would I have picked Trump if a vote if someone I really wanted to be President was actually an option? Of course not. But if anyone actually thinks Hillary was a better choice, then I don't know what the hell they're even doing in a conspiracy sub.

       I wouldn't consider myself in the Hillary cult, but I did vote for her. I was going to abstain but I knew I would never forgive myself if I didn't vote and Trump won. Now I can at least sleep at night.

       You're kidding right, every economic metric was improving. The country was on life support in 2008, when it was under global collapse and running &gt;trillion dollar deficits. Since then millions more have health insurance, unemployment is back to normal levels, the stock market was at all time highs well before Trump ran for President.

       Trump was the first chance to get a real outsider who hates what the govt has become. He is such an anti-establishment pres he got a nod from Johnny Rotten himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact most of the people who hate him are total crap themselves. Not only can I root for a guy who really seems to be lookimg out, we can watch Hollywood and the Press cry everyday. Ive got a surplus of tears to drink and all these shills just remind me to stay hydrated.

       Look im not pro-trump or anti trump. politics is a facade, but use your brain. it is reasonable for someone to question someone elses birth origin if one of their parents are completely out of the picture. hilary clinton has a lineage that can be traced, ya goof. i don't see how race plays a role and why you are so focused on it.

       And even after he showed his birth certificate? Trump says he didn't, but he kept up questioning it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember his investigators in Hawaii finding "very interesting things"? Turns out, Trump lied and there wasn't anything interesting to uncover.

       My original question was how was it racist. I got my answer. apparently its because hes black and has a funny name. either way all of our presidents suck and questioning birth certificates isn't going to get us anywhere i guess.

       It wasn't just the questioning, it was how it continued until, for the first time ever, a President was forced to "prove" his birth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump also questioned his school enrollment and grades.
      </p>
      <p>
       And after proving it, he still questioned his birth. Then he acted like he was the one who "solved" it and out it to rest even though he continued it after Obama gave proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, he won't even show his tax returns. Something every previous president in modern history has done.

       I did my care if you think I'm lying. I explained the color of my skin because there are plenty of people that are native, but aren't affected by discrimination because they appear white. I said that because I've been mistaken as a Mexican, and I've been called a beaner etc. It was to prove a point. That I've been affected by racism, yet still don't adhere to the identity politics, victimhood propaganda "the left" shoves down our throats.

       For fucks sake, I brought up Hillary because she was the OTHER CHOICE that might have won the election. And I'm still glad she's not president. I don't like Trump, but at least it wasn't the alternative.

       Nope, I never assume your gender clown. I don't care if you claim to be a man, woman, it, or a thing. Unlike you I don't go around judging a person base on the color of their skin.

       This is the Internet dude.  Anybody can claim to be anything they want too.  You can claim to be a Native American all you want too. But just because you "I am a Native American" doesn't make is true.  If your really are a Native American then you should be able to prove it with no trouble at all.

       No, what racist is you claiming to be a Native American. If you're a Native American then prove it!  Either put up or shut up with your ridiculous claims.  Nobody is going to believe you until you show us evidence that your a Native American.  Once you show us evidence then we start to believe you on the sub.

       No knucklhead, I'm trying to make you post evidence for your claim. if your really a Native American.  Then you should be able to prove it with no problem at all.  Show far you have been unable to show us any evidence for your wild claims.

       Lol. That's because they all want to be "victims." That's what identity politics does to a society. And it's pretty racist to want "proof" of someone's race. Do you tell white people to prove they're white before you believe them? No? Didn't think so. You might want to reflect on why that is.

       No, it's not racist to ask for evidence. When somebody makes a claim it becomes their job to PROVE IT!  If you're really a Native America then prove it by providing evidence for your claims. Once you give out evidence for your wild claims.   Then'll we start to believe your ridiculous claims.

It's just an attempt to discredit my opinions because that's all you have. Your rabid anti Trump hate blinds you to the insanity of your behavior. You don't see how racist that in itself is.

       Fred Trump lied about being Swedish instead of German to make real estate deals with Jewish people easier. Donald Trump continued this lie in
       <em>
        The Art of the Deal
       </em>
       , years after it would have stopped mattering. So now he lies just to lie after his daddy liked to advance his career.

       I'm not championing anyone. I'm saying the alternative was Hillary. And that alternative was much worse. I'd rather have the devil I don't know than the devil I do in this situation. Hillary already had decades in politics to prove how corrupt, flip flopping, shady, war mongering and psychopathic she is.

         He was calling for the health penalty for a couple black men he publicly convicted of a crime way back in 1989. They were later overturned on DNA evidence and he basically said, "don't care, they did it".

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Betwren 73 and 83, He and Fred Trump were caught twice discriminating against blacks looking to rent in his buildings. It was as simple as this, a black couple applied and was denied at the meeting in person, they gave their paperwork to a white couple to resubmit, and the white couple was given the apartment, and it was denied the moment the black couple came in to sign the final paperwork.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         At his casino in 1992, he satisfied the racist whims of high roller who asked that he remove a black card dealer and the casino was legally penalized for this.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In 1993, he was upset that Native Americans were opening a casino that would end up being competition for his casino and he testified, "They don't look like Indians to me" to try and baselessly void their heritage.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In 2000, he was fined for secretly funding ads that countered a Native American gambling proposal by showing Native Americans doing coke and syringes and said, "Are these the neighbors we want?" Meanwhile, he clearly has no issue with gambling, casinos, or what they bring to a neighborhood. He just didn't want competition and used racist bullshit to turn people.

       Fuck this fucking lie that no one called Donald Trump a racist before he ran for President. I live in New York, we've known about this idiot from before he got famous for his tabloit womanizing and marriages falling apart. He's always been an asshole racist and people have always called him on it, including multiple times he was fined money for being a racist asshole.

       Nice lie. That's just objectively, 100% false. I can't imagine that you're stupid enough to actually believe it, because there is a

       Trump has been accused of racism since the fucking 80s. Remember the lawsuit against him for housing discrimination? The central park five?

       Are you fucking kidding me with this shit? The first time Trump ever came into the public consciousness was when the family real estate business was caught discriminating against blacks in their housing developments. That was the late 70's.

       I went from sanders to trump and kept dem party affiliation to continue voting for young non-radical progressives over establishment neocons. If they don't win I simply go back to republican in the head-to-head generals. I grew up thinking that the republicans were awful because iraq was wrongful, and then watched libya and syria happen which are arguably worse in many ways. If anything it's the feminists who defend HRC in spite of her anti-woman/anti-gay history that are the cult because they wanted her to win at all costs on the basis of her gender and still think that she lost because if sexism and not the aforementioned.

       Some of us Women saw through the bullshit msm was proposing to exploit our minds. HRC for the women and the minorities. HRC isn’t for anyone or anything but herself. I hoped Sanders would have gotten the ticket but we all see how that played out. Trump was a wild card. Who knew what he was going to do. It was still a better bet than her. Any given day.

       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPtj6dmbORA">
        this
       </a>
       and think that she was their champion? That was in 2004 when she was running for senator. By 2007 she had flipped because Obama was pro-gay. Meanwhile, the "unbiased" media not only didn't play this clip one time in 2016, but they brought in as many "columnists" as they could to pull things out of thin air to make Trump look anti-gay when they had nothing on him. It's the media and their globalists financiers that are our biggest enemy.

       I'll give you Mercer, but he's already spent hundreds of thousands more than he would make in a tax cut. It seems he's more of a political activist than you're giving him credit for.

       Look at the analysis. The tax cuts for rich people is enormous and permanent, the other tax cuts are temporary and short-lived. Anyone making less than $100k is ultimately going to see a tax
       <strong>
        hike.
       </strong>
       (Even including dynamic effects on businesses.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that liberal rich people are against the plan for cutting their taxes while Trump lies and says it will raise his taxes
       <em>
        should

       tell you something who has people's interests in mind.

       I did look at it. Most of the numbers the left is using assumes that the average person is maxing out their line item deductions, which 90% of the middle and lower class do not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love to see your math because you are making assumptions based on the same premise. The lowest income individuals pay nothing in taxes with a standard $25k deduction (double if you're married). There's no way a 0 percent tax rate is comparable to the reduction made to upper class individuals.

       Just so we're on the same page, this is a distribution of tax decreases. I don't see this document on the
       <a href="https://www.jct.gov/">
        Joint Committee on Taxation's website
       </a>
       but I'll argue the points being made anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's misleading to compare the value difference of taxes between different brackets. If you're paying less that $500 in taxes at the lowest end, you're never going to be in the lowest category even if youre now paying nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the flip side, you see 80% of the top bracket are getting &gt;$500 reduction in taxes. Realistically that's a drop in the bucket of what they're paying in taxes and isn't a useful measure. Even then, 20% are still paying more in taxes, which goes up to 35% by 2027. If we wanted an actual understanding of the tax change we would need more statistical data than what is provided.
      </p>
      <p>
       To go on, your number of wealthy individuals receiving tax cuts drops at every 2 year mark. So Trump is in fact raising taxes on the wealthy like he says he is. I'm not sure how they're projecting the changes to lower classes in future years because the bottom 5 classes should be dropping more than that. The only thing I can assume is that they're comparing year to year differences which is why the lower/middle class would begin sliding to the middle category.

       Sure, it's all we have and this is the most comprehensive analysis available.

       You missed my initial argument. Income tax inherently costs you more money (in actual dollars like your chart describes, not a percentage of their income) the more money you make. Its impossible for people who currently pay less than $500 to ever see a tax decrease greater than $500. If you're paying a couple thousand dollars or tens of thousands, its going to be incredibly easier to hit that $500 mark in tax decreases.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person could go from $499 to 0 in the first category and a wealthier individual could go from $10,000 to $9,499 and your chart would make it look like the wealthier individual is getting a better deal. In reality, the poorer person is now paying 100% less in taxes and the wealthier individual is paying 5% less in taxes.

       Your chart isn't measuring a percent of income change. Its 80% of people in that bracket that would pay $500 less. Once again, this is only significant if you know the tax value and their wealth.

       Duh. It's not relevant because you have no prior reason to expect an asymmetric distribution on the decrease side but not the increase side. Lacking further information, you should assume that both sides are uniformly distributed in the $100-500 columns, and have some fat tail in the over $500 columns. Either way, you have no reason to expect asymmetry.

       Obviously. What the JCT's data shows is that
       <strong>
        more people making under $75k will see their taxes go up than will go down.

       Period. You're essentially trying to dance around this fact by arguing that the mean change could be different, but that's irrelevant.

       Whenever I see characters like this I like to imagine that they come from main reddit where it's a complete echo chamber and see that you actually have to coexist with supporters of all political ideologies here and
       <em>
        freak out
       </em>
       and try to turn it into a political battle when we're all just trying to focus on the conspiracies that can't be discussed anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really a testament to how good the mod team is on here. They allow both crossposts from r/politics and r/thedonald and have moderators from both ideologies. Name one other subreddit where that's the case.

       Perfectly said. Thing is, most lefties want nothing to do w tinfoil. They're either centrist/independent, or right wing.

       I'm a former Trump supporter.  Not because of any obvious political reason.  It's because NASA is lying to us and he knows it.  Trump is supporting them and not calling out.  He's part of a larger deception going on about the nature of our reality.

       I believe an apathetic public is easier to control and easier to  hide new bills and laws from.  I feel like you, but I will not let my frustration take away my vote.  My vote, however, may not go to one of the two parties.  For better or worse, I guess.

       Cool, I don't want to see another person have their vote taken away by what I consider manufactured divides and the resulting apathy.  I wish more people voted.  Perhaps if the roughly 45% of our electorate who do not vote actually did vote, a third party could start to get some real traction, some funding, and be part of debates.  At the very least, the platforms of both parties would be impacted and hopefully in a good way.

       What has his cabinet done so far, that concerns you? I don't typically form opinions based on "connections" to past companies.

       Trump isn't doing the dividing. It's the people that have convinced themselves that all their negative adjectives are bulletproof arguments, proving that he is some kind of evil human. Actual evidece (aka reality) shows otherwise.

       It was low hanging fruit.  It was not ratified by congress yet and even the democrats did not like it.  The republicans would have all voted no just because it was an Obama thing anyways, but I'm sure they also disliked it for the same reasons democrats did.  Considering the majority of congress is held by republicans it was never going to get anywhere.  Killing it before it got to them was way to easy a target for Trump.  Makes him look good on both sides and I'm glad we didn't have to waste time with it in congress.  It had some good things, but it had some really shitty things too.  Most notably those using child and slave labor were given a pass on it so they could be a part of TPP.

       TPP is a really complicated piece of legislation. Maybe it would have maybe it wouldn’t have, but the reason he killed it was strictly because Obama wrote it. Nothing else.

        the Telegraph's electoral college vote tracker showed that Clinton was predicted to win 206 electoral college votes while Trump was expected to get 164.

       Last RCP average had Clinton up 3.2%, she won with 2.1%, difference of 1.1%, well within the margin of error.

       Since you, and only you, are using electoral college I was able to pick 47 of 50 states November 9th correctly strictly off polls, the three I got wrong were PA, MI and WI.

      <p>
       Wisconsin was the huge miss, and didn't have any polls conducted in the last week after the Comey letter was released. So, yes Wisconsin polls were horribly off, the rest were within the margin of error, and national polls were very close.

       That's right, there is.  The polls projected that Hillary would win the electoral college resoundingly.  I've even linked you to a very clear example.
      </p>

       Here you're really just attempting to rewrite the history of the 2016 election and assert that the polls weren't wildly off.  They were, and I can link you to a plethora of examples of media outlets lamenting this reality.  You're gaslighting plain and simple.  Well, you're attempting to at least.

       Trump didn't win Wisconsin by 30 points. He won by 20k votes out of a total of ~3million, or less than one percent. Florida was 1.2%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because they said he chances of winning was 70% doesn't mean they polled her at winning 70% of the vote. The polls basically showed exactly how the election would go, by county, but missed that Trump had better turnout in his base than Hillary did. In Michigan the polls basically missed Macomb County by 5% and expected Wayne and Oakland to have better turnout. If Wayne alone had similar turnout to 2008 than Hillary would have won Michigan.

       No let's go back and forth until we run out. TPP would have shipped jobs out of the country, decent factory middle-class jobs. Do you understand it?
       <br/>
       How are tax cuts a bad thing? The middle-class is getting the tax cuts. I assume you are referring to the tax cuts for the corporations? That's good too, it incentivizes jobs to be made. Or are you talking about how he wants to repeal the death tax? I don't think that's a bad thing, but yes only affects people that have a lot of stuff to leave behind. But saying 'enormous tax cuts' is broad.
       <br/>
       My next thing: Illegal immigration has been reduced immensely, it's good because the next thing to go is the billions spent of financial aid for them. That money can be used elsewhere for the American public.

       I resent that term and yes, the estate tax really only affects a small percentage of americans. I think the entire tax plan is bullshit. I agree with the reduced corporate tax rate, but I don't think it can possibly do any good without a substantial increase in the top personal income tax rate.

       If you read between the lines, all that order does is allow companies working on "infrastructure" projects to bypass environmental regulations. This disproportionately helps large companies (especially oil companies) and does very little to help the average american. It does nothing to raise revenue and does little to create long-term job growth. Not to mention environmental impact and renewing our dependence on fossil fuels

       Technically, the IRS were the ones who stopped requiring people to provide proof of insurance. Granted, this EO enabled them to do that. However, all this does is to further undermine the ACA. The penalties for not carrying insurance were put in place to reduce the price of premiums since it would force healthy people into the insurance market. Without this mechanism, we get exactly what we're seeing now: rapidly rising insurance premiums.

       I would argue that it's absolutely not a good thing for anybody. Sure though, I'll let you have it.

       Withdrawing from the Paris Agreement? That saves the US tons of money that would otherwise go to powerful international organizations. Also it's designed to cripple our energy production, while other major countries do not have to follow. I see the Paris Agreement as a way for other major countries to keep us further from energy independence while also paying out a ton of money to international organizations. I guess I am too cynical or critical to believe the people involved are genuinely concerned with climate change.

        Withdrawing from the Paris Agreement? That saves the US tons of money that would otherwise go to powerful international organizations. Also it's designed to cripple our energy production, while other major countries do not have to follow.

       I see. So you fell for the conservative talking-points and didn't bother to research the subject?

      <p>
       Energy independence isn't our goal and never has been our goal. It's not even sound economic policy since limiting yourself to your own domestic production of energy is monetarily inefficient. Not to mention that it is only really relevant as long as we are using fossil fuels

       Such as? Also, why is that bad? The amount of money involved was absolutely miniscule.

        Next: more healthcare - Removing government subsidies to insurance companies (literally taking money from these people you think he is only looking out for) and allowing for buying insurance across state line (will drive prices down through competition)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Wait, do you really think insurance companies are just going to eat the extra cost from not receiving subsidies? They just withdraw from the marketplaces and force people to try to get insurance on their own. This puts us right back where we were in 2008 when people were clamoring for healthcare reform. I fail to see any research or analogue that would indicate that these new healthcare rules are going to fix the problems of high premiums while still allowing everyone to get coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know why conservatives hate the ACA? Because it keeps them from cutting taxes. They have money. They can afford to buy healthcare regardless. Or do you think this is the one thing that Trump and Paul Ryan have decided to do out of their own benevolence?

       Energy independence does not mean only using your own, but having the ability to do it if needed so you're in better position when negotiating. Well it is relevant as we are still using fossil fuels, just to inform you.

       What about his cabinet? I don't agree with all of his picks, but if we are using the level of wealth someone has as an argument that they are corrupt, I'm going to need some more meat to convince me. Just because someone is wealthy does not automatically mean they are corrupt. I do have a problem with Elaine Chao, but I think Trump did that to put Mitch in a odd position.

       Not all rich people file taxes with 1120s or 1065s. Even if you are an Uber driver, you can incorporate yourself for about $250(can also write that expense off) and file 1120s and get all the same tax breaks that benefit "the richest corporations." Put the vehicle in the company name you created, and write your car payments off to drastically reduce the tax burden.

       The stock market has gained $3+tril since the election. That money is just sitting there. Unless we pass a tax bill, that money will not get reinvested/very little will get reinvested, and that could possibly crash the markets...again..

       It's designed to shoot up to the top of the subreddit and then  get picked up by the r/all brigade. Watch it's going to go to +17k 86% despite starting at +37 56% and will have multi-gilded testimonials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, in the past 10 hours OP has commented "fuck the bible"/"fuck jesus" 3 times,  admitted to having "10 abortions", and basically just crossposts every anti-trump story from r/politics. This is another classic case of someone who is not here for conspiracy, but rather to create noise with the hope that the people who are here to discuss conspiracy will get annoyed and leave to the quieter conspiracy subs and other conspiracy sites in general. Then they can make this another r/resist offshoot.

       TIL that when a post reaches
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       it is 'brigaded' by people from '
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       '.
      </p>

       Seems like
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       is the opposite of a single reddit brigading another, since it's, you know, 'all' the subreddits.

       nothing you described as happening actually happened.

       so are you the kind of person that will re-evaluate why you thought it happen in the first place? or the kind of person who will harbor delusions of grandeur and think "aha! i foiled those pesky soros shills by revealing their plan!"

       If that's the case, let's put all Sandy Hook shit into it's own sub. Obviously get the 9/11 stuff onto it's own sub. The newest Las Vegas shooting, wrap that all up on it's own sub.

       Nah, I don't think that's what I or they were saying. I'm at least still trying to stick it out, but it does mean much of the discussion is going to get buried here.

       I will give the mods kudos for being a bit more hands-off in regards to the "Misleading" tags and post removals whenever new news of the investigation comes out, though. That was pretty bad for a while.

       It's just that you are making a statement with nothing backing it up.  Trump is not a good human being but that doesn't mean it's a cult.  I'm always open to a discussion when evidence is presented.

       I'm not in lockstep with that other guy, I am just sharing the general complaint that too many people on this sub have an agenda and refuse to acknowledge the corruption of their "guy" because it's their guy.

       Being conservative and supporting Trump should not be a mutual requirement.  Liberals had no problem hanging Hillary out to dry.  I wish more conservatives had the stones to do the same with Trump.  I would take Mike Pence in a heartbeat.

       I don't mind pro-Trump people here and explaining their positions on topics, but I do mind the fanatics who defend absolutely everything he does.  For instance I'm a pretty pro-Obama person, but I'm not going to defend his use of drones, or staying in wars we should be out of by now, or pushing for TPP, and so on.  Trump is doing some shitty things, and his base, which frequent this sub don't seem to care.  If his supporters are unable or unwilling to call him out on shitty things he's never going to know they are shitty things and he will continue to do them.

       How do you go about ending wars that are already started? I would like some war advice or more instances of how Trump supporters stick up for Trump no matter what he does.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are always elements to any political party that stick with their leader no matter what. This isn’t new or specific to Trump.. Even though you seem to be reasonable and willing to think for yourself. There were/are plenty of Democrats who are rabid defenders to their cause as well to win power.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are some other shitty things Trump is doing?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t defend them all but hunk he’s done a pretty good job so far with what he’s working with.

       Lmao! You only mention Trump supporters and fail to recognize that you are still a member of the other side of the same cult... stop buying in to partisan politics. If u really want to stop participating in cults, you need to set down some of your bias. Partisan politics is a hydra which you can only the see the heads of, making it appear that each head is a different beast. In reality, they are all one cult with a goal of keeping you enslaved and complacent while feeding the hidden belly that connects them all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even Trump is just a card they burned in order to muscle through some agenda points. Hated charasmatic leaders can be even more effective at advancing agendas than a beloved charasmatic leader. BCL has to do a lot of things under the radar to advance while a HCL can push through unpopular agendas with ease, right out in the open. Meanwhile people unwittingly stop caring how bad policies are getting because their emotional state has them convinced that everything HCL does is going to be bad and so they expect bad policy, which leads to accepting bad policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the next guy runs on the promise to reverse all these new bad policies, gets elected, and allows them to keep chugging along in spite of campaign promises.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever feel like they're just there to entertain you and produce an emotional reaction?

       It doesn't matter as long as you still believe that representative government is a representation of what the people want and need. Nearly EVERY politician is for sale to the highest bidder. If they aren't, there's always someone higher up that is and they'll make sure any conscientious politicians won't advance. By the time you hear their name outside of local elections, they've already been corrupted or outright bought.

       So, you are saying, that we should have elected Clinton, who would have been elected if her lies hadn't been exposed?! Marvelous critical thinking there. And, BTW, the 2 party system is a joke, and it's a corporate party, an oligarch party; neither represents the majority of Americans. We actually are dealing with the lesser of 2 evils in the Trump scenario, and, although it isn't packaged as deceptively comfortable as you might have preferred, electing Clinton would have actually been worse. Many things are now exposed that would not have been. What we need is a workers party, not any more of this illusionary 2 party division bullshit. I'm confused why the public still believes it? Really, Democrats not Republicans care unless the lobbyist pay them to. The real issue we should be campaigning for is money out of politics, End Citizens United. Realize the Democratic party is corrupt as hell please. That Trump is towing the line for all normal Republicans. Both are unappealing.

       This. There are so many Trump voters turning away from him, not the radicals or the loyalists, but the one’s who voted for him based on specific things like Trade or healthcare. The most moderate Trump voters who didn’t want Hillary and now they’re seeing Trump can’t get anything done and have completely abandoned him. The more unhinged Trump gets, the more moderates will turn from him, leaving him only a pack of loyalists which is likely a fraction if his nearly 70m voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump wants those moderates back, he needs to stop throwing them under the bus with these bs policies that only harm them and stop pretending he’s not losing his base. Trying to make your crowds look bigger and inflate yourself as more popular than you are is neglecting the majority of your voters and you’re gonna get raped in the 2018 elections and possibly even the 2020 elections.

       You can hate trump (i am somewhat glad he won) but I will say as an outsider (non US) i can tell you that Hillary probably would have done more damage as she was experienced in doing damage. Trump is just a guy who does nothing so the rest of the world can breath. The USA is fine, still great country bla bla. But the rest of the world needs a break from US action and hillary was all about fucking up other people. So worst of two evils in my opinion..

       As long as people live within the construct of the cave, 
happily "they" create theater,  and in it let you play.
 shadows dancing are your reality, just Like Platos cave. 
The one who points and sees outside a world much alive, 
they are shunned "shilled" and mockingly pushed away,
 for they only see the mental puppet theater. 
every time the shadows grow a little more absurd.
       <br/>
       So here you have the final hand, the feelings are so high,
       <br/>
       at last to end such the comedy divine, 
of course in the end the only card remaining left to play, 
from the cave of shadows joy filled and triumphantly "TRUMP CARD!"
       <br/>
       while from behind walks away alone the one who saw outside, 
hearing people in unison singing the Trump cards praise
 all still staring at the shadows, the shadows in the cave.
WAKE UP! IDIOTS.

       Not duped, never had any illusion he was on any side other than his own. The only reason i voted for him was to watch you SJW's lose your minds, and you did en mass. Everyone, tears and screaming and screeching about impeachment. Worth it. And yall have continued assuring 4 more years. Grats.

       Oh he's a shit bag, no two ways about it, but i knew that going in. The sad part is he's still probably the lesser of two evils as far as he and hillary were concerned. Everyone is mad at trump, but in truth the US brought this on themselves.

       The way you write, the tone, slanted title, and your history here in conspiracy do not, at all, lend ANY loft for you to you APPLAUD anyone from.  You are not on a righteous perch, and to me it seems you are trying to get noticed. Yes, we noticed the fallacies.
Right or wrong, posting this has the hallmarks (even if you are 100% right) of cult preaching, as if this were religious in your delivery. Especially the last bit,
       <em>
        eye roll
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's telling to me that someone who is 'formerly' a cult member may not have any precipitation of unbiased knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       There simply is no actual critical point to this post, other than cheerleading and complaining you are not getting your notice-me-please points.
      </p>
      <p>
       May I suggest a rally sub, or other appropriate arena you can post non-conspiracy posts?

       This is the Internet dude.  Anybody can claim to be anything they want too.  You can claim to be a Native American all you want too. But just because you "I am a Native American" doesn't make is true.  If your really are a Native American then you should be able to prove it with no trouble at all.
