       Can't wait for TopMindsofReddit to get a hold of this one. It was fun asking how many kids Jimmy Savile, Cyril Smith, Sir Edward Heath, Dennis Hastert, Clement Freud, Jeffrey Epstein, and pals had raped. Now they can't say shit. Just sinking ever so slowly into their own discord... as we all know - falsehood is innately self destructive, actually by definition - and what we are witnessing here is the crumbling of an empire... Welcome to the new world... UFO's and Free Energy Tech are coming... They're already here... So many pills...

       And for those of you who consider yourself "educated" and think that "free energy" is a hoax. I regret to inform you of your indoctrination, but i know a guy who can help you out with that. His name was Richard Feynman.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Physicists Richard Feynman and John Wheeler calculated the zero-point radiation of the vacuum to be an order of magnitude greater than nuclear energy, with a single light bulb containing enough energy to boil all the world's oceans.[5] 
According to Quantum Field Theory the universe can be thought of not as isolated particles but continuous fluctuating fields: matter fields, whose quanta are fermions (i.e. leptons and quarks), and force fields, whose quanta are bosons (e.g. photons and gluons). All these fields have zero-point energy.[2] These fluctuating zero-point fields lead to a kind of reintroduction of an aether in physics,[1][3] since some systems can detect the existence of this energy.

       (edit: Think of a 3D space in which the fluctuations of that space, or nodes, cause manifestations into matter, or subatomic "ripples" - now add consciousness as the fundamental field of all fields) - my opinion

       I also was wondering what YOU were doing to wake up your fellow brothers and sisters... this is the time... Bitcoin is a prime example of the death blow the Rothschild's have taken, that and the entire cryptocurrency world system is dissolving their system beneath their feet. It's quite something to behold. I'm really not sure how many people FULLY grasp this concept yet. But... we own the money now guys... well not entirely yet, but bitcoin's fucking the 30th largest currency on earth now - and it's only the beginning - no more fiat Rothschild evil owl money
      </p>
      <p>
       This entails something so much larger than many can grasp... This means a free world... no more IMF... BIS... No more systematic extortion of every country on earth. Repo-ing minerals from 3rd world countries that are eyeballs deep in debt as their children starve... Bombs that cost 2 million each will go to waste as the power players don't own the chessboard anymore... without this demonic venom coursing through the veins of humanity so many things are about to start unraveling it's insane. The true history of earth will be revealed... Just imagine if people TRULY saw what was going on in the Vatican... how quickly they would tear it down... but of course only AFTER checking out the archives and preserving them

       Antarctica's obviously crazy as well - as we know - well at least I'd think. Apparently they've found some high tech from an ancient civ down there and now they're playing around with what the fuck they've found... like
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a7nu0MOsMY">
        here
       </a>
       is the apparent shooting of a giant gun like device they found. Corey Goode, and i'm surprised if you haven't heard of him being in here, is pretty much a deep state agent who's infiltrated Gaia TV. Dark Journalist
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYYl12VXdUw">
        exposes
       </a>
       him pretty hard... His manager has Lucifer's Sigil tattooed on his neck, as well as satanic art on his albums, as well as a pentagram on his hand. Anyways Goode's a "leaker" from Antarctica, better yet a deep state ploy. The point is this, they mix in bullshit with fact so you eat the hook, i mean it's the same humans do to fish. You have something tasty and then next thing you know you've got a giant rusty hook in your face. He's specifically mentioning these devices down there, a gun-like machine. They have the largest internet cable connecting Antarctica and South America now apparently. Of course, all media on this will be subverted, Clif High, master coder, basically can scrunge through the internet data like a hawk and basically picked this bit out... and it matches everything else... dude knew the internet before the internet and bought bitcoin before it was 1 cent... he said it was going to get to 10k earlier this year - as his data sets predict the future - because - omg - humans are psychic as shit... still amazes me how stilll soooo many people don't see this. I mean fuck, don't they know anything about shamanism? Shared Dreams? Lucid Dreams? Near Death Experiences? Synchronicities? Have they never recieved a random call from someone for the first time in years and just so happened to be thinking about them? Dogs knowing when you come home? Precognition?

         Well, I think you can guess where my high octane speculation is going: Lockheed-Martin would not be in Antarctica investigating penguins, nor taking ice core samples, sponsoring seismic studies or investigating Antarctica's many thermal pools and lakes. It's an aeronautics company. Airplanes, conventional and otherwise, are its bailiwick, in addition to data-management and so on and so forth. Did they find some sort of lost ancient high technology there? A crashed flying saucer? No one is saying, and in the absence of any clear indications, then wild and wooly speculations abound.

       You were weak, and then exposed to stories that confirrmed your fears, mixed with pdeudoscience. Any amount of truth to anything in your post is hard to pinpoint. The stuff about Feinmann is ridiculous. UFO's and Anarctica are just paranoid fantasies. The Bitcoin part sounds incredibly naive. But then I'm more negative, and perhaps less insane ;-p

       Lucifer is used once in the Bible and almost certainly is referring to the physical, human King of Babylon, not Satan. These are very clearly two distinct things. They have been colloquially equivocated because of ignorance. Devil? Yes Satan is referred to as a devil. Lucifer? King of Babylon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even many Satanists have no idea this equivocation is bullshit, and those that do still use "Lucifer" in place of "Satan" because it has a less harsh sound that makes their ideology more approachable to non believers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have the whole Demiurge conspiracy which asserts that the Abrahamic God is actually a malevolent spiritual entity, and that the actual creator God is the original God worshiped by early man, which took the form of polytheistic and otherwise Pagan beliefs including Shintoism, Animism, and Buddhism. This "true" spiritual Satan tries to reach out to you however it can, through every religion and spiritual practice available. This is actually a very interesting spirituality to me, seeing as the materialist Satanist philosophy is virtually indistinguishable from the teachings of the Old Testament, in fact morally superior to much of the beliefs of Judaism, where as the spiritual Satanist philosophy is most similar to Taoism and Buddhism.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when I see a Luciferian sigil tattooed on someone's neck, I honestly don't care, they may as well have a cross.

       How is buddhism a pagan belief? You have people who can attain enlightenment and rainbow bodies, fucking put handprints into stone with ease - yeah mind is above matter because mind IS matter - but this isn't just there in Tibet - but south america - here in the USA - aboriginal - everywhere - it's in the blood of humankind - inseparable - indestructible - unmovable - I know of "satan" not even pronounced SATAN and how that's the "good" force - i mean fuck - i need to slap people in the face more often - just call it the great spirit and fucking see it in everything - you wanna be happy? lol there you go - ah i see you said agnostic - i presume no psychic experiences? Hopefully you know James Randi is a Pedophile and Robbed Rupert Sheldrake by lying about data, bullshitting stuff, and not allowing his dog to go on...

       I think you forget we're dealing with the military here... you know the one that housed Micheal Aquino... (?) Know him? Temple of Set? That's where Satan Comes from i'm pretty sure - as isreal is how close to egypt? - very - and how much of their shit's in common? - just about all of it...

       Imagine if we brought Tesla's research into real life application. We would be building our own great pyramids. We are hidden from vibrational and frequency knowledge because we are constantly subdued into low energy energy resonation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The slavery of being trapped in low vibrational energy is being eroded more and more each day. Imagine what our collective consciousness could build if we acted as one.

       Oh Tesla's technology is indeed being used.  I think that's what this pill is.  It's being used to influence, subjugate and even kill people world wide.  Look at the directed energy weapons we already know exist.  Active denial system, lasers, etc.  Now imagine what tricks DARPA has up its' sleeve.

       Counterpoint, me being an economist: Free energy might be the most disruptive technology ever. Releasing it out all at once might destroy the whole planet through the amount of chaos it would create in financial markets.

       I think solar is wind are a good stepping stone towards it. You have to think in terms of decades and centuries when you're running the world.

       I think they will be able to control markets into a smooth transition from one to the other. I expect a global oil price sky rocket (SA VS Iran) in order to force people to start using Teslas (Elon) which our deepstate has been pumping up hardcore. Oil will still be needed for tons of other stuff too, but I suspect they are finally doing something about global warming because that shit is getting real. Trump is pumping up oil usage right now though so SA can go public with their company at high oil prices and exit the oil market financially.

       What a lot of people are forgetting is that wireless electricity powers an entire area, whether it needs to be powered or not. If you don't have the grid to support it, much as Colorado Springs did not in 1899 or whenever Tesla fired up his first wireless electricity transmitter, you blow the grid out.

       Testa was very good at proving things experimentally. It would be very difficult to prove the results of some experiments mathematically. Don't discount someone's hard work and experience because they have studied under an institution. The things that you learn are very real there and can be empirically proven. However, institutions only really teach classical physics at the base level - the more advanced "non-Newtonian" stuff is only available at grad-school level which takes much time, effort, money, and study to have access to and to understand.

       This was already all written about:
      </p>
      <p>
       Rev 17:16  And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whore is the Vatican and it's Luciferian system is being slowly relieved.  The 10 end times kings will help destroy the Vatican and the Anticrhist will rise up at this time and lead the world into a new era of ecumenical "peace".
      </p>
      <p>
       Rev 13:17  And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cryptocurrency is part of the beast's system.  A one world currency that can be used with something that goes inside the body for buying and selling.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way out of all of this is to get saved by the blood of Jesus Christ (this is what they really don't want you to know or believe) by repenting and believing this:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

       The first part of the book was written by people in the bronze age, with a poor understanding of science. Their main goals were "don't take my shit, don't fuck my wife". Then the second part is a collection of stories chosen by a powerful cabal hundreds of years after the supposed events.

       I used to think the same way you did until I actually read the KJV Bible, saw the truth, then believed the gospel and it and it changed my life.  The greatest conspiracy of all is the entire world's efforts to discredit the KJV Bible with false history and especially false science.  The view you are espousing is exactly the results of that.

       Dude, the world is run by people who worship Lucifer.  He rewards them for blood ritual and child sacrifice.  The Catholic church is the actual Church of Satan.   The Elite hide things like discovery of Giants.  There is a chamber under the earth that Hitler was looking for.  Outer Space is fake, and the earth is actually not spinning ball.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all Biblical and would be considered conspiracy.  That's how I ended up taking a look at it in the first place.  The Bible perfectly describes what is goign on right now and where we are heading.

       I got saved by the grace of Jesus Christ about 7 months ago.  I've been searching for truth for many years.  What I found is layers upon layers of deception and hardly any actual truth.  Once you get into the spiritual realm it's exactly the same.  So many layers of deception.  I currently believe the only actual truth we can know is found in the King James Bible as it's the word of God.  Everything needs to be tested against that.  If people say they found bones of Giants, that matches up perfectly.  If people say space is fake, I'm willing to take a look because the Bible has a firmament and things like the moon being it's own light (if you read it honestly and don't bring your own knowledge into it).  What I found is when I tested the world through that lens instead of my own ideas of what was truth everything clicked and made perfect sense.

       The apostle Paul goes over how to get saved.  Jesus was mostly ministering to the Jews who rejected him (clearly)
      </p>
      <p>
       One you must know that you are a sinner.  Every single human in existence is a sinner (besides Jesus Christ).  It helps to know that the punishment for sin is eternal separation in a lake of fire.  Then repent and believe the Gospel which is:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
      </p>
      <p>
       So God himself came to the Earth in the flesh and took your punishment.  He was the final blood sacrifice for the sins of the world.  All you need to do is believe that in your heart.  Your God knew you couldn't make it so he did it all for you.  Grace by faith alone in what Jesus Christ did for you personally.  Nothing you do can save you, no good work, no nothing.  Just repent and believe the Gospel according to the KJV scriptures and you will be saved.  I also recommend confessing this all to God in prayer.  He wants you to talk to him.

       I'm dead serous.  I wouldn't bother telling people this if I didn't believe eternal souls were on the line.  I want as many people to get saved as possible.  It's the entire purpose of this life.

       How is that the entire purpose of life? We laugh at the Greeks for all the gods they worshipped. How is Jesus any different? Not gonna argue with you, believe what you want but god isn’t real. I’m a nihilist though so I don’t think there’s really any way you can convince me the world is much more than a projection of the mind. None of this is real. The point of this life is to enjoy it, that’s it.

       Satan/Lucifer is real man.  He's all about deception.  Anything but faith in Jesus Christ and his gospel will send you to the lake of fire.  You will know you aren't creating that when your flesh dies.

       So in the Old Testament, God commands us to sacrifice animals, but strongly warns against consuming blood, because it's a savor for the Lord. Then God sends his Son to be the eternal sacrifice in place of animals, and we should pretend to drink
       <em>
        his
       </em>
       blood to celebrate? Meanwhile, we are expected to believe that this is true and therein lies salvation?

       No that's Catholic perversion.  The RCC is the church of the Antichrist.  Drinking blood isn't good, it opens one up to devils (demons). That's why Podesta and friends drink blood while Spirit Cooking.

       Rev 6:1  And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rev 6:2  And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe he's somewhere in the pit.  Jesus is going to pop the fist seal during Jacob's trouble and he's going to come out on a white horse conquering.  Due to the white horse and many false end times teachings many will think he is Jesus Christ returning to set up his Kingdom.  He will have great power and lying wonders.  The Muslims will think he's Mahdi, the Jews will think he's their Messiah, The false Christians will think he's Jesus, the Buddhists will think he's Maitreya, Atheists will think he's an inter-dimensional savior.  He will unite the world's religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       He will sit in the temple in Jerusalem (pay attention to that being rebuilt someday) and call himself God and the world will worship him and take his mark.

       Largests shareholders of BTC are goverments, early magnates, btc can still be prohibited by some goverments, btc is still fiat, theres nothing new about it, its not revolutionary or innovative, it's just the same old 'money' marketed in a new light, you understimate powerful entities, people and the intilligence/military groups of the world didn't know the consecuences of the internet and crypto 20 years or more before it reaches public/normies awareness and usage.

       "btc is still fiat" do you know what fiat means? it means it can be done/ordered (printed, in the case of money) at will. btc can NOT be printed at will, it is created at a very predictable interval and there is an upper limit (~21m) that will ever exist. satoshi's white paper spells everything out, the code is open source, the only "mystery" is who was satoshi. but it's been proven that whoever it was, he/they mined about 1 million coins in the first year and never touched them after that.

       anyway, any proof of your claim "largest shareholders are governments, early magnates"?

       I also think its interesting that there has been so much interest/"pushing" from multiple online communities over BTC.  I would think most folks wouldn't really care unless they have a direct interest in either economics, currencies, or investments with it.  Yet i keep seeing it upvoted/posted/shared across a ton of different media reach.  i understand the excitement, but it seems a bit much over something only a small percentage of folks would have an interest in?
      </p>
      <p>
       To me it seems like whats the best way to get money that you can use for real world dealings without having to provide anything for it, and getting folks to invest into a crypto currency seems to fall into that.

       BTC is the primary trading route for almost all crypto's - it's the standard - it's the gold - the issues that arise with your argument - and I'd argue Good ole bill - who i do love btw - but i remember him stating that ALL UFOS AND ALIENS WEREN'T REAL AND JUST A PSYOP - i'm not that dumb... fuck my ancestors have been doing this shit much longer than technology has been around - alright moving on - Bitcoin has solved a fuckload of issues - it removes the money from the hands of a central bank - who has absolute control - check rothschilds - it removes the need for 1 person or a CENTRALIZED party mediating - it's mediated by all - it's fair - no offense but you don't know shit about this and you've already got the hook so far down i'm scared you swallowed it. I don't think you comprehend that the GOV had to STEAL shit from TESLA - your brain obviously perceives them as the gods they want you to - hence lessening your own self perception and thus your actual overall self worth as you can't view yourself as good as the gov - so i'm here to remind you... tesla...

       I like what you have to say when you’re not joking around. I been following all the little disclosures drops for the past year and yea, this shits a pattern and I’m glad I’m not the only person who sees it... I’m just saying people need to entertain the idea, Take it with a grain of salt, ask the right question. Then we will figure out if it’s real. Or all a Grammy awards style LARP.

       maybe you could make the argument that the deep web is decentralized, but you cant even spell it. You think that TPTB control all the information in libraries but cant edit and filter the information on the internet? so youre under the assumption that the investors of blockchain.com own the BTC blockchain? or control it just as much as they control the internet? I like how youre just trying to split hairs here to hold onto your reality. get woke

       LOL, dude the internet is DESCENTRALIZED by definition, it's a peer 2 peer network rather than a single connection to access to knowledge/information (like pre-internet era for your news, thoughts, info about the world), TPTB controlling all info in libraries? LMAO no, but look at the great gatekeeping of info to that knowledge to the general public, plebs, unpriviledged people.

       Did you ever wonder why the name 'chain' is on the name of the technology? 'occultism 101'? When you get rid of fiat wheres your money? A cashless society it's what they want, you actually get to own nothing, they just lend it to you or let you think you own stuff. Bankers are not standing idling and watching distant how the transfer of wealth to digital and sleeping into these 'underground small 'revolution'. They have been working/corrupting blockchain a long time ago for their same agenda. Next thing you know you're born with a chip that records all your transactions, guess what, you lost all your privacy and freedom, there's no 'Scape Route' once it's implemented. The homeless ppl will ask for dogecoins in the street, cashless is not progress. Natural disaster? Good luck with that internet stability.

       Satoshi has 1 million bitcoin - you obviously know nothing about Zcash - all of the other coins as well - what are Zero Knowledge Proofs? - can you name me 10 cryptos? or 5 even? 3? You say that it's the same old "money" but it's not - you don't have a fucking bank owning it - you have your OWN SHIT - MUCH BETTER YEAH? No more CENTRAL BANKS THAT ENSLAVE THE PEOPLE - sorry - but you've honestly got to think long and hard about this - i love bill coop don't get me wrong - but for fuck sake he said there were no aliens at one point and that it was all a fucking brain machine thing that the CIA had. I love bill but dude i don't believe fucking everything i hear him say - he's not fucking glowing light levitating at the top of the mountain... that dude i'll listen too - but bill coop on things like that? meh - he's got an ALRIGHT vibe - but dudes not glowing light like some people i've seen...

       There is literally not a single accurate thing in your post. As for who holds the most, BTC, that would be the founder(s) who went by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. The original BTC wallet contains ~ 1 mil BTC and has never been touched.

       We are talking about a wallet with 1 million bitcoins, worth $6.1 billion. So who controls the wallet? It's not the current dev team. Why would you even link that?

        With such a huge holding, could Satoshi exact similar pressure on the bitcoin market? It could be catastrophic, said Glaros. He points to the bear whale incident, when 26,000 bitcoins were unloaded on BitStamp on 6th October, slashing market prices by 10%.
       </p>
       <p>
        "If Satoshi were to dump one million bitcoins, it is not only the price effect we have to worry about but what I'll call the 'faith' effect: after all, if the creator appears to lose confidence in bitcoin then what are the rest of us to believe?" Glaros said. Bitcoin companies would become insolvent, he suggested, and the market would take a long time to recover – if it were to recover at all.

       Q is a "supposedly" top secret leaker on 4chan who has direct ties to the president. He's posted many things on 4chan indicating that he at least has some level of knowledge. Most people consider it the most elaborate larp or greatest drop ever. Basically Q stands for the highest level of security clearance given. There are some other cool things like Q posting an original photo outside a window, and kekistan deduced it rationally to China, where Trump was. Then, on top of that, Lynn De Rothschild was freakin' out - screamin' at trump - all the way from fucking england - you know after the house of SAUD GOT DECIMATED - +++ = saud ++=rothschild +=soros
      </p>

       You are right.  I've been saying this for almost 15 years now.  There is a war on your mind by dark occultists who are master psychologists.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are playing a number on the human race right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are the El - ites.
      </p>
      <p>
       El = ancient name for planet saturn
      </p>
      <p>
       El = Kronos = Satan - these are names for the planet saturn - the ancient God of time and materialism.

       This is an ancient underground religion we are up against.  Their recruitment tool is money.  They seek psychopaths and sociopaths who want money and power.
      </p>
      <p>
       They put their people at the head of every industry and control it from the top down.
      </p>
      <p>
       More people than ever know about them today than ever before in written history.  They are losing.  There is a slow but gradual increase in you fuckers awakening and its happening faster everyday.

       The real red pill is realizing that love triumphs and guides all. As long as love exists, it will prevail. Whether it is today, tomorrow, next year, a hundred years from now, a thousand years love will prevail. We are but a speck of sand in the universe of time. We will fall back into tune with the frequency of infinity

       Also research the "20 and back" program. William Tompkins talked a little about it as well. Slowly more ex-soldiers are popping up with stories about being in this program. Some of them have stories about seeing body parts in totes.

       Dulce base "Nightmare Hall" where the guy who got down to the lower levels saw aliens experimenting on humans and what he thought was harvesting organs. He got in a gunfight and escaped then told his story all over and then I think he got killed. As you can tell I'm a bit rusty as it's been a long time since I looked all this stuff up, as usual use your discretion.

       RED PILL INCOMING....
      </p>
      <p>
       We are ruled by a generational cult of transnational toddler gobblers who are basically adrenochrome junkies using pedo blackmail to enforce their blood contract with an alien species who are actually demons from another dimension, who inhabit their hosts and use them as some sort of avatar for interacting with our dimension.

      <p>
       And much of what you think you know about our collective history is false. Civilizations such as the Mound Builders existed before us, and were wiped out by successive cataclysms and changes to the environment brought about by certain cycles (read Velikovsky).

       Human history is a tale about control. Money, government, religion, war, agriculture, art, disease - these are all war by other means to bring subjugation to the masses and keep your nose to the grind so you don't sit there and think too long, because if you start looking for answers, it's frightening what you can find.

       I don't believe in conspiracies but I have circumstantial evidence linking George Bush Sr to a notorious sex predator (they are good friends) and a former anti narco trafficker &amp; finance guy, who has worked for 4 Presidents, involved in laundering $400 million in cocaine money (I was in the room).

       My guess is that the Vril were looking to make a utopian society on earth similar to the beings of Alderan but ultimately failed due to the state of war the planet was in so they packed up and left for another planet. All I can day for the USs intentions would be that they wanted their upper hand back. Am I missing something deeper?

       Zero point energy is consistent in all directions,  so we can't use it to do work any more than we can run a car engine when the exterior of the engine is as hot as the interior. There's nowhere less energetic for the energy to move towards, so nothing happens when you try to use it.

       What about what Goode has said makes you think any of that? He was falsely accused of being a Luciferian (lol)  like six months ago and shut that down pretty easily. Have you even listened to the things he’s trying to tell people? He’s nothing but positivity despite the unfortunate reality of the intel he has. I’d really give him a more objective look if I were you.

       Idk if he was they would have more dirt and more power over him... and he took out the house of Saud basically, they're the heads of global human trafficking... Idk that shit would be out like crazy honestly - there is stuff out but I mean you have fusion gps being sold as real news yet it was fake and known to be fake the whole time. Why pay for fake dirt if you have real dirt? That was paid for by Clinton so I mean. I see what's happening in the world now and it definitely doesn't look like he's one of them

       A family power struggle does not mean the House of Saud has fallen.   Trump made a billion dollar arms deal that will ensure SA keeps funding Islamic terrorism for the US to fight. If it annoys you when people say things that aren't true, then you should stop speculating based on a LARP.

       Lol nope, just the globalist I think. McCain, etc. Yeah Liz Crokins a bad ass journalist and followed him for years, she fucking knew Jenner was dressing in high heels at night because people talk, and about the satanism etc too. Anyways I see the shit happening like pedos coming out of Hollywood rapers and the fucking culture, as a sign that Trump isn't a sick demoralized pedo... at all - in fact it looks like he's eradicating it

       Also research the "20 and back" program. William Tompkins talked a little about it as well. Slowly more ex-soldiers are popping up with stories about being in this program. Some of them have stories about seeing body parts in totes.

       Dulce base "Nightmare Hall" where the guy who got down to the lower levels saw aliens experimenting on humans and what he thought was harvesting organs. He got in a gunfight and escaped then told his story all over and then I think he got killed. As you can tell I'm a bit rusty as it's been a long time since I looked all this stuff up, as usual use your discretion.
