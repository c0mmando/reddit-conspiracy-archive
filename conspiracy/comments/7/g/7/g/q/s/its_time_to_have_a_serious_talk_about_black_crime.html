        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let&#39;s cut the political correctness for a moment.</p>

<p>In America right now there&#39;s an epic wave of violent crime being committed by Black criminals and more often than not, the victims are white.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough these numbers have been examined in the past but not in recent years.</p>

<p>In fact the numbers are so catastrophically high, <strong>that black criminals are twenty five times more likely to violently assault white victims than white criminals are to assault black victims.</strong></p>

<p>Now let&#39;s be reminded I&#39;m not defending any criminal here, I&#39;m only reporting the facts.</p>

<p>But wait, there&#39;s more!</p>

<p>When those numbers come to a specific type of violent crime, known as Aggravated Assault, those numbers grow even more.</p>

<p><strong>Black criminals are two hundred times more likely to be the perpetrator against White victims than White criminals are against Black victims.</strong></p>

<p><strong>TWO HUNDRED TIMES!</strong></p>

<p>These numbers are based upon the 2010 FBI Crime Statistics.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is, they could be even higher now.</p>

<p>The FBI released their violent crime statistics for 2016, but the numbers are incredibly skewed based upon the harsh criticism from black advocacy groups after the 2010 results stunned the white community.</p>

<p>There are two very important changes in the 2016 results.</p>

<p><strong>Violent crimes committed by “Whites” against blacks now include statistics of “Hispanics”.</strong> Yes I realize this is intended to make White crime seem worse than it is. An idiot can see this.</p>

<p>Murders committed by Blacks against Whites is now up 12 percentage points from the numbers in 2014 (446 Whites murdered by Blacks) and an absolutely shocking jump up 22 percentage points from those recorded in 2013 (409 Whites murdered by Blacks).</p>

<p>Now keep in mind, these murders are not total murders nationwide. These numbers come from cases where there is a single killer, and a single victim.</p>

<p>So in fact those numbers in all categories are even higher, because these numbers remove about 17 percentage points of all homicides in the United States.</p>

<p>Stunning when you then consider that at least 40 percentage points of Black men are unemployed. Forty percent, not a typo.</p>

<p>I cannot imagine forty percent of Black men not working, that&#39;s just a complete shock.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What’s the point in separating “black crime” from “white crime”</p>

<p>All that get accomplished by doing this is that we’re divided, and get to paint black people as more criminal or more violent, it’s not like these criminals are going out of their way to commit a crime against a person of a particular race</p>

<p>And frankly “talking about black crime” is a bit of a dog whistle imo. It seems like people who have no desire to actually learn about inner city communities, much less do anything for them, like to talk about what exactly black people are doing that’s causing them so many problems.</p>

<p>Frankly the only time I ever hear someone speak out against “black on black violence” is because someone is calling out some other issue like police brutality, education inequality, mandatory minimums, etc. and how they provide a barrier for black Americans to succeed, and someone wants to redirect the conversation to the “real problem”</p>

Everyone needs to admit there is a problem, and take some responsibility in fixing it, that includes Black communities cleaning up their acts.

    <div class="md"><p>But why are they acting like ignorant thugs? Is it something inherent about them? Or is it as a result of the circumstances that they were born into.</p>

<p>If you say 50/50, that means you are implying that to some degree, blacks are genetically predisposed to growing up to become ignorant thugs, regardless of what circumstances they were born into.</p>

<p>My view is that anyone, black/white/hispanic/asian can grow up to become ignorant thugs if the circumstances push them in that direction. Matter of fact, that&#39;s really how lots of the gangs and criminal activities got started. Not because these groups had a penchant for mischief but because they were dealt a bad hand(sometimes by design as in the Blacks) in life(poverty, lack of education, victimizations).</p>

I&#39;m just simply stating that the lack of family structure affects juvenile delinquency and that that specific issue is prevalent among the black community. There are a number of issues contributing to why thats the case including our fucked up prison system like you said. There is blame do go around in many facets of society.
