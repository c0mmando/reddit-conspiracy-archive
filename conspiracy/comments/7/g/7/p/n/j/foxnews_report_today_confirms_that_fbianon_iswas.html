       Disclaimer:  This is not my theory.  It's posted on /pol/ right now and I figured I'd write a summary for those who are not familiar with the whole FBIAnon fiasco.  I'm going to start from the beginning so that people who are completely out of the loop can follow.  Unfortunately, that means a long post, sorry.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         On July 2, 2016, a poster on 4chan going by the ID FBIAnon posted that Hillary's email servers contained above top-secret information.  He called it Special Access Program (SAP) which means that even top clearance does not get you access to these classified materials.  You have to have a reason for getting read in.  He claimed that Hillary Clinton had transferred some of this to her personal servers and would pay a heavy price for it.  Here is the entire conversation of that night
         <a href="https://i.imgur.com/34LJp1J.png">
          https://i.imgur.com/34LJp1J.png
         </a>
         Now, as you know, nothing ever came of the email investigations by Comey.  So, as usual, this was dismissed as larping.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Just last night, November 27, 2017, news broke out on FoxNews that got some coverage, but it seems people didn't realize the whole implications of this story.  Here it is:
         <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/27/blowback-clinton-campaign-planned-to-fire-me-over-email-probe-obama-intel-watchdog-says.html">
          http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/27/blowback-clinton-campaign-planned-to-fire-me-over-email-probe-obama-intel-watchdog-says.html
         </a>
         This story is about the former Intelligence Community Inspector General Charles McCullough III coming clean about how "emails BEYOND TOP SECRET LEVELS passed through her servers" (his exact words)  This could refer to only one thing: SAP    This means that the FBIAnon was absolutely legit.  Read and listen to how he was threatened to stay silent on the SAP matter.  It was a complete cover-up from the highest levels of the gov't.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Now that we know that the FBIAnon was real, we have to go back to May 16, 2017.  On that date, FBIAnon actually gave a Q&amp;A session here :
         <a href="http://victuruslibertas.com/2017/05/readers-and-viewers-of-vl-ask-fbi-anon-their-own-questions/">
          http://victuruslibertas.com/2017/05/readers-and-viewers-of-vl-ask-fbi-anon-their-own-questions/
         </a>
         Now, if you didn't read the other two links, READ THIS ONE.  It is mind blowing.  Now one caveat.  We don't know if this FBIAnon was the same one as the one on 4chan back in 2016.  However, the site owners and the anon claims that he is the same.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Okay.  Let's look at the first question in the Q&amp;A
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        TOM asked:  The news is exploding that Trump shared intel with Russians from an “ally” in the middle east and the ally is very upset. This is in regards to an Isis plot regarding airplanes and laptops.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Do you remember this?  I do.  The media went in to a frenzy that Trump somehow leaked information to Putin concerning our ally.  It was never revealed what the information was or who the ally was.  NOW WE KNOW.  Look at the FBIAnons answer:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A:  The “ally” not being named is Israel, and they are mad as hell at Trump.  Israel is furious because they got caught with their pants down. Lets get to the point. Isis was created by Israel and the US to weaken Iran and topple Assad. Billions in profits at stake. Israel has developed the technology to remote control airlines via laptops. A false flag was being prepared. Trump discussed it with Russian officials,exposing the “plot” McMaster pitched, and now all hell has broken loose. Trump did a wonderful thing in my opinion.  We do not need anymore Isis false flags.
       </p>
       <p>
        If Isis is eradicated, it will decrease CIA and DOD budgets, limit the amount of “support” Israel receives, and cause disruptions in the grand scheme to build a massive pipeline through Syria and ultimately cause the downfall of Iran and Russia. This is why “Isis” is being kept alive by the NWO. This is why such “bold” and “frightening” plots must be continually fed to the people. To justify larger budgets, and bigger hegemony.
       </p>
       <p>
        Russia is actually our only hope, along with Trump, that this diabolical system can be broken, shattered, as JFK once said, into a thousand pieces and scattered to the wind.
       </p>
       <p>
        The technology to remotely control and crash commercial airliners was developed by Unit 8200, the Israeli cyber command. Does any thinking person actually believe rag tag militants would have the know how and resources to develop this technology? Give me a break. While we are at it, you may want to see how close the Russian MetroJet 9268 was to Unit 8200 when it went down. Tensions between Israel and Russia continue to grow by the day. Putin knows every trick in the Israeli arsenal and he just happens to be a much better chess player than Netanyahu.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Is your mind blown yet?  Let's go over all the bombshells here.
      </p>
      <p>
       a.  Hillary Clinton had SAP level emails go through her servers.  The FBI knew about it.  The Intelligence Community Inspector General knew about it.  Comey suppressed it.  Congress and Obama suppressed it.  Now, it's all coming out.
      </p>
      <p>
       b.  The info Trump shared with Putin was a false flag attack planned by Israel.  We don't know the exact details of the attack but from his words about remote controlled planes, it's obvious he's talking about a 9/11 style attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       c.  Literally every conspiracy that is discussed here on this sub, pay-to-play, pedophile, CIA drug-running, gun running, human trafficking, organ harvesting, money laundering (etc.) network, plus Israel blackmail of US politicians ARE ALL TRUE according to the FBIAnon.  Read the full Q&amp;A linked above.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some final thoughts.  I now realize why Trump is cozying up with Saudi Arabia.  Our greatest enemy is/was Israel all along.  Wow.  I'm done thinking for the day.  I need a drink.  Anybody got some scotch?

       Ok fair enough.  My entire post is whether FBIAnon is legit or not.  If he is, then everything he said needs to believed.  If not, then dismiss it.

      <p>
       Read the actual FBIAnon posts of 2016.  Read and listen to the Inspector interview of yesterday.  The facts match perfectly.  I understand that if this is not enough evidence for you.  But for me, I'm getting there.  I'm like 90% there now.

       FBIAnon put in bad information on purpose to protect himself and have plausible deniability.. People will say oh of course, but if you start throwing out 100% accurate information it isn't hard to know where it comes from with how intelligence agencies compartmentalize information to track leakers.

       Could be.  But all I care about is the first post.  Everything that comes after, like Q, is a crap to me.  Why?  Because if the original poster had intention to post again at a later time, it can be easily done with pgp encryption.  Literally, he could post over and over again and prove that it's him.  But, no one ever does that.

      <p>
       I've read this before and it's just a desperate attempt by fanboys to explain away problems with FBIAnon. You don't get plausible deniability by including false information in a leak because anyone can lie and thus it wouldn't exclude anyone from suspicion of being a whistleblower. Plus, including lies in your information immediately discredits you as a reliable source, and why would anyone trying to be a whistleblower do that? Face it, FBIAnon is just a fraud.

       The first half is the theory that FBIAnon is legit because of what the Inspector has said last night.  The second half delves into what it means IF FBIAnon is in fact legit.  And it's not even my theory.  As I stated above, I'm summarizing what's being discussed at pol.  Why do you have such a problem with this?

       I dont know what you are talking about. Israel is probably in the strongest position they have been in their entire existence. Europe has always been on the fence about them but have gotten closer to the US, SA and Russia in the meantime. No to mention the right wing/military has a lot of popular support in the country. They could pave over the rest of the west bank no body would do a thing.

       I don't know if you have your head in the sand but Israels ability to do shit like that is because, and ONLY because, of their inorganic political support within the US. Every day that public opinion in the US sours towards Israel they lose their hegemonic power in the ME. And once again, I don't know if you have your head in the sand but that support is dying.  Their detractors are becoming more and more vocal and emboldened, their supporters (or patsies rather) are becoming less and less able to convince their consistuencies of the ethical value in blindly supporting them. The younger Jewish generation in the US is far less able to stomach Israel (Netanyahu's Israel) policy. Even Obama, who's connected by the balls to Israeli lobby, gave a final fuck you to Netanyahu as a last gesture as president.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you didn't respond to the possibility of revelations linking Mossad to ISIS and false flags, and how that would effect Israeli international support (which once again they rely on for their flexibility to commit war crimes)

       Also since their inception Israel has gone from a complete pariah in the middle east to now openly being allies with Egypt and SA. Really their only adversary in the region is Iran. I grant you that Obama was probably the most anti-Israel president we've ever had but now it seems we have the opposite again.

       I'll go ahead and disregard that poll. After last election I've decided personally that my own personal judgment and interactions with real people are a better indicator of public opinion. And to clarify: I'm not saying the American people are overwhelmingly opposed to Israel as an entity. I'm saying we are overwhelmingly opposed to Israeli military policy, leadership (Netanyahu), but more than anything against our government being essentially at the service of the Israeli lobby. And once again the more transparency, the more revelations, the more emboldened that critics of this become (and the more of them that are in positions of power), the more overwhelming that sentiment will become. I can't show you a pill to "prove" that but go outside and ask informed people what they think of the Israel/Palestine situation, what they think of Netanyahu, and what they think of the Israeli lobby's influence in our country.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree that Trump is most undoubtedly pro Israeli (as was Obama btw). But you can be pro Israel and anti Netanyahu. Pro Israel and anti Mossad. Believe it or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, once again, if revelations were to make it to the surface that Mossad played a part in any false flags, or had any support for ISIS (interesting to me that ISIS has never had a problem with Israel and vice versa- very odd for a "Muslim extremist" group),
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you can bet your life that Netanyahus reign is over. Once again I think these investigations were primed for what some in Israel must feel is inevitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway I have no polls. Just a sense of what fellow Americans feel. And a real sense that we are going to be learning a lot of dirty secrets that will negatively implicate elements of Israel vs American interests

       In that part of the world public opinion doesnt mean a whole lot. Of course Netanyahus wont last forever, he is an elected official. I'm just saying at the moment the all the dictatorial/militaristic figures in the world seem to be aligning and supporting each other and have public opinion behind them. Israel will continue with settlements at full pace with no repercussion. Russia will continue to destabilize Ukraine with no repercussion. If SA feels threatened enough they will start a larger conflict with Iran and the US and Israel will back them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your friends might see things for what they are but most people arent informed. They see Israel for the only semi civilized place in sea of chaos which it kind of is. Also the christian base will always blindly support Israel. Unless hard undeniable proof that they are propping up terror organizations is reviled American support will never drop below %60.

       Imagine complaining that a person that high in government having top secret information. So it basically comes down to feels about the private server which has proved to be more secure than government ones at this point.

       If those emails were SAP, as has been reported, she wasn't allowed to have them off of the secure (not connected to the net) servers. It is espionage and treason. Who gave them to her? They would not even be allowed on a govt server if they were SAP. They are offline and at a secure location, for viewing only.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        EXCLUSIVE: Hillary Clinton's emails on her unsecured, homebrew server contained intelligence from the U.S. government's most secretive and highly classified programs, according to an unclassified letter from a top inspector general to senior lawmakers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fox News exclusively obtained the unclassified letter, sent Jan. 14 from Intelligence Community Inspector General I. Charles McCullough III. It laid out the findings of a recent comprehensive review by intelligence agencies that identified "several dozen" additional classified emails -- including specific intelligence known as "special access programs" (SAP).
       </p>
       <p>
        That indicates a level of classification beyond even “top secret,” the label previously given to two emails found on her server, and brings even more scrutiny to the presidential candidate’s handling of the government’s closely held secrets.

       Oh I'm aware that Comey was forced.  But I also believe they really didn't have to twist his arm too hard to go along.  His written notes exonerating Hilary even before the investigation concluded tells me 1. He had no choice and 2. he was going to play ball.

       You should probably edit the OG post, then. It'd be disingenuous otherwise. Plenty of people may read your initial blurb and not go any farther. That may be the reason for the DVs.

       Also worth noting that it was widely reported back in May that the intelligence Trump shared with the Russian foreign minister was from Israel. e.g.,

       I still think this is interesting, but neither the SAP thing nor naming Israel as the source were new developments showing insider access.

       Yes it is common knowledge the laptop security threat was from Israel but this is implying Israel was in on the threat and not just simply aware of it.  Stark contrast imo

       FbiAnon posts. He may have known about SAP's from the january report, but how does that explain away him knowing about both Clinton investigations? He knew about the e-mail one and the Clinton Foundation investigation. Which is still ongoing and folks are dead silent on it for a reason. I believe that Mueller is really the Trojan horse to investigate the election, Russia, and The Clinton Foundation.
      </p>

       Either that or they are just distracting us again while they prepare for things to pop off in the middle east. Israel and Iran can't wait to launch missiles at each other. Israel is very worried though ever since ISIS got crushed. They are asking for another billion dollars in aid.

       bc you havent edited your post with the new information.  Most people don't check the comments so the majority of the people who see this wont know you are denouncing it.  Honestly you should just delete it since now you know its incorrect and there isnt a point to continue to spread false information

       the fox news article came before the 4chan post.  That means that the 4chan leaker release no new information.  OP is trying to say  that the fox news legitimizes the 4chan "leaker".   If he only checked the dates then he would've known this was not true.

       Stop worrying about funny downvotes and focus on the server issue. Per MegaAnon, WikiLeaks has:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "the Weiner files the NYPD mirrored/retained as evidence before handing the hardware to the FBI. Some of the files are pizza-coded creepy, just like Podesta's don't get me wrong but, the NYPD recovered ALL of the files on Weiner/Huma's computer, which in their majority, are directly tied to ALL of Hillary's dirty Secretary of State Middle East dealings and her backdoor foundation profits thanks to hundreds of millions in cashed payroll checks for their dirty "cooperation". Yes, the pizza will burn, but she will ultimately go down for the shade she threw to our nation, as our Secretary of State."

       Great post, thanks op.

       My only criticism is in your very last statement:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Some final thoughts. I now realize why Trump is cozying up with Saudi Arabia. Our greatest enemy is/was Israel all along.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       While I do agree that Israel is not what it seems, I'm not sure Saudi Arabia is our white knight. It's encouraging to see that some of their elites, who have allegedly supported extremism in the past, are being rounded up and dealt with. But, I am still quite skeptical of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I will remain hopeful that they have turned a corner and we can work together with them to help make things better.

       Hold on bro.  I believe those predictions came later, no?  I have a rule about Anon drops.  Only the first one has even a remote chance of being legit.  All that comes afterwards is pure garbage and should be ignored.

       I'm saying the predictions by FBIAnon that didn't come true weren't in his first post.  That all those were made at a later date and, to me, those later posts are ALWAYS larpers.  Like I said, there's probably 1% chance that the original drops are legit.  The rest that follows are all fake.

       Just because it's confirmed that clinton had above top secret info on her servers DOES NOT MEAN necessary that they were SAPs.  And it CERTAINLY  does not mean FBIanon was legit or who he says he was or that he was not a larp.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone Confirming there were above TS info one a server doesn't mean that they are automatically SAPs.  And using this to confirm FBIanon is just tenuous at best.

       Well let's get some things about TS clearances straight.  If something is top secret, you only have access to it if you have a need to know.  For example, the secretary of energy has a TS clearabce, but he can't just walk into the DoD and ask to see whatever he wants.  He has to have clearance to do so.  So any information that only a small handful of people have access to would be Considered above top secret.  Saps are the same way.  Clearance isn't enough, you have to have a need to know.

       What?!?!  How did you get that from what I said?!?!  You know what?  Don't answer that.  And no, that definitely NOT what I was saying.  I was saying SAPS aren't the only thing that you could consider "above top secret".

       Wasn't it reported that the information was SAP's though?
The question I have is, Who took those emails off the (not connected to the internet SAP servers.) and gave them to Hillary? IF they indeed are SAP level, this is treason/espionage, literally.

       I don't remember them being SAPs specifically.  But it still would t surprise me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is a very good question to ask.  She wouldn't have access to SAPs, so who have her access?  Why is nobody asking that?   Nobody is asking that in Congress or in the conspiracy community.  Why not?  My guess is its someone very high up that everyone agreed should be protected, which would explain why she never went to jail.  Of she goes to jail, they would start looking at who gave her access, and they just can't have that.

       Look at these articles, referencing SAP's:

        https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/20/hillary-clinton-classified-email-special-access-program

        https://www.huffingtonpost.com/h-a-goodman/hillary-clintons-private-_b_10354484.html
       </a>
       and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really wonder if this is the straw that breaks Hillary's back. I'm just not sure if all SAP's are created the same, so hopefully some work is done here. Too many great researchers for this to have skipped them imo. 
Fair enough though, regarding your last few points with "very high up"...

       Saudi Arabia and Israel are allies. Look at what is going on now with Hezbollah and Lebanon. Hezbollah, along with Syria, is an ally of Iran. Saudi and Israel share the same interests in the region; to destroy Iran and achieve hegemony. Some say the Saudi royal family are descendants of Jews... all I know is that they fund an awful lot of terrorism

       I don't know if you have your head in the sand but Israels ability to do shit like that is because, and ONLY because, of their inorganic political support within the US. Every day that public opinion in the US sours towards Israel they lose their hegemonic power in the ME. And once again, I don't know if you have your head in the sand but that support is dying.  Their detractors are becoming more and more vocal and emboldened, their supporters (or patsies rather) are becoming less and less able to convince their consistuencies of the ethical value in blindly supporting them. The younger Jewish generation in the US is far less able to stomach Israel (Netanyahu's Israel) policy. Even Obama, who's connected by the balls to Israeli lobby, gave a final fuck you to Netanyahu as a last gesture as president.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you didn't respond to the possibility of revelations linking Mossad to ISIS and false flags, and how that would effect Israeli international support (which once again they rely on for their flexibility to commit war crimes)
