<p>I&#39;m sure a bunch of people here are aware of the box aspect, maybe they can help me point you in the right direction.</p>

<p>But ya if you dig online you&#39;ll find it.</p>

<p>IMO all you need to do is watch this interview (taken just a few hours after victims murder) to know something is up. <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-1NU-GNlGDI">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-1NU-GNlGDI</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was knocking doors - not in Hurst&#39;s district, it was in Roanoke for a different HoD candidate - I ran into a former co-worker of Chris and Allison&#39;s.  He retired last year.  He was working in his garden.  </p>

<p>He talked about how he was the first one who figured out they were dating.  He got teary-eyed.  Spoke about a time the three of them went out drinking after a story wrapped.</p>

<p>I only know Andy Parker through social media.  </p>

<p>When there was a Wildcat strike at a Target - one of the managers had a long history of sexual harassment - and Hurst showed up, grabbed a sign, and marched with us.  I joked to him that he was getting radicalized, and he just grinned.  Like - I like Chris, but he&#39;s not leftist.  But he&#39;s a good guy.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I know an actor when I see one, and he was not acting like his daughter had just died when he went straight onto the news to advocate gun control. I&#39;ve heard the arguments that people react in strange ways when confronted with that kind of trauma, but sorry im not buying it. The whole thing is sketchy, top to bottom. The top posters link is worth viewing</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t offend me, exactly.  I just don&#39;t buy the conspiracy of it.  People did die.</p>

<p>Like 9/11.  I can believe conspiracies, because there is no pretending that people didn&#39;t die.  I had co-workers on UA 175.  They are definitely not around anymore.  But the conspiracy I can entertain belief in is about WHO did it, not that it didn&#39;t happen.</p>
