       Credit where credit is due.  The screencaps and videos I reference in this post are taken from HDRCFX Cornwall and John E Hoover's incredible videos on YouTube.  Guys, you have my highest respect.

         You first have to watch this video.  Watch it to 3 minutes.  It starts at 1 min 13 seconds so just watch the damn thing until 3 minutes.  It's only 2 minutes of your life.

         Okay.  There have been numerous people who claimed that those flashes from the 4th floor of Mandalay are just reflections.  Fine.  You win.    But if they are reflections,
         <strong>
          <em>
           here's where those reflections came from
          </em>
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Now let's go to the next video.  Watch this.
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfa3wkR2hRo&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=3m15s">

         .  Make sure you watch to 4:20. Do I have your attention?  Good.

         You know all those shots that were aimed at blowing up the fuel tanks?  Hmm... What if those shots weren't really aimed at the tanks?  What if they were shots taken to kill the shooter who was firing from THIS POSITION:
         <a href="https://i.imgur.com/XQ26mga.jpg">
          https://i.imgur.com/XQ26mga.jpg
         </a>
         Would that make sense?  What if some of those rounds happened to make it to the fuel tanks and now we have the narrative of Paddock trying to blow up fuel tanks?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I honestly don't know.  What I do know is that nothing the fucking government is telling me makes any sense.  Speak out.  Don't let this become another JFK.

       Something I’ve had on my mind. All those shots and none damaged any trees? I’ve looked at footage. I’ve searched high and low. Trees don’t lie. There should be damage to the trees between the Mandalay and the venue.  Lots of holes. Not every bullet hit a person. So why are the trees not damaged. Where are the bullet holes?

       Fwiw... I stayed at Mandalay two weeks ago for a conference.  My room was over looking the two towers and parking lot/fairgrounds. The top of the two towers is all rebar.  No one could perch on top, they would have to hook to the side of the rebar.

       I think the video shows a reflection but I am not convinced that it's from the Skyvue towers.

       The million dollar question!  Because the authorities stopped holding press conferences and addressing questions, they leave us no choice to speculate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theories like yours or possibly helicopters makes more sense than the official story.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I was there, more information was published about the strange activity of the helicopters that night.  I can confirm I watched multiple helicopters take off and land every day and none of them ever flew behind the Mandalay. All of the ones located at the airport take off and fly in front of the Mandalay.

       Could they not come up through the middle of the tower and aim through a big enough gap? Most of these types of towers are hollow and allow access for maintenence.

       Yes, there is some kind of opening at the base of the towers facing away from Mandalay.  It is large enough for someone to go through.  The unknown is what is inside.  There is not an elevator like some people say but a ladder or rungs attached the concrete is a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the rebar spacing to fit a barrel, again this is a possibility.  So it looks like shooting from towers is still a valid theory.

       Your theory falls apart in several places, most importantly of which is the fact the tanks were hit by Incendiary rounds. You don't use incendiary rounds to snipe a human target, but you would if your trying to blow a fuel tank.
      </p>
      <p>
       You spent a lot of effort researching this and it pains me that you haven't even thought through the basics of your theory.
