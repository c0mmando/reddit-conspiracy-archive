I&#39;m sick of eating this poison food they force us to eat because we&#39;re way to busy working from dusk to dawn for corporations that pay us barely enough for rent/mortgage for a home we don&#39;t own. That&#39;s actually owned to a bank that has us in debt for a minimum of 30 years. So we&#39;re either living with our parents who are constantly stressing over money or renting with a bunch people you don&#39;t even really like. I&#39;m sick. I&#39;m sick of the public school system who crammed 30-40 students in a class room since we were 5 years old where we&#39;re bullied by other students and teachers and taught false history and the way things are suppose to be in order to prep us for the ultimate test which is getting into college. What they don&#39;t tell you is at 18 years old we will signing up for a loan that&#39;s a small fortune or face the consequences which is having bad credit. But wait once you graduate and get that piece of paper you&#39;re given 6 months to pay off that money. Oh wait you have to buy a car that needs gas in order
To go to your 9-5 barely making any money to survive job. Ohhhh but wait This money is not actually real and the debt isn&#39;t real either it&#39;s all a fiat currency that&#39;s not actually backed by anything. As a matter of fact the US government is trillions of dollars of debt but if I don&#39;t pay my debt or taxes I will be shit out of a place to stay, a car and go to jail. But this is how it&#39;s suppose to be....right? Right.</p>

<p>Yep, I worked for a school board in IT for the past 6 years and the only reason I got the job was because I knew the right people.
I was 19 years old with a high school diploma and they chose me over applicants with college degrees.</p>

Not that you want your kid doing drugs. Just pointing out the level of freedom i have. Had i gone to school instead of learning a trade id be broke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice! It could be, but I&#39;d prefer a Northern island, tbh. I think the best island would be in between two &quot;enemy&quot; countries. You seize the island and ask for recognition by either one, in presumption of being a buffer zone between the two cunts (you don&#39;t call the one you&#39;re asking recognition from a cunt though - diplomacy 101 :) ). </p>

<p>Then you act like Switzerland, a neutral international party. Bingo-bango, a new country with no taxes, you own the land, have natural rights, all drugs are legal, etc etc. An Anarcho-Capitalist/Voluntaryist/Libertarian hybrid nation! Like some of the United States founders wanted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Get a one bedroom if you don&#39;t like your roommates. I got one when the economy went way down and got in at low rent which cannot be raised more than 20 dollars a month when I resign yearly lease. I would have to be there 20 years before the rent reaches the level it was 5 years ago. 
Also getting a car is a sucker move, live close to work, i take public transit and if i want a car for the weekend I rent one. I am not sure you live that you only have 6 months to pay off a school loan. I sucked it up and lived with parents until I paid it off. 
Anyway i saw a young guy in the media the other day who just bought a house outright. He spends his weekends working, he spends all his time working. I find the people complaining often aren&#39;t willing to really work at it. If your job isn&#39;t paying much get two jobs. I see immigrants come here with nothing and work 15 hour shifts and own a home faster than people who are born here because they wanted it more and worked for it. 
Tighten your belt live cheap and work hard, or just complain about it, whatever</p>

Wrong it is , but the practice of such behaviour will continue...and it goes on from capitol hill to the Kmart in Crickside .Now and forever...Because why have the authority if you can&#39;t abuse the power that goes with it? This is the credo upon which everything we know is built.  Good luck to us all !</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ill tell you now. it has never been a better time to own multiple homes.  rent more than double the mortgages and we can all thank that last crash for ripping most of you out of your permanent homes and into one of our rentals.     Ouch.  1500 a month is 18k a year and in 5 years that is 90k  x multiple homes.    you see the game?  don&#39;t live above your means and try to own something.  anything.  then rent it to those that cannot afford it.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This comment is funny - assuming your mortgage for something like that after taxes and insurance is $750 a month (which I doubt) you&#39;re pocketing 9K a year and that&#39;s not counting cost of running the houses and not being a douche slumlord.</p>

<p>Also - the people who rent aren&#39;t only ones that can&#39;t afford to own... I rent and it&#39;s because Where I currently live, owning is MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE than renting.  I&#39;m not coming out of pocket 30-50K for a home in a volatile market. With the way things are now - I&#39;d be surprised if this bubble lasts another 2 years tops. I&#39;m good. </p>

I have friends that completely skipped college and have been making $45 an hour with a $40 an hour benefit package since they were 23. By the time they&#39;re 43 they can retire, or work a few more years and have over a million in their retirement fund. I seriously wish I did this instead I was forced to go to college and am now struggling to pay my loans. Fuckin pathetic</p>
