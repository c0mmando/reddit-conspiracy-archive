Check my post history for the last 2 years if you don&#39;t believe me. I am still trying to get a good clip of what I am talking about. I don&#39;t even know what to think anymore. I was watching it on youtube and not in HD so perhaps it could be related to that, but my gut tells me otherwise. I am seriously disappointed and creeped out right now. I have always been skeptical of the &quot;reptilian&quot; theory but am officially creeped out and beginning to really take the possibility seriously. Imagine the human race 10,000 or even 50,000 years from now, we could easily have molecular shapeshifting tech by then, so is it really that insane that a more advanced race has it and is using it against us? I think our entire reality and world is one giant lie. Please everyone wake up before it is too late. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much as you would expect, at first.  A new relationship starts like any other, lustful, exciting, I was putting my best foot forward and she hid her scales.  </p>

<p>Everything is hot, until the smell hits you.  You won&#39;t notice it at first, but something about the skin being artificial and disposable soon becomes an odoriferous reality.  The breath is the first thing you notice, as if something was dying inside; perhaps a rodent, who knows?  Then the rest begins to ripen.  It is a kinetic mix of death and friction, like the scales are sawing a void in between the real entity on the inside and the borrowed skin-suit on the outside.  </p>

<p>You try to make it work, but reptiles and humans just aren&#39;t meant to be together.  </p>

<p>That being said, there is always the possibility that my daughter&#39;s mother is just a smelly, insufferable bitch.  </p>

Well, the truth is time is a planar dimension with two axes, T_x and T_y, it&#39;s just humans who are limited in their perception of time, so it looks linear to us. Lizard people are transdimensional transgender beings who can flitt in and out of our linear time dimension by travelling on the time plane. On the youtube video interface, press really hard on the time marker at the 2:00 mark, to push the time marker into the T_y dimension. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Videos purported to show this are <em>always</em> just the result of compression artefacts. If you are familiar with these things it just seems so obvious to see.</p>

<p>Many image and video compression reencodes colour as hue/saturation/brightness values since brightness is the most important and the colour can be compressed way harder. This often results in colours getting messed up for small details.</p>

<p>Also the lossy part of compression affects different parts of an image differently and the effective resolution is different for different areas depending on how neatly the compression scheme can capture certain textures etc. This means that for videos where things are moving around, if they are heavily compressed then details which are just about on the edge of the effective resolution are liable to pop in and out.</p>

<p>These problems affect all parts of an image, people just notice it more with eyes because our brains are wired to be really good at recognising patterns and differences in faces.</p>
