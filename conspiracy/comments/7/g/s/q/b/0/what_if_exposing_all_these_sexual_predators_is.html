        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Think about it. Pizzagate was EVERYWHERE when the story first broke. The NY Times did a &quot;debunking&quot; and most people forgot about it. But, the story kept surfacing from time to time. When a key predator would fall, they would create a distraction somewhere else to draw the news and attention away again.</p>

<p>Now, it seems they&#39;re doing the &quot;limited hangout&quot; approach: &quot;Yeah, we did it but,...&quot; They are sacrificing all these Hollywood scumbags (Kevin Spacey, Harvey Weinstein, Charlie Rose, etc.) &amp; some low-ranking Washington representatives. This is supposed to make us think: &quot;Finally! It&#39;s all coming out in the open! We&#39;ll hear the whole truth!&quot; But, they will continue to coverup &amp; censor Pizzagate related news. Most people will be happy with &quot;the sacrifice&quot; and assume all the pedos are gone and in jail now. But, most of the key players (Podesta, Clinton, etc) will continue on like nothing happened. Witnesses will just mysteriously die or disappear, and everyone will completely forget about Pizzagate. </p>

<p>Maybe this is the whole plan with the latest &quot;cleansing&quot;? But, instead of going after the REAL pedophiles, they just go after a few womanizing assholes and known-perverts and throw them to the lions? How do you keep people focused on things like Pedogate, Pizzagate, Pedowood and Corey Feldman&#39;s TRUTH Campaign?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Countries need to enact this:</p>

<p>a bill or law stating that every citizen of voting age has the right and slight obligation to vote on enacting laws that will be on the federal level. (this is more for well-warranted situations rather than for small shenanigans)</p>

<p>For instance, a bill is proposed: child traficking is illegal and brings the penalty of _____ (in all the states/provinces of the country).</p>

<p>Then people vote on whether this will be enacted federally or passed. The vote # would have to be significantly higher than 50%, but I feel like it could be worthwhile.</p>

<p>Then imagine spreading this globally, where all (voting-aged) citizens that would like to vote, can, and this will be enacted on a global level. Such as, again, child sex trafficking (looking at you, Thailand). This would be a good way for the power to make its way back to the people, and to keep certain things off the table in the country</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s assuming the majority of this world isn’t ignorant, enslaved and manipulated. I don’t mean it as an insult, but ignorance is certainly bliss. Our so called democracy, where the vote doesn’t matter when we are forced to choose the better of 2 demons, will never allow this. </p>

<p>NY just had a constitutional convention ballot measure that people voted 80/20:no/yes.  While the governor and mayor are being investigated by the FBI for pay to play, and corruption. People had signs and bumper stickers with vote NO on it. It’s sad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. It&#39;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_burn">controlled burn</a>, they&#39;re burning the low level creeps to protect as many truly sick fucks as possible while tricking people into thinking the issue has been resolved. Look at the way certain allegations of sexual assault and rape are ignored while others are given a LOT of attention. Consider the way recent allegations against Roy Moore have been handled in the media. Compare this to the lack of coverage of recent allegations against Bill Clinton. Notice how the media focused on news of Louis CK asking for permission to masturbate in front of women, then consider how the same media didn&#39;t cover allegations that Charlie Sheen did drugs with an underage Corey Haim before raping him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No matter how you slice it, these are real sexual and criminal predators in high places currently being outed and exposed so it&#39;s only a matter of time before more recent victims besides Corey Feldman who were, and perhaps even still are under-age that were subjected to the same kind of abuse not only start to come forward but get taken far more seriously, now that the proverbial cat is out of the bag.</p>

<p>I think that there&#39;s a growing perception and expectation that it&#39;s going to get worse, and I mean a whole lot worse, going forward because there is the realization that these are just the tip of a very big iceberg that is expanding and exposing the collusion and involvement of other high placed people not simply in the entertainment industry, but in politics and the police and even some judges who&#39;ve all worked in tandem to try and minimize and downplay the extent and seriousness of it from being more widely known and exposed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do talk in the nature of terms most fitting:</p>

<p>&#39;Psychological priming&#39;: exposure of perceptual forming and elicitation stimuli prior to the desired response.</p>

<p>Advanced: the use of psychological priming in fractionated time processes leads to ease and acceptance of a process, when exposed to it - called &#39;habituation&#39;. </p>

<p>In other words, the reason everything is coming out, with the most minor infractions being mixed with the most major, the nature of sexual harassment and pedophilia being seen so rampant, is that the &#39;largest possible fish&#39; is about to be caught.</p>

<p>They already have  been caught, and it&#39;s just not a fashionable trend to make jokes, and trivia, and SNL skits about it. It&#39;s not &#39;accepted&#39; common knowledge&#39;, even though everyone knows and has an idea. It&#39;s still &#39;offensive&#39; to true believers, and victims, and every other useless idiot in between.</p>

<p>IN other words,</p>

<p>Truth is subjective to how YOU use it, and how the mass of useless eaters emotionally responded; unless youre measuring exact qualities of time, space, or language. </p>
