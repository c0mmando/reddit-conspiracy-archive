        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A 64 yr old man with no criminal history, no apparent political or religious leanings, no documented history of mental illness, financially successful and certainly didn&#39;t seem to have much stress in his life.  This is what I keep coming back to, and can&#39;t come to grips with it.  I&#39;ve read all the conspiracies about the Saudis, the gun runner, the alphabet agencies, etc, and I just haven&#39;t seen enough evidence to convince me of any of those.  However, I cannot buy into the fact that this 64 year old man just snapped and did this.  If you look at all the other shootings you can typically identify one, if not many of these characteristics in the shooter.  I just can&#39;t buy that a 64 year old man meeting none of the above criteria would do this.  If he&#39;d been 23 years old I&#39;d probably buy the story because a lot can go wrong mentally for a late teen/early twenties person.  The best argument I can come up with in my head is that he was a hermit and a loner, and nobody ever got close enough to know what was going on in his head.  That&#39;s still hard to fathom though because we know he had a girlfriend and some family.  Surely he would&#39;ve said something to them.  But no, nothing.  Not only that, but why would he snap in the twilight of his life.  That&#39;s just not the way humans are wired.  I bring all this up because I haven&#39;t seen this conversation much, and it&#39;s the biggest question of all for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A grand story based off conjecture and coincidence is juicier than the truth. I mean I could be wrong, it’s not like our government has a stellar record in trying to keep the peace. Gulf of Tonkin anyone? Anyways, a story about the FBI, Saudi nationals, George soros and the ceo of MGM resorts international along with the cooperation of the LVMPD to cover up or conceal the true source of the extreme malevolence perpetrated in Las Vegas. Yes it’s sketchy, but what isn’t these days. If you look hard enough you’ll find what you’re looking for. You want a motive? This guy was a fucking psychopath, he was in a great deal of pain, and he willed to inflict that pain onto as many others as possible. And he did not wish to leave this world in a better place. But the Saudi false flag story sounds better. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear you, but where&#39;s the evidence of him being a psychopath? A psychopath that never got caught doing psychopath things for all those decades?  Or did he just become a psychopath in his 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s?  Why do you say he was in a great deal of pain?  If any of this was substantiated I&#39;d certainly be more likely to believe the main stream account of what happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would still want to see a video or some photographic evidence of him being alone anywhere in Vegas. I would like to see evidence of him, alone, carrying a dozen similar AR-15 style rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition up to the 32nd floor. I would like to know how he obtained said weapons, whether it was alone through licensed dealer, or through secondhand markets. I would also like to see a gunshot residue analysis of the crime scene, to see if the DB had been firing off those rifles, or see if hundreds of shots were actually fired through those windows. Also, would like to see  a total count of collected shell casings from said rifles, compared to a forensic audio analysis of how many shots were fired from &quot;Mandalay Bay&quot; down to the concert area. I would like to see photographic evidence of the 200 rounds fired down the hallway at security guard Jesus Campos. I would also like to see security footage of Campos, anywhere in Mandalay Bay, after being shot in the leg. I would like to know what was stolen from his house in the week following the attack. I would like to know what happened to thee hard drive in his computer from the crime scene, because people don&#39;t carry around computers that don&#39;t have hard drives in them. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think a white person could have done this alone, a black person, an arab person, whatever. Law enforcement job has done a very poor job of painting the picture that they want us to see. They expect us to just believe so much, without offering any evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said a 64 year old cannot snap. All I&#39;m saying is somebody prone to a major mental malfunction that could drive them to something like this is more likely to experience that malfunction in their early years, and build up to it.  Kind of the same idea as a serial killer who hurts animals as a child, and then maybe starts setting fires in their teens, eventually they build up to the major crime.  Just odd that there was no build up here.
I said it would be more believable for somebody in their 20&#39;s because I think statistically this is probably a young man&#39;s crime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Till a better working theory is available the whole LV was an attempt at taking out the crown prince before his crackdown just weeks later. Explains the arab gunmen at other casinos, explains why no motive for paddock, why no footage of him has been shown, explains the immediate fbi takeover and  obvious mess of a official story. The theatrics of Campos. The 20 guns were for the team of SA/ISIS hitmen. This also explains the escort vip video. Also fits with the 4chan post right after saying a larger event was stopped and a vip was there. The vip = crown prince. Also explains the reports of us mercs torturing bin talal for info. </p>
