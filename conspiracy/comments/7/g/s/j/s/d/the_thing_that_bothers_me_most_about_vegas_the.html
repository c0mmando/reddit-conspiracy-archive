       A 64 yr old man with no criminal history, no apparent political or religious leanings, no documented history of mental illness, financially successful and certainly didn't seem to have much stress in his life.  This is what I keep coming back to, and can't come to grips with it.  I've read all the conspiracies about the Saudis, the gun runner, the alphabet agencies, etc, and I just haven't seen enough evidence to convince me of any of those.  However, I cannot buy into the fact that this 64 year old man just snapped and did this.  If you look at all the other shootings you can typically identify one, if not many of these characteristics in the shooter.  I just can't buy that a 64 year old man meeting none of the above criteria would do this.  If he'd been 23 years old I'd probably buy the story because a lot can go wrong mentally for a late teen/early twenties person.  The best argument I can come up with in my head is that he was a hermit and a loner, and nobody ever got close enough to know what was going on in his head.  That's still hard to fathom though because we know he had a girlfriend and some family.  Surely he would've said something to them.  But no, nothing.  Not only that, but why would he snap in the twilight of his life.  That's just not the way humans are wired.  I bring all this up because I haven't seen this conversation much, and it's the biggest question of all for me.

       I think he was meeting up with some people in a hotel room to sell some guns. He did trade arms for money. And he just got in with the wrong people who decided to shoot up the crowd and then kill him and leave him for the cops to find.

       I'm under the impression it was a showing gone wrong. Paddock was going to sell guns legally, until randos showed up and hijacked his buy for nefarious purposes. That's part of why the guns were loaded as they went instead of arriving with loaded mags.

       I agree that it’s strange that no motive has been discovered, but I’m also okay with believing that a everyone struggles with their own demons and seemingly normal people can do awful things with very little rhyme or reason.

       A grand story based off conjecture and coincidence is juicier than the truth. I mean I could be wrong, it’s not like our government has a stellar record in trying to keep the peace. Gulf of Tonkin anyone? Anyways, a story about the FBI, Saudi nationals, George soros and the ceo of MGM resorts international along with the cooperation of the LVMPD to cover up or conceal the true source of the extreme malevolence perpetrated in Las Vegas. Yes it’s sketchy, but what isn’t these days. If you look hard enough you’ll find what you’re looking for. You want a motive? This guy was a fucking psychopath, he was in a great deal of pain, and he willed to inflict that pain onto as many others as possible. And he did not wish to leave this world in a better place. But the Saudi false flag story sounds better.

       I hear you, but where's the evidence of him being a psychopath? A psychopath that never got caught doing psychopath things for all those decades?  Or did he just become a psychopath in his 50's and 60's?  Why do you say he was in a great deal of pain?  If any of this was substantiated I'd certainly be more likely to believe the main stream account of what happened.

       Ok well then name me another mass shooting where we can't find one of these characteristics I mentioned.  We can typically always at least find a history of mental health issues or radical ideological beliefs.  I feel like they all fit the profile up until this one.

       That was the main thing that had me questioning the shooting from the get go. He doesn’t fit any kind of criminal profile. Which lead me to believing he’s just a patsy- for what I have no idea. That’s when the other details of the event in question didn’t add up at all. If I had the time and resources I’d spend all my time trying to figure this out. But I don’t, so I rely on other people’s investigations and try to make sense of it. Which I still haven’t been able to do.

       I would still want to see a video or some photographic evidence of him being alone anywhere in Vegas. I would like to see evidence of him, alone, carrying a dozen similar AR-15 style rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition up to the 32nd floor. I would like to know how he obtained said weapons, whether it was alone through licensed dealer, or through secondhand markets. I would also like to see a gunshot residue analysis of the crime scene, to see if the DB had been firing off those rifles, or see if hundreds of shots were actually fired through those windows. Also, would like to see  a total count of collected shell casings from said rifles, compared to a forensic audio analysis of how many shots were fired from "Mandalay Bay" down to the concert area. I would like to see photographic evidence of the 200 rounds fired down the hallway at security guard Jesus Campos. I would also like to see security footage of Campos, anywhere in Mandalay Bay, after being shot in the leg. I would like to know what was stolen from his house in the week following the attack. I would like to know what happened to thee hard drive in his computer from the crime scene, because people don't carry around computers that don't have hard drives in them.

       I don't think a white person could have done this alone, a black person, an arab person, whatever. Law enforcement job has done a very poor job of painting the picture that they want us to see. They expect us to just believe so much, without offering any evidence.

       The guy was clearly an operator, he didn't look like a lazy LV gambler slob, and he was ripped for his age. Not "going to the gym to keep in shape ripped" but more like "kill you with a single punch" ripped. Definitely black ops former millitary type of deal with paddy

       It is naive to say a 23 year old could snap but a 64 year old cannot.  Anyone can regardless of age can just lose it at any time for what ever reason.  We do not know what was going on his head and it seems like no one really knew him except maybe his girlfriend but she isn't talking.

       I never said a 64 year old cannot snap. All I'm saying is somebody prone to a major mental malfunction that could drive them to something like this is more likely to experience that malfunction in their early years, and build up to it.  Kind of the same idea as a serial killer who hurts animals as a child, and then maybe starts setting fires in their teens, eventually they build up to the major crime.  Just odd that there was no build up here.
I said it would be more believable for somebody in their 20's because I think statistically this is probably a young man's crime.

       I can't believe people buy into a 64 year old, out of shape, no military background or training could have shot so accurately from a htel across the street. People really believe that?

       Till a better working theory is available the whole LV was an attempt at taking out the crown prince before his crackdown just weeks later. Explains the arab gunmen at other casinos, explains why no motive for paddock, why no footage of him has been shown, explains the immediate fbi takeover and  obvious mess of a official story. The theatrics of Campos. The 20 guns were for the team of SA/ISIS hitmen. This also explains the escort vip video. Also fits with the 4chan post right after saying a larger event was stopped and a vip was there. The vip = crown prince. Also explains the reports of us mercs torturing bin talal for info.

       A grand story based off conjecture and coincidence is juicier than the truth. I mean I could be wrong, it’s not like our government has a stellar record in trying to keep the peace. Gulf of Tonkin anyone? Anyways, a story about the FBI, Saudi nationals, George soros and the ceo of MGM resorts international along with the cooperation of the LVMPD to cover up or conceal the true source of the extreme malevolence perpetrated in Las Vegas. Yes it’s sketchy, but what isn’t these days. If you look hard enough you’ll find what you’re looking for. You want a motive? This guy was a fucking psychopath, he was in a great deal of pain, and he willed to inflict that pain onto as many others as possible. And he did not wish to leave this world in a better place. But the Saudi false flag story sounds better.
