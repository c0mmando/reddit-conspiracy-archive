    <div class="md"><p>No fuck that, this is a great topic for this sub.  OP is a great example of the partisan bullshit and is only half right.  Trump is now responsible for the deaths in Yemen, but so is Obama and Hillary Clinton.  The US has been directly bombing and supporting Saudi Arabia in Yemen for years.  The fact OP only chooses now to take issue with it should be a sign to their own blind bias.  I&#39;m sure OP didn&#39;t give a shit when the US fucked over Libya, but nas no issue blaming Trump for not doing anything about the current slave markets that have been going on for years.  It&#39;s fucking disgusting.  Trump is shit, so was Obama and Hillary, but at least recognize they all are and our Foriegn policy is ran by the military industrial complex.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why ask blind trump supporters?  How about you ask why our media hasn&#39;t been reporting this on our 24hr news.  If you wanr the answer, listen to Jeremy Scahill&#39;s most recent podcast, he has recently been coming out of his blind hate for Trump and discussing the big picture with regards to the medias lack of actually reporting what our foreign policy really is.  I&#39;ve already listened to it 3 times in the last in the past couple days, it&#39;s amazing: <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/11/29/very-bad-men-trump-the-saudi-crown-prince-sexual-assaulters-and-robert-mugabe/">https://theintercept.com/2017/11/29/very-bad-men-trump-the-saudi-crown-prince-sexual-assaulters-and-robert-mugabe/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if I pose this question and no Trump supporter gives me a valid response, the failure to do so speaks for itself; that they are all fanboying for various reasons but most importantly that they have drank the Kool Aid.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ll check out the podcast when I have the chance. But to answer your question, the media isn&#39;t reporting it 24/7 because even if the aforementioned war crime and subsequent deaths come as a result of the Trump admin&#39;s support of SA(currently speaking), and although the media jumps on any opportunity to shit on him which makes this the perfect topic, criticizing the Military Industrial Complex is something that they would rather avoid. Why? Because the media exists to push the illusion of the Right and the Left and the Military Industrial Complex is one of, if not the the driving force of said illusion.</p>

<p>Ok, I agree, their fan boys.  R/politics isn&#39;t much different when compared to the echo chamber of T_D.  You know how hard it was to point out the BS obama did to the left?  With that said your post is no different than what you accuse the media of:</p>

<p>The way you have framed this post is no different than what the media is doing.  Thumbing your nose at blind supporters instead of addressing the real issue.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck, on mobile and my commenr got deleted.... it was long too.  Shit!  Anyways, the jist was, if you actually care about what&#39;s going on in Yemen, you probably should be more concerned with the lack of coverage by everyone else.  60 minutes last week didn&#39;t even mention the US&#39;s involvement at all.  Go search r/politics for &quot;Yemen&quot; over the last month and look at the vote count on the top post.  It&#39;s pathetic, for what ever reason r/resist stops once it involves our foreign policy and that should be more conserning rather than what Trumps blind supporters have to say... Shit, still pissed I lost that comment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I feel as though what you are highlighting(the fact that the media is not giving Yemen enough attention) is probably a greater issue but in this post, I am addressing Trump supporters who seem to be glossing over the aforementioned issues(Our support of SA&#39;s campaign against Yemen, turning a blind eye to their blockade).

    <div class="md"><p>Corrupt American government has been colluding with corrupt Saudia Arabia for decades and decades.   Do you have selective memory, amnesia?  The US, we have propped-up and installed dictators, for ages, and when we want to create regime change we topple the dictators we support and install more puppets under the guise of democracy when it&#39;s really all just global oligarchy and corporatacracy.  Saudi Arabia is a part of the globalists age old agenda of forming a one ruling body to rule the entire globe... There&#39;s only a few coubtrues left to topple, left to install an IMF central bank, and Saudi Arabia is not one of them. Iran is.  North Korea, Venezuela... These are next.  Right, Left, it doesn&#39;t matter... It&#39;s all two wings of the same dirty bird...a bird which has been consolidating global power, and so to have this Age old ideology of new world order culminate in our time. It&#39;s happening now. Saudi Arabia a big part of it... Heck, they were involved with 9/11 in cohorts with our own corrupt government and so as to create a new pearl harbor, a caralyst that has enacted much change toward this future of tyrannical globalism</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who knows why trump has armed the Saudis, maybe it was for money? Maybe he thinks any little bit of money will help the debt situation that America is facing.</p>

<p>Maybe he gave them weapons to broker a deal to get rid of the pedos within Saudi royalty maybe he did it to broker deals to loosen the laws Saudi civilians have to live by an example would be letting women drive now.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I can really justify his actions in this case, because I don&#39;t understand his reasoning behind it. And it&#39;s the wrong kind of decision in my opinion.</p>

<p>But can i ask you a question too.</p>

<p>Did you like Obamas foreign policy when it was towards Saudi and the middle east? Did you have a problem with him droning constantly and killing mass amounts of civilians, did you have a problem with him not just giving weapons to Saudis but also arming the rebels that turned out to be isis</p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing trump giving weapons to a country or government, but I think what&#39;s worse is a president giving weapons to groups that wanted to kill anything and everything that stood in their way of accomplishing their goals of installing the most hardcore and violent form of a religion ironically enough with hardcore violence and death.</p>

<p>One reason why trump will always be better then Obama.</p>

<p>Trump wasn&#39;t the one arming isis.
It was Obama&#39;s doing and before that it was bush&#39;s and before that it was Clinton&#39;s and before that it was bush Sr.</p>

<p>They all funded rebels to topple governments that they didn&#39;t want around and then would swoop in kill the rebels and take over, leave and fund more rebels and the cycle had continued but you know what&#39;s funny since trump has come along. Wheres all the news about isis? Where&#39;s all the News about isis growing. That&#39;s because trump stopped giving them weapons because it&#39;s in his best interests to stop them not continue to fund them. And if hillary became president well fuck me I can assure you she would of continued Obama flawed foreign policies and most likely would of made things even worse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s happening in Yemen isn&#39;t as cut and dry as many would have you believe. It&#39;s not entirely the fault of SA, and it certainly isn&#39;t all Trump&#39;s doing. </p>

<p>Yes, Yemen is hell on earth. They&#39;ve been fighting each other forever. The current war though is largely misunderstood in the west. Former dictator Ali Abdullah Saleh was forced to step down in 2012. He&#39;s accused of stealing $60 billion. He fought the Ansar Allah movement several times. They&#39;re also known as the Houthis. They&#39;re Shia supported by Iran.</p>

<p>Most of the damage you see in Yemen today was caused by the many wars that Saleh fought against the Houthis. One such campaign was called &quot;Operation Scorched Earth.&quot; Pretty self-explanatory. </p>

<p>After Saleh was forced to step down, he actually allied with the Houthis--his mortal enemies--to overthrow president Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. The Houthis and Saleh loyalists chased Hadi from the country. </p>

<p>On March 26, 2015, a Saudi-led coalition began a holding operation. I think Saudi Arabia is largely using the Yemen war as a deception operation. They wanted attention on Yemen while they took care of business in Syria and Iraq.</p>

<p>The press and all the NGOs seem to simply regurgitate all the outlandish claims made by the Houthis. The worst cholera outbreak in the world, mass starvation, wholesale bombing of schools, hospitals, weddings, funerals, et cetera.  What&#39;s the death toll? August of 2016 <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/at-least-10000-killed-in-yemen-civil-war_us_57c58703e4b0664f13ca63e4">it was 10,000</a>. What was it in January of 2017? <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/at-least-10000-killed-in-yemen-civil-war_us_57c58703e4b0664f13ca63e4">Still 10,000</a>. In five months of wholesale slaughter by the Saudi-led coalition, nobody died.</p>

<p><a href="http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/yemen/military-plan-in-place-for-hodeida-says-yemeni-foreign-minister-1.2106870">This</a> is actually interesting. If the port of Hodeida is taken from the Houthis, that&#39;s the end of the war. So what is the US doing? <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/us-launches-first-ever-strikes-against-isis-in-yemen-2017-10">The first air strikes</a> under Trump just started last month, and the Southern Movement--seperatists--suddenly <a href="http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/yemen/south-yemen-separatists-not-in-rush-for-vote-1.2107777">aren&#39;t all that eager to seperate</a>.</p>

<p>This is likely the beginning of the end of this conflict, and I predict that ultimately the Iranian mullahs will be overthrown and the people of Yemen will decide their own fate. The Gulf Cooperation Council is an absolutely immense achievement, and absolutely no one is talking about it. The fact that Arabs and Israelis are now working together to fight extremism is tremendous. </p>

<p>SA and the GCC are making the first steps towards decreasing economic dependence on oil. We can see the first steps taking place now in SA. Pushing to get Aramco listed on the NYSE will create billions of revenue they can push into other areas of the economy. They&#39;re opening to foreign investment. They&#39;ve begun issuing tourists visas, they&#39;ve dismantled their religious police forces. They&#39;re reforming. One of the major hurdles to this transformation is instability in the region, and the GCC seems to be intent on rectifying this. </p>

<p>The Houthis and the NGOs in Yemen have painted a very dire picture, but I think there&#39;s something much larger, and more benign taking place behind the scenes.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The blockades <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/11/30/saudi-arabia-lifted-its-blockade-of-yemen-its-not-nearly-enough-to-prevent-a-famine/?utm_term=.78d4cbeab00d">have been lifted</a>. Yemen is bordered by Saudi Arabia, Oman and water. The primary means for the Iranians to supply the Houthis was via sea. It&#39;s the same reason any country would affect a blockade in war. This is precisely why the article I linked is so important. If the Saudis can take the Houthi-held Hodeidah port, it denies them any material support from Iran, and the entire conflict can be resolved while the Yemenis begin to rebuild. The fact that air strikes began last month, and the blockade lasted for less than a month could be taken as a sign that things are actually progressing. </p>

<p>Again, it&#39;s worth noting that all of the information we&#39;re getting comes from NGOs which are largely passing information along from the Houthis. The article also notes that the situation was dire even before the blockade, so we have no objective metric to determine precisely how damaging they may have been to civilians. And, once again, we see the 10,000 dead number being thrown around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the links and the write up.</p>

<p>I can see that maybe it wasn&#39;t so cut and dry as the media made it out to be. The 130 children a day, 50,000 children dead by the end of the year, one million infected with cholera etc etc</p>

<p>Not that I think these numbers are not accurate but I can see that the Trump admin isn&#39;t solely to blame as the media has tried to frame it. It&#39;s clearly always been a cluster fuck over there and I didn&#39;t know that the blockade came as a result of the Houthis shooting a missile into SA.</p>

<p>Not saying that the blockade can be justifiably argued but regardless of what the government or the military leaders of that region was responsible for, the civilians should never have to suffer in those large numbers as payback, would you agree with me on that? And although the cholera outbreaks may not have been caused directly by the SA coalition&#39;s bombing campaign, although <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=14&amp;amp;v=YcdzEPaLyWk">Senator Murphy(btw what are your thoughts about this information he presented before Congress</a> seems to be arguing that this is case, the fact that they refused to allow even humanitarian aid(Food and Medicine) to enter into the cities to me seems a weaponization of hunger and disease(a war-crime). Even if the blockade has been partially lifted, this was done as a result of international pressure! The US backed SA coalition would have continued this blockade resulting in the continuous deaths of civilians had no one said anything.</p>

<p>I will also mention that SA coalition, despite the lifting of the blockade, is yet to allow fuel from entering into the cities which is preventing hospitals and water treatment facilities from operating again. I see your argument that the fuel can be used by the Houthis for their war efforts but if it&#39;s also causing the deaths of innocent civilians in such staggering numbers, then what should be prioritized? I would still consider that a weaponization of hunger and disease albeit indirectly. </p>

<p>To end, I will concede that I may have fell victim to a over simplified one-sided view pinning all of the civilian deaths on the Trump admin. But that doesn&#39;t mean that war crimes were not committed either as the blockade, regardless of what it was as a result of, caused mass suffering to innocent Yemenis who had nothing to do with the actions of those who rule over them. We cannot also forget that 10,000 innocent civilians were also killed as a result of our backing of this SA Coalition. The reason why I made this post addressing Trump supporters was not to expose the sins of his administration in an effort to benefit Obama or the Democrats. It was simply to question how if Trump is this force of benevolence, draining the swamp and locking up pedos, how could he be allowing all of this to happen in Yemen.</p>

<p>As I have said many times, I have not written Trump off. And I still haven&#39;t. I will be keeping a close eye on him for the upcoming years.</p>

<p>Not saying that the blockade can be justifiably argued because regardless of what the government or the military leaders of that region was responsible for, the civilians should never have to suffer in those large numbers as payback, would you agree with me on that? And although the cholera outbreaks may not have been caused directly by the SA coalition&#39;s bombing campaign, although <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=14&amp;amp;v=YcdzEPaLyWk">Senator Murphy(btw what are your thoughts about this information he presented before Congress</a> seems to be arguing that this is case, the fact that they refused to allow even humanitarian aid(Food and Medicine) to enter into the cities to me seems a weaponization of hunger and disease(a war-crime). Even if the blockade has been partially lifted, this was done as a result of international pressure! The US backed SA coalition would have continued this blockade resulting in the continuous deaths of civilians had no one said anything.</p>

<p>I will also mention that SA coalition, despite the lifting of the blockade, is yet to allow fuel from entering into the cities which is preventing hospitals and water treatment facilities from operating again. I see your argument that the fuel can be used by the Houthis for their war efforts but if it&#39;s also causing the deaths of innocent civilians in such staggering numbers, then what should be prioritized? I would still consider that a weaponization of hunger and disease albeit indirectly. </p>

<p>To end, I will concede that I may have fell victim to a over simplified one-sided view pinning all of the civilian deaths on the Trump admin. But that doesn&#39;t mean that war crimes were not committed either as the blockade, regardless of what it was as a result of, caused mass suffering to innocent Yemenis who had nothing to do with the actions of those who rule over them. We cannot also forget that 10,000 innocent civilians were also killed as a result of our backing of this SA Coalition. The reason why I made this post addressing Trump supporters was not to expose the sins of his administration in an effort to benefit Obama or the Democrats. It was simply to question how if Trump is this force of benevolence, draining the swamp and locking up pedos, how could he be allowing all of this to happen in Yemen.</p>

<p>As I have said many times, I have not written Trump off. And I still haven&#39;t. I will be keeping a close eye on him for the upcoming years.</p>

<p>Yes.  Those are products.  They sold them products which included training, fueling and use of satellite data.  Again, they are not responsible for how those products are used.</p>
