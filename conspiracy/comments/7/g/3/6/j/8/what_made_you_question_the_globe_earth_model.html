    <div class="md"><p>On live feeds?! So they have the technology to digitally generate water on live video feeds, but they still need “invisible wire” to make people float? On top of that, where were the wires when the guy spun in a circle, and what were they attached to? No harness, no tugging of clothes, no visibility of anything except for what the video highlights and wants you to see.....</p>

<p>You’re telling me this was all done digitally, just because?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well now that’s a complete different topic.  The footage of us on the moon is fake, IMO, and it makes sense why. We were in a heated battle with Russia to make it into space, and they beat us to it (maybe, jury is still out if Yuri Gagaran footage was faked as well) so they put together some footage to show the world of our accomplishment. However, I don’t think there is science to back up the fact that we brought film through certain radiation belts in space that would have exposed all the film.</p>

<p>And your idea of circumnavigation is way off. You can fly in one direction, and obviously refueling, will eventually end in the same spot. No one was flying in a giant circle, that’s not how planes work....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All maps are flat....because they’re two dimensional....</p>

<p>And obviously it takes a lot more than “just flying” to fly a plane, but the pilot would also know if they made a big loop by turning they’re plane 180 degrees over an extended period of time..... High up or not, you’d realize the difference between flying over an ocean from one coast to another, or passing the same coast twice..... now you’re basically questioning the intelligence of pilots and astrophysicists under the false pretenses of videos you’re taking out of context</p>

<p>Keeping a secret of flat earth v global earth does nothing.....literally. If a scientist discovered the earth was flat, he’d be excited and want to tell the world, it’d be a scientific breakthrough that would give scientists work for years to come. If someone came out and said “the earth was flat” nothing would change.....that’s where these theories of flat earth have ZERO logic to them. </p>

there is everything else which follows experimentation, but somehow for gravity and relativity, we must follow blindly Einsteins equations that only a &quot;handful of people understand&quot;, maybe if you see the nasa fake videos some day you will be more open-minded to no gravity as we know it and no relativity like tesla said, look it up, tesla vs einstein, Einstein was clownshoes</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem number one, you’re assuming I’ve never researched anything or know anything about anybody.</p>

<p>Even when someone asked Einstein, “how does it feel to be the smartest man in Earth?” He responded, “I don’t know you’ll have to ask Tesla” and I’m sorry, but Einstein wasn’t clown shoes by any stretch of the term. It’s no one else’s fault they haven’t decided to research and come up with their own understandings, theories and equations. </p>

<p>But if regular folk are going to watch YouTube videos and say “well this just isn’t true” there needs to be more than half witted arguments about plane’s movements, ice walls, government mind erasing, edge of the earth, and circular terraforming. </p>

<p>I did my research, as I give everything a chance, and I cane to my conclusion that most everything discussed was silly and couldn’t really be backed by anything other than assumptions and arguments of CGI. </p>

<p>For example, the Himawari 8 weather satellite takes a Live Photo of the planet every 10 minutes.  It’s to keep track of weather, and nothing else. It didn’t need to be a public thing, especially if the earth was flat, why spend millions on CGI for something just for themselves just to portray earth to the public.</p>

<p>But that’s not good enough for anyone, clearly. </p>

<p>Not from somewhere else from some other place. The non physical reality which is formless and without boundaries manifests within itself form and this form is the hologram, what is seen and experienced as the universe. The source is not separate from the hologram, it is the reality in which and out of which the holorgam is made.</p>

<p>Anything with any form is the hologram. It is still real and alive, dont get me wrong. Its not some dead hologram. I use the word hologram only as a kind of a description. </p>

<p>But if you have no form, if you know yourself as that which is without any form, if that is your experience of yourself, then you are beyond the hologram while simultaneously being one with it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Its no ones hologram, its shared by itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Am I a real person like you, or some sick meta program from some unknown creator</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All the bodyminds and the hologram itself are equally real/unreal. The real I is the formless consciousness that projects the hologram within itself.</p>

<p>In order to be an intellectual you need the intellect, you need to think and conceptualise thoughts. If there is no thought the nature of reality is not veiled. Therefore it has nothing to do with being an intellectual. I know you are just trying to annoy but I liked to entertain you for a moment. You only ever come to talk to flat earth threads so dont think I dont see what you are doing.</p>

<p>I dont care if it is outrageous or not, but many people have seen the nature of reality and many will see it and many have spoken of it. No one is forcing you to listen. Just like you dont have to go to the library and read zen books about enlightenment you dont need to listen to me either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I questioned it once I had found out how much the media lies about things and was forced to question absolutely everything I thought I knew about everything. And I saw that people were claiming the Earth was flat, so I looked into it because for all I knew, they were right. I was re-evaluating everything and had realised how wrong it was to just assume stuff was true just because I&#39;d been told it at some point and everyone else seemed to believe it.</p>

<p>But after looking into Flat Earth theory, I realised it wasn&#39;t true and that the Earth is in fact a globe. There&#39;s no reason for anyone to lie about the shape of the Earth, let alone pour enromous amounts of money and resources into keeping up a lie like that, there&#39;s just no benefit to anyone of doing that.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s the story of why I questioned it, although ultimately my questioning led me to the conclusion that it is a globe and that the whole Flat Earth thing is a fake thing made up to try and make conspiracy theorists or truthers seem crazy to others. That&#39;s why you see people popping up trying to talk about Flat Earth on all kinds of truther websites and youtube channels, even if the channel in question doesn&#39;t talk about it or belive it - the aim is to taint them all with this crazy label so that other people who might be swayed by soem of the actual truth about the way the world works will just switch off when they see people trying to say the Earth is flat. I do think a lot of people genuinely believe it&#39;s flat, but they just don&#39;t understand the science properly and are basically reacting to the trauma of discovering how many lies we are told all the time by the &#39;authorities&#39; we have been trained to trust since infancy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very similar story of questioning. I did my research after finding out that history, politics, money, science was in reality different from the doctrine of 18 years of public schooling. I began relearning everything through careful analysis online. I am of the conclusion that the world is indeed globe shaped and is more than likely hollow. I came to this conclusion from many angles. I looked up the deepest hole ever dug to gage the reactions of the discovery. Apparently the hole was dug in Russia during the cold war. It also surprised the scientists because it contradicted their expectations. They had said it was much warmer and more cavernous than they had predicted. There was also a guy that broke down how the mantle/core theory was brought about and the way we came up with an interior for the earth is in itself flawed. I regret not attaching sources but do your research. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s because your eyes can only see so far...again, that’s just a lack of understanding how big the earth is. We’re talking hundreds of miles....</p>

<p>What about the opposite side of the coin? Like James Gallagher, the first pilot to take off from Texas and land at Texas traveling the same direction? Or time zones? Or eclipses? Or Magellan circumnavigating the globe in the 1500s?</p>

<p>I know it’s neat to question things, and I’m a huge conspiracy theorist myself (hence why I’m here), but the “evidence” against a global earth is just a bunch of misunderstandings.</p>

<p>Not to mention, to me, the most obvious of things, why? Why would there be ANY reason to hide the fact of a flat earth, over thousands of years? There’s nothing to gain or lose. Covering up secrets of assassinations, public destruction, or government shadiness makes sense. Every single scientist, astrophysicist, and pilot being silent of the last 100 years.....unlikely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can’t drive without a license because it shows who went through the means to learn how to operate a motor vehicle....it’s not permission, it’s a privilege of allowing others to know you belong on the road without killing everyone....there’s nothing to control either, whether it be round or flat, as someone could potentially “leave” either way....with the same outcome, floating away in space....</p>

<p>Just YouTube it, they explain everything.....who does? And why is videos on YouTube the most credible source. How about someone, ANYONE, who believes the earth is flat, get a piloting license and try flying around the world, instead of making YouTube videos?</p>

<p>You say you understand &#39;basic science&#39; but what exactly is &#39;basic&#39; about the planetary system? There is nothing basic about &quot;aberration&quot; or the &quot;antisolar point&quot;. </p>

<p>People are questioning these things not because they&#39;re insane lol they are addressing obvious holes in what has been presented/taught to us. Is it really...i mean really, so odd that a person questions why he/she doesnt feel the earth moving when we are told that we&#39;re hurling through space at unknown speeds??

    <div class="md"><p>That’s the basic science I’m talking about though! Common knowledge of size v matter. With the speed of the Earth, it still take a full 24 hours to make one rotation, and we do feel the speed, because that’s what is keeping us where we are.</p>

<p>Look at one of those whirly rides at a carnival that you stand in. As the thing speeds up, it pins you back to the wall which you’re standing against. Now imagine the earth as a GIANT one of those. It’s basically doing that to everything at all times. We don’t feel it because it’s the atmosphere and conditions we’ve been born into for millions of years.</p>

<p>Again, I just think this all comes down to the fact that certain people just can’t wrap their head around how big the world is compared to us. Out of ALL the land mass on this planet, there’s still 75% that’s just water. You can walk and walk for days or months (depending on location and direction) and will never see the true edge of land.</p>

<p>I understand it’s fun to think otherwise, and easy to not want to try and understand it, rather just accepting the fact we have a flat land mass floating around in space, but it’s just a slap in the face to every scientist, pilot, astrophysicist and so forth who have done ANYTHING to better our way of life in any way by questioning their intelligence and understanding.</p>

<p>Which is why I go back to my original point. There’s NOTHING will or would have changed at any point in time coming out and saying the Earth is flat. It doesn’t affect anything. Life continues. If anything, it would be considered a scientific breakthrough. But to assume every single scientist, pilot and astronaut has been in on the covering up of this for years and years is just nonsense to me.</p>

<p>Do I believe there are things in this world that have been covered up, absolutely! However most of those would affect people’s daily life much more than this. </p>

<p>And I do know what flat earthers say, because contrary to popular assumptions by said flat earthers, I DO in fact watch videos and research both sides. I don’t just commit to one side without actually looking at stuff. And unfortunately, that’s what a lot of research has led to. So you need to quit assuming I’m just “saying” stuff to say it. I’m one of the reasonably minded people in this sub, who gives both sides a chance. I gave the flat earth theory a chance for a bit, and nothing presented to me was anything convincing.

    <div class="md"><p>That’s the basic science I’m talking about though! Common knowledge of size v matter. With the speed of the Earth, it still take a full 24 hours to make one rotation, and we do feel the speed, because that’s what is keeping us where we are.</p>

<p>Look at one of those whirly rides at a carnival that you stand in. As the thing speeds up, it pins you back to the wall which you’re standing against. Now imagine the earth as a GIANT one of those. It’s basically doing that to everything at all times. We don’t feel it because it’s the atmosphere and conditions we’ve been born into for millions of years.</p>

<p>Again, I just think this all comes down to the fact that certain people just can’t wrap their head around how big the world is compared to us. Out of ALL the land mass on this planet, there’s still 75% that’s just water. You can walk and walk for days or months (depending on location and direction) and will never see the true edge of land.</p>

<p>I understand it’s fun to think otherwise, and easy to not want to try and understand it, rather just accepting the fact we have a flat land mass floating around in space, but it’s just a slap in the face to every scientist, pilot, astrophysicist and so forth who have done ANYTHING to better our way of life in any way by questioning their intelligence and understanding.</p>

<p>Which is why I go back to my original point. There’s NOTHING will or would have changed at any point in time coming out and saying the Earth is flat. It doesn’t affect anything. Life continues. If anything, it would be considered a scientific breakthrough. But to assume every single scientist, pilot and astronaut has been in on the covering up of this for years and years is just nonsense to me.</p>

<p>Do I believe there are things in this world that have been covered up, absolutely! However most of those would affect people’s daily life much more than this. </p>
