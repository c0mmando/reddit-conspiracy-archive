<p>I always liked the Coincidence Theorists Guide to 9/11 as a starting point for people who want to talk &quot;controlled demolitions&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://rigorousintuition.blogspot.ca/2004/08/coincidence-theorists-guide-to-911.html">http://rigorousintuition.blogspot.ca/2004/08/coincidence-theorists-guide-to-911.html</a></p>

<p>Since it focuses on (some of) the shenanigans going on leading up to 9/11, it lays out a great case for the means, motive, and opportunity, without needing to get into the specific forensics of &quot;controlled demolition&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How often do planes drop from the sky because of malfunction or such? I&#39;d say flying a plane is quite failsafe too, especially if it is preprogrammed for a certain route. I can think plenty of more things to go wrong with a prerecorded movie, like independent footage of an explosion but no plane and no eyewitnesses for planes. Then some other things that could be verifiable like having different weather IRL and in the movie, or something happening that&#39;d be visible but couldn&#39;t be predicted and put into the movie.</p>

<p>For some Moon landings I think they could have had recorded some things in advance just to be sure all looks good. But to have it all prerecorded seems impossible to me. I am not sure if the footage especially from the later missions could be faked even today. And that&#39;s only a part of it.</p>

<p>You do realize I hope, since you are at least woke enough to read r/conspiracy even though it&#39;s almost nothing but disinfo, that the planes flew in ways that are physically impossible on 9/11. And there&#39;s a simple explanation for that - It was a prerecorded movie and all the upset relatives and firemen and conspiracy profiles like Jim Fetzer and 9/11 truth are there to make that movie true to you and everyone.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I do, they most probably wasn&#39;t the passenger planes they were supposed to. CGI or not, that much I agree here. Assuming no CGI, if we knew what kind of planes they were it could be proven if they behaved in a physically impossible way. At the moment that they exceeded the limits of the alleged planes they were is not proof to me it was CGI.</p>

<p>Relatives can be upset no matter how people died and I have no doubt whoever was behind the false flag had no issues with getting people killed in whatever way is the most convenient. I don&#39;t know who is Jim Fetzer, but you don&#39;t need to be a public/conspiracy figure to have had a relative die or have witnessed the event.</p>

<p>Why do you think the Pentagon attack was not CGI&#39;d too? Not saying this is an argument against what you&#39;re saying, but asking genuinely.</p>

<p>I think the Pentagon was not hit by a plane either. Also Shanksville. But about the towers I am inclined to say some planes did hit. If there was only the news broadcast footage available I&#39;d be less sure, but there&#39;s plenty more.</p>

<p>Because the conspiracy theorizing that goes on at places like r/conspiracy <em>helps</em> psychologically confirming the event the way they want it to be confirmed – That something <em>real</em> happened and that there where no image fakery involved. The clues to what happened in the contrived conspiracies <em>always</em> looks a the imagery of the event. We can <em>see with our own eyes</em> that 9/11 was a controlled demolition and <em>the camera doesn’t lie</em>. JFK was of course murdered. We all saw that on TV. Let’s scrutinize the imagery to find out what <em>really happened</em> and don’t for once come up with a theory that maybe JFK wasn’t shot at all and that the murder might have been a movie production.</p>

<p>Nope. No evidence that anyone died on 9/11 exist, but since what we&#39;ve see on TV is real if the news anchor says it is, very few people seem to be able to grasp this.</p>

<p>Why would a rocket lose momentum when air gets thinner? I read in the forum that rockets push themselves against air. If no air is present there is nothing to push against.

<p>There’s nothing wrong with thinking like that, it’s just that when it comes to rockets it is not relevant because they cannot operate with this principle. A rocket operates by a chemical reaction that converts its fuel into gas and heat. But if that reaction does not have anything to react against outside the system, like air molecules, then there can simply be no Newtonian action/reaction. So a rocket will for example work in air and water, but if there are no molecules outside the rocket in can react against, as with vacuum, then no movement. This is and has been proven with experiments despite what you can find on Youtube. The rocket experiments there are flawed usually because they use a vacuum chamber that are small enough to let the rocket push against the wall of the chamber and then pressurize the chamber with its own exhaust gasses.</p>

<p>A gun in space would produce a Newtonian action/reaction. Because then the gas expansion have something to react against – the bullet. The gas will push the bullet through the barrel, and in that process push the gun the other way provided the space between the bullet and gun is gas tight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As with your bullet example, you don&#39;t need anything to react with outside the system. Think of replacing the bullet with gas. An explosion will force that out, and keep repeating the process and you have a continuous thrust. Assuming the gas would stay in place like the bullet, but that&#39;s just in the case of a single explosion. For a continuous process where the expelled mass gets more velocity than would happen by just vacuum sucking it out you will have something &quot;to push against&quot;.</p>

<p>If you had two sources of liquid in the vacuum of space, oxidizer and fuel, aimed towards each other from a good distance, they would react upon getting in contact and then expand to every direction due to nothing restraining that reaction. Thus the point of the reaction stays stationary, nothing to react against (other than other molecules produced in the reaction, but net change would be zero).</p>

<p>The restraint in rockets is the combustion chamber and next is the nozzle. They make sure the products of the reaction are pointed at a certain direction and thus it is very much like shooting out bullets. If the chamber &amp; nozzle did not place constraints for the gases they would be going through the vessel to every direction, which would lead to the vessel staying stationary, also being a bit odd.</p>

<p>If the exhaust gases expand to any direction other than equally everywhere (or in some number of directions than cancel each other out), where do they gain their momentum and where is the counter-action to that gained momentum? If you are saying there is such things as actions without counter-action then I don&#39;t know how to discuss this. I can see the laws in action every second and I cannot think of a reason why vacuum would cancel some basic laws.</p>

<p>Logical fallacy. The bullet <em>is</em> something outside the system since it <em>leaves</em> the system permanently.</p>

<p>If you look into it with a mind that not presupposes that rockets have to work in vacuum because satellites/ISS you will find that it is in direct contradiction with known and verified physics. In particular Fluid dynamics and Thermodynamics.</p>

<p>If you want explanations on how GPS, Satellite TV and what we see moving rapidly across our skies are, look into Triangulation, Loran, Skywave and near earth objects/asteroids. This is thoroughly gone through at Cluesforum. And no, you don’t have to buy into that the earth is flat to understand these matters. The Flat Earth campaign is disinfo. The astronomer Ptolemy from 100 AD explains very well in his book Almagest (google almagest English translation) why Earth can be nothing but round.</p>

When a solid/fluid mass transforms into gas as with rockets the molecules cannot magically react with each other and produce Newtonian inertia.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes of course I do. The energy/expansion follows the laws of physics described in fluid/thermal dynamics. If the molecules of a gas expansion encunters no resistance, the will be a free molecular flow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_molecular_flow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_molecular_flow</a>. The gas/heat from a chemical reaction will have no way to convert into kinetic energy if there&#39;s nothing outside the system to react with.

    <div class="md"><p>That light can produce motion is what I&#39;m sceptical of.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would help you to think about it this way: What is pressure? Evenly (because it&#39;s free molecules) distributed gas in an area. More gas more pressure. What is vacuum? No pressure. Absence of gas. So what will free molecules do there? Distribute themselves according to entropy until it gets crowded which it never will because it&#39;s an unrestricted vacuum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed if you take a box of air and open it in space, they will happily distribute themselves freely as you say. Unless you enforce some constraints or build up a heavy pressure that forces them to act in a certain way, like happens in an explosion that produce temperatures &amp; pressure from the mixed components. I can think they way you suggested, but can&#39;t relate that to why gas could not have constraints in vacuum. The Earth places constraints on the gas too. If it didn&#39;t our atmosphere would escape, freely, to space, vacuum, but it doesn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another help for thought: The argument for &quot;rockets work in vacuum because Newton&quot; often brings up high velocity as if that would be a factor. But no matter how fast the chemical reaction is it still have to have something to build up pressure against and that cannot be itself. Imagine bringing down the reaction into slow motion. Each molecule will slowly drift away maybe bounce into something but then find the direction where it will float away into the endless vaccum of space. No interaction. No pressure buildup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess this is pointless if you think free molecules cannot transfer momentum. To each other or to another object.</p>

<p>I wonder how propellers work. It seems gas is interacting with the propeller. Or wind, it tends to feel on your skin or even try to bump you over if the gust is strong enough.</p>

<p>Produce a controlled explosion with molecules bouncing off the object in front of it will lead to momentum transfer from the molecules to the object. A rocket in another words.</p>

<p>After the gas exits the nozzle they indeed are free to do whatever, but while they are constrained they do interact with each other and the nozzle / chamber.</p>

<p>Again, if they didn&#39;t, wouldn&#39;t they pass straight through said object / nozzle / chamber / rocket, without having an effect?</p>

<p>I have the same feeling because you and most others don&#39;t seem to grasp actually very simple physics. Of course a propeller works. But what is the difference between water and vacuum? Molecules. So the molecules in the propeller have something to interact with as opposed to rockets and vacuum. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way an explosion works is that it produces a pressure difference/wave. Think of it as throwing a rock into a pond. The bird that flies by will be unaffected but when it lands in the lake the adjacent fish will notice.</p>

<p>In an unrestricted vacuum like space we get the same effect. The molecules “set free” by the chemical reaction will not have to push any existing molecules away in all directions in the medium to expand (since there simply is no medium). Thus no pressure wave in the medium. Thus no “effect” of the explosion.</p>

<p>Another way to think of it that this is also it means that a vacuum is completely frictionless. No reaction occurs between the molecules in an moving object and  the surrounding ones (since there are none). If you would drop that rock high up in space within earths attraction field it will pick up speed constantly until it encounters the atmosphere. And then as with meteorites it will burn up because of the high momentum it has picked up in the vaccum causing an intense reaction with the surrounding molecules.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. Again slow down the reaction in your mind and watch molecule no 1 pop away from its confinement. It will drift away without interacting with any other molecules since there are none and keep its speed. Then molecule 2 pops and even if it has the exact same direction as no 1 it will never be able to catch up with it and cause a reaction since no 1 is a tiny bit ahead losing no speed. This is what free expansion means. </p>

I understand this is hard to comprehend, because the implications are so vast. But for the sake of sanity just TRY to look at these things without having the things you THINK must be true about Satellites in the back of your head.
Confidence can be good, and bad (arrogance). If it makes any difference, I’m 40+ and hold an MSc, but of course I’ve have not doubted rockets either until I found reason to recently. I’ve been a fool just as much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I appreciate that. Only thing that bothers me here is that you don&#39;t seem to take the last step in explaining your theory. Usually that means someone doesn&#39;t understand what he&#39;s talking about, or doing it on purpose.</p>

<p>I would be plenty happy understanding a major scale fuck us in the ass scenario, going beyond the usual theatrics of money &amp; power.</p>

<p>But still, you have contradicted yourself a few times, saying you think pressure in gas is possible in space, and then it isn&#39;t, and the explanation you have is &quot;free expansion&quot;. I am not sure you understand what that might even means - why particles / molecules move in space the way they do or allegedly do.</p>

<p>What is pressure in gas? Do or don&#39;t the molecules interact with each other?</p>

<p>In some response you said they&#39;d need magic to interact with other objects, if I remember right even with each other. Physics could aswell be magic because we don&#39;t understand it fully, but there are certain reasons why a gaseous volume gain temperature when forced into smaller and smaller volume, and tend to want to expand the more there is pressure. If there is none, one molecule surrounded by vacuum without any significant force acting on it, there is no expansion happening to any direction. It already needs pressure as a prerequisite.</p>

<p>Pressure is born from molecules interacting with each other. If it so happens an explosion happens in a volume, not in a singular point, some of the molecules are forced to move closer to each other, and not follow one and other as in your example of two molecules coming from a singular point. Just like on Earth, in our atmosphere, in vacuum chamber tests, or wherever here, the molecules interact and it manifests as something we call pressure.</p>

<p>If you can have pressure, you already have forces acting, between the molecules in this case, and those forces are directly able to influence other molecules or solid objects, made up of molecules aswell. They don&#39;t need to be molecules even, but apart from the laser example that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been discussing about.</p>

But still it seems you are interpreting equal as better or worse in some regard then saying people are not better or worse. &#39;Equality&#39; was always meant in a human rights context of personhood. We don&#39;t fundamentally disagree here, I just think biology has its own valuable element in the context of humans and races and racism. It is actually a separate point from personhood. We can all generally agree as a society on human rights, but when people are baited into racism itself, based on false biological premises, I think its ok to point out the biological fact that we are one, not different as a whole. As you expressed, we are different individually.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t call a black lab and a yellow lab different races of dog, because the category of &#39;race&#39; is rooted only in culture and not biology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t call them significant. Geneticists wouldn&#39;t either. And no, artificial selection doesn&#39;t quite apply to humans the same as it does for dogs. The point is its up to you to decide where race lines are drawn. Or rather, society, which you&#39;re a part of. Its been done for us, its only natural. Most people go with the obvious, like color. Those lines are fading away nowadays tho. To define one&#39;s race accurately a lot of people need multiple terms. In fact we all do really, its just only obvious on a genetic level not a visual one.</p>

<p>Sorry I made points about our 99.9 percent genetic similarity between any random stranger. If that bothers you, sorry. I seem to be the only one making this point, I think we would be much better off if we all did. Even if you don&#39;t care its still true. </p>

<p>&quot; How many single base pair variations would you expect between yourself and a randomly selected person from a street corner? Sequencing efforts such as the 1000 genomes project give us a rule of thumb. They find about one SNP per 1000 bases. That is, other components set aside, the basis for the claim that people are 99.9% genetically similar.  But this genetic similarity begs the question: how come we feel so different from that person we run into on the street? Well, keep on reading to learn of other genetic differences, but one should also appreciate how our brains are tuned to notice and amplify differences and dispense the unifying properties such as all of us having two hands, one nose, a big brain and so forth. To an alien we probably would all look identical, just like you may see two mice and if their fur coat is the same they would seem like clones even if one is the Richard Feynman of his clan and the other the Winston Churchill&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There absolutely are statistically significant genetic differences between the races. I have read the articles, and I have a PhD in biochemistry. </p>

<p>Here is an example: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1893020/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1893020/</a></p>

<p>And here is the pertinent bit: &quot;sufficient genetic data can permit accurate classification of individuals into populations.&quot;</p>

<p>So, while individuals from different populations (or races) can be more genetically similar to each other than they are with another member of their race, a scientist could look at the genetics of an individual and accurately determine what their race is. I hope that makes sense.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why on earth would that bother me? Its actually completely beside the point. Most genetic elements are highly conserved because they are required for basic biochemical processes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Appreciate that. I don&#39;t think its completely besides the point in the context of this thread tho,  where Im trying to emphasize the greater* similarities between different populations (or races) of our species, specifically because people who aren&#39;t interested in biology don&#39;t often bother to distinguish between the words races and species in a literal sense. They do it to make a point about Us vs Them and promote separation or inferiority, and like another theme in this thread, there is good reason to make a case for our similarities. You&#39;re making a big point about such a small genetic difference rather than make the point about the gigantic genetic similarities. Thank you for making the point, its just the science, but its also better to clarify what you mean in this particular context. A conspiracy thread with a racial debate. And the more proper term is populations right? Aren&#39;t there many subsets of populations? Does society determine all those subsets when using the word race?</p>

<p>Anyway, I understand a geneticist can determine a shit ton about an individual on that basis, thanks for the link! But is it really A or B or C in the way that people regularly use the word race? I appreciate correcting me if I&#39;m wrong, but would the geneticist say this person is Asian, and leave it at that? It wouldn&#39;t be more complicated? Because that&#39;s how most of the world sees the word race. I don&#39;t know if &quot;Sufficient genetic data can permit accurate classification of individuals into populations&quot; can simply be translated to &#39;can determine your race.&#39; And even then the differences in how we live and experience our lives is not very extreme. The wording is exact for a reason it seems because its a scientific hereditary perspective, not a classification by means of superficial color-coded people.</p>

<p>Look, most of my motivation was to point out how we are probably 1000x <em>more</em> alike than we are different, is that so crazy? I should have made it succinct and clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, its a very nuanced subject. And like you said and like the paper I linked says, we are very similar, and people of different populations or races can sometimes (but not usually) be more similar to one another than other individuals within their own population or race!</p>

<p>I think people go to far on both sides. One will say &quot;the races are completely different, I&#39;m nothing like people from that other race. None of them are as smart as I am!&quot; And the other side says, &quot;No, race is only skin color. Otherwise we are all exactly the same.&quot;</p>

<p>I think the truth is somewhere in between those two extremes. It is a very touchy subject, and made more complicated because our definition of what makes a race is arbitrary and not based on anything scientific really. </p>

<p>But I think there are undeniable differences between, say someone from Kenya who&#39;s ancestors have been there for hundreds of generations, and someone who is likewise pure Japanese. The physiological differences that we see are not purely aesthetic. It would be intellectually dishonest to say that those genetic differences that lead to those physiological differences do not have some effect on the brain, and therefore behavior, personality and intellect as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s crazy stuff, how it might be the opposite of what appearances might tell you, or it might be spot on. I think another aspect is that we drifted apart for so long, and now (since antiquity) our populations are mingling again, so its just a big messy pie.</p>

<p>I suppose a good lesson to reference is not to get the &quot;ought from the is&quot;</p>

<p>Nature is brutal and beautiful and apathetic all the same. We shouldn&#39;t be looking at the way something IS, in nature or in modern culture or whatever, to then determine what OUGHT to be. We can make that determination ourselves. </p>

<p>You made a good point that its just extreme on either side of the idea. One side fears loss of culture or control, whereas the other fears neo social darwinism used against them or others. Both are valid fears in their own respects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has multiple meanings. Equality in rights and obligations is one where we are both on the same side i suppose.
Then there is equality which means equal in capabilities which is not true for any two persons. Which also means I did not make any assumptions of &quot;races&quot; as a whole. I am speaking about individuals, there is no other way to compare. That example about asians being better in mathematics is worthless, if mathematics is not the thing that counts in a given situation. Every person has different capabilities in all the fields there are. THIS is why I say there is and has never been nor will ever be equality. Not between two white people, not between to black people not between a white and a black, because race does not matter, the individual does.
Then there is equality in status which I did not even touch yet. The color of your skin should have nothing to do with that in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m x-posting this from another thread I just posted this in, about this exact topic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 6 million number. Plain and simple.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying millions didn&#39;t die. I&#39;m not saying denying a holocaust ever happened. I&#39;m simply saying, the fact that &quot;historians&quot; cling to this number so hard is half of the reason why there are &quot;revisionist historians&quot; in the first place.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen the number of times the 6 million figure was used before WW2, and it&#39;s religious implications? Check out this for examples.</p>

<p>Even when they drastically changed the official number of those who died in camps, the total 6 million number remained unchanged by attributing the difference to other categories.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m really trying to say is that there is MUCH more to the tragedies of WW2 than you&#39;ve most likely ever been told. Unfortunately, you&#39;re forbidden to ever question the narrative we&#39;ve all been given (after all, the victors write the history books, right?). It&#39;s even illegal in some countries to question the narrative.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not some anti-Semetic lunatic, nor am I trying to be disrespectful to anyone by asking either. But I feel that the amount of effort put into making sure that nobody challenges the official narrative with legitimate scrutiny, really just raises even more questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>mate there is a mountain of proof... i will send you it but you have to fact check it yourself please.   in this case its easy to see which is truth and which is big business propadanda.  as they can&#39;t openly lie.  but if you ask any zoo keeper or anyone who studies physiology its right there as proven science.
we are apes,   great apes in fact.  the difference between monkeys and apes is that monkeys have tails.   all apes are frugivores/herbivore.</p>

<p>our closest relatives are   gorilla chimpanzie, bonobo and orangutan.   all are frugivores.</p>

<p>we have very similar anatomy  (organs)  if you feed these apes meat... they get the same diseases as sick people in who eat western food..</p>

I&#39;ve also looked up anything i could on google and as I suspected most of the &quot;articles&quot; are just that. articles and not scientific experiences or understanding. I studied history for years and i can&#39;t even fathom how humans would have been able to evolve the way we have without the higher nutrient value and proteins found in animal meat. We don&#39;t need to eat half as much as we do today, but i just can&#39;t get on board with the ban all meat wagon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>its not the case my friend.   what the health is 100% correct (((They)))
just don&#39;t want you to know it... if you look into it there is stacks of evidence to prove it.</p>

<p>diabetes is caused by intracellular fat, that stops sugar from getting into the cells to builds up.</p>

<p>things you can check for yourself...   our cells are fueled by sugar (glycogen)  why would our fuel be a problem to us?</p>

<p>as soon as you go low fat high carb   diabetes will start to resolve in a matter of a few days.</p>

<p>consider why there are so many what the health advocates and high carbers who are thriving, the raw food diet is considered to be the healthiest.... as can be plainly seen these foods break down into sugar and not fat.</p>

<p>please look at the reviews of these books</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true. The majority of the time when I raise these issues to the average Joe they probably think I mean all this data that they&#39;re collecting will be used against us immediatly, but it&#39;s definitely more a case of it sitting in the cloud in case you become a problem and they need to dig up dirt. They know the world is becoming more unstable so they build profiles on everybody so they can prevent uprisings. It&#39;s not to catch terrorists anyway, at least it isn&#39;t in my opinion. It&#39;s population control. The push for censorship, closed internet and the surveillance state is basically turning the west into a prison. We&#39;re funding it all as well, and being shamed into censoring ourselves. There is way too many layers to this mess.</p>

Corporations use data mining pretty heavily for advertising and shit. Also I think that conspiracy theorists are getting more and more accepted nowadays at least among my age group. Shows like Stranger Things are pretty popular and once people realize that MKULTRA is real they start going down the rabbit hole. Also when I get intoxicated I sometimes let that shit out and people are surprisingly accepting of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really nice share, thank you. Love me some Jefferson v Hamilton historical political theory. </p>

<p>A shame that the US experiment failed so miserably by paying only lip service to Jefferson whilst executing Hamiltonian principles in practice. Look where that&#39;s gotten us!</p>

<p>The gist of Rose&#39;s argument is that people can&#39;t collectively confer powers (or rights) that they do not themselves individually have. The semantics of powers v rights makes no difference in this context. The establishment of an institution to execute through a monopoly of force objectives which would be immoral if done individually doesn&#39;t make the objectives moral. Or to say it another way, if an individual doesn&#39;t have the right to encroach on someone else, they can&#39;t morally gain that right or imbue an institution with that power through collective action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference is big tho. The powers are...</p>

<p>A. Conditional (can be taken away by laws) B. Limited (are defined individually, rather than saying &quot;anything but these things&quot;) and C. They exist to protect the rights of people. How does anyone have any guarantee of rights without any ability whatsoever for anyone at all to protect them? If you don&#39;t have it guaranteed then it isn&#39;t a right. Obviously this isn&#39;t a retail guarantee, it means that if your rights are violated then you have the right to use the powers of the state. Otherwise, I can punch you, and I didn&#39;t have the right, but guess what, no one has the right to do anything about it. Give limited powers and grant </p>

<p>I understand the sort of moral paradoxical dilemma, but it kinda just leads to anarchy in a way. Which Id be fine with if the masses could handle it. But they don&#39;t fare that well. Not at this point in history. Maybe Im wrong. Im not against it per say its just unrealistic. It just won&#39;t happen, governments or groups of leaders will inevitably form together, you can&#39;t avoid that with a pretty philosophy. Its like dodging the rain. Its better to develop a system that can get wet.</p>

<p>The system is broken because advertising and political science and industrial revolution and military industrial compx has been festering with greed for hundred years plus... but there is a <em>big</em> difference between a bad idea, and a bad execution of a good idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The moral imperative of nonviolence, or more specifically non aggression, <em>precedes</em> the concept of government - or how humans choose to self-organize. Yes, it does sort of lead to anarchy in a way, or to say it another way - anarchy is the default state of humanity. And I&#39;m with you on being fine with it if the masses could handle it. But, you are absolutely correct in that they aren&#39;t. I don&#39;t know that governments are necessarily the way humans would choose to self-organize given current technology, but so many people think that&#39;s the only way to do it. I don&#39;t know what the answer is, but I do know that increasing the size and scope of government - the direction the US has been headed - isn&#39;t the right answer.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you escape greed - it is a fundamental human motivation - but you can reduce the scale of the systems available to humans (and cabals) to hijack for their own purposes. I don&#39;t think democracy is necessarily a very good idea at any type of large scale. Maybe that&#39;s the key to functional execution - scale.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Money used to be backed by gold, the gold standard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is pretty much correct. Silver was also used in the US, which raised another host of problems, because silver&#39;s value relative to gold changed a lot faster than the laws governing the amount of gold and silver in a dollar.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So our money was worth whatever because it was backed by gold.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A dollar could buy a certain number of grains of gold. What it could buy in things people actually bought, like food, or real estate, or clothes, was <a href="http://www.in2013dollars.com/1800-dollars-in-2016">all over the place</a>. It turns out the value of gold can fluctuate just as much as anything else. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>at some point in the last 100 years or so the gold that backed the money was taken out of the vaults</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just straight up false. The US still has over 8000 tons of gold in Fort Knox and other repositories throughout the nation. One of the reasons the US went completely off the gold standard in the 1970s was because maintaining it was draining our gold reserves so quickly. When we left the gold standard, we just said we would no longer buy dollars with gold. We didn&#39;t do anything with our gold.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they just started printing, money inflating, being Worth actual dog shit, if that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you think money is worth dog shit, I have a dog, and I will gladly trade his shit for the content of your bank account. I am guessing you won&#39;t take me up on that, because money is not worth dog shit, it is worth what you are willing to buy and sellers are willing to sell for it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So basically our money is symbolic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People use it. It has value. It is not symbolic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And that wars are usually in the search of the petro-dollar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That just doesn&#39;t make sense. The US economy is over 10 times the size of the entire world oil trade, and why would we invade countries and destroy the oil producing capacity if we wanted to them to trade oil in dollars?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very gross oversimplification and details are shakey</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. That was flat out incorrect.</p>

Even if you want to ignore who signed a new 99-year lease 2 months before, took out insurance specific to terrorist acts.. the same person who decided to &quot;pull&quot; WTC7.  All that aside.. isn&#39;t it abundantly clear to anyone with eyes, that something isn&#39;t right?  That no skyscraper has ever collapsed in 14 seconds (WTC1/2) or 8 seconds (WTC7).</p>

<p>9/11 was a day that 8 indestructible titanium fanned engines vanished.. isn&#39;t that weird?</p>

<p>This is our generations JFK.. the clear to be seen video evidence (or suppression of video evidence), obvious collusion, the mountains of omitted testimonies from eye witnesses hearing explosions - pilots that say the Pentagon maneuvers were impossible for a 747, let alone an amateur pilot to do, even the BBC finding all of the &quot;terrorists&quot; still being alive.  </p>

<p>And with all of this rudimentary stuff.. the mere mention of the subject means you&#39;re talking about a conspiracy theory.  A term as synonymous with crazy as Kleenex is with tissue.  The meaning of the word has been lost.. obviously people conspired the events to occur, the planes didn&#39;t crash themselves.</p>

Steel skyscrapers have burnt for +12hrs down to their frame and not collapsed.

 So all the floor pancaked ontop of each other.. that&#39;s the official story.. so why wasn&#39;t there dozens of stories worth of concrete stacked on stop of each other?
Instead all concrete turns to dust and seems to have thermite particles within.  Molten steel at ground zero which could not be extinguished for 3 months and what was safe to handle was exported to China before experts could investigate.  Of 2 pieces of steel that FEMA gained access too, they found traces of thermite too.
Simple fact is.. building don&#39;t collapse in seconds, ever. When investigation was delayed, underfunded and conducted by people with ulterior motives.. it is clear that it needs to be done again and properly.
University of Alaska aren&#39;t far away from releasing a thorough report on WTC7 right now..

    <div class="md"><p>A bomber accidentally crashing into a building and then a fully loaded airliner crashing into a building as fast as they can get it to go aren&#39;t comparable in the least bit. That&#39;s like comparing a car bumping into a pedestrian in a crosswalk and causing a bruise to a guy going 70 on the interstate in a semi running into a dude and saying but wait why did the guy on the interstate turn to mush! </p>

<p>As far as the thermite I don&#39;t know a lot about it but I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s made of a lot of common materials that could be explained by things the building was built with/already contained inside. Also there were workers cutting down pieces of the structure still standing in order to clean debris and search for bodies. They probably left a lot of materials behind. </p>

<p>The real cover-up with 9/11 is all the first responders and workers being exposed to toxic chemicals and getting very sick and dying. Some of them being denied funds to get medical attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I havent heard anything about that but think of it this way, every flammable substance has a temperature at which it burns at. As people have pointed out, jet fuel does not burn at the melting point of steel. But you can light a match and use it to ignite kerosene for example, which would burn at a different temperature than the wooden match originally did. The plane was like a match, it started the fire, and then the various materials within the building burned at their own different temperatures. Some of which, could have been hot enough to melt steel beams. But again, the melting point is just the point where the steel turns into a liquid. But it can become weakened and deformed at a much lower temperature. So the beams didnt need to “melt” in order for the building to fall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only is it how buildings like that fall, it is how buildings like that are supposed to fall, if they fall. They aren&#39;t supposed to snap and fold over, because they would cause far greater destruction to surrounding areas and other buildings. </p>

<p>Perfectly good point about the logic of taking out terrorist insurance because of the previous attacks, and also because the building were extremely symbolic and logical terrorist targets. On top of the this, the Eiffel Tower was also an intended target in 1994 by hijackers of Air France 8969 in 1994, who intended to carry out a similar attack to what occurred in 2001, so it is completely logical that immensely symbolic buildings like the WTC towers, were covered by terrorism-specific insurance policies.  </p>

For someone this invested, and this confident, it is almost impossible that they will ever take a backward step now, even in the face of overwhelming evidence that their position is wrong.</p>

<p>To cap it off, you have to paint a picture of people who don&#39;t share your version of reality, as all being stupid and credulous enough to think that the media would not lie to them or misrepresent information. Classic straw-man debating tactic.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how you have made any case whatsoever that Trump&#39;s presidency has proven that a uni-party form of government exists in the United States either, the two major parties may receive lobbying and funding from the same sources frequently, but if anything, all Trump&#39;s ascendency to the presidency has displayed, is how far off the political spectrum the Republican party in the United States has flown, and how easily convinced people can be convinced that a candidate can be an attractive option, based on nothing more than outrage manufacturing, slogans and bluster.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not really. I don&#39;t think that Dunning Krueger is the correct term I am looking for, although it does have some connection to what I am talking about. People who are so confident about their enlightened status relative to others, often do so because they lack the cognitive ability to be able to discern the flaws in their own thinking, or the adequate critical thinking abilities to adequately critique their own positions. However despite studies that have pointed out some correlation between lower levels of education and lower levels of cognitive abilities, with higher tendencies to believe in one, or multiple conspiracy theories, many extremely intelligent people have been avid believers of conspiracies that have been turned out to be false. On top of this, some conspiracy theories, have turned out to be true. </p>

<p>I think I am more pointing to the issues of close-mindedness and tribal thinking, emotional attachment to a position, as well as perhaps, emotional maturity when it comes to conspiracy theories and theorists. It is so evident when you come to this sub, that the conspiracy theorists here, especially those super confident in their own enlightened thinking abilities, relative to the average member of the public who falls for &quot;official lines&quot;, suffer simultaneously from both super cynicism and super gullibility. They have an emotional attachment to one position, and therefore display very little scepticism towards their own positions, yet extreme scepticism to any official positons. </p>

<p>Many people, the elderly especially, overdose on their meds because if it says take every 4 hours as needed they just fucking take it like clockwork. People od all the time without even taking more than the recommended dose. It&#39;s fucking sickening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your comment illustrates your backwards thinking. Do you not realize how many people die right after getting chemo? Or how many gradually suffer and die from chemo with their cancer never being fully cured? I could hold up the names of any of those people and say &quot;and you would end up like Jane Doe&quot; in response to someones decision to use chemotherapy.</p>

<p>Do you not see how stupid your comment is? You act like I claimed everyone who uses a natural modality will be cured and survive, which I never claimed. The question is which modality is more appropriate and offering a better chance of survival and quality of life?</p>

<p>On the other hand, your asinine Steve Jobs comment implies that YOU think everyone who gets chemo will be cured and live happily-ever-after...which is just plain ignorant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Some cancers might respond to it, but only a select group of it.&quot;</p>

<p>And you know this how? From what I have discovered all cancers respond to high-doses of cannabinoids. Many but not all respond to IV Vitamin C, many but not all respond to apricot pits, ALL respond to a whole-foods plant based diet. There are more of course but I don&#39;t have the time or energy to go in the detail on every one.</p>

<p>&quot;Chemo on the other hand is a nuclear bomb. It will kill the cancer a lot of the times, problem is it could very well take you out to.&quot;</p>

<p>Most of the time chemo will take you out. Sometimes gradually, sometimes right away. They are each poisonous after all. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t fail to appreciate the point I made in my original post--what research does exist that compares no-treatment to a chemo regimen implies that those receiving no-treatment actually fared better than those who did. Of course the records of these studies by Hardin Jones can only be accessed at the Berkeley library and the other study done by Linus Pauling can be found by purchasing a collection of his research.</p>

<p>Chemo has never been properly studied in a no-treatment placebo-controlled fashion. Not even in animals. Or if the animal studies have been done they are no where to be found (perhaps because they are being surprised due to what they reveal). If you want to &quot;nuke&quot; your body go ahead, but in my opinion you would be making a grave mistake and accepting an anti-scientific treatment modality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look man I&#39;m not completely disagreeing with you. Chemo is definetely poison. The oncologists I know even advertise it as such. However that poison does save some people lives. I know people personally that have gone into full remission because of chemo. To say they would have lived otherwise is simply not true. </p>

<p>There is obviously a huge push by big pharma to sell chemo, and yes it&#39;s probably overused. Right now I work with a lady who has breast cancer. He insurance won&#39;t cover a mastectomy, but they will let her get all the chemo she wants. It&#39;s fucking crazy. She is going to probably due because of this and it makes me sick. The chemo isn&#39;t working and her fucking hair is falling off and her skin is literally pealing off every surface of her body. </p>

<p>Some cancers respond to natural remedies and some don&#39;t. There is a severe lack of research into this for sure, but if every cancer patient went with these treatments more people would die. If chemo didn&#39;t work then survival rates of cancer patients would not be improving. Its dangerous to advise every patient to not use chemo and stick with a holistic approach. Diet is definetely a big factor but Its absolutely not going to simply cure all cancers or be better than medical treatment. Though every patient should eat a strict diet. </p>

<p>Some cancers are certainly better left without chemo and radiation, like slow moving prostate cancer, but sometimes chemo is going to be necessary to survive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, but you have to understand that I am not saying that everyone who receives chemo will die. Some will survive the assault of the toxins and if their cancers do not then they survive cancer free. This does happen. What I take issue with is your other statements:</p>

<p>&quot;To say they would have lived otherwise is simply not true.&quot;</p>

<p>How do you know that these people would not have survived and even thrived using, say, high doses of cannabinoids instead of chemo? It&#39;s like a mantra that you have without any sort of rational basis. Do you just believe this without any reason? If so, maybe you should confront that within yourself. </p>

<p>&quot;Some cancers respond to natural remedies and some don&#39;t. There is a severe lack of research into this for sure, but if every cancer patient went with these treatments more people would die.&quot;</p>

<p>Again, what are you basing these statements on? Have you done a comprehensive study that proves what you are saying to be true--or have you just been weakened by decades of propaganda to the point where you simply believe it without question?</p>

<p>&quot;If chemo didn&#39;t work then survival rates of cancer patients would not be improving.&quot;</p>

<p>So do you mean to tell me you have accounted for all other possible confounding variables, such that this is a rational statement? If you haven&#39;t done so you are--again--merely begging the question.</p>

<p>&quot;but sometimes chemo is going to be necessary to survive.&quot;</p>

<p>And again--based on what do you claim this? You can&#39;t just keep making bald statements like this and fail to justify them with actual research that shows the people you think &quot;need&quot; chemo and chemo only would not have done better with a natural modality. It&#39;s just blatant cognitive bias otherwise.</p>

<p>And I must reiterate: Chemo has never been properly studied in a no-treatment placebo-controlled fashion. Not even in animals. The irony is, it is that type of study that would be required to substantiate each of your statements that I have highlighted above--but the studies have not been done, so unless you can put up something of substance other than your baseless statements, your beliefs about chemo are merely unfounded biases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. This study does very little to illustrate a proper comparison. Read the abstract--they looked at people who were marked as &quot;other&quot; and who did not receive chemo. This does nothing to compare alternative vs conventional treatments. For all we know, these people could have been given injections of dishsoap.</p>

<p>For instance, look at one of the studies used for comparison (in the citations at the bottom): </p>

<p>&quot;Alternative medicine--the risks of untested and unregulated remedies.</p>

<p>Angell M, Kassirer JP.
Comment on
Clinical and biologic activity of an estrogenic herbal combination (PC-SPES) in prostate cancer. [N Engl J Med. 1998]
Butyrolactone-induced central nervous system depression after ingestion of RenewTrient, a &quot;dietary supplement&quot;. [N Engl J Med. 1998]

Clinical problem-solving. A leading question. [N Engl J Med. 1998]
Contamination of botanical dietary supplements by Digitalis lanata. [N Engl J Med. 1998]&quot;</p>

<p>This list of studies used for this study show that they were studying adulterated asian remedies and dangerous central nervous system depressants. This tells us nothing other than the remedies tested in these studies were dangerous, contaminated and/or ineffective.</p>

<p>This also shows us that the study you linked was a meta-analysis of other studies that themselves were meta-analyses. In other words meta-meta-analysis--quite possibly the poorest quality data that can be derived.</p>

<p>What you need to do is find natural treatments that have been shown to be effective, find people who used only those treatments and not conventional, and compare them to people who only used conventional. Two agents that need to be tested in this manner are IV Vitamin C and Cannabinoids. A direct (IE not metaanalytical) comparison of this manner needs to be made. </p>

<p>Otherwise the &quot;Alternatives&quot; that are being referred to in these metaanalytical studies may simply be toxic, unregulated substances that are only &quot;alternative&quot; in that they are not legally permitted for use in a conventional setting. This mixed-bag approach tells us nothing of substance.</p>

<p>Try again.</p>

<p>Muslims aren&#39;t our enemy, but the Quran is the single most fucked up religious text ever written which encourages and rewards violence against innocent people. Muslims can be progressive, and that&#39;s all fine and dandy, but the Quran itself is a problem. I see what you&#39;re saying though, yeah, the demonizing of Muslims and targeting of them as nothing more than a threat to our existence, instead of the human beings that they are is bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The New Testament? You mean the Old Testament, right? The Old Testament doesn&#39;t contain even 10% of the justifications and encouragements of violence against innocent people that the Quran does, and most of the time those calls to violence in the Old Testament are specific, given by God himself for the unique situations, according to the writers of the Old Testament. They are not often open ended declarations of obligation to kill those that refuse to believe in Allah. It is very, very different. I am not saying this as a Christian, I&#39;m agnostic. I tried to find out the truth about the Quran versus the Bible, and I thought I&#39;d find that the Quran was no worse than the Old Testament, but I was wrong. It is many times worse. They aren&#39;t even remotely comparable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I meant old testament. Fixing it now. Trust me I found alot of the quaran verses downright barbaric and they are if you read them with no context or with a misunderstanding of the language.. I can&#39;t find it now but it was on YouTube a video of an actual religious scholar on some panel show. She was explaining how some of the most popular verses that are used to paint all muslims as dangerous,because at first glance they seem brutal, with the context it made more sense. I think all religion is wacky anyways but it&#39;s dangerous to single one out and go thats the dangerous one when they all have done harm</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t agree more, it is dangerous to single out people, but that&#39;s why I say there is a problem with the Quran. There&#39;s nothing wrong with Muslims inherently, there&#39;s something disturbingly wrong with the Quran, and Hadith as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://quran.com/3/28">Verse 3:28</a> in the Quran tells Muslims to not &quot;take allies&quot; of nonbelievers instead of Muslims, except to protect themselves from those nonbelievers, i.e. don&#39;t befriend nonbelievers when you can befriend Muslims. It further warns Muslims to not befriend non-Muslims, for if they do, they &quot;have nothing with Allah&quot;.</p>

<p>Then <a href="https://muflihun.com/bukhari/49/857">verse 49:857</a> of Sahih al-Bukhari very plainly justifies lying if the ends justify the means.</p>

<p>That&#39;s very different from God commanding you to not make friends with non believers or face God&#39;s punishment for disobeying him, explicitly. They&#39;re very, very different things.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But that is the context that is given for every single violent verse in the Quran, and there are hundreds. That&#39;s the problem, there&#39;s so much room for radicalism it&#39;s ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and in the U.S. they have killed a whopping 11 people in 25 years. Outside the U.S., particularly in Africa, there are a handful of very violent Christian terrorist organizations, and they have kill counts in the hundreds, yes. Without even counting 9/11 however, the kill count of Islamic extremism in the U.S. is about half way to 1,000, and if you look at global numbers for Islamic extremism, you&#39;re looking at numbers that makes the Christian terrorists in Africa look like a peaceful protest. Seriously. The two are completely incomparable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always figure: if there&#39;s a book that says that you should kill people who disagree with you, and someone decides that they believe that book to be Truth with a capital T and the word of God himself.... said person is imminently dangerous.

<p>The main problem is that it only takes a few nutcases to begin acting on that book and what you end up with is a horde of complicit people who, while not themselves acting on its instructions to kill, are willing to stand by in silence and allow it. And this is what we find with the majority of Muslims worldwide.</p>

<p>So, while they&#39;re not all actively terrorists.... there is a problem, and they are directly involved in the problem. Until they speak out and denounce said aspects of their books, we all ought to be wary.</p>

<p>That&#39;s where I differ, although the text of the Quran and related holy books does make me suspicious of Muslims, I wouldn&#39;t say I regard all Muslims as &quot;a problem&quot;. My biggest complain with Islam is that even if you could explain away &quot;the truth&quot; of the Quran and related holy books, it still leaves open many opportunities to be interpreted in a way that justifies violence, lying, and other nefarious behavior. The Bible, on the other hand, does not. I&#39;m not religious, so my perspective on this is to approach religion pragmatically. The Quran is way too open to extremist interpretation. It is <em>no</em> surprise that we have a problem with radical terrorism in the middle east. It would be more surprising if we didn&#39;t. That&#39;s the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To clarify: the people are a problem in the sense that a book itself is powerless but it takes people who believe it to manifest its violence into real life. Thus my point that if the book is problematic, the people who believe it to be infallible truth are problematic, as they will be the only ones to manifest its commands into real life. </p>

<p>And I agree with the rest of what you wrote in the sense that Christianity has a very different, and ultimately peaceful message. The two are definitely not the same and that pretty much boils down to the nature of their founders: Christ (how he is portrayed at least, leaving aside the historicity aspect) vs. Mohammed are two very different examples to follow. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat earth. People too lazy and too brainwashed to even begin to think it might be true. So flat earth is the most frustrating and difficult to talk about. Because so many will shoot you down and have the whole crowd laughing at you, because at the end of the day, it sounds crazy, and people seem to love mocking and making fun of someone whenever they find the option. Reminds me of the old tribal times, where if you say something so backwards you are ostracized and tossed out of the group and nobody wants to be seen as someone who may be on your side because then they may be kicked out of the &quot;smart and know all&quot; group. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calories. Fat was strategically demonized to take the heat off sugar. Keep in mind that in the world of calories fat is more than double the calories per gram of sugar (carbs). This give sugar the appearance of being healthy and half as fattening as fat. Why would they do this? Fat costs 10x more than carbs. Convince the population that carb calories are more food for less calories and even make the cals BOLD on the label. Then people will fill up on the cheap stuff instead of demanding value for their food dollars. Calories have convinced people to get less food for their money. A perfect scam. Nobody on r/fitness will accept this, but anyone who understand math and business knows I speak the truth. </p>

I than proceeded to show him example after example of billions of dollars of us aid being given to improve the internet and ISP&#39;s doing nothing. Still thinks it&#39;s a good idea to dismantle NN because 2/4 roommates are gamers and apparently we ruin the internet. More like his 10 yr old Dell and iPhone 4 are what fuck the internet. </p>

The seemingly brigaded veritas post from last night highlights it, hundred of upvotes for someone claiming all American conservatives are immoral, honorless idiots incapable of seeing how being liberal is right. We are all more alike than different but we are much more controllable if we are pitted against one another. There are forces in this sub who want more than anything to do just that, and our emotional reactions are allowing them to succeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The New Testament? You mean the Old Testament, right? The Old Testament doesn&#39;t contain even 10% of the justifications and encouragements of violence against innocent people that the Quran does, and most of the time those calls to violence in the Old Testament are specific, given by God himself for the unique situations, according to the writers of the Old Testament. They are not often open ended declarations of obligation to kill those that refuse to believe in Allah. It is very, very different. I am not saying this as a Christian, I&#39;m agnostic. I tried to find out the truth about the Quran versus the Bible, and I thought I&#39;d find that the Quran was no worse than the Old Testament, but I was wrong. It is many times worse. They aren&#39;t even remotely comparable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I meant old testament. Fixing it now. Trust me I found alot of the quaran verses downright barbaric and they are if you read them with no context or with a misunderstanding of the language.. I can&#39;t find it now but it was on YouTube a video of an actual religious scholar on some panel show. She was explaining how some of the most popular verses that are used to paint all muslims as dangerous,because at first glance they seem brutal, with the context it made more sense. I think all religion is wacky anyways but it&#39;s dangerous to single one out and go thats the dangerous one when they all have done harm</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As with your bullet example, you don&#39;t need anything to react with outside the system. Think of replacing the bullet with gas. An explosion will force that out, and keep repeating the process and you have a continuous thrust. Assuming the gas would stay in place like the bullet, but that&#39;s just in the case of a single explosion. For a continuous process where the expelled mass gets more velocity than would happen by just vacuum sucking it out you will have something &quot;to push against&quot;.</p>

<p>If you had two sources of liquid in the vacuum of space, oxidizer and fuel, aimed towards each other from a good distance, they would react upon getting in contact and then expand to every direction due to nothing restraining that reaction. Thus the point of the reaction stays stationary, nothing to react against (other than other molecules produced in the reaction, but net change would be zero).</p>

<p>The restraint in rockets is the combustion chamber and next is the nozzle. They make sure the products of the reaction are pointed at a certain direction and thus it is very much like shooting out bullets. If the chamber &amp; nozzle did not place constraints for the gases they would be going through the vessel to every direction, which would lead to the vessel staying stationary, also being a bit odd.</p>

<p>If the exhaust gases expand to any direction other than equally everywhere (or in some number of directions than cancel each other out), where do they gain their momentum and where is the counter-action to that gained momentum? If you are saying there is such things as actions without counter-action then I don&#39;t know how to discuss this. I can see the laws in action every second and I cannot think of a reason why vacuum would cancel some basic laws.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Logical fallacy. The bullet <em>is</em> something outside the system since it <em>leaves</em> the system permanently.</p>

<p>If you look into it with a mind that not presupposes that rockets have to work in vacuum because satellites/ISS you will find that it is in direct contradiction with known and verified physics. In particular Fluid dynamics and Thermodynamics.</p>

<p>If you want explanations on how GPS, Satellite TV and what we see moving rapidly across our skies are, look into Triangulation, Loran, Skywave and near earth objects/asteroids. This is thoroughly gone through at Cluesforum. And no, you don’t have to buy into that the earth is flat to understand these matters. The Flat Earth campaign is disinfo. The astronomer Ptolemy from 100 AD explains very well in his book Almagest (google almagest English translation) why Earth can be nothing but round.</p>
