<p>I&#39;m saying regardless of who you vote for,
They rig the primaries of both sides and it doesn&#39;t matter. They then select the &quot;puppet&quot; they want, (based on the climate or what &quot;angle&quot; or script the social engineers wrote up), the electoral college vote them in, and you have your puppet.</p>

<li> Rothschild connection anti-establishment.  So what if our President was doing business with folks that worked for organizations that are connected to the Rothschilds?  Do they not have their &quot;hands&quot; into almost everything on this planet?  Wilber Ross was hired for his knowledge and experience.  If he does not do the job per our president&#39;s agenda, he will move out and move along.  What is your definition of &quot;establishment&quot;?</li>
</ol>

<p>About meeting with Henry Kissinger...do you know what was said at the meetings?  Know thy enemy!</p>

<p>Trump is also doing deals with a new regime in Saudi Arabia, not the old, corrupt regime.  Big difference.  </p>

<p>He is supportive of the CIA...the &quot;good&quot; CIA.  Not the &quot;deep state&quot; CIA.  What is he suppose to say when he first meets them?  </p>

<p>Because the &quot;strategic bombing&quot; in Syria was part of the &quot;public showing&quot; of the narrative at the time and did not kill any Russians etc...  Notice that we (US fighters) are leaving Syria and there is no more push to oust Assad.</p>

<p>Any drone strikes are decided upon by the commandant commanders and those that they delegated that decision too.  Our president trusts our generals and does not micromanage them (like Obummer&#39;s 30 year old staffer who would call directly into the tactical operations center with orders on what to do and who to strike etc...)</p>

<p>Everything Trump has done and is doing is acceptable to me because every morning I wake up and he is my president and Hillary is not!  MAGA!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that so many people hate and so many of the establishment politicians in both major parties don&#39;t seem to like him, and the constant negative news coverage seems to give people the idea that he&#39;s anti establishment. I also think this is viewed as a positive sign for trump supporters as they people that they cant stand and dislike in turn are upset about the potus.  As per some of his policy choices... Yeah, doesn&#39;t look like he&#39;s doing a whole lot different than others. The yemen thing isn&#39;t too different than the libya thing that hillary and obama got shit for.</p>

<p>No one expected Trump to announce &quot;911 is an inside job&quot;, but he has enough views that the establishment hates they&#39;re trying their hardest to ruin him.</p>
