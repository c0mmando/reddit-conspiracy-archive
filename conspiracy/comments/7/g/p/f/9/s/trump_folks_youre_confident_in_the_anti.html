       So you're basing your entire support of a candidate by how the fake media treats
Him? Haven't you ever heard of reverse psychology?

      <p>
       He's a populist that the elite selected. Maybe they are using their state media to run a smear campaign on him, so people like you will be drawn more to him. I bet you liked his anti SJW "politically incorrect" straight shooter way of talking too, right?

       And the answer is "they voted for Trump because the other choice was Clinton."   Also, it appears, they liked his stand on illegal immigration.

       I don't know that anyone was voting for him because he was "anti-establishment".   Anti-corruption (mostly Clinton style) was a factor.

       I would disagree with that personally.  I tend to agree with Susan Sarandon - with Clinton we'd already be at war.  Also, I think we'd have more illegal immigration and more taxes.

       The Trump administration has hallowed out the state department, pulled back from international agreements, moved tens of thousands of additional troops into Africa and the Middle East, has massively increased Middle East bombing and resulting civilian casualties, is engaging in daily brinkmanship with North Korea, and is installing Iran War hawks in pretty much every senior military and intelligence position.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think there's any question that Trump is pushing us towards war at a faster and more reckless clip than anything Clinton would've done.

       Well, good. It just got lower.   Don't believe we'll see a lot of state department employees getting replaced by temps - but I could be wrong.

       Either way - it will be different people doing the work and perhaps the outcome will be different.  We can't afford to keep doing stuff the way we have been doing it.  It's time to try something different.

       We're losing bad. It's time to try a different way.   I used to be in the corporate world for a half century.  I saw hatchetmen walk into multiple big corporations and cut out the dead wood.  Every single time the people getting chopped said "You won't make it" and rarely was that the result.

       I have watched corporate America and the US Government sell off our assets and squander our power for about thirty years now.  It's time to do things different.

       Yes - if it puts money into the hands of corporations instead of bureaucracies and lowers the cost of doing business in the United States versus other countries.

       Cutting the scope and size of the federal government, getting money and power out it's hands seems like a good answer to me.

       We've gotten more socialist in the last 40 years and we're in decline.  The Chinese and Russians went the other way and the more their government loosens the reins, the better off they seem to be.  I see a pattern there.

       That's a big idea - and can't disagree that things are broken - but we have to use the ballot box we have or create something better.  I'm not at all sure what that something would be.

       I'm saying regardless of who you vote for,
They rig the primaries of both sides and it doesn't matter. They then select the "puppet" they want, (based on the climate or what "angle" or script the social engineers wrote up), the electoral college vote them in, and you have your puppet.
      </p>

       In many ways, he's just like any other POTUS.  He's done some good things, and some bad things.  I can easily name some of each.  In other ways, he's like no other POTUS ever.  No other POTUS has had to deal with consistent attempts at character assassination by the media.

       1 man questioning and pushing a narrative (wrong or not) is not similar to news stations, twitter,Facebook, Reddit, etc. constantly attacking you. Literally everyday I check Reddit I see some new allegations against Trump, it's getting tiresome at this point. I voted 3rd party as well, since I disliked HRC for numerous reasons, and I disliked Trump for numerous reasons.

       I think he means, this sub doesn't support TD, despite what all the shills tell you. He's the first president to espose conspiracy theories from his pulpit and the entire MSM is gunning for him, so sometimes we share his opinions (like on Fake News, cutting TPP, draining the swamp, etc...) But that doesn't mean we like or even support him. He's a big fat turd that happens to be right sometimes...which is a lot better than the other option we had the last election.

       I think the draining the swamp in saudi arabia, not being a career politician,  and outright political party tribalism play a role in peoples opinions. The yemen crisis isn't a new trump development also. And isis seems to be defeated, and the usa hasn't officially declared war on syria (tho we still have several thousand troops occupying part of it uninvited that our last potus sent in)

       I don’t think he’s a moron. Or Hitler or nearly as bad as his opponents make him out to be. I genuinely believe he is trying to MAGA. It might not be exactly what we were expecting, but he has done a lot of things that I enjoy.

        Rothschild connection anti-establishment.  So what if our President was doing business with folks that worked for organizations that are connected to the Rothschilds?  Do they not have their "hands" into almost everything on this planet?  Wilber Ross was hired for his knowledge and experience.  If he does not do the job per our president's agenda, he will move out and move along.  What is your definition of "establishment"?

       About meeting with Henry Kissinger...do you know what was said at the meetings?  Know thy enemy!

       Trump is also doing deals with a new regime in Saudi Arabia, not the old, corrupt regime.  Big difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is supportive of the CIA...the "good" CIA.  Not the "deep state" CIA.  What is he suppose to say when he first meets them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the "strategic bombing" in Syria was part of the "public showing" of the narrative at the time and did not kill any Russians etc...  Notice that we (US fighters) are leaving Syria and there is no more push to oust Assad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any drone strikes are decided upon by the commandant commanders and those that they delegated that decision too.  Our president trusts our generals and does not micromanage them (like Obummer's 30 year old staffer who would call directly into the tactical operations center with orders on what to do and who to strike etc...)
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything Trump has done and is doing is acceptable to me because every morning I wake up and he is my president and Hillary is not!  MAGA!

       I cannot truthfully answer that because I have not been privy to all their accomplishments (or lack of) since they have stepped into office.  Only time will tell and in the meanwhile, I will continue to show my support for our president, his administration and his agenda.

       The fact that so many people hate and so many of the establishment politicians in both major parties don't seem to like him, and the constant negative news coverage seems to give people the idea that he's anti establishment. I also think this is viewed as a positive sign for trump supporters as they people that they cant stand and dislike in turn are upset about the potus.  As per some of his policy choices... Yeah, doesn't look like he's doing a whole lot different than others. The yemen thing isn't too different than the libya thing that hillary and obama got shit for.

       Sure, if you want America to start waging more wars and killing more civilians, you're welcome to support all this.  Same as if you favor the Administration's policy of handing control executive agencies over to industry lobbyists and attorneys.
