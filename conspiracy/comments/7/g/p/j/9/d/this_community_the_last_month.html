    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not organic. This is merely the culmination of the last years worth of trajectory. Lots of political refugees made their way here, when subs like r/politics and r/wikileaks got coopted, and the shills that drove them out followed them here. r/conspiracy is a major battleground on Reddit right now, and it&#39;s one of the front lines in the information war being waged against the Public. </p>

<p>My advice- abandon /hot and browse by /new, that&#39;s how you can make the biggest difference. The tone of a post is already set by the time it reaches the front, in /new <em>you</em> have the opportunity top set that tone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>r/politics is useful when you actually follow links and read the articles. Even skimming is beneficial because you can determine quickly if it&#39;s an opinion piece or actual breaking news. You can then determine if the source or supplemental material is good enough for you to believe what is being claimed.</p>

<p>This can all be achieved by using a RSS reader if you can figure out how to set one up for yourself. Do not engage in the comment section on that sub. It&#39;s a time sink because of the astroturfing and brigading.</p>

<p>Disagree.  Sorting by controversial usually yields good results.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>Title:  I’m a Depression historian. The GOP tax bill is straight out of 1929.</p>

<p>Top comment: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Things are going to get worse. Brace yourselves. The republicans are going to push us into another depression or worse with these policies. Most of us are already struggling with no help in sight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Best comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.&quot;</p>

<p>Those who teach history are doomed to watch it happen again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Controversial comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its hard to take this piece seriously from the moment the term “trickle down” appears.</p>

<p>Trickle down economics is not a real economics theory and no one on the economic right supports it. Trickle down is a term that was created to strawman free market economics and supply side theory.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the author goes on to straw man the other side throughout the article.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is always so much white noise that it is hard to determine what exactly has transpired that might warrant it. Personally, I feel like with or without a catalyst these things will continue. The DNC and Podesta leaks as well as Pizzagate was the start of all of this. That&#39;s when the censorship kicked into overdrive, and when the term &quot;fake news&quot; popped up. So I&#39;m not sure if it is anything particularly recent as much as it is the continuing attack that started from events last year.</p>

<p>More than willing to hear others opinions though, it&#39;s easy to forget when exactly things happened in the last 1-2 months as they all start to blend together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with you that it&#39;s a battle ground for information, there is misinformation being spread by both sides. Yeah, it sucks to see so many comments that immediately shift that argument to &quot;Oh, that Trump, what a butt! Am I right?&quot; And then a string of comments that just talk about how much they hate Trump. I&#39;m sick of reading about him in everything. All of those comments are upvoted to heaven. Then a post comes along about how a republican is unsurprisingly also accused of sexual assault/ rape/ whatever and that posts gets 200 upvotes in the first 30 minutes. I guess people don&#39;t want to worry about being TOO obvious with their bias or anything.</p>

<p>On the flip side, I&#39;m also tired of seeing stuff coming from Trump be completely unquestionable in the eyes of some. Maybe it&#39;s just me, but I don&#39;t trust anyone who just wants me to accept what a person in power says without question. Or how some things are painted. Like pizzagate. Some times it seems like the only people that are &quot;100% truly involved&quot; are all Democrats and John McCain. It&#39;s like, come on. Yeah, sure I believe that the people in power could very likely be running a pedophile ring, but just the political opponents of your guy? Isn&#39;t that just a tad too convenient for you?</p>

<p>Last complaint about the battle for conspiracy is the strawman attacks all over the place. I didn&#39;t vote for Trump. That must mean I love Hillary and worship Satan. I didn&#39;t vote for Hillary. That must mean that I&#39;m literally a slave owner. Everyone looks past the arguments and just tries to label anyone who disagrees with them.</p>

<p>Anyway, sorry for rambling. There is disinformation all around. We&#39;re being divided. The people who ask questions are being divided because of politics. I wonder what&#39;s really going on.</p>
