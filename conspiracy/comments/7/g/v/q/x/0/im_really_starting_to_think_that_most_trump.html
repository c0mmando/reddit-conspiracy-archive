<p>And inb4 i get viciously called out.</p>

<p>There are a handful who i can honestly say they probably aren&#39;t fake, and they actually understand the divide and conquer techniques, and so even though they support Trump, they&#39;ve still openly said they would be willing to stop supporting him with enough evidence that he&#39;s not the real deal.</p>

<p>However, there are just so many blind worshippers in this place.</p>

<p>Look at my last post about applauding those who have admitted to their mistake in basically worshipping the dude and own up to it. Look at all the comments.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so toxic.</p>

<p>They can&#39;t be real, and if they are, then I&#39;m truly sorry. Please wake up everyone. Trump is just a terrible person, not that Clinton would be any better.</p>

<p>But i never fucking said Clinton would have been better.</p>

<p>Best to always hold leaders accountable and doubt their authority. </p>

<p>Edit: sorry for the repost. I&#39;m doing it again because this original post was obviously brigaded by Russian trolls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. Exactly this. People who &quot;support&quot; Trump aren&#39;t necessarily defending his actions/comments/Tweets... we support what he stands for. Which is a regression from a Globalist system, deeply rooted corruption, crime and an intentionally diluted economy to force the masses to eagerly await their next handout. </p>

<p>Keeping a society dependent, clueless and obedient paired with attacking ANYTHING that happens from the GOP/Trump/His supporters is the only strategy left in the toolbox of the Dems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a great video on this issue. It is rather long, but well worth the listen.  The people who rule the world are Satanists/Luciferians.  I am talking about the Rothschilds, Soros, Vatican, Jesuits, Freemasons, Clintons, Obama, Bushes, Merkel, May, Trudeau, etc.  Satanism and Luciferianism are the religions of the New World Order globalists.  </p>

<p>Once you understand their belief system, you can see their influence everywhere, such as in the media, movies, and monuments.  I mean, why is the Washington Monument an Egyptian Obelisk?  That is very strange, when you think about it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have it all backwards! Most dictatorships - from Nazis to the Soviets - demand that the woman&#39;s reproductive duties belong to the state. More population = more soldiers. But not only that, the more people you have, the fewer resources each of them has, the and the more they fight between each other.  </p>

<p>Do you know the country that dealt with the panama leaks the most effectively? Iceland. It&#39;s no coincidence that Iceland also has one of the smallest populations from any country - only 300,000 people. It&#39;s easy to march on the parliament when there&#39;s so few of you.  It&#39;s also a lot easier to implement decent social security, education, medical system. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a lot harder to enact any significant change in a country with hundreds of millions of people. Just think how large the hierarchies need to be to manage such a society. You can climb from the bottom to the top, but it will either take a lifetime, nepotism, or a lot of luck. </p>

<p>So by all means, I won&#39;t stop you trying to uncover the globalist agenda. But don&#39;t look among the people trying to reduce population, look for the people who are telling you to breed breed breed. </p>

<h1>BorschtErrrrryDay</h1>

<p>Seriously though, the very notion of the &quot;Russian Troll&quot; and &quot;Russian Bot&quot; story in light of the &quot;Collusion&quot; narrative is so fucking diluted, thin and substance-less that it&#39;s become very evident to me that this is just one more half-baked conspiracy cooked up from the left that some are desperately clinging to. </p>

<p>Once the story about how Russia used Pokemon Go! to infiltrate us, that should have been a clear indicator to anyone still falling for this anti-Trump propaganda that it officially jumped the shark. </p>

<p>What&#39;s next? Russian infiltration of Vtech devices to brainwash children into voting for the GOP at a young age? I could spend 1 hour in a Word doc and create this conspiracy out of thin air with fabricated &quot;evidence&quot; and these stupid assholes would believe it. They&#39;ll believe anything that is anti-Trump. The narratives serve a dual purpose:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It generates a huge surge of income via clicks/advertisements (NYP/WaPo/CNN estimated a 30-40% surge in revenue when they run anything re: Trump).</p></li>
<li><p>It helps them satisfy their Mockingbird handlers by furthering the political agenda to divide/question the very existence of this &quot;evil Nazi/Russian/Racist/Sexist supporters&quot; despite the lack of any concrete evidence supporting those accusations. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s such obviously brainwashing, that so many people fall for, it serves only to confirm my decades-long assumption that most people are just plain stupid. I&#39;m not saying people that are anti-Trump are stupid btw. There&#39;s good reasons to be anti-Trump and some of them make good arguments... </p>

<p>But I AM saying that people who fall into the propaganda trap ARE ABSOLUTELY stupid. There should be a special internet for them. An echo chamber of idiocy. </p>

<p>Right, because everything I mentioned above is clearly coming from a singular source of coordinated intel and not a crowd-sourced effort to connect dots that lead back to a series of unanswerable questions that will eventually expose extreme corruption. </p>

<p>&quot;for you to see the truth and admit wrong is to say your last decades you were wrong&quot;</p>

<p>What? What does that even mean? I look at things very objectively... any time I&#39;ve pursued leads/info and it turns out to be wrong I am the first to admit it. </p>

<p>Nitpick? For confirmation bias? WTF are you talking about? Do you know of some details behind the &quot;Russian Collusion&quot; that NO ONE ELSE does?

<p>Maybe you remember...one of them killed a lady? </p>

<p>Yeah....no concrete evidence at all. It&#39;s all propaganda. Fake news. </p>

<p>Is your stance really that there aren&#39;t a whole hell of a lot of racist Trump lovers? Because I&#39;ve met <em>lots</em> and they&#39;re not hiding. </p>

<p>How about Trump Aide Gorka wearing a Nazi-affiliated group&#39;s medal to the inauguration? </p>

<p>How about Steve Bannon, <em>Trump&#39;s Chief Strategist</em>, boasting at the RNC that his publication, Breitbart, was &quot;the platform for the alt-right&quot;?</p>

<p>What is the alt-right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Richard Spencer initially promoted the term in 2010 in reference to a movement centered on white nationalism and did so, according to the Associated Press, to disguise overt racism, white supremacism, neo-fascism and neo-Nazism.[2][3][4] </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right</a></p>

<p>Yeah, that whole crowd <em>loves</em> Trump, too. </p>

<p>A couple days ago when Trump tweeted out a video of a Dutch kid beating up another Dutch kid and said it was a Muslim beating a Dutch kid, David Duke tweeted, &quot;This is why we love Trump!&quot;</p>

<p>Total lack of concrete evidence. Real small minority. Sure thing.</p>

<p>You&#39;re focused on the aggressive white nationalist movement, inherently racist and made up of many sub-divisions - some of which you mentioned above. Do they exist? Yes. Are they hateful idiots? Yes, obviously. Have they been condemned by the right and Trump himself? Yes. </p>

<p>You take these comments and actions to somehow implicate that the President shows any kind of two-way affection towards these hate groups that do not represent Trump supporters by in large. </p>

<p>Dude, Trump made a guy who boasted that he ran the &quot;platform for the alt-right&quot; his <em>chief strategist</em>.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not condemnation, that&#39;s endorsing. </p>

<p>After a lady was killed in the White Nationalist fiasco in Charlottesville Trump said there were &quot;very fine people&quot; on both sides. Who was he referring to? Statue enthusiasts that were there to protest the removal of the statue and decided to stay when the crowd they were with started chanting Nazi slogans? He was referring to the Neo-Nazis, man. We both know it.</p>

<p>most of the time i get called a shill and downvoted.... </p>

<p>quick question- do you know what the average number of sealed motions are and sealed cases? i mean, these aren&#39;t all indictments, i think most are just sealed motions. </p>

<p>but anyway, i&#39;m curious what the average number is, and if this number is actually noteworthy or if that&#39;s a &quot;normal&quot; load for our justice system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely! Happy to provide it... certainly very interesting! In terms of the indictments vs. motions - what makes you see the majority are motions? It looked to me that they were actually indictments. As they are only* counting the &quot;Sealed Cases&quot;, of which a motion would be a component of, but not counted separately. </p>

<p>In terms of averages in previous years? I think there was one year, I want to say 2009, which had the highest volume of sealed indictments FOR THE WHOLE YEAR and it did not exceed 2,000!</p>

<p>We&#39;re talking about 6 weeks = 4,300 sealed cases. And who knows what it&#39;s up to now? I&#39;m not sure that Google drive link has been updated for a week.</p>

<p>So, WAY beyond normal load. Even for an entire year, let alone within a 2 month window. </p>

<p>my main issue with statements like this, is that they are not rooted in any reality beyond pro-trump/pro-GOP propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right... because Clinton was so squeaky clean. Let me know how the American Dream would have ended up with the secret email servers, the Awan/Congress/DNC conspiracy, a political party willing to steal donations and hijack a primary, that used the FBI to cover their tracks and prevent criminal charges, a non-profit foundation with countless kick-backs and pay-to-play schemes, colluding with FGPS/CS to produce internationally coordinated smear campaigns... </p>

<p>Wake up. </p>

<p>He&#39;s not the cleanest choice, of course not. But if you have to pull a pair of jeans from the dirty laundry pile - I&#39;d choose a pair that smelled a little bit vs. the pair covered in shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said there&#39;s a &quot;lack of concrete evidence.&quot; That&#39;s objectively false. </p>

<p>Is your stance really that there aren&#39;t a whole hell of a lot of racist Trump lovers? Because I&#39;ve met <em>lots</em> and they&#39;re not hiding. </p>

<p>How about Trump Aide Gorka wearing a Nazi-affiliated group&#39;s medal to the inauguration? </p>

<p>How about Steve Bannon, <em>Trump&#39;s Chief Strategist</em>, boasting at the RNC that his publication, Breitbart, was &quot;the platform for the alt-right&quot;?</p>

<p>What is the alt-right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Richard Spencer initially promoted the term in 2010 in reference to a movement centered on white nationalism and did so, according to the Associated Press, to disguise overt racism, white supremacism, neo-fascism and neo-Nazism.[2][3][4] </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right</a></p>

<p>Yeah, that whole crowd <em>loves</em> Trump, too. </p>

<p>A couple days ago when Trump tweeted out a video of a Dutch kid beating up another Dutch kid and said it was a Muslim beating a Dutch kid, David Duke tweeted, &quot;This is why we love Trump!&quot;</p>

<p>Total lack of concrete evidence. Real small minority. Sure thing.</p>
