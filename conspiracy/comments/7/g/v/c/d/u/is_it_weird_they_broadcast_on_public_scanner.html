    <div class="md"><p>In hindsight, this is one of the more bizarre aspects of the vegas incident. They have private channels for tactical shit. But, if this is indeed the case, that we were intentionally ledt to observe this radio traffic, it means vegas was to some degree known and planned with the help of LVMPD.</p>

<p>Vegas happened. I could literally hear the shots and screams. Wasting time proving it was a hoax is the most retarded waste of time and resources to me, when we have evidence of a very serious conspiracy right here. And the &quot;vegas is fake&quot; idea was likely planted by malicious groups to interfere with actual research and fact finding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Way too many open questions for anyone to make a definitive statement like you have here. Shots? Yes. Screams of fear of the Unknown? Yes anyone would scream in fear. No Blood, dead bodies, richochets, bullet pockmarks in the cement or asphault, very few shell casings on floor of hotel room, number 13 on Paddocks neck in some pics and not others. Relationship with CIA pilots and drug and child traffickers? I would like to have some answers before I publicly state it was a FF or real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only reason I can think of using public channels is that the various agencies might not be able to be on the same encrypted channels.</p>

<p>But you&#39;d think that would be something worked out beforehand.</p>

<p>The real conspiracy in many of these things is the amount of incompetence in various areas.</p>
