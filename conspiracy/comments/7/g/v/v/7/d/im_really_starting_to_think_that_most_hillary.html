<p>And inb4 i get viciously called out.</p>

<p>There are a handful who i can honestly say they probably aren&#39;t fake, and they actually understand the divide and conquer techniques, and so even though they support Hillary, they&#39;ve still openly said they would be willing to stop supporting her with enough evidence that she&#39;s not the real deal.</p>

<p>However, there are just so many blind worshippers in this place.
Look at my last post about applauding those who have admitted to their mistake in basically worshipping the chick and own up to it. Look at all the comments.
It&#39;s so toxic.
They can&#39;t be real, and if they are, then I&#39;m truly sorry. Please wake up everyone. Hillary is just a terrible person, not that Trump would be any better.
But i never fucking said Trump would have been better.
Best to always hold leaders accountable and doubt their authority.
Edit: sorry for the repost. I&#39;m doing it again because this original post was obviously brigaded by Russian trolls.</p>

<p>See how that works.</p>

<p>EDIT:  +++For those that still do not get it, this was an exact opposite post of an earlier post to show how silly partisan politics is in a conspiracy sub.+++</p>

<p>Same with HRC. She&#39;s fucking irrelevant. No influence on our lives. And yet, we have a petulant child at the helm of our country who clearly doesn&#39;t give a bucket of rat vomit whether anyone who makes less than $1M/yr lives or dies, and is actively trying to shift a vast sum of wealth onto the already wealthy <em>by taxing the poor!</em></p>

<p>Right, so it&#39;s Obama&#39;s fault that Cheney, Rumsfeld, Feith, Wolfowitz, etc. were party to war crimes and murder of Americans? Call me crazy, but I think the person who commits the murder is more a piece of shit than the people who may or may not prosecute them. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>What decade are you talking about? And who is &quot;we&quot; in your quote? You think the Dems gave up? Newsflash: elected officials never went after anyone in the Cheney regime. It never happened. At all. Not D&#39;s, Not R&#39;s. No one. Don&#39;t act like that makes their crimes ok.</p>

<p>But still, after all your rearranging of responsibilities, you still haven&#39;t given a coherent reason why you think HRC is more relevant than GWB or Cheney or the rest of the war criminals. You say you &quot;completely agree&quot; that they&#39;re criminals, yet you twist logic and reason to ignore their crimes in favor of someone who actually doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>And why? So you can protect the President. Why? That guy wouldn&#39;t waste his piss on you or your family if they were on fire. In fact, he&#39;d probably laugh at your suffering as this tax bill proves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I know you aren&#39;t actually interested in hearing why I liked her as a candidate, but I&#39;ll reply in case someone else is.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no shame in evolving on cultural issues like gay marriage, and she has been a public supporter of gay rights and civil unions for many years. As someone who has been personally conflicted before on the civil union/marriage debate, that actually speaks to me more. Now, if you&#39;d like to point to some of her views that <em>actually</em> flip-flopped, I&#39;ll try to address them, but keep in mind that changing your view as a politician isn&#39;t an inherently bad thing, and painting her as a political weathervane is, I feel, dishonest.</p>

<p>Her public/private line was mischaracterized and over-blown, and more to the point understandable by anyone who has to negotiate with people who don&#39;t share your views. Sometimes you need to endorse a solution that isn&#39;t what you&#39;d personally like, because it is the best you can get.</p>

<p>On her experience, yes, I&#39;d say having to deal with political situations without a clear or clean answer is <em>exactly</em> the kind of experience I would look to in a presidential candidate. But don&#39;t neglect the rest of the 112 countries she traveled to as SoS, that counts too.</p>

<p>The world works as it works, and I personally don&#39;t care for idealists running into walls to attain a moral victory. I want someone in charge who can move within the system and direct it in ways I find correct. Which is why electing one of the best technocrats this country has seen to President struck me as appealing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen maybe a dozen posters here that could really be called a &quot;Hillary Supporter&quot;, calling Trump out on shit doesn&#39;t make someone a Hillary supporter, and neither does pointing out holes in some of the flimsier Lock Her Up narrative(though a lot of us still wouldn&#39;t mind it). With those two things in mind, I think the number of supporters you would perceive goes down significantly.</p>

The problem is that any topic about Hillary gets a load of comments trying to shift the focus to Trump which is off topic.

    <div class="md"><p>No power? Estimated 2,748,978 people work for the federal government.  Over 8 years Clinton and Obama they appointed leadership and grew it to that number.  So let&#39;s assume 200k of the 2.7m are left overs.  This does not include Bush left overs and they are on the same team as Clinton/Obama. </p>

<p>Now we have Clinton and Obama who form a &quot;resistance&quot; organization effort after the election funded by Soros.  Clinton who is on TV everyday and Obama who is meeting with Foreign leaders before Trump.  They have a following of 200k+ of  current employees in the government.  Trump is 1 year in and has probably brought in 20k maximum. </p>

<p>Republicans have majority of the seats and houses.  But that doesn&#39;t make them Trump&#39;s team. 
 If you haven&#39;t noticed the Trump team has found a lot of Soros backed Republicans and many more will be uncovered.   This is not a Republican versus Dem situation.  This is Globalism funded by Soros vs Nationalism voted by Americans.  </p>

<p>You ask who is in power? I would say we have new leadership sailing with the enemies crew and ship.       </p>

<p>Exactly. Not sure why so many people (usually, but not always, overt Trump supporters) have a hard time understanding this.</p>

<p>I think Trump is an inept, unfit moron with huge, huge character flaws who should have never been allowed within 100 miles of the White House.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t meant I support Clinton. She was politics as usual, thought the presidency was her right, was just as much a cheerleader for big business as Trump is, and would have perpetuated something I&#39;m firmly against by continuing/creating a political dynasty. Screw that. (I was against Jeb Bush for the same reason.)</p>

Most &quot;Hillary Supporters&quot; would admit that she was a deeply flawed and unpopular candidate, and a good number of Democratic voters actually wanted Bernie, though the number of Bernie supporters was not enough to overcome the overwhelming backing of establishment Democrats for Hillary. Bernie couldn&#39;t even win California.</p>

You made valid points and I agree with the content, by I&#39;ve seen you use the same copy-pasted phrasing in a couple other threads while I sit here giggling and reading comments at work. Put in some effort or hold yourself to only engaging a couple threads rather than lifting your same phrases (assuming it was you and not another username, don&#39;t care enough to go back and check the other thread while browsing on mobile).

<p>Are you just asserting everyone is a Soros funded shill?</p>

I first joined reddit for free network IT help rather than pay to comment web forums. Maybe you saw my 1 other comment or maybe you&#39;re trying to discredit me because you aren&#39;t who you say.

<p>We have all been mind washed over the past 15 yrs of internet use and now we are all just one little hive mind who hate everyone......some we hate a lot. Some we just hate a little bit. But if we hate everyone - who is left to 💘 love?</p>

<p>This is <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Strategy_of_tension">Strategy of Tension</a> 101:</p>

<p>&quot;The strategy of tension is a method of social control involving a series of covert attacks upon a population, intended to promote stress and fear amongst them. The purpose is, by inducing a mistrust of one another and of the world at large, to increase child-like dependence upon perceived authority figures (such as national governments). &quot;</p>

<p>Historically, the example of the Venetians sponsoring the Reformation comes to mind. Venice was incredibly corrupt and controlled the governments of Europe through debt, intrigue, and incursions from their Mongol allies.</p>

<p>The European powers wised up, formed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_League_of_Cambrai">League of Cambrai</a> to Drain the Lagoon and attacked. Venice narrowly avoided disaster and realized they would soon fall to united opposition if something wasn&#39;t done.</p>

<p>So, their intelligence network supported Martin Luther&#39;s Reformation. As a result, Luther wasn&#39;t burned at the stake like Huss, but instead received protection that allowed a religious gulf to open and divide Europe along religious grounds. Once the religious division was accomplished, it was a trivial matter to set off centuries of religious wars while Venice used the time they bought to infect Holland and England with the virus of usury.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t like Hillary, and only voted for her because I knew she’d put up better SC judges than Trump in terms of political lean. But that doesn’t mean I won’t be happy to shut down the 346th poorly sourced “body bags” list I see. I’d do the same for someone pushing Trump body bags. I hate Gish Gallup arguments, and I hate people who push “research” that they haven’t done a lick of themselves.</p>

<p>And yet, when I call out obvious bullshit because all it does is distract from legitimate reasons to question motives &amp; morals, when I point out that it’s the accuser’s job to prove a positive rather than mine to prove a negative, I get called a Hillary Lover. Explain That shit to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I forsee comments saying both Hilary and Trump are bad. OP don&#39;t forget that actual Dems really did want Hilary to be president. Don&#39;t be suprised by the comments you recieve on this very popular website where politics have been virtually unavoidable on almost very sub. Sure some could be fake supporters, bots, or even flamers, but priorities are mostly toward the current administration that is loyal to corporate penis and is potentially more damaging to this country than Hilary who lost. Whether installed by the Kremlin or not, they are definitely satisfied by the huge division that is growing every day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is better for everyone who isn&#39;t American, but terrible for us. Hillary would&#39;ve been great for us, but terrible for literally everyone else on the planet.</p>

<p>Remember when Bill Clinton bombed Yugoslavia for no reason? Remember when Hillary supported us going into Iraq, and when she went right along with Sarkozy&#39;s plan to fuck Libya sideways? Put a Clinton in power, and watch the third-worlders run screaming as the bombs blow them to smithereens. At least Trump is an isolationist. At least his pants-on-head retarded policies stand a good chance of neutralizing some of the unwarranted power and colonial reach of the American Empire. Hillary would&#39;ve kept the Empire going, and she would&#39;ve been good at it.</p>

<p>First and foremost, I can&#39;t stand HRC. She&#39;s an opportunistic, lying, corporatist like the vast majority of politicians currently in office. I voted for her because I already knew who Trump was. But don&#39;t ask me to defend her for a goddamned thing. If HRC committed a crime, prosecute that pos to the fullest extent of the law. I&#39;m the last person you&#39;ll see defending her or anyone&#39;s illegal activities. </p>

<p>The most glaring problem with pointing out some &quot;conspiracy&quot; involving HRC is that she&#39;s a fucking private citizen. She has no sway over policy, nor does she have any way to influence intelligence agencies nor law enforcement. Not any more than the rich guy down the end of the street has. Why then are we even talking about her? </p>

<p>She is a <strong>FUCKING DISTRACTION</strong>. And any time someone brings her up, they are most likely trying to draw attention away from the upward sucking motion of money in our country to the pockets of the already wealthy. The richest 0.01% have our politicians by the ballsacks, with big carrots and big sticks at their disposal to incentivize this massive shift of wealth right under the noses of the other 99.99% of us.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m fucking pissed at anyone who thinks HRC is a bigger problem than the actual POTUS and his cabinet, and congress and the House. She&#39;s not a central figure to ANY of it, and yet, many dipshits still think she&#39;s so important, we need to have several threads about her at any given time at r/conspiracy. </p>

<p>Are you so uninformed about the American political situation that you think HRC has some influence that even compares to the POTUS? </p>

Even Carter and Moyers have come to realize that the US is run by oligarchs.   There is no democracy here.   But really,  we could have voted for a third party if we could have gotten over the partisan divide.   Right now,  everything we do is feeding the oligarchs and their fake news and fake parties.    Its so corrupt that the only thing that can stop it is a brick wall.    It won&#39;t be pretty.   Capitalism depends on the rule of law or it degenerates into oligarchy and monopoly,  total corruption.   It is now busy making the rope with which it will hang itself.    Several decades after the Soviets made the rope with which to hang their so called dictatorship of the proletariat that was actually a dictatorship of the apparatchik/nomenklatura.</p>
