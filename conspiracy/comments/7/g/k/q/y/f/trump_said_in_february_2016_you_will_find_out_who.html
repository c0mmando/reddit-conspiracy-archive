       Does Trump know the full truth behind 911? I find it hard to believe that if he found out about a conspiracy behind it he would keep it quiet. On the other hand, I find it hard to believe that he would not have learnt about what really went down. He seems to back the official story in most of his quotes, but now and then before the election he hinted at being some kind of 'truther'. What's the truth with Trump and 911?

       It's not. People just have cognitive dissonance, even in the "truth" movement, here. I fought this debate for years, here (seriously, check my account history)... There was way more to 9/11 than just inside job and thermite - controlled demolition.

      <p>
       I'm fine with getting the perps, but, I want to know the full truth, and how those buildings turned to dust. How Erin was supposed to hit, but didn't. How cars were rusted out. How paper was not burned, but other material was.  Where the fuck did those buildings go? Why so much cancer? Why the molten core?

       You know that the smallest nuclear device ever produced is ~6ktons right?

       That would leave a crater significantly larger than the WTC, and it would have killed all electronic devices in NYC.

       I think the theory is that there were small nukes set off in the basements of the towers as part of the demolition. Some people think that explains the long lasting high temps recorded under ground zero. Personally I don’t believe it.

       He might know, but I doubt the actual truth will surface if it’s anywhere near as nefarious as many of us believe it could be. IMO the statement most likely was to garner more publicity/support, at most possibly a foreshadowing of something to arise from the “clean up” going on in SA. If there was a demolition or in any way planned with US help, that truth will never come about. Better chance of Delong’s “imminent disclosure” and I’m not going to hold my breath for that either.

       A noble lie. Even if he knew he would not tell us. The damage to moral would be too great. We have a whole generation of guys in the military who joined as a result of 9/11. Not to mention their parent and grandparents...everybody. Grown men would be curling up in the fetal position and rocking back and forth. As much as I want to live in a just and open society I worry what that truth would do to most men.

       I am agnostic on what happened on 911. Perhaps Trump thought there would be more to tell. Just as it is poor logic to completely accept the official line, it is also not a good idea to have absolute certainty in a conspiracy.

       Maybe do a bit more research? r/911truth has a great wiki and sidebar docs. The picture is quite clear if you put the time in. I am not trying to insult your intelligence nor assume what you do or do not know. I just find it very hard to believe anyone who seriously tries to connect the dots can pretend those buildings completely disintegrated straight down because of the impacts or office fires. I am weary of having this conversation because it is ultimately pointless. People see what they want to see and we are all people...The American dream right?

       I did. I spent years on 911 truth. I know it is easy to assume the reason people come to a different conclusion is because of intelligence, but I was a truther. For years. It's not that I believe the official story. It's that I think both sides are plausible (although I do not sit on the fence). Hence I'm agnostic. The official story is clearly not everything that went on. But at the same time, none of the "conspiracy" theories have nearly enough evidence to convince me. They still require a leap of faith.

       Again I was not talking about intelligence and I never would say people are stupid for believing this or that. I do not have enough information on anyone to make those kinds of assumptions. Human psychology is complicated to say the least. Ignorance or a lack of information is what I was suggesting. You are welcome to believe whatever you like. As I said before I am weary of this tit for tat online.

       I joined partially because of 9/11. I figured out things way after I got out, but it would definitely effect recruitment levels in a catastrophic way if that information suddenly came out, and was completely different from the narrative they were saying back then. 
Even now, troop levels are low enough that they want to invite people with mental illnesses into the military. I think part of the reason numbers are low is that people are catching on. More and more, the distrust in the government grows. 
Thanks, internet/Net Neutrality! lol

       You got to feed your family one way or another. I knew a guy who wanted to get out. He was seriously done with all the military B.S. I saw him a few weeks later, and he said he already re-enlisted. He was having a child, so he stayed in for security. lol

       If Mexico somehow is forced to pay for the stupid wall, they'll just jack an increased tax on goods exported to the USA, the increase in costs will be passed to the consumer, so the USA's citizens will pay for the wall. Am I just being naive or is it not that obvious?  It's not like a 2% increase in export duty will warrant the corporations sourcing all the goods elsewhere.

       IIRC it's cited in the whole Bill put forward, has been a long time. There is a clause in the Immigration and Reform Act that simply states that in exchange for granted their citizens amnesty, Mexico would contribute x dollars to border security and whatever funds necessary to secure the border in the future, with the example being building walls. It's a general clause but that's how Trump is going to justify directing money from Mexican trade taxes to the wall, and why media seems to be mum on details of the bill. I haven't fact checked on the recent bills presented regarding the wall, but I did see it on the first one put forward.

       Epstein likes to tell people that he's a loner, a man who's never touched alcohol or drugs, and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. "I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,'' Trump booms from a speakerphone. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life."

       Can you imagine if somebody they didn't like said this?  They would be destroying that person.  But because its somebody they like they brush past it or spin it. That basically makes them partisan hacks that are willing to do anything for their team. Fuck justice or truth.

       I doubt TPTB have let Trump into the know. He's a bumbling stooge and not collected enough to be privy to what's really going on. I believe generally after the inauguration they pull the pres into a dark room and say "okay asshole now here's what's REALLY going on". I think they skipped this step with Trump.

       I think you need to reconsider going back to TD. We are very skeptical of Trump and his cabinet of Goldman Sachs billionaires here. He hasn't done anything for us to give him the benefit of the doubt that he's "against the deep state!!!1"...
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, many of us believe he's just appealing to theorists and saying shit to get the trust of our demographic. Not gonna happen. The idiots on 4chan can keep their circle jerk going if they want, but I advise they wake the fuck up and realize they're being sucked into the political paradigm...

       Exactly. It's interesting that no other president in my life time has said things like this. I don't think he's going to do anything for the people to take down these evil influences, but it's interesting to have a president that admits that these evil influences exist.

       I was told the same about the JFK drop. Then, when it happened, I was told that Trump had literally nothing to do with the JFK drop, since they were set to come out anyway as long as Trump did nothing. And then, to continue that path, I was told that Trump was taking credit for something that was going to happen regardless and that he wouldn't have allowed it to happen had it been something he had to proactively pursue. Then, the CIA pushed for an extension for time. Trump said no. Then the files dropped, but soon realized only partially and the rest wouldn't be out until the spring. But then Trump pushed back and forced more disclosure. Still partial. Trump STILL pushed for more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shouldn't he not have pushed at all if he was only taking credit for the JFK drop because it was going to happen anyway?

       I hope so. It just seems hard to be like "yeah, the government was actually behind 9/11" when, if we're being fair, he gets a lot of support for his anti muslim rhetoric. This isn't a comment on immigration policy, just that there seems to be a conflict of interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'm not really that much of a Trump guy, but it would make sense to me that if he was that against the deep state or TPTB, he would open the books to show the American people that our government was behind it all. I'd have a lot of respect for him if he did that.

       Imagine you are Donald Trump and you know for a fact that Saudi or Israel was behind 9/11.  What if you just came out and said so. Would anyone believe you? What kind of breakdown would that cause in our relationship with our closest allies in the ME?  What would the retaliation be? Would you go to war?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what I'm saying is, even though he knows, he has to be extremely careful in how he proceeds.  Israel and Saudi have lots of US politicians as well as the elites of the media in their pockets.

       The evidence that it was Jewish work is overwhelming. Problem with Trump is he surrounded himself with bankers and Mossad agents like Kushner, so they would never let him go anywhere near it.

       Regardless of international involvement, there was clearly US involvement as well.  Which, in my opinion, should be our top priority for investigation and prosecution.

       Look, I know every time anyone is Jewish, we start screaming "Rothschild/Soros dogs!"   But it simply isn't the truth.  Just as not all white people are white supremacists, not all Jews are part of the global Jewish agenda.

       It was elements of several governments. Why is everybody jerking off about pinpointing one single country or entity behind 9/11? Nobody ever comes down on GWB or Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice? Any of those corrupt cocksuckers?
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a massive criminal heist that involved thousands of people who vowed to keep their plans secret. You can't pinpoint it to just "Israel" or Saudi Arabia". Honestly I think the US government was behind most of it. It was a NWO hit like always.

       I'm pretty new to this sub, but I've got the general idea what supposedly happened behind the scenes.  So my biggest question is how do they keep all these people who infiltrate all these other countries loyal?
      </p>
      <p>
       I just kind of find it hard to believe that all these people who if they really are infiltrators and such show an extreme amount of competency and ability to manipulate others do so out of the belief of basically a 2,000 year old bat shit crazy creationism myth when basically one of their biggest weapons is manipulating large amounts of people with what they themselves would view as other 2,000 year old false creationism myths (a.k.a. manipulating christians and muslims)
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know the theory just makes it seem like there's an incredible amount of competency and talent, manpower, knowledge etc going into this suggested scenario and yet it is all being backed by people showing insane levels of loyalty to something they manipulate.  I mean it's pretty damn common for the past 200 years or so for politicians and powerful people to pay lip service to religions and use them but it's pretty rare to find actual powerful people that dedicated. And this theory puts hundreds or even thousands of such powerful people arcoss the world in every country all doing so for Zionism.

       Very simple. Ethnic supremacist cause. They only accept people who believe in it. Read Jewish holy scriptures if you want. Its more supremacist than Quran. They don't infiltrate - they take over. Entire institutions and organizations from the top.

       I think there is a 33% 4chan fee that he's going to blame 9/11 and Vegas on the arrested Saudi princes being tortured in Saudi Arabia now by Blackwater mercenaries. The ones that bought kids from HRC in exchange for donations to the Clinton foundation.
