       No dice. They were all functioning, that place is one of the most guarded places on earth. They have cameras everywhere. They were working, but they show something that contradicts the "official" conspiracy theory, and that is what it really is.

       I am shocked, the only semi functional camera from the boom gate had frames missing at critical junctures making it impossible to see the

       It's why the FBI went around the whole district confiscating all surveillance footage from businesses.

       An abundance of cameras is one thing but there are highways on literally every side of the pentagon.    The side that was hit is the most visible of the sides too.    I’ve known a lot of Washingtonians that saw the damage first hand and not one has explicitly said they saw a plane.    Not one.    And they all seem to imply there may not have been one to be seen.     Of course driving by at 55mph on the most traumatic of days may not be ideal for investigation but there were also plenty who biked to the scene and saw nothing.    What I am curious about are the south facing windows from all the hotels in the area.     There’s a giant mall two blocks away as well.   Eyewitness testimony should have been abundant but I’ve never heard anyone say they saw a plane.     The story isn’t cold though.   We’ll find out the truth in time.

       I hope we get to see that truth during our life time, man.  The wait is ridiculous, and having folks offed for trying to expose that truth is just.. ugly.  Let's not also forget about the passports they found in great condition.  Shit stinks to high heaven

       It’s been 60 years since JFK and we still act unsure about what really happened.    (Which also means the official story is a dud.)    If 9/11 is let slide I think it would be the last time the real nazis would doubt themselves.      And the internet could spoil things at any moment but the major social networks are falling in line with the authoritarians by censoring and otherwise manipulating what’s in the public discourse.   Algorithms.   The other component is how much people care and how they’ll engage the issue.    I feel like truth movements aren’t becoming more effective but are gaining a larger audience just by their own virtue.    And with the internet that base can perceive a solidarity and stay engaged to whatever extent possible.    The big hurdle is the ground game in Washington.   Does any researcher, media group, advocate, investigator, victim, politician, or anyone else feel like they could make inroads in DC?     If state crimes are the charge how is it exposed?     State crimes are effectively halted by the fear of being caught, so kowledge really is power.    I think people are generally becoming quicker to call foul and are far better investigators than what the traditional media would give them credit for.    So for 9/11, people will always know it’s bullshit for us and the world at large, but Zeitgeist and Loose Change have proven to be formidable, and I think all state level events of the future will be judged on how they hold up to this type of scrutiny.     Long story made short, we may never get the videos or authenticate the passports, but we can ridicule them until they put up, make them eternally defensive, and hope they slip up from fatigue if they ever attempt something similar in the future.

       Excellent points made, man.  I'd agree that they'd figure that if they could get away with 9/11, they'd be good further down the road.  This to me is why I felt like the momentum behind the initial Podesta e-mail release and ensuing pizzagate research had the biggest potential to open up that can of worms, and expose some serious truth.  No way in hell would anyone want to be associated with the one thing everyone in the their right mind would lose their shit about and protect: kids.

       This child sex trafficking business is a global affair, and one of the ways they keep the ones at the "top" complicit.  Reveal that to the masses and it'd we'd be surely facing the beginning of the end.

       What is a flying device that explodes on impact?
      </p>
      <p>
       Payload = Jet Fuel /kerosene or High explosive warhead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Missiles are designed to explode after collision with the target to wreak maximum damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the pictures of the impact zone and how many rings it went through, then ask wheres the impact of a plane vs missile.

       Yeah, there are missiles like bunker busters that are meant to go through concrete before exploding.  But why the fuck did we even design those, we should just use passenger jets in war, they can bring anything down.

       If the object that hit the Pentagon wasn't a plane, then what happened to those people who allegedly boarded flight 77? The two main theories of flight 77 range from simple to elaborate so I'll spare the details(because I'll introduce my own crazy theory), however, they have one thing in common: in both cases the passengers of flight 77 are 'deceased'.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if that wasn't the case? What if the passengers of the plane were instead shipped off to Mossad(or NK) to work as slaves? It's not like human trafficking isn't one of most lucrative businesses in the world. What good is a dead human(I guess unless you do the killing..) when you could have an enslaved one that everyone in the world thinks is dead?

       but it just boggles my mind that some military commanders were so guilty of overspending on military R&amp;D ... overspending into a new low. so what? that's new? they needed to blow up the Pentagon to distract us from a 2 trillion spending spree?

       I understand that , I think it’s more so destroying the evidence of it . In New York and d.c , the targets hit happened to be where sensitive information was being kept . In nyc , wt7 was home to the people investigating the negligent spending . Can’t audit the pentagon when you blow up the evidence .

       A lady that was interviewed who worked at the Pentagon and was very close by said it was a bomb.

       The director of Army imagery (the entire Army) said he reviewed the imagery footage from a Pentagon sensor and that it was a missile. Then he said the footage was later altered to look like a plane.

       Almost everyone in the Naval Intelligence office in the Pentagon died from this. Something like ~38 out of 40 people. Supposedly they were investigating the paper trail of all kinds of financial instruments that were set to be exercised on September 12th. September 11th attacks allowed for unprecedented exercising of instruments without verification under some emergency act. It was targeted against them.

       I think it would be a grave mistake to imagine that Navy intelligence are the good guys here. However I agree with your general view that evidence of financial crime was clearly destroyed, and investigations targeted, on 9/11. This view ties together the Pentagon attack with the destruction of the towers and WTC7.

       FWIW I definitely think this. Sounded crazy to me at first, but when you think about it, it's simply Hollywood FX passed off as news. Just 3D computer graphics layered onto live video and a bunch of actors LARPing as witnesses. And we know CNN etc has done this sort of thing before with green screens, fake witnesses, and such. All the world's a stage.

       You surely can't believe that literally every video is edited to make it look like planes, can you? While an entire city was staring at a the tallest building in flames, a missile got shot at the second tower but everyone thinks it's a plane? My dad was lying about what he saw that day?

       Dimitri Khalesov does a great interview where he states a Granite missile was used, and I tend to believe him. It's armor piercing qualities and size explain how it passed through the reinforced walls of the Pentagon. He also theorized that the missile was stolen from the sunken Russian submarine Kursk

       My thought, it was just a small bomb. Enough to damage the Pentagon but not destroy it completely. Enough to get people to believe that 9/11 was a planned attack by terrorists. 
Terrorists destroy the Twin Towers and attack the Pentagon killing many. America needs to go to war for this. Who else is easy to blame, other than another country or a "terrorists? 
Just like any one who doesn't want to be caught. Lie lie lie. Easier to blame than be at blame for your own actions.
