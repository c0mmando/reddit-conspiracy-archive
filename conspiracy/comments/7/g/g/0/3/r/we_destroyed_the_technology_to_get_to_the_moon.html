<p>The video is only 11 seconds long so just watch this freak show lie through his teeth. His speech, smiles, and overall body launguage is just off. He seems like he&#39;s hiding something for sure. Either way telling the public that they&#39;ve basically thrown money down the drain is not okay. Why the science community allows for such behavior,         (whether this guy is just lying or they actually destroyed it, both are equally weird) is just bizarre. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sourced the claim. John S. Lewis in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_the_Sky">Mining the Sky
</a>.</p>

<p>Paul Shawcross, from NASA&#39;s Office of Inspector General deny the claim it seems. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Federal Archives in East Point, Georgia, also has 2,900 cubic feet of Saturn documents,&quot; he said. &quot;Rocketdyne has in its archives dozens of volumes from its Knowledge Retention Program. This effort was initiated in the late &#39;60s to document every facet of F 1 and J 2 engine production to assist in any future restart.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The problem in recreating the Saturn 5 is not finding the drawings, it is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960&#39;s vintage hardware,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and the fact that the launch pads and vehicle assembly buildings have been converted to space shuttle use, so you have no place to launch from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, he&#39;s saying the physical technology was dismantled.  The tech is still around, but expensive to make.  It&#39;s a lot cheaper to send machines to other stellar bodies than it is people.

    <div class="md"><p>We know the blueprints for the Saturn 5 were lost following miscommunication during the a 80&#39;s spring cleaning effort.</p>

<p>Even then, the plans would not contain details for every part needed, and the company producing those specific parts would almost certainly have gone under, or been bought up. </p>

<p>Add to that, the top engineers who worked on the original Saturn 5 program, are almost certainly all dead.</p>

<p>So in short, yes, We no longer have the technology to go to the moon. Rockets would have to be designed from scratch.</p>

<p>When the government want to do a project, it will get it done, especially when it brings prestige to the ones on top. things work when people are watching closely and questioning what people are doing with money.</p>

<p>The moment <strong>anything</strong> in government is left on to its own, everything turns to shit. you would not believe how fast inertia turn anything bellow upper management to shit. Not only will people stop being efficient, middle management will actively create inconveniences to make sure they seem busy, and budgets dont shrink, and upper management dont check on them, because it is taxpayer money. </p>

<p>this is why you should not trust the government to do anything more than necessary. </p>
