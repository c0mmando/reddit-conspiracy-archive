       The video is only 11 seconds long so just watch this freak show lie through his teeth. His speech, smiles, and overall body launguage is just off. He seems like he's hiding something for sure. Either way telling the public that they've basically thrown money down the drain is not okay. Why the science community allows for such behavior,         (whether this guy is just lying or they actually destroyed it, both are equally weird) is just bizarre.

       Is there a longer video of this? almost sounds like he is saying ancient humans could get there in a nano second, but we humans destroyed it (ancient world war maybe idk) and have to reverse engineer it via old writings.

       No, he's saying that if he was given the choice he'd love to go there.  By 'in a nanosecond' he mans the same as 'in a heartbeat'.  Just a way of saying yes, 100% he wants to go there.

On a side note why the fuck would we destroy any tec? y not just set it aside if you don't need it right now, wtf?

       Sourced the claim. John S. Lewis in

       </a>
       .

       Paul Shawcross, from NASA's Office of Inspector General deny the claim it seems.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The Federal Archives in East Point, Georgia, also has 2,900 cubic feet of Saturn documents," he said. "Rocketdyne has in its archives dozens of volumes from its Knowledge Retention Program. This effort was initiated in the late '60s to document every facet of F 1 and J 2 engine production to assist in any future restart."
       </p>
       <p>
        "The problem in recreating the Saturn 5 is not finding the drawings, it is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware," he wrote, "and the fact that the launch pads and vehicle assembly buildings have been converted to space shuttle use, so you have no place to launch from.

       Just so we are clear, this dude is saying the "technology" is destroyed. Like none of the thousands of engineers behind the project could possibly hint at how to "recreate" it? Is there no person nor technology that can unlock the secrets of the magic slide rulers of the 1960s?
      </p>

       Some lost items from that program
 - all original recording footage
- telemetry / temperature / environmental data from capsule
- Saturn V engine technology
- Playtex's special suit formula
- whatever else this dude is referencing

       No, he's saying the physical technology was dismantled.  The tech is still around, but expensive to make.  It's a lot cheaper to send machines to other stellar bodies than it is people.  We don't need to put people on Mars when we can put nuclear powered mobile science labs there for a fraction of the cost.

       We know the blueprints for the Saturn 5 were lost following miscommunication during the a 80's spring cleaning effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even then, the plans would not contain details for every part needed, and the company producing those specific parts would almost certainly have gone under, or been bought up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add to that, the top engineers who worked on the original Saturn 5 program, are almost certainly all dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in short, yes, We no longer have the technology to go to the moon. Rockets would have to be designed from scratch.

       Absolutely it would be a big effort I agree. But the ability and possibility of it getting done is there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now whether or not it's worth the enormous effort is whole different discussion I suppose.

       Lol. What an incompetent agency. They shouldn't be trusted with any tax payers money. If we paid them to create technology to go to the moon and they built it and went, how can they expect us to keep giving them money if they let all that tech get destroyed? They are probably lying. I can see them lying. I can't imagine that an agency would be able to build tech that could get them to the moon 50yrs ago and then destroy it and not be able to remake it 50yrs later. Lol. Think of all the advancements in the last 50yrs. Every category you can think of has advancements except trips to the moon.

       When the government want to do a project, it will get it done, especially when it brings prestige to the ones on top. things work when people are watching closely and questioning what people are doing with money.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moment
       <strong>
        anything
       </strong>
       in government is left on to its own, everything turns to shit. you would not believe how fast inertia turn anything bellow upper management to shit. Not only will people stop being efficient, middle management will actively create inconveniences to make sure they seem busy, and budgets dont shrink, and upper management dont check on them, because it is taxpayer money.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is why you should not trust the government to do anything more than necessary.
