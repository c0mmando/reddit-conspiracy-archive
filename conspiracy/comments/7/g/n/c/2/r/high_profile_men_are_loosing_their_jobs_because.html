       Not really, I don't think low profile or medium profile people behave this way. It's a function of power, power makes them feel like they can take liberties which ordinary people don't want to take/don't dare to take. Projecting it on all males or all white males or all middle aged white males will be a mistake.

       You are free to accept whatever you like but in my experience most people are not bad. they are struggling to put food on the table you know what I mean.

       I wasn't stating an opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of the project where I was exposed to this the forces on these crews was enhanced due to the internal problems with the companies that had hired them. It caused great stress on the families and most of them had issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       As my level was direct integration at the highest level this is what I fought for. The general public that would be in direct use of the project's "product". The upper management that needed to be coddled to "keep up" and the staff working through little slivers of perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was the main system integrator and saw it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The result was very high drug and alcohol use, separating families. Loss of a stable home etc. In the offices there was rampant misbehavior from CAD designers throwing shit around the office etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I write all this because stress is the cause.

       It's common to conflate personal anecdote with general trend. I may be guilty of that as well but even from your experience, it seems you are talking about a kind of corporate culture where this happened? Not that it excuses anything, of course but NBC, Fox, Movie companies etc are corporations as well. They are the playground of the power-hungry. You need to be, to rise in the hierarchy/ladder. And those under them suffer. Stress is a symptom not the cause of the underlying problem.

       Yeah. Try being just a decent looking lady and work a minimum wage job...these "men" say and do so much stupid shit that would get them fired. Perverts come from all classes. The big shots, or men in power, tend to be more "sly" with their actions so they are harder to take down so their level of abuse grows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, the things I hear from some  ladies mouths are foul too. And handsy because they think its okay because they are women. They have to keep up with the other pervs.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a lot of good people in this world but the good people are surrounded by perverts. At least in areas I've lived, which contains a bunch of low profile people like you say. I mean, you can't even walk to your car some days without a pervert yelling sweet nothing's at you. I can only imagine what's really going on in a place like Hollywood.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm Sorry, maybe my vision is blinded but I've been acosted by perverts since I was 9. It's so far from just men in power.

       I am sorry for the experience you have to live everyday. Sounds like a horrible place. No sense of a community there it seems. It will take some work to fix and a strategy. Talking with other women in the neighborhood to try to come up with viable solutions would be one place to start. 
 It is true that perverts come from all backgrounds but powerful ones have the access and the opportunity to realize their words into deeds and and the resources to cover up afterwards. But perverts are perverts whatever background they might have. Anyways I think we are too much into the weeds now. I hope you relocate to better place or your neighborhood changes for the better. May be you will be the one to do it.

       Keep waiting. Although I'm sure there are bound to be one or two bad apples, there's just no way that there is a systemic, institutional problem of men being abused and harassed by women in any industry the way there is vice-versa in so many. No way - for a variety of reasons.

       To begin with, there's no industry in the world that's controlled by women and has some sort of raunchy girl's version of the "boy's club" culture that was known and accepted in industries like media, news, entertainment, etc etc. That's a huge one right there.

       It's common to conflate personal anecdote with general trend. I may be guilty of that as well but even from your experience, it seems you are talking about a kind of corporate culture where this happened? Not that it excuses anything, of course but NBC, Fox, Movie companies etc are corporations as well. They are the playground of the power-hungry. You need to be, to rise in the hierarchy/ladder. And those under them suffer. Stress is a symptom not the cause of the underlying problem.
