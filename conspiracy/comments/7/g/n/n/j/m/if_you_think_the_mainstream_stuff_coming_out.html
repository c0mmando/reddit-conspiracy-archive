       Kind of. Interesting how many important members of the counter-culture movement had parents who were high ranking military officers. I think Jim Morrison's dad was heavily involved in the Gulf of Tonkin false flag.

       I dunno, there were a lot of songs in the charts over here in the UK back in the 70s and 80s that were very much protest songs or looking at what was wrong in society ("Ghost Town" by The Specials is one of them), while the biggest hit All Saints had in 1997 was a cover of "Under The Bridge", originally by Red Hot Chili Peppers, which detailed the singer's isolation due to his sobriety and how awful life was when he was a drug addict, with the city of LA as his only friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, The X Factor winner usually had the #1 spot in the charts on Christmas week for several years, until the public grew sick of it and bought Rage Against The Machine's "Killing In The Name" instead, then won the chart battle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though I guess as with 90% of conspiracies, it tends to be "all music/mainstream media/whatever is evil and lying to us", when they actually mean "in America", because that's the only point of view they have and the rest of the world doesn't seem to exist, unless it forms part of a conspiracy theory that involves American agencies.

       Always wondered why so many rappers look at 2Pac as this god figure when a lot of them are making music and pushing a culture that he was totally opposed to. Almost like they don't want that type of music being made.

       Biggie was assassinated by an LAPD officer, a corrupt one, but an officer nonetheless. That's not even a conspiracy, that's public information and elimination of possible suspects.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was actually pretty fucked up to read about it, because even if I didn't like Biggie, everyone deserves justice.

       Having watched them backtoback... interesting how both address white men.  Both note they voted Obama in and share some of the same oppression.  KRS notes they are part of hip hop and the humanist-freedom movement, from abolition to now.  Griff holds preppers up as a model to follow.

       Also Tupac's history itself is so fascinating. His parents were Black Panthers, and he was being groomed at a young age to take over leadership. 4,000 page FBI file and 95% of it's still locked up. The man was brilliant, a true threat to the CIA/Skull &amp; Bones drug trafficking operation.

       When Morrison joined the band, he brought with him enough songs for their first two albums. However, he didn't know how to play an instrument or even how to read or write music.
       <strong>
        Most likely the music had be written by professional musicians, given to Morrison, and he took the credit.

       Members of the military and intelligence communities probably didn't want their sons going to Vietnam. So they created created Laurel Cannon as a psyop to protect them and sabotage the peace movement. The bands that resided in Laurel Cannon were not drafted and seemed to be protected from any drug prosecution.  (Except for Authur Lee of Love. I guess he wasn't in the club.)

       Military intelligence.  Most of the California musical groups of the 1960s and 1970s have ties to the Pentagon.  More importantly, they all moved to Laurel Canyon at the same time, before there was a music scene or music industry in Los Angeles.

       Most importantly, they all moved into the same neighborhood as a covert U.S. military outpost called Lookout Mountain that was a media facility with a self-contained film studio bigger than Hollywood, where such Hollywood stars as Bing Crosby, Marilyn Monroe &amp; others worked on unknown projects.  The father of Sharon Tate (the major alleged "Manson Family" killing) was Lt. Col. Paul Tate, U.S. military intelligence.  Tate was also killed in Laurel Canyon, as were many other serial killings.

         A lot of serial killers seem to follow the CIA's handbook on assignations. (don't bring a weapon, use what is available as a weapon. if you do bring a gun, use a small calibre weapon because it is actually more effective with a head shot.)

         Henry Lee Lucas was pardoned by George W Bush from execution. This was very unusually because Texas executes more people than any other state. Henry wrote a book claiming that he was an assassin. A lot of is murders were contract killings and the others were to throw of the police.

       I can find quite a few articles discrediting the archaeologist E. Gary Stickel, but his report is online and it seems pretty conclusive. I think he has pretty good credentials as an archaeologist. The tunnels seem like prima facie evidence to me.

       btw. I like to watch old episodes of Star Trek Voyager. There is an episode where 7of9 starts to remember some repressed memory’s of her being sexually assaulted by an alien that trades with Voyager. But it turned out the memory’s were inaccurate. The trader killed himself because of her allegations. I wonder if this episode was designed to program the public as part of operation mocking bird or something like it.

       Most of not all musicians have weird childhoods. Having strict military parents is probably the reason these kids picked up instruments to begin with. Every generation wants to get away from their parents world. The music to me was really good and a lot of meaningful songs. I don’t understand why everything people don’t like here is MKULTRA

       I read that book a while back because a musician friend borrowed it to me.  My personal opinion is that the research is pretty good but i thought the overall organization of the book sucked. Also I think that sometimes McGowan does a bit of guilt by association type stuff.

       That being said I think that there's a ton of good info in the book and for those interested but don't want to buy it or take the time to read it, just listen to a podcast that has Dave McGowan on it and let him explain his own research.
