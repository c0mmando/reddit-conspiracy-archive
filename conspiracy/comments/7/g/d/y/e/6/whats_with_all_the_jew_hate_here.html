       Now I'm not saying all of you are antisemitic but damn there's a lot of those types that congregate here. I have been told this sub just does t like Zionism and stuff like that, but constantly I see posts about how the jews did this or that. I don't want to call out specific people but my god there's a lot of retards on here straight from stormfront. It's disturbing. Like /r/ conspiracy has been hijacked by pathetic neonazis. It's sad. These people need to be purged.

       Ok man. Have fun protecting neonazis. I'm not saying ban everyone that uses the word jew.  I'm just surprised their ideas aren't challenged. When I say get them out I don't mean to call for a strict ban on them or their ideas, just enough people saying they are full of shit and downvoting them and they won't feel welcome hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could have been wrong. Maybe this place is worse off than I thought if so many protect these ideas.

       Their ideas are challenged plenty.  And I'm not protecting neonazis.

       Didn't take you long to start flaming about protecting Nazis.  So like I said, instead of trying silence people you don't agree with you can just go somewhere else instead.

       What you're doing is asking people to abandon free speech because of one particular ideology of nasty origins, and when they refuse your idea to abandon free speech then you accuse them of actually being an supporter of that nasty ideology.

       That's not what I'm trying to do. I couldn't give a flying fuck if Richard Spencer is allowed to speak and i feel like the people that protested him and used their hecklers veto strategy are children. I'm also not calling for these people to be banned from anywhere. I just don't want them to feel welcomed. I'm not making wild claims about random people being Nazis. I'm saying the ones that just always say "It's the fucking jews!" seem to be neonazis. I don't see how that is a wild claim.

       How about you give me an example of your "evidence" and then I'll explain it to you in a language you can understand, cuz there appears to be a gap here.

       My understanding was that you knew all the details and could explain them in a way that wasn't "tribalism" and showed their actions had some greater purpose that could be projected onto selfishness and greed.

       No my honest opinion is that I don't know enough about it to make a judgement. I don't think everyone in Israel deserves to die or be thrown out and I don't think they are inherently evil. I believe the same thing about the Palestinians. I don't know near enough about that subject to make a judgement. I just know that the jews aren't behind every major conspiracy in the world.

       That is like the most loaded question in the world. They shouldn't be wiped off the map how's that for an answer? Should Israel have ever been established in the first place? That's what I need to learn more about. Fact is it's there now, and it would be wrong to just banish them from that land and genocide them on the way out.

       What are you talking about? It's pretty clear that you are just trying to get me to say something specific and then call me out on it somehow. I'm saying countries shouldn't be established based on being a certain race. Like the usa shouldn't be a white ethnostate like some altright people want. Culture is different. A country needs to have people with similar cultural ideas or everything will fall apart.

       The problem is people who misconstrue Zionism for Judaism. They are not one and the same. As we all know, some of the most valuable Zionists are non-Jews (not connected to Jews ethnically, religiously, or culturally). Jewish people are like all people...some good, some bad, some ugly, some crazy...etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zionists, and whoever they work for, would like you to hate Judaism and Jews. They don't care. In fact, they would like you and I to be 'antisemitic'...this gives them an excuse to engage in military operations and perhaps even use the Sampson Option.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop hating Jews, Muslims, Christians. I suggest we direct our energy towards those who manipulate the sheep, not the sheep themselves.

       So, you are unwilling, or I suspect are unable, to cite even one example here in the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       subreddit of 'a lot of people doing it' to support your accusation.  And you are now quire rudely accusing me of being blind, I suppose for either not buying your accusation as true on its face without any specific demonstration of its truth, or for merely asking for such a demonstration.

       Nope.  I'm saying that free speech requires that we don't let Nazis run off people they don't like.  A Nazi by any other name is still a Nazi.

       I think we are having a misunderstanding. I'm saying run them off as in call them out so much that they just just leave. I'm not advocating for pitchforks unless they start engaging in their violent ideas. Let them speak all they want, just call them out on their shit. Free speech to combat free speech so to speak. And no not in the form of hecklers veto. More in the way of debate.

       I'm not on board with the widespread use of the word Nazi. I don't think the American political system is full of them and I certainly don't think Trump is a Nazi if that's what your going for. I mean Nazi in the sense that people are propagating the idea that the evil Jews are ruining the country and we have to stop them. You know, like the Nazis thought.

       Maybe I pulled the trigger early on that one. If I did I apologize. Didn't mean to come off a one of those people from politics. I'm was just saying you seem to deny the presence of antisemitism in this subreddit. And I haven't lied about any of my positions.

       I never denied the presence of antisemitism or any other wrongthink.  What I did was acknowledge the right of those concepts to exist and be spoken under the principles of free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of the issue with disallowing these topics to be freely discussed, as you've clearly demonstrated yourself, is that people can define antisemitism, racism, bigotry etc etc very loosely to demonize or silence almost anything they wish.

       Ok sure yeah they can say whatever they want. I don't want there to be legal repercussions for any sort of speech except maybe actively inciting violence towards anyone. Or stuff like yelling bomb in an airport. Causing mass panic or something of that sort.
      </p>

       I honestly understand your concerns with readily labeling people. The word Nazi does get thrown around Willy nilly against a lot of conservatives as a way to discredit them and that's a problem. Or the even newer tactic of labeling people online as Russians. I do however have to take exception here with you saying that's what I'm doing here. I accept that someone could be against Zionism without being necessarily antisemitic, but I'm talking more about the people referring to the "jews" as the cause for all these conspiracies. Plenty of examples in this thread and others. Like the dude pretty explicitly calling for Jews to be "charboiled". That shit is gross and toxic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do understand where your coming from though, as people really so throw these terms around left and right to discredit people. Nazi being a big one. Though it seems a lot of people here espouse some Nazi ideology. Not in some abstract way either, but directly calling for the overthrow of "the jews".

       What would you have done about it? Is this one conclusion to be forbidden? Are there specific areas it's forbidden or is it a forbidden conclusion for anything and all things?  It's not like everyone here believes these conclusions, hell they are rarely popular comments at all.  So should we mock these people to such an extent that they leave forever never to return? And if we successfully mock them into exile are we accomplishing anything other than ensuring that they land square in the center of actual neo-nazi forums like stormfront only to crystalize their radicalization by denying them a compassionate audience of people who don't necessarily agree with their antisemitism?

       The worst example of an antisemite that has ever graced this subreddit was in fact a Jewish kid (Joshua Goldberg) pretending to be a neo-nazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most accused antisemites simply want a level playing field where 98% of banking and media power positions aren't held by Zionists who are willing to lie cheat and steal in the name of creating greater Israel.

       Maybe purged was the wrong choice of wording but No I don't think people should be banned from here for espousing certain ideas. I think they should be dented and exposed and made to feel unwelcome. I'm beginning to feel that there is a majority here that just accept many of the antisemites here though. So hey if y'all want to be a racist community go for it. A true recipe for having your ideas thrown to the curb.

       Give us a few examples, won't you?  That's a pretty serious accusation.  And you owe us evidence to support what you assert, else I might just have to come to the conclusion that you are only here to provide cover to the multiplicity of the crimes rightly attributed to the Zionists who wage Apartheid and Genocide in The Middle East.

       Your argument relies on the dishonest tactic increasingly pushed by Zionist factions to discredit any criticism of Zionism by falsely insisting that Zionist=Jew and Jew=Zionist.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, a panel of Zionists recently appeared before Congress, trying to convince them to accept their assertion that criticism of Zionism (and its product, the State of Israel) is a form of 'anti-Semitism'. To their credit,
       <strong>
        <em>
         other Jews
        </em>
       </strong>
       testified that conflating the terms was
       <strong>
        <em>
         not
        </em>
       </strong>
       appropriate.

       The Zionist position hogwash, but given the power of AIPAC, Congress will no doubt buy the false and bigoted definition, just as Britain recently did.

       Yeah I'm not understanding this defense either. Obviously some people are just against the idea of Zionism. As I understand it some jews are too. However, most people here seem to just be throwing around the word new like it's a slur. One even going as far as saying the jews "time is coming". A look at his post history shows he clearly wants to exterminate the Jewish people entirely. Yet I'm apparently a crazed leftist communist Marxist Nazi for pointing out blatant antisemitism. When in reality I'm probably considered fairly conservative in today's political sphere. Certainly you will not find me advocating for any communist rule.

       Okay, you are upset because people are conflating 'Zionists' with 'Jews', and vice-versa, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do people tend do that?

       As I clearly demonstrated above, it is Zionists who are busting their asses trying to falsely conflate these terms. Why? So they can shield their nefarious activities under the apron of Judaism.

       Zionists abuse the charge of 'anti-Semitism', using it as their

       Of course, there are other, more sensitive factors to be considered as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        To what extent are Jews in the US politically, ideologically and socially in alignment with the broader views and goals of Jewish Nationalism/ Political Zionism?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Here it is important to bear in mind that, thanks to generations of propaganda and inculcation, for most people,
        <em>
         including many Jews
        </em>
        , the perceived definition of the term
        <strong>
         <em>
          'Zionism'
         </em>
        </strong>
        has been whitewashed, simplified and twisted to mean
        <em>
         'supporting Israel's right to exist'
        </em>
        . In fact, the term was originally
        <em>
         (and is more accurately)
        </em>
        defined as belief/ participation in and/or support of
        <strong>
         <em>
          Jewish Nationalism
         </em>
        </strong>
        , which defines Jews as a Race, Ethnic Group, Tribe, or 'Nation', without regard to geopolitical borders.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Considering the limitations created by this widely accepted (but false) definition of 'Zionism', let's see how
       <strong>
        <em>
         Jews living in America
        </em>
       </strong>
       responded when asked polled about their views on the Zionist State of Israel.

       The responses given above would indicate that Jews living in the US are overwhelming supportive of and emotionally attached to Zionism/ Israel. This is especially noteworthy 1/3 to 1/2 (depending on definition) of all Jews live in the US, and these Jews are viewed the most 'assimilated' of any Jewish population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the opinions expressed in the polls, AND the fact that so many Jews are visibly and vocally supportive, as opposed to the tiny minority who openly express opposition...

       Personally, I find the reverse true too. Anti-Semites (many on this thread included)
       <em>
        love
       </em>
       to conflate Jews and Zionists, then they have an immediate
       <em>
        Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free
       </em>
       card when accused of anti-Semitism. "Gasp! Me? No! I only hate Zionists!" then go off on some anti-Semitic rant about how 17th century "Zionists" ate babies for Passover and that Hitler was right etc.

       Yes, they do, and with nefarious intent; using others Jews as a fulcrum to gain political leverage.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it seems to me that any Jew who repudiates Zionism should be up in arms in he face of such defamation, shouting from the rooftops in condemnation of those bastards for having the nerve to try to associate them with such a repulsive racist ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       But where are these indignant Jews? Aside from the quirky Satmars, Neturei Karta and a few other fringe, eccentric minority sects, there are only a handful of Jews who openly denounce Zionism. And all of these are derided and reviled as 'renegades' or 'self-hating Jews' by most other Jews. I have run across a few on social media, but again, these are viciously condemned and ridiculed by other Jews, who often insist that they must be fakes, imposters.

       Rather, it calls attention to another factor that cannot be ignored, whether the majority (or a plurality) of Jews here in the US

        <em>
         do
        </em>

       subscribe to Zionist ideology, and if so, to what extent.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       On the contrary, the facts and statistics revealed in the poll clearly show that Jews are NOT all Zionists, which has been my position all along. Indeed, the data provided shows that Zionist proclivities vary considerably by age group, sex, and religious identity (or lack thereof), with Modern Orthodox, Orthodox and Conservative tending to lean more Zionist than other groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even here, this does not present a full picture, as in the US, the groups who tend to lean most Zionist represent a minority within the overall Jewish population.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/10/jew-overview-6.png">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That taken into consideration, the figures I supplied above (Net Jewish) show that on the whole, US Jews tend to be quite sympathetic to Zionism and related ideologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, the data gathered has its limitations, because the questions examined above relate only to US Jews' opinions on the Political State of Israel, and that is NOT the heart of Zionism/ Jewish Nationalism, rather, it is the deep underlying sense of familial kinship, tribe, culture, religious and secular community, ethnic unity and cohesion and nationality that binds Jews together
       <strong>
        <em>
         as a separate and distinct people
        </em>
       </strong>
       . These instinctive and emotional ties existed for many centuries before the concept of Political Zionism ever reared its head, and the success of the latter is utterly dependent on this broader sense of community which has existed and persisted for thousands of years without any firm political structure or geographic center as a focal point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quite astounding, I must say, and I am unaware of any other group with a similar history.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, Zionism or anti-Zionism all about Israel? No. Israel has certainly become the focal point, but only because it has concentrated vast numbers of a long-scattered people into a single regions where the cumulative traits of their tribe are writ large, as they have autonomy over their own governance and fates, free to craft their society, lives, and destiny as never before.
      </p>
      <p>
       The emergence of Israel as an autonomous society has revealed much of Jewish character that had  long been long been cultivated, but largely unseen due to their isolation, obscurity, and living for centuries as minorities among larger outside groups. The manifestation of these traits has been something of a shock, not only to outsiders, but to the Israeli Jews themselves, as they grapple to reach an equilibrium in their new 'reality'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Viewed by outsiders (especially gentiles), some of these traits are seen as laudable, while others are seen as shocking and repulsive,
       <strong>
        <em>
         especially
        </em>
       </strong>
       the way that Jews treat non-Jews who find themselves in the unhappy position of living under Jewish control, occupation and subjugation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is that the Jews of Israel remain intimately tied with Jews in diaspora, and that the creation, growth and continued success of the Zionist regime is
       <strong>
        <em>
         utterly dependent
        </em>
       </strong>
       on the cooperation and support of Zionist Jews living outside of 'The Realm', and their ability to wrangle financial and political support by working with the governments of 'The Nations'. This means that the Zionist Jews living in diaspora cannot fully divorce themselves from the policies, practices and actions, whether 'good' or 'bad', committed by their Israeli kin, because they are the ENABLERS of that behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zionism, Jewish Nationalism has long existed in the hearts and minds of the Israelites- 'The Jews', and there it continues to dwell, with or without political frontiers. The question is whether it can continue on its present course, interacting with gentile society in this modern age without major changes in attitude and behavior facilitating coexistence, and failing that, what will be the outcome?
      </p>

       This is a typical BS approach - and I notice it more and more. Something as long term and wide spanning as total global domination - and you here this "show me the evidence" line. Do you think there is a piece of paper somewhere signed by Barack Obama/Jesus Christ/ Arnold Schwarzenegger proving the Zionist conspiracy. Of course not. The evidence is literally all of recorded history. And even if that paper did exist - nobody would read it

       There is not a secret cabal of Jews running this country. That's an absurd idea. You would need a lot of evidence to justify that claim. Not just proving Israeli against have tried to influence our policy. Russia and Iran and many others could be proven to have tried similar tactics, but that doesn't mean they control our country.

       Why Israel belongs to Palestine when Jews ruled Judea and that region long before and have been trough many wars to win back their land. I know it’s very complicated and probably don’t know the whole story but I’m sure a lot of us are misled on the situation over there.

       Israel is to blame as well but both sides are acting ridiculous with terrorism and settlements building.

       We respect you have acknowledged some blissful ignorance but to call the notion of Zionism and Jewish cabal "absurd" already indicated that. There IS endless and insipid evidence on many fronts to prove this. Take the fact "Jewish Americans" stand at a population rate of 2-3%. Now consider that  the leadership and influential positions of every facet of industry/politics/media etc. 
 - the percentage of Jews rises to well over 90 percent. Its not conspiratorial - its fact. Opinion may lie within the extent to which they operate under nefarious motivations - but they sure as hell control every single entity that matters

       Excellent point. The sheer notion that something is a "conspiracy" invokes immediate dismissal of any legitimate truths. Just bc the insinuation that the most powerful people in the world conspire to varying degrees so as to remain powerful - is it that Hard to fathom???

       Look I said this in another comment in thread but I cant tell if you are genuine or troll. Consider what you just asked me for - realistically. To what capacity - could I actually sit here and fire off every single company/political party/historical event and its list of jewish controlled influence. Thats asking a lot. Its there for you to see but not in some neat bulleted Power Point. Lets do this :  take one entity which exhibits clear influence on everyday life - the establishment media/hollywood. Something undeniably American and yet it is confoundingly dominated by Jews. Here is a sneak peak -

       Now I would appreciate you dont just read the headline but take a moment to ingest the spiderweb of influence and control wielded from its inception. If you'd like - throw any other remotely significant group you think ISN'T and I will provide the same disparity vs. actual jewish population in this country.

       Browsed through the article real quick. Seems like not all the jews agree here on this bill. Also, this isn't exactly revealing anything. All sorts of groups try to pass laws to protect themselves with laws. Was the transgendered bathroom bill evidence of a tranny takeover of the world?

       I suppose that is asking for a lot, and it would take a while, but that's a bold claim. I realize there are a lot of successful jews but can you point to some evidence besides some shitty website that they are controlling us? Like things they have actually done? A new owning a newspaper doesn't mean they are using their great Jewish powers to control people.

       The largest media conglomerate today is Walt Disney Company, whose chairman and CEO, Michael Eisner, is a Jew. The Disney Empire, headed by a man described by one media analyst as a “control freak”, includes several television production companies (Walt Disney Television, Touchstone Television, Buena Vista Television), its own cable network with 14 million subscribers, and two video production companies. As for feature films, the Walt Disney Picture Group, headed by Joe Roth (also a Jew), includes Touchstone Pictures, Hollywood Pictures, and Caravan Pictures. Disney also owns Miramax Films, run by the Weinstein brothers. When the Disney Company was run by the Gentile Disney family prior to its takeover by Eisner in 1984, it epitomized wholesome, family entertainment. While it still holds the rights to Snow White, under Eisner, the company has expanded into the production of graphic sex and violence. In addition, it has 225 affiliated stations in the United States and is part owner of several European TV companies. ABC’s cable subsidiary, ESPN, is headed by president and CEO Steven Bornstein, a Jew.
      </p>
      <p>
       This corporation also has a controlling share of Lifetime Television and the Arts &amp; Entertainment Network cable companies. ABC Radio Network owns eleven AM and ten FM stations, again in major cities such as New York, Washington, Los Angeles, and has over 3,400 affiliates. Although primarily a telecommunications company, Capital Cities/ABC earned over $1 billion in publishing in 1994. It owns seven daily newspapers, Fairchild Publications, Chilton Publications, and the Diversified Publishing Group. Time Warner, Inc, is the second of the international media leviathans.
      </p>
      <p>
       The chairman of the board and CEO, Gerald Levin, is a Jew. Time Warner’s subsidiary HBO is the country’s largest pay-TV cable network. Warner Music is by far the world’s largest record company, with 50 labels, the biggest of which is Warner Brothers Records, headed by Danny Goldberg. Stuart Hersch is president of Warnervision, Warner Music’s video production unit. Goldberg and Hersch are Jews. Warner Music was an early promoter of “gangsta rap.” Through its involvement with Interscope Records, it helped popularize a genre whose graphic lyrics explicitly urge Blacks to commit acts of violence against Whites. In addition to cable and music, Time Warner is heavily involved in the production of feature films (Warner Brothers Studio) and publishing. Time Warner’s publishing division (editor-in-chief Norman Pearlstine, a Jew) is the largest magazine publisher in the country (Time, Sports Illustrated, People, Fortune).
      </p>
      <p>
       When Ted Turner, a Gentile, made a bid to buy CBS in 1985, there was panic in media boardrooms across the nation. Turner made a fortune in advertising and then had built a successful cable-TV news network, CNN. Although Turner employed a number of Jews in key executive positions in CNN and had never taken public positions contrary to Jewish interests, he is a man with a large ego and a strong personality and was regarded by Chairman William Paley (real name Palinsky, a Jew) and the other Jews at CBS as uncontrollable: a loose cannon who might at some time in the future turn against them. Furthermore, Jewish newsman Daniel Schorr, who had worked for Turner, publicly charged that his former boss held a personal dislike for Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       To block Turner’s bid, CBS executives invited billionaire Jewish theater, hotel, insurance, and cigarette magnate Laurence Tisch to launch a “friendly” takeover of the company, and from 1986 till 1995 Tisch was the chairman and CEO of CBS, removing any threat of non-Jewish influence there. Subsequent efforts by Turner to acquire a major network have been obstructed by Levin’s Time Warner, which owns nearly 20 percent of CBS stock and has veto power over major deals. Viacom, Inc, headed by Sumner Redstone (born Murray Rothstein), a Jew, is the third largest megamedia corporation in the country, with revenues of over $10 billion a year. Viacom, which produces and distributes TV programs for the three largest networks, owns 12 television stations and 12 radio stations. It produces feature films through Paramount Pictures, headed by Jewess Sherry Lansing. Its publishing division includes Prentice Hall, Simon &amp; Schuster, and Pocket Books.
      </p>
      <p>
       It distributes videos through over 4,000 Blockbuster stores. Viacom’s chief claim to fame, however, is as the world’s largest provider of cable programming, through its Showtime, MTV, Nickelodeon, and other networks. Since 1989, MTV and Nickelodeon have acquired larger and larger shares of the younger television audience. With the top three, and by far the largest, media companies in the hand of Jews, it is difficult to believe that such an overwhelming degree of control came about without a deliberate, concerted effort on their part. What about the other big media companies? Number four on the list is Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, which owns Fox Television and 20th Century Fox Films. Murdoch is a Gentile, but Peter Chermin, who heads Murdoch’s film studio and also oversees his TV production, is a Jew. Number five is the Japanese Sony Corporation, whose U.S. subsidiary, Sony Corporation of America, is run by Michael Schulhof, a Jew. Alan Levine, another Jew, heads the Sony Pictures division. Most of the television and movie production companies that are not owned by the largest corporations are also controlled by Jews. For example, New World Entertainment, proclaimed by one media analyst as “the premiere independent TV program producer in the United States,” is owned by Ronald Perelman, a Jew. The best known of the smaller media companies, Dreamworks SKG, is a strictly kosher affair.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dream Works was formed in 1994 amid great media hype by recording industry mogul David Geffen, former Disney Pictures chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, and film director Steven Spielberg, all three of whom are Jews. The company produces movies, animated films, television programs, and recorded music. Two other large production companies, MCA and Universal Pictures, are both owned by Seagram Company, Ltd. The president and CEO of Seagram, the liquor giant, is Edgar Bronfman Jr., who is also president of the World Jewish Congress. It is well known that Jews have controlled the production and distribution of films since the inception of the movie industry in the early decades of the 20th century.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is still the case today. Films produced by just the five largest motion picture companies mentioned above-Disney, Warner Brothers, Sony, Paramount (Viacom), and Universal (Seagram)-accounted for 74 per cent of the total box-office receipts for the first eight months of 1995. The big three in television network broadcasting used to be ABC, CBS, and NBC. With the consolidation of the media empires, these three are no longer independent entities. While they were independent, however, each was controlled by a Jew since its inception: ABC by Leonard Goldenson, CBS first by William Paley and then by Lawrence Tisch, and NBC first by David Sarnoff and then by his son Robert. Over periods of several decades, these networks were staffed from top to bottom with Jews, and the essential Jewishness of network television did not change when the networks were absorbed by other corporations. The Jewish presence in television news remains particularly strong. As noted, ABC is part of Eisner’s Disney Company, and the executive producers of ABC’s news programs are all Jews: Victor Neufeld (20-20), Bob Reichbloom (Good Morning America), and Rick Kaplan (World News Tonight). CBS was recently purchased by Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Nevertheless, the man appointed by Lawrence Tisch, Eric Ober, remains president of CBS News, and Ober is a Jew. At NBC, now owned by General Electric, NBC News president Andrew Lack is a Jew, as are executive producers Jeff Zucker (Today), Jeff Gralnick (NBC Nightly News), and Neal Shapiro (Dateline).

       <strong>
        <em>
         Part 2 OF 2
        </em>
       </strong>
       The Print Media After television news, daily newspapers are the most influential information medium in America. Sixty million of them are sold (and presumably read) each day. These millions are divided among some 1,500 different publications. One might conclude that the sheer number of different newspapers across America would provide a safeguard against Jewish control and distortion. However, this is not the case. There is less independence, less competition, and much less representation of our interests than a casual observer would think.
      </p>
      <p>
       The days when most cities and even towns had several independently owned newspapers published by local people with close ties to the community are gone. Today, most “local” newspapers are owned by a rather small number of large companies controlled by executives who live and work hundreds or ever thousands of miles away. The fact is that only about 25 per cent of the country’s 1,500 papers are independently owned; the rest belong to multi-newspaper chains. Only a handful are large enough to maintain independent reporting staffs outside their own communities; the rest depend on these few for all of their national and international news. The Newhouse empire of Jewish brothers Samuel and Donald Newhouse provides an example of more than the lack of real competition among America’s daily newspapers: it also illustrates the insatiable appetite Jews have shown for all the organs of opinion control on which they could fasten their grip.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Newhouses own 26 daily newspapers, including several large and important ones, such as the Cleveland Plain Dealer, the Newark Star-Ledger, and the New Orleans Times-Picayune; the nation’s largest trade book publishing conglomerate, Random House, with all its subsidiaries; Newhouse Broadcasting, consisting of 12 television broadcasting stations and 87 cable-TV systems, including some of the country’s largest cable networks; the Sunday supplement Parade, with a circulation of more than 22 million copies per week; some two dozen major magazines, including the New Yorker, Vogue, Madmoiselle, Glamour, Vanity Fair, Bride’s, Gentlemen’s Quarterly, Self, House &amp; Garden, and all the other magazines of the wholly owned Conde Nast group.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Jewish media empire was founded by the late Samuel Newhouse, an immigrant from Russia. The gobbling up of so many newspapers by the Newhouse family was in large degree made possible by the fact that newspapers are not supported by their subscribers, but by their advertisers. It is advertising revenue–not the small change collected from a newspaper’s readers–that largely pays the editor’s salary and yields the owner’s profit. Whenever the large advertisers in a city choose to favor one newspaper over another with their business, the favored newspaper will flourish while its competitor dies. Since the beginning of the 20th century, when Jewish mercantile power in America became a dominant economic force, there has been a steady rise in the number of American newspapers in Jewish hands, accompanied by a steady decline in the number of competing Gentile newspapers–primarily as a result of selective advertising policies by Jewish merchants. Furthermore, even those newspapers still under Gentile ownership and management are so thoroughly dependent upon Jewish advertising revenue that their editorial and news reporting policies are largely constrained by Jewish likes and dislikes. It holds true in the newspaper business as elsewhere that he who pays the piper calls the tune.
Three Jewish Newspapers
      </p>
      <p>
       The suppression of competition and the establishment of local monopolies on the dissemination of news and opinion have characterized the rise of Jewish control over America’s newspapers. The resulting ability of the Jews to use the press as an unopposed instrument of Jewish policy could hardly be better illustrated than by the examples of the nation’s three most prestigious and influential newspapers: the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post. These three, dominating America’s financial and political capitals, are the newspapers which set the trends and the guidelines for nearly all the others. They are the ones which decide what is news and what isn’t, at the national and international levels. They originate the news; the others merely copy it, and all three newspapers are in Jewish hands. The New York Times was founded in 1851 by two Gentiles, Henry Raymond and George Jones. After their deaths, it was purchased in 1896 from Jones’s estate by a wealthy Jewish publisher, Adolph Ochs. His great-grandson, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr., is the paper’s current publisher and CEO. The executive editor is Max Frankel, and the managing editor is Joseph Lelyveld.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both of the latter are also Jews. The Sulzberger family also owns, through the New York Times Co., 33 other newspapers, including the Boston Globe; twelve magazines, including McCall’s and Family Circle with circulations of more than 5 million each; seven radio and TV broadcasting stations; a cable-TV system; and three book publishing companies. The New York Times News Service transmits news stories, features, and photographs from the New York Times by wire to 506 other newspapers, news agencies, and magazines. Of similar national importance is the Washington Post, which, by establishing its “leaks” throughout government agencies in Washington, has an inside track on news involving the Federal government.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Washington Post, like the New York Times, had a non-Jewish origin. It was established in 1877 by Stilson Hutchins, purchased from him in 1905 by John McLean, and later inherited by Edward McLean. In June 1933, however, at the height of the Great Depression, the newspaper was forced into bankruptcy. It was purchased at a bankruptcy auction by Eugene Meyer, a Jewish financier. The Washington Post is now run by Katherine Meyer Graham, Eugene Meyer’s daughter. She is the principal stockholder and the board chairman of the Washington Post Co.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1979, she appointed her son Donald publisher of the paper. He now also holds the posts of president and CEO of the Washington Post Co. The Washington Post Co. has a number of other media holdings in newspapers, television, and magazines, most notably the nation’s number-two weekly newsmagazine, Newsweek. The Wall Street Journal, which sells 1.8 million copies each weekday, is the nation’s largest-circulation daily newspaper. It is owned by Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc., a New York corporation which also publishes 24 other daily newspapers and the weekly financial tabloid Barron’s, among other things. The chairman and CEO of Dow Jones is Peter Kann, who is a Jew. Kann also holds the posts of chairman and publisher of the Wall Street Journal. Most of New York’s other major newspapers are in no better hands than the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. The New York Daily News is owned by Jewish real-estate developer Mortimer B. Zuckerman. The Village Voice is the personal property of Leonard Stern, the billionaire Jewish owner of the Hartz Mountain pet supply firm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other Mass Media
      </p>
      <p>
       The story is pretty much the same for other media as it is for television, radio, and newspapers. Consider, for example, newsmagazines. There are only three of any note published in the United States: Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News and World Report. Time, with a weekly circulation of 4.1 million, is published by a susidiary of Time Warner Communications. The CEO of Time Warner Communications, as mentioned above, is Gerald Levin, a Jew. Newsweek, as mentioned above, is published by the Washington Post Company, under the Jewess Katherine Meyer Graham.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its weekly circulation is 3.2 million. U.S. News &amp; World Report, with a weekly circulation of 2.3 million, is owned and published by Mortimer Zuckerman, a Jew. Zuckerman also owns the Atlantic Monthly and New York’s tabloid newspaper, the Daily News, which is the sixth-largest paper in the country. Among the giant book-publishing conglomerates, the situation is also Jewish. Three of the six largest book publishers in the U.S., according to Publisher’s Weekly, are owned or controlled by Jews. The three are first-place Random House (with its many subsidiaries, including Crown Publishing Group), third-place Simon &amp; Schuster, and sixth-place Time Warner Trade Group (including Warner Books and Little, Brown). Another publisher of special significance is Western Publishing. Although it ranks only 13th in size among all U.S. publishers, it ranks first among publishers of children’s books, with more than 50 percent of the market. Its chairman and CEO is Richard Snyder, a Jew, who just replaced Richard Bernstein, also a Jew.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Effect of Jewish Control of the Media
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the facts of Jewish media control in America. Anyone willing to spend several hours in a large library can verify their accuracy. I hope that these facts are disturbing to you, to say the least. Should any minority be allowed to wield such awesome power? Certainly, not and allowing a people with beliefs such as expressed in the Talmud, to determine what we get to read or watch in effect gives this small minority the power to mold our minds to suit their own Talmudic interests, interests which as we have demonstrated are diametrically opposed to the interests of our people. By permitting the Jews to control our news and entertainment media, we are doing more than merely giving them a decisive influence on our political system and virtual control of our government; we also are giving them control of the minds and souls of our children, whose attitudes and ideas are shaped more by Jewish television and Jewish films than by their parents, their schools, or any other influence.

       You are correct. Without context or further breakdown it is no way a PROOF that Jewish control is conspiring to dominate the world. It is merely a reflection of the current state we live in. And when compared to overall pop. it is very clear they hold a disparate amount of influence. No amount of resourcefulness or shrewd business sense can account for such a stark and drastic discrepancy. 2 percent of population VS. 96% of mass media.

      <p>
       PS -
       <strong>
        Da GOYIM = all non jews
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The goyim have lost the habit of thinking unless prompted by the suggestions of our specialists
       </strong>
       . Therefore they do not see the urgent necessity of what we, when our kingdom comes, shall adopt at once, namely this, that it is essential to teach in national schools one simple, true piece of knowledge, the basis of all knowledge -- the knowledge of the structure of human life, of social existence, which requires division of labour, and, consequently, the division of men into classes and conditions. It is essential for all to know that owing to difference in the objects of human activity there cannot be any equality, that he who by any act of his compromises a whole class cannot be equally responsible before the law with him who affects no one but only his own honour.
       <strong>
        The true knowledge of the structure of society, into the secrets of which we do not admit the goyim, would demonstrate to all men that the positions and work must be kept within a certain circle, that they may not become a source of human suffering, arising from an education which does not correspond with the work which individuals are called upon to do.
       </strong>
       After a thorough study of this knowledge the peoples will voluntarily submit to authority and accept such position as is appointed them in the State. In the present state of knowledge and the direction we have given to its development the people, blindly believing things in print -- cherishes -- thanks to promptings intended to mislead and to its own ignorance -- a blind hatred towards all conditions which it considers above itself, for it has no understanding of the meaning of class and condition.
This hatred will be still further magnified by the effects of an economic crisis, which will stop dealings on the exchanges and bring industry to a standstill. We shall create by all the secret subterranean methods open to us and with the aid of gold, which is all in our hands, a universal economic crisis whereby we shall throw upon the streets whole mobs of workers simultaneously in all the countries of Europe. These mobs will rush delightedly to shed the blood of those whom, in the simplicity of their ignorance, they have envied from their cradles, and whose property they will then be able to loot.

       They are AIPAC, the ADL, the AJC, JStreet, the WJC, and countless other Zionist organizations that shield their naked, racist, Jewish Nationalist activities by accusing their critics of 'anti-Semitism'.

      <p>
       What they are doing is collaborating to subvert the US and State governments and US society at large to serve Jewish Nationalist (Zionist) interests, to the detriment of the interests of the people of the USA.

       These Jewish Nationalist groups are determined and tenacious. They have been working tirelessly for many decades to infiltrate and gain dominance in important sectors,  in government and private industry (finance, media,  academia, etc).

       Their ethnocentric unity in cooperation and collaboration makes them a formidable force, and their success bears testament that they are very good at what they do.

       You're using something called an "etymological fallacy" to argue. You are arguing that the word "anti-Semite" does not mean what the dictionary says it means, rather its definition is its etymological origin. That's like saying "bathroom" can only be a room with a bath in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Anti-Semitic" means "against Jews" and has always meant that.

You have been pretty much the best example of it. I'm not completely sure you are being serious with your comments but I might as well take you at your word.

Zionist's run this country, Zionist's run Hollywood, Zionist's run the Middle East foreign policy(it's called the Oded Yinon plan), Zionist's run almost all of the banks, Zionist's are responsible for 100 years of straight war.  Jews are responsible for Zionism.  Kvetch all you want, nothing's going to stop the truth.

       I'm definitely not authoritarian. And I'm not screaming. I sort of feel sorry for you that your worldview is so warped by racism and hate. You're literally blaming the Jews for inventing racism. Don't you see how ridiculous that is. How far gone down this rabbit hole of hate are you?

       How is you being an open and out racist and me calling you a racist a buzzword? You have literally advocated putting jews in ovens in your post history. You're very clearly driven by the hate of an entire people. You are literally espousing Nazi ideology. Not in some buzzword sense where I'm reading into what you are saying. The things you are literally saying meet the definition of racism and are very hateful/evil. Grow up.

       Well, if you wanna break it down further...a lot of jews whether they’re secular or not; seem to be obsessed with a jewish holy land.
      </p>
      <p>
       They seem to force feed this agenda to Americans and are quick to paint anyone who doesn’t agree with it as anti-semitic.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of Americans do not want to waste money on Israel’s crybaby bullshit and would prefer they handle their own interests.

      <p>
       But, since our country has been infiltrated with Zionists; we seem to be overly concerned with Israel first instead of America.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result, you are going to have a counter group that opposes or even outright hates jews.

       Let’s look at a few of the passages which cannot be defended by claiming to be “taken out of context” because the statements are the context.*

       “If a ‘goy’ (Gentile) hits a Jew he must be killed.” (Sanhedrin 58b)
“If a Jew finds an object lost by a ‘goy’ it does not have to be returned.” (Baba Mezia 24a)
“If a Jew murders a ‘goy’ there will be no death penalty.” (Sanhedrin 57a)
What a Jew steals from a ‘goy’ he may keep.” (Sanhedrin 57a)
“Jews may use subterfuges to circumvent a ‘goy.’” (Baba Kamma 113a)
“All children of the ‘goyim’ (Gentiles) are animals.” (Yebamoth 98a)
“Girls born of the ‘goyim’ are in a state of ‘niddah’ (menstrual uncleanness!) from birth.” (Abodah Zarah 36b)
“The ‘goyim’ are not humans. They are beasts.” (Baba Mezia 114b)
“If you eat with a ‘goy’ it is the same as eating with a dog.” (Tosapoth, Jebamoth 94b)
“Even the best of the ‘goyim’ should all be killed.” (Soferim 15)
“Sexual intercourse between the ‘goyim’ is like intercourse between animals.” (Sanhedrin 74b)
“When it comes to a Gentile in peace times, one may harm him indirectly, for instance, by removing a ladder after he had fallen into a crevice.” (Shulkan Arukh, Yoreh De ‘ah, 158, Hebrew Edition only)

       I am always perplexed reading a thread such as this. A 'truth seeker, conspiracy theorist or just an overall observer can not ignore statistical facts and a startling trend in which most of the worlds leading industries whether it be the Media in Hollywood or the banks and financial sector on   Wall Street in New York, MOST are admittedly Jewish. I say this with no hatred, disgust or bigotry, I say this with certainty th
at it is a undeniable fact. The inescapable truth.

       Yes, it's quite sad and a very poor reflection on the sub. They get quite uppity and effectively self-ID when you raise the issue, as you have seen from this very thread. Check out some of their post histories. Mindbogglingly bigoted.

       200 comments and a questionable 2 antisemitic comments which after checking there history are about 99.9% troll comments meant to just piss of the OP for being a generalist. OP then proceeds to repeat how half the comments are antisemitic and pats self on back.
      </p>

       Got to love it when the guy who's trying not to be bigoted is being a classic all encompassing generalizing A-hole..
      </p>
      <p>
       OP has an agenda. I've got money its to smear this very sub. Seriously if one can't distinguish between the political movement and Zionist Fascist State of Israel vs the Jewish population it's self I'd start question the intelligence of that person. That's like saying all Americans are responsible for our governments dealings. It's out of our hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally no antisemitic thread has ever make it to the front page /conspiracy. To say otherwise is a outright lie. You'd be lucky to pull 1-3 "antisemitic" threads out of the first 100 threads. They all get buried and voted down to 0 thumbs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And don't be so uniformed the political Zionist movement has really been around since the inception of the religion. And one cannot talk about them without talking about the Jewish faith. Does that make one antisemitic? Of fucking course not you nobs..

       Lol you're definitions of antisemitism must be off a bit their sir but ok fine. No one is paying me anything and I didn't link that thread there but keep on believing that if you want to. You are so backwards and caught up in your own twisted worldview that you think people who disagree with you are literally paid shills. Thats really sad. So easy to just call everyone you don't like a shill. Take that strategy into the real world. Why don't you start publicly speaking about this stuff and see how actual people respond to the obvious bullshit. Everyone's "proof" for the jews controlling the world can pretty much be summed up as "The jews are too successful!" No one can really point out how they are controlling the world, but obviously they must be since they are prevalent in the media and Hollywood. Pull your head out of your was. You're shilling for Nazis and don't even realize it.

       Ok I'm not really generalizing for one, there's all kinds of posts her about "the jews" and their crimes. It's a fantasy land of antisemitism in a lot of these threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       How am I a snowflake? Because I don't agree with hating people based on their race or religion? That's nonsensical.  I'm not the one screaming "the jews!" at every turn. I'm not doing that because I'm not a loon. You are the one reporting me and calling me a shill. Doing everything you can to get me out of you're safe space echo chamber. Look I can use those words too.

       How did I say I was full of shit? How would you even know anything about my entire existence? Lol i don't even post on Reddit that much. I didn't make the thread to rile people up. It was just an honest question and I got my answer.

       Ok but I'm not and fully support free speech. Look if people want to come here and blame the jews for everything I suppose they can. I just wish more people here challenged those silly ideas.

       Very important topic - and should show you why your posts claiming anti semitism are without merit and the most dangerous form of censorship

       One minor clarification:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Its not conspiratorial - its fact.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The terms
       <em>
        'conspiracy'
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        'fact'
       </em>
       are not antonyms.

       I gotta ask foe a source on those statistics. I'm aware jews perform very highly per capita and seem to be a fairly successful group of people but that seems like a bit much. Who controls what entities?
