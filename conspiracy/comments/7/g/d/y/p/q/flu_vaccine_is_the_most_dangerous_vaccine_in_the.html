       Of course they're tucked away.  They should advertise the fact?  The same with any side effect of any drug that's on the market....tucked away.

       And yet, every is so so sure the MMR vaccine is safe.

       The flu vaccine is no joke, I took care of a girl who came down with GBS from it. 3 months paralysed on a ventilator with a tracheostomy followed by a long time in physical therapy and now a dimpled scar in the middle of her throat.

       Everyone should get the flu shot. It's because of people like you diluting and misinterpreting this shit and spreading this misinformation like your saving lives. Can you even fathom what is like to be 75 years old and be ultra susceptible to the flu that could easily kill you? You should fucking take solice on the fact that one day because you don't get the flu shot you might become a carrier that infects somebody that ends up dying BECAUSE OF YOU.

       Yes, in the short term. That's why they tell you not to take the shot if you're sick at all. Once your body has defeated the small number of weakened flu germs, you won't be carrying the flu you'll just be carrying the antibodies.

        There were 139 claims settled during this time period, with 70 of them being compensated. So, just over 50% of the claims filed for vaccine damages were compensated during this period.

       You're telling me 70 people out of billions had a bad side effect to the flu vaccine and that scares you?

       That sounds like the vaccine is working as intended.

       I think that the Flu shot is nothing more than a “Cancer Lottery”
I’ve also heard this one before: “I got the Flu shot and still got sick” “Well that’s because it’s a different strain that your Flu shot couldn’t protect against.” 
I’ve never had the shot, never had the Flu and if I don’t get the Flu how could I spread it?
