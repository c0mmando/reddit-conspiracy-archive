<p><strong>I will guarantee you <del>five</del> six things:</strong></p>

<p>(1) this post will get downvoted as fuck</p>

<p>(2) they will <strong>not</strong> talk about the contents of the video in the comments</p>

<p>(3) they will use the argument that O&#39;Keefe and Project Veritas are untrustworthy </p>

<p>(4) brigading is almost a certainty</p>

<p>(5) I laugh my ass off when I am predicted right </p>

<p>EDIT 
(6) they will say Trump paid Veritas, if he did, who cares. I am more interested in WHAT The Washington Post reporters said. It comes straight from the horses mouth</p>

<p><strong>LAST WORD: Truth (PV) will always beat propaganda (WaPo). Always.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s my point. You have told me twice now, go back and watch from 3:40 on.  From then on, what they are doing is implying that because an opinion piece has an OPINION, that the reporting part does too.  However, they did not demonstrate that to be true.  They actually demonstrated the opposite, as my first post mentioned.  So it&#39;s pretty clear Project Veritas is literally propaganda.... project veritas, as the beginning of the video demonstrates in O&#39;Keefes, is set on demonstrating MSM&#39;s bias.  When they couldn&#39;t find that, they decided to attack the editorial section, because it&#39;s an easy target.  By its very definition, it is going to have strong opinions.  It is however very clearly marked, and a reader with critical-thinking skills will understand that.  <a href="http://www.constitution.org/col/propaganda_army.htm">here is a list of propaganda techniques</a> the specific name of this technique (in my opinion) is &quot;Insinuation&quot;.  Which is a part of a broader technique called &quot;Pinpointing the Enemy&quot;... they are insinuating you can&#39;t trust their reporting and are thus pinpointing WP as the enemy.  Project Veritas, whether intentional or not... is using propaganda techniques.</p>

<p>But I&#39;ve argued with enough people on Reddit to know where this goes.  I know you the truth is scary.  You don&#39;t WANT to believe it.... is also know your post history is 6 months old and is basically all <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> posts, but I&#39;m going to give you the benefit of a doubt and assume you&#39;re not a paid actor.... but someone who just joined, and is very passionate.  So inform me.  Help me understand.  Using that link above, can you give me examples and names of WP articles (not opinion pieces) that are examples of propaganda.  Show me 3 examples, and the next reply you get will be a screenshot of my canceled subscription.</p>

<p>Baseless was the wrong word to use. I&#39;m not a Trump fan boy, so if he falls for collusion, it&#39;s no skin off my back. I guess what I wanted to convey is that WaPo has been on a 24hour news cycle for months about it, and to me, it has made it where much like all the ClintonGate shit it irritates now.</p>

<p>Like I get it, they have stuff to report, but at the same time stop pitter patting with the punches. Stop talking about twitter bots and what he tweets and all the whinny stuff and focus on hard facts. Stop the 24 hour whine fest that has ruined all forms of media. It has turned grating...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Trump campaign is counting on your fatigue.</p>

<p>Honestly, think about what we know now compared to a year ago.  We&#39;ve seen the literal communications between Wikileaks and the campaign (which were denied for a year).  We&#39;ve seen the evidence of dozens and dozens of meetings between the campaign and known Russian agents. We&#39;ve seen that the man the president wanted to make the highest intelligence agent in the country was actively working on behalf of foreign governments at the time he was receiving America&#39;s most sensitive secrets.</p>

<p>You would not have believed this stuff if you heard it in the summer of 2015, you would have found it outrageous and not believable -- and now you&#39;re bored to hear it?</p>

<p>This is how Watergate went down, a steady drumbeat of hundreds of stories over the course of a year and a half -- mostly by WaPo -- that ultimately filled in every blank beyond doubt.  Don&#39;t let modern life&#39;s destruction of our attention span make you ignore perhaps the largest scandal by an American president in modern history.</p>

I’m not sure if you’re aware, but news organizations are not privy to evidence in criminal investigations. Stop asking for hard evidence you know will be impossible to get until mueller is done. Look at the mountains of circumstantial evidence (which is admissible in court and has been used in thousands of convictions) and make conclusions. It’s what the rest of us do. </p>

<p>The President of the United States is currently being investigated by a special prosecutor, the former head of the FBI, for his relationship to a Russian espionage operation and obstruction of justice.  That special prosecutor has already indicted the president&#39;s former campaign manager and extracted a guilty plea from one of the president&#39;s senior campaign advisors.</p>

<p>Aren&#39;t you forgetting about Guccifer 2.0? Remember how the metadata of his first leaks was smudged with all those all-too-obvious Russian fingerprints somehow left behind by &quot;highly sophisticated GRU cyberwarriors&quot;? And remember how he bragged about how he was the one responsible for leaking the emails to Wikileaks a day before the first Wikileaks email drop? That&#39;s your fucking Russia-Wikileaks connection. How could you not know about that? </p>

<p>Oh except that anyone with any sense can see that Guccifer 2.0 was a DNC hoax, cobbled together at the last minute (in part on a Word program registered to one-time DNC operative Warren Flood), in an effort to get ahead of the first email drop announced by Wikileaks, and frame it as a Russian conspiracy against Hillary Clinton to distract from the undoubtedly damaging contents. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all so fucking obvious I can&#39;t even believe it. </p>

<p>I just provided you direct conclusive evidence that the Trump campaign and Wikileaks colluded on multiple occasions. </p>

<p>And now you want to say it has to be “meaningful high level collusion” lol like come on man I’m not even trying to argue with you, but ??? </p>

<p>How about specify your standard for “meaningful high level collusion” before you start spouting what is and what is not collusion. </p>

<p>I don’t really want to get into the Guccifer, Russia, GRU thing as that’s a pretty meaty topic and still we both can agree we’re reliant on the IC’s take that Guccifer is Russian. </p>

<p>Sorry. It&#39;s been real weird watching this whole thing play out. Every two seconds there&#39;s some minor thing that comes out that can be twisted around with weasel words and innuendo to support the narrative that Trump won the election due to Russian interference or Russian collusion, and then it gets hyped up so much by a desperate and biased news media that even rational people start thinking there&#39;s something to it.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s nothing to it but lies, obfuscation, and most alarmingly, what appears to be an honest-to-goodness conspiracy by the intelligence community to undermine the President and subvert the democratic process that got him elected. </p>

<p>Oh yeah, and most of the time I honestly suspect I&#39;m replying to some Beltway Shareblue astroturfer, so my politeness filter is in the fully upright and locked position. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not how it works, though. When you do freelance work for someone you&#39;re a contractor, not an employee. He&#39;s not part of their staff or on their payroll. He&#39;s someone they have (presumably) paid to provide them with content. There is a distinction. </p>

<p>I say &quot;presumably&quot; paid because there&#39;s no guarantee he was. I&#39;m not certain either way, but it&#39;s not unusual for papers to print material from unpaid contributors, especially if they&#39;re involved in politics. When your congressman or senator has a column in the paper, for example, it&#39;s almost certain they did not get paid for it. The &quot;payment&quot; is in being given an opportunity to promote their point of view.</p>

<p>the law states that their campaigns cannot &quot;officially coordinate&quot; with superpacs, and a bunch of $1000/hr lawyers have interpreted that to mean that as long as it&#39;s not through official channels, a little consult here and there isn&#39;t breaking the law. and no one in the justice dep (now or during obama or before) has ever tried to prosecute this stuff.</p>

<p>well if that was in any way true, it&#39;d be a good point. unfortunately for you, there isn&#39;t any evidence to support the notion that all non-right leaning media is controlled by soros. in fact, i would say that is a ridiculous theory, personally.</p>

<p>Do you have an example? The media is presenting Russia collusion as an ongoing question. Then, they present facts and reports relevant to that question. I&#39;ll give you an example:</p>

<p>The Trump Jr (and other campaign associates) meeting with the Russian lobbyist to get dirt on Clinton is a fact. It&#39;s confirmed by the man himself. Seeing this, you may think the media is claiming collusion with Russia is a fact. They aren&#39;t. You came to that conclusion yourself, because the fact that was presented sure looks like evidence of collusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few reasons.</p>

<p>For one thing, people who self describe based on their interest in conspiracy tend to seek out claims that put them above the majority population. They look for a sense of special or hidden knowledge.</p>

<p>Sure, sometimes powerful people conspire and there&#39;s nothing wrong with noticing or getting angry about that, but people who define themselves by their interest in conspiracy can often, but not always be more a breed of contrarian than of critical thinker.</p>

<p>So it makes a lot of sense that some number of conspiracy theorists would hop on a view in contrast to the popular one. Trump is a wildly unpopular president, so supporting him gives an ego boost for someone who feels they need to set their sense of self worth in terms of being right about something the majority is wrong about.</p>

<p>Then you can add in brigading and trolling from T_D. And very possibly some astroturfing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They didn’t lose it. They never had it to begin with.</p>

<p>There’s a huge swath of people using the vulnerable and fertile terrain that is conspiracy discussion zones as a weapon to mass propagate their narratives, lies and political agendas. </p>

<p>The right wing, in particular, has been very very active. From their talk radio to written publications, they prey on people who reject mainstream reporting and mainstream explanations, people who question official stories and <em>use</em> them as puppets to reproduce and disseminate their information. </p>

<p>These people represent a large chunk of conspiracy spaces. They aren’t so much conspiracy-minded folks who entertain alternative explanations as much as they are people who reject facts, reject reality and choose to believe the fake news and lies that, unfortunately, are very prevalent in communities such as this (by nature- as official/mainstream explanations are rejected, there are a lot of unsubstantiated explanations, theories, ideas etc that rely more on “connecting dots” than actual solid evidence in conspiracy spaces). These people choose to follow and believe their FEELINGS over what is real because it doesn’t line up with their preconceived biases. That’s why you’ll see them latch on to <em>anything</em> that validates their political/social beliefs but reject <em>anything</em> that goes against it (perfect example: trump supporters).</p>

<p>REAL conspiracy theorists/people interested in discussing alternative explanations entertain the whole spectrum of possibilities within a conversation. </p>

<p>These people have a line they follow, and everyone can see it plain as day by just looking at a couple examples either here or on the donald: 
Whatever the trump admin and it’s lackeys says and whatever supports that end = good</p>

<p>Anyone standing against them: bad, fake, discredit</p>

<p>These aren’t people here to discuss or analyze conspiracies. These people are here to USE conspiracies and the people who discuss them as tools for their propaganda machine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yes, &quot;whataboutism&quot;.  You use that word, but I do not think you know what it means. As a logical fallacy it&#39;s defined as attempting to create false equivalencies to deflect criticism back onto the critic, however in this case there is no false equivalence. </p>

<p>You&#39;re bashing people whom you claim are defending a child predator, and I&#39;m bashing someone who <em>literally defended a confessed child predator in court.</em> Don&#39;t get me wrong Moore is probably guilty AF, but technically his crimes are still not proven.</p>

<p>Interestingly the word has recently experienced a dramatic increase in popularity over the last few months because Trump critics accuse him of being guilty of its use. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, here is a transcript with everything the WaPo reporter said in the interview, divorced of the Project Veritus spin. I&#39;ve also included all of the cuts in the interview.:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adam Entous: WaPo: Our reporting has not taken us to a place 
where I would be able to say with any confidence that
the result of it is going to be the president being guilty of being in
cahoots with the Russians. There&#39;s no evidence of that that
I&#39;ve seen so far.</p>

<p>-CUT-</p>

<p>Project Veritas: How do we get the president?</p>

<p>Adam Entous: I have no idea. And, frankly, there may not be anything
that gets the president. It may just be lower-level people who are compromised
by this. We just don&#39;t know. It&#39;s very hard to tell. So, we just don&#39;t
know at this point.</p>

<p>PV: There has to be something, right?</p>

<p>AE: Maybe, maybe not. It could just be lower-level people being manipulated
or manipulating, but it&#39;s very hard to, it&#39;s really....it&#39;s a fucking black box.</p>

<p>-CUT-</p>

<p>Adam Entous: I have no idea. Seriously. I mean, it&#39;s a fucking crap shoot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-&gt; CUT - </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adam Entous: In terms of the actual secret arrangements where they cooperate, we haven&#39;t seen
anythingt hat shows that yet.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve seen a lot of flirtation, if you will, between them but nothing that, in my opnion,
would rank as actual collusion. Now, that doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist, it just
means we haven&#39;t found it yet. Or it may mean it doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Project Veritas: Does it seem like we&#39;re getting warmer or cooler?</p>

<p>AE: We&#39;re getting warmer, but it goes warm and it then it goes cold, then it goes warm
and then it goes cold. I just...I have no idea. Seriously.</p>

<p>I mean, it&#39;s a fucking crap shoot. I literally have no prediction as to what
would happen, and I do all the stuff for the Post on this.</p>

<p>I do most of this reporting, so I honestly would tell you. I have no idea. But, that&#39;s the truth
You know, we&#39;re just trying to figure it out. It&#39;s very hard.</p>

<ul>
<li>CUT - </li>
</ul>

<p>Adam Entous: If things happen, maybe it goes that way, maybe it doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s very hard to tell.</p>

<p>But you know, we&#39;re trying our best to figure it out. But it be honest, it&#39;s very hard. And it&#39;s getting harder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, to me, this doesn&#39;t really seem like much. Seems like it&#39;s basically a reporter saying &quot;We don&#39;t have any absolute proof of collusion yet, but we have lots of breadcrumbs. I can&#39;t say one way or another that Trump himself did anything, but we&#39;re going to continue investigating it.&quot; </p>

<p>This, to me, sounds like something an investigative reporter would say in the middle of an investigation, but that&#39;s just my take.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, here is a transcript with everything the WaPo <strong>Director</strong> said in the footage:</p>

<p>Project Veritas: I mean, it&#39;s getting more and more like he&#39;s not going anywhere.</p>

<p>Melissa Hyde: Well, let&#39;s just hope he doesn&#39;t get re-elected in another three years, so...it&#39;s just my take&quot;</p>

<p>-CUT-</p>

<p>Project Veritas: Yes, he is a little self centered. Only a little bit.</p>

<p>Melissa Hyde: Living on a different planet I think but, you know, whatever...he&#39;s living on a different planet but, you know...</p>

<p>Melissa Hyde: But again, you know, this is not...I shouldn&#39;t be saying these things because we don&#39;t...We&#39;re not really supposed to be talking about this kind of stuff.</p>

<p>Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I agree with Melissa Hyde, Trump is a damn clown. Anyone with half a brain would be opposed to the guy, but she seems far too eager to tell others how she feels about him, being a director of a newsroom for WaPo. IMO this is helpful, it confirms WaPo is biased, so we can all approach their content acknowledging that bias, which will allow everyone to better discern the truth when analyzing their content.</p>

<p>Having opinion and being bias are two entirely different things.</p>

<p>Bias: prejudice in favor of or against one thing, person, or group compared with another, usually in a way considered to be unfair.</p>

<p>Opinion: a view or judgment formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge.</p>

<p>An opinion is not always a bias, but a bias is always an opinion. Her opinion reflects a strong potential for bias in her work as a journalist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is so sad. No Manafort was not arrested for being associated with the Podesta Group, that&#39;s a simple lie. Uranium One was a Canadian company which owned US based uranium. Russia purchased the company. That purchase was overseen by the CFIUS, a government agency composed of nine other agencies. Hillary Clinton was not even involved in the approval process and was represented by the Assistant Secretary of State. She had no involvement with the allowing of the deal and every single one of the nine agencies in the CFIUS had to give their approval. Tell me, where exactly do you see the collusion? If it has to do with the donations from Uranium One to the Clinton Foundation maybe you don&#39;t know that the founder of the company was a philanthropist who donated 130+ million to the charity over his career. He also sold all of his shares three years before the deal was first proposed. So again, where is the collusion? And where do you get the deluded and insane idea that Mueller is attempting to investigate Hillary Clinton instead of Trump when he arrested Trump&#39;s campaign manager for charges which include being an unregistered agent of a foreign official, the foreign official being Russia. You can&#39;t spin your way around this, don&#39;t bother trying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What it means is that the narrative they&#39;re trying to push in their publication which is heavily insinuating certainty that Trump and his campaign colluded with Russia to win the US election, is not very certain at all.</p>

<p>It means that much of the staff is not really sure what they&#39;re doing or why they&#39;re doing it.  </p>

<p>It also confirms that they are continuing to pound away at a story in an attempt to confirm a conclusion that they have already decided upon (i.e. confirming bias).</p>

<p>So, it&#39;s not a bombshell like it was before the election when they caught Hillary camp people talking about paying violent protestors, but it is an important thing (I think) for people to see.  &quot;The historically coveted media that claims to be telling the truth, lies to you&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that he&#39;s lying in the video, it&#39;s that his opinion as stated in the video is not what is being published. Surely everyone knows that WaPo is pushing the idea that Trump colluded with Russia.

The dishonesty is in having decided to push this idea about Russian collusion as though it happened, while privately conceding that maybe it didn&#39;t happen and that there isn&#39;t any evidence for it.</p>

<p>It will be up to federal prosecutors to determine whether federal conspiracy laws or election laws barring campaigns from soliciting help from foreigners have been implicated. What we already can say is that the plausibility of the Trump camp’s narrative, in which any underhanded Russian assistance came without the campaign’s witting participation, is eroding.

<p>I did some research about her, though it&#39;s not really clear what her role at WaPo currently is since she doesn&#39;t mention it in the video clips. O&#39;Keefe probably got her job title from <a href="http://archive.is/nf2Mf">this website</a>. She was <a href="http://archive.is/vBkRNl">listed as a &quot;contributor&quot; in 2005</a>, and mentioned in <a href="http://archive.is/vpj7Y">this 2011 WaPo article</a> about traffic in Washington D.C. Also, she is pictured <a href="http://archive.is/Nkz3A">here</a> at the <a href="https://mylittlebird.com">MyLittleBird.com website</a> launch party in 2014.</p>

<p>Likely illegally and certainly unethically (false pretenses), but that&#39;s a side story. Are you actually listening to the words he&#39;s saying? Or pulling out only what you want to hear? </p>

<p>In summary of what he said: If WaPo had a smoking gun they would have reported it, they&#39;re still looking for it, and he doesn&#39;t know if they&#39;ll find it. It may have just been low level people working with Russia without Trump knowing.</p>

<p>Have you not noticed how the administration proped up (and props up) PV? How PV&#39;s only focus is following Trump&#39;s narrative? How PV is using false pretenses trying to make WaPo look like &#39;Fake News&#39;? This is blatant propaganda posted to a god damn conspiracy subreddit. Are you sure you&#39;re in the right place?

<p>Is what you said. It&#39;s factually correct, although in regards to this argument, completely misses the point, so I corrected you.</p>

<p>This is where they get their funding. They are paid to promote propaganda through multiple channels by the one&#39;s that constantly push propaganda through main channels like major news outlets. By doing so they get a third party being reported on by these outlets (yes, they&#39;re in the news) as well as get promoted by ignorant (or paid) shills like you.</p>

<p>What you asked is actually one of the stupidest things I&#39;ve read today, and I was just on r/conservative to see if even their easily lead asses are picking up on this story. Even they see through the obvious propaganda. The short bus of reddit sees through this shit, why can&#39;t you?</p>

<p>All of the comments these two people made seem pretty level handed and honest. It really isn&#39;t damning in any way either, just a bit more honest than what you get from narrative driven editorials. They clearly have their opinions and their doubts, but they have a job to do and an audience to please and no one wants to read a wishy-washy editorial that doubts its own stance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi OP,</p>

<p>So this guy is a reporter in the video right? And the video argues that despite him saying that there&#39;s basically &quot;a lot of smoke but no fire&quot; makes the entire wapo disingenuous. But he&#39;s not an editor. He writes stories, and submits them, he doesn&#39;t control what other people write in the paper. So I went to his reporter page (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/adam-entous/?utm_term=.8d746eaf2700">https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/adam-entous/?utm_term=.8d746eaf2700</a>) and there are a ton of things about Russia, and it&#39;s possible interactions, but from a cursory searxh (first three articles with Russia in headlines) nowhere does he say &quot;Trump colluded with Russia&quot;. To me all this shows is a reporter with a more realistic world view than his editors trying to sell papers. How is this in any way a bombshell?</p>

<p>Bitch you have everything to gain. Anytime someone who watches one news network and you are actively trying to prove it false and thus gain viewers to your independent network you are clearly trying to increase your base. It&#39;s in PV best interest to attack ANYONE that likely does not consume their media to help bolster viewership.</p>

<p>You&#39;re bashing people whom you claim are defending a child predator, and I&#39;m bashing someone who <em>literally defended a confessed child predator in court.</em> Don&#39;t get me wrong Moore is probably guilty AF, but technically his crimes are still not proven.</p>
