Your argument is basically because someone doesn&#39;t believe you&#39;re theory, then they are mindless sheep?

Besides that, newspaper stories are not evidence.  Do you understand that?  Hard evidence is video of people getting shot, photos of entry and exit wounds, the actual bullets.</p>

<p>Newspaper stories are not evidence.  Go to court and submit a newspaper story in a court case and you&#39;ll get laughed out of the building.  Video, blood samples, bullets, photos of bullet holes, photos of actual entry and exit wounds.  Those are evidence.  You have none.  There is none.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You speak a lot on lawyers and court but you seem to have no real understanding of rules of evidence or what constitutes evidence. You weren&#39;t there. You don&#39;t know anyone who was. There are people who were there and can prove they were there but you say that&#39;s not evidence. Sorry guy, but eyewitness report trumps your idea that you base solely on evidence you don&#39;t have access to. You are behind a keyboard...go investigate in real life before you disrespect people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are also many witnesses saying they did see people shot and those that are shot. Many who he and the shots. Many videos around that YOU can&#39;t say are fake because you have no way to prove that. Point is, you are throwing a lot of bs based on your opinion without fact. You are also shooting down any facts given to u by labeling them as fake simply because you say so. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to educate you any further on how newspaper articles are allowed in court if you lay the proper basis for admission. Research it yourself. In this case a list of deceased would be admissable but not needed because there are official public records of the deaths.</p>

Dan Blizerian has a video during the shooting where he sees someone shot, there’s pictures from that night there. Literally no time to set up a fake photo shoot. I’d love to discuss this more with you over any form other than text because I actually need to hear you say these words to make sure you’re not actually a bot.

<p>This is the perfect example of a placed story in media.  The earliest version circulated has a video of the father telling the story including him saying his son kept the bullet.  That would not be possible.  Witnesses are not allowed to keep evidence.  The police would keep the bullet for the case file.  Later versions of the story like your link omitted that part of him keeping the bullet probably because someone informed them of the inconsistency.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fake story purposefully placed in the media.</p>

<p>Listen I don&#39;t think the official story about Vegas was true what so ever (probably multiple gunmen, maybe a gun running deal gone wrong, maybe a CIA/FBI asset gone rogue, maybe an assassination attempt, maybe a false flag to push new gun laws/security), but to suggest that no one died at all is something I&#39;ve seen absolutely no evidence for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I think you&#39;re wrong on this one.</p>

<p>With something like Sandy Hook, I could maybe, maybe believe that it was fabricated. That was a very weird instance in my opinion, for many reasons.</p>

<p>With Vegas though, I&#39;ve seen footage from people&#39;s cellphone cameras of them running and bullets striking next to them, as well as photos of bodies. There are multiple independent videos of gunfire, both the sound, and where it was coming from. Given the evidence that I&#39;ve seen and the hundreds and hundreds of people involved, I don&#39;t believe something like that was staged. I believe it was something different from what we were told though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t falsify that everyone survived either, based on your evidence criteria. I wouldn&#39;t throw out circumstantial evidence such as the bloody hospital floors, consistent testimonies (of multiple shooters, seeing people get shot), acoustic forensic evidence, leaked crime scene photos (including bullet shells and guns). Whatever can be debunked and thrown away to create a more accurate depiction of what happened is more important.</p>

<p>Most criminal court cases are settled based on a preponderance of circumstantial evidence - not with smoking gun evidence.  That&#39;s what we have with the Vegas case.  There is no smoking gun, at least not yet.  So in the meantime, we continue to assemble the circumstantial evidence.  As we sift through it all, whatever we can debunk and throw away the better.  We need only hold onto evidence that we can verify.  The winner of the race isn&#39;t always the fastest runner.  Sometimes it&#39;s the one who keeps running after the faster runners burn out and fall behind.  We need to keep going and not give up.﻿

    <div class="md"><p>What does any of this have to do with positive and negative claims? That’s not how burden of proof works. You’re thinking of evidence of absence:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence</a></p>

<p>Ironically, it means the opposite of what you think:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Per the traditional aphorism, &quot;absence of evidence is not evidence of absence&quot;, positive evidence of this kind is distinct from a lack of evidence or ignorance[1] of that which should have been found already, had it existed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absence of evidence of bullets (even though I’ve now shown you four sources with evidence) is not evidence of absence of bullets.</p>

<p>And the whole “can’t disprove a negative thing”? James Randi:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1992 during a presentation at Caltech, skeptic James Randi said &quot;you can&#39;t prove a negative&quot;. He claims that it is impossible to &#39;prove&#39; a negative assertion (such as &#39;telepathy does not exist&#39;). He contends that induction is often used as a mode of proving a thesis, but if an individual assumes that something is or is not, then the person must prove so. Further, he says, he does not take an advocacy position, as a lawyer would. He says that he cannot prove that a negative is true, but he could attempt to use evidence and induction to support a claim that he is biased toward, such as a claim that something does not exist.[7]</p>

<p>Philosopher Steven Hales argues that typically one can logically be as confident with the negation of an affirmation. Hales says that if one&#39;s standards of certainty leads them to say &quot;there is never &#39;proof&#39; of non-existence&quot;, then they must also say that &quot;there is never &#39;proof&#39; of existence either&quot;. Hales argues that there are many cases where we may be able to prove something does not exist with as much certainty as proving something does exist.[8]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m curious at this point though. Why don’t you show me what it is that you think justifies you to keep pasting this same person A and person B thing, because from what I can tell you’re completely off base.</p>

<p>Or hey, keep ignoring the points I’ve made and resort to more ad hominem attacks. That’s sure to make you look totally reasonable to anyone else who happens to come across this little exchange. Fine with me either way lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reminder:  You still don&#39;t have ONE SINGLE VIDEO of anyone being hit.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have to explain why. What happened and why it happened are 2 separate discussions. To determine what happened you just have to look at the evidence (or in this case, the lack of it). To determine why it happened, you have to do some mind reading.
It&#39;s a fallacy to think that I&#39;m required to explain why. Like if there was a fire and I think it was arson but you think it was accidental. I don&#39;t have to explain why they did it. I just have to point to the evidence such as multiply empty kerosene containers and a lighter found at the scene.
In the case of Vegas, there are so many bad crisis actors, co-ordinated crowd movement, lack of authentic fear or pain, and ZERO bullets, that its so fucking obvious that it was a drill. Just use your eyes.
Why they did it is anyone&#39;s guess. You&#39;ll never get proof of why it happened. But there is tons of proof what occurred, which is a hoax, a drill, a crisis simulation.</p>

But you for some reason only think video evidence is valid, when all the videos I&#39;ve seen are shaky as fuck and could never show someone falling over.

<p>The &quot;eyewitnesses&quot; that got on the news are crisis actors.  The whole thing was staged by a professional crisis simulation company similar to this one  <a href="http://www.crisis-solutions.com/">http://www.crisis-solutions.com/</a> along with the help government agencies.</p>

<p>Watch the Debbie Lusignan video.  She was a nurse for 15 years.  There were no EMTs.  There were no ambulances.  There were no 58 dead.  They don&#39;t have photos of the bodies.  They just say &quot;58 dead&quot; on the news and that&#39;s it, that&#39;s the extent of their proof.  They show a few crisis faking injuries and you assume the rest.</p>

Las Vegas was such an obvious hoax yet this sub hates that truth.  Conspiracy thought has taken so many steps back since the powers that be flooded this zone with the political dietetic by using Trump to legitimize some of the more obvious conspiracies and creating false ones like &quot;muh Russia&quot; to bring the political battle here and muddy everything.</p>

<p>The people at the top have been working together across all politics and nations for a very long time to enslave the human mind.  Russia vs US is just as fake as North Korea&#39;s nuclear program.</p>
