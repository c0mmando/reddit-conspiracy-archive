<p>People are reporting that the latest iOS update reduced battery life significantly. I think this is because it increased the amount of information the iphones relay back to Apple. </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why else would you need 8 CPU cores in a phone? </p>

<p>That&#39;s more than most personal computers.</p>

<p>I&#39;d posit it is that way so you can use 2 or 4 cores for whatever you are currently doing, and the others can be recording you and doing audio -&gt; text processing and voice recognition. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if they were also (or soon plan to be) running both cameras 24/7 as well, to capture video data they can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not <em>STORED</em> anywhere on the device. </p>

<p>It is listening, doing real-time voice analytics (who is speaking) and translating what is said to text. They also tag where it was said, and add that info as well, also likely add a &quot;voice print&quot; for any speakers that were unknown to the local device. All that is then uploaded to the cloud, where it is integrated into a larger data set (who else&#39;s phone was nearby when the convo happened, does voice print match any of them, etc..).</p>

<p>Audio -&gt; text takes up <em>VERY</em> little data (when it&#39;s stored as text). Text could <em>EASILY</em> be uploaded 24/7/365 without anyone noticing. It wouldn&#39;t be terribly hard to represent voice prints as a reasonably small text package as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;d have to root your phone, turn off mobile data, connect to your wifi, then run wireshark (or some equivalent) on it, capturing every data packet to/from the device. (you could also run collections on your wifi router or internet router, filtering to only the MAC address of your phone).</p>

<p>You&#39;d then play, for your phone&#39;s microphones to pick up, a recording of some voice conversations, ideally of yourself and your family/friends, as well as some &quot;random&quot; conversations.</p>

<p>You&#39;d then have to analyze the traffic that was passed. Where it went. What data was sent?</p>

<p>If they used HTTPS or other encryption scheme to transfer the data (they likely would), you may have to add a &quot;trusted&quot; certificate to the machine, then do a man-in-the-middle attack in order to ascertain what is inside the encrypted tunnel. This likely would need to be done on your wifi router and/or internet router.</p>

<p>Then you&#39;d have to do this multiple times, with multiple different carriers / phones, and document the similarities.</p>

<p>If you rooted your phone it may also be possible to view which processes are using a bunch of CPU time and/or which processes are using microphone/cameras at any given time, and then make some assumptions based on that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That particular app is Samsung only, maybe there&#39;s an equivalent for jailbroken iPhones? </p>

<p>The app automatically blocks ads and trackers and then I fucked with permissions (mic, camera, internet, location, wakelock) and disabled them on every app I didn&#39;t use. Then when an app kept going &quot;this app keeps stopping&quot; I uninstalled the app because I knew it was tracking me. How would you do this on rooted stock?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You guys ever try leaving you camera and or mic on all day? You can&#39;t. Your phone will get super hot and die within an hour. I just find the idea of phones and tablets listening to us all day physically ludicrous. Yes, phones die easily these days, but that&#39;s because we keep increasing the complexity of the machines themselves, as well as the operating systems, and software they run. Apps get updated every day, and sometimes they run shitty code that run the CPU too hard. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the whole planned obsolescence thing so you keep buying new phones. That&#39;s the real conspiracy. Not that it&#39;s listening to you. </p>

<p>You&#39;re bombarded with ads all day, literally hundreds of thousands of ads, whether you realize it or not. One of them is bound to feel personal.</p>

<p>Sometimes, my phone seemingly randomly starts getting super hot and losing battery at a pace like that. Only sometimes though -- other times it&#39;s fine. I haven&#39;t been able to figure out what causes it. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all if it was for exactly that reason. Of course, it also wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it was planned obsolescence, but then why so inconsistent?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because phones run <em>really</em> shitty code and stuff inside them gets  screwed up all the time. Chrome has terrible ram leakage, apps are almost pure garbage, even the good ones. CPUs get inefficient when hot, and phones can&#39;t really get rid of their heat easily. That kind of stuff can snowball very easily on our tiny fanless computers.  Not to mention if this was happening, some one would catch the phone uploading data to somewhere. There would be an enormous shit storm. </p>

<p>Are they using phones to spy on certain people? Absolutely. Those backdoors are in there.  Are they probing the general population randomly to sell a few more tacos and ski boots here and there? Nah. That just isn&#39;t cost effective at all, not to mention logistically next to impossible to do with out a wide gamut of different types of phone nerds noticing and causing a shit storm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok what about when the phone turns off at 15 percent and won&#39;t let me turn it on until I pull the battery out and put it back in and viola it&#39;s at 22 somehow?  I&#39;ve noticed it hot in my pocket before in this &quot;off&quot; state before too, and the same method fixes it.  </p>

<p>It could just be my phone completely shitting itself I suppose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the more likely scenario. Phones also don&#39;t give you the exact battery percentage left, but rather an approximation of time left given current CPU usage. What it sounds like to me is an app is leaking ram and can&#39;t shut down all the way despite the  phone telling you it&#39;s not even open in the recent apps screen. Then once you&#39;ve rebooted, you&#39;ve forcably cleared the cache of the problem. So then your phone is not working as hard, so it has more clock time left on the CPU and thus reports back the &quot;cooled down&quot; time on it&#39;s current workload. This is how you would have more battery % upon rebooting. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to tell you to get a new phone, but I will tell you to root what you&#39;ve got. That way you know exactly what your phone is doing and you can shut off any dependency you dislike the look of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One reason they&#39;re getting worse, in the senses of how long the battery lasts before it needs to be replaced, and how long it lasts on one charge, certainly is because they&#39;re listening to users. Users want the slimmest phones, which means the thinnest lowest capacity batteries they can get away with, without annoying users too much. Users also want their phones to recharge as quickly as possible, which means they keep upping the rate at which the batteries can charge. That reduces the time you have to wait before it&#39;s fully charged again, but charging quickly wears it out more quickly, reducing the lifetime of the battery. </p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing you can do about the size of the battery your phone comes with. You can reduce the wear on the battery by reducing the charge rate, by using old fashioned weaker chargers, and by not bothering to charge it up to 100% every time. If you&#39;re worried that leaving the house with your battery at less than 100% charge risks running out of battery just carry around one of those charge packs which can recharge it. You&#39;ll hardly ever need to use it, but it&#39;ll stop you worrying :-)</p>
