    <div class="md"><p>This book is thin and easy to read, and it  packs a punch. I don&#39;t want my child in public schools after reading it. I always had misgivings about schooling, and the book outlines reasons ALL of us should. It&#39;s a game changer. You won&#39;t come away with an exact solution (he states that the public school system isn&#39;t broken, but working exactly the way it is designed to), but you will definitely be motivated to find one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The current standardized test system in American public schools is a double whammy.</p>

<p>Not only does it make private companies wealthy that design these tests and accompanying textbooks, but it changes the entire educational structure to be about studying to take multiple choice tests instead of promoting and developing critical thinking in the general public.  </p>

<p>The &quot;dumbing down&quot; part of the equation is simply a welcome side effect of diverting tax money into the pockets of the wealthy by investing in standardized tests instead of investing in the core infrastructure of education, which is a system of qualified educators and programs that benefit children and not businesses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a good point.  This is where parents are responsible.  You can&#39;t rely solely on some government system to be the only form of education for your child.</p>

<p>However, having a rigged system is an overarching problem that must be dealt with before you can take a hard line on misguided parenting.  And these rigged school systems are a throwback to when there was s strong effort to keep people of color uneducated as a means of generating subservience.  We should keep your ideas in mind as we work to improve education, as they are a key to resisting the standardized testing takeover of public education.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personal story about standardized testing....My son was 8 and came home from school and did his after school stuff. Something was on his mind, but he isn&#39;t the type of person that gives that stuff up easily. Before bed, on the verge of tears, he finally lets it go: Mrs. 3rd grade teacher is going to get fired if I don&#39;t do well on the test tomorrow! I was dumbfounded, and I could feel my face going red from anger. He had stewed all day on it. So I told him, fail the test. Your family will still love you, the sun will come up, all that stuff. This is where standardized testing has gotten us. Teachers are scared, they need that job, and kids aren&#39;t learning anything useful. And now with a dual income family necessary, or with single parents doing the best they can, most can&#39;t home school (which seems the most viable option to fix it). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While an interesting delusion, it&#39;s not something that has worked well in history. If it was the better delusion it would have taken root. Unfortunately it&#39;s not a delusion supported by biology, our amygdala unconsciously gives things importance in a hierarchical structure. If our mind gave equal importance to everything you&#39;d never be able to focus on anything, so instead the mind uses heuristic tricks by grouping things into categories.</p>

<p>This means our waking consciousness is responding to unconscious perceptions neatly categorized by importance according to our needs/wants. Naturally we will be attracted to what is similar to our previous experience, further experience creates knowledge, thus the familiar becomes a foundation for further growth. Thus our racist tendencies are beyond our control, we inherently group things to maximize our safety and growth. You can observe this behavior in nature, nomadic groups will fight each other for control as they&#39;ve done since the beginning of recorded history.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t until they can unify themselves into a country that they can have any sort of order. Until then it&#39;s just tribes competing for resources, typical dog eat dog behavior. The Middle East is a perfect example of this dynamic, particularly the origins of the UAE. Hell this dynamic is still at play in more &quot;civilized&quot; places.</p>

<p>Look how quick we in America are to judge others and group them into neat categories, how ignorant of those people to completely miss their own hypocrisy. You&#39;re right wing, you&#39;re a libtard, you&#39;re a statist, cuck, commie, nazi, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I believe so. But, at the same time, there is a lot of information out there, and we cannot cover it all. Who is the President/Prime Minister of Spain right now? I have no idea. Does this make me an uneducated fool? Can I pick out Nigeria on a map? Maybe. But, there are lots of other things that I need to know, like how to make word documents or change the water pump on my car, can I do everything?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Slavery in America hasnt gone away.  It has just evolved.  We are slaves for the 1%.</p>

<p>think about it</p>

<p>Slave owners would force thier slaves to work for them and in turn the slaves would get food and shelter.</p>

<p>Today they pay us but only so they dont have to provide us with food or shelter themselves.  we use the money we make to male them more money (buying thier food, thier electronics, playing thier game by thier rules).</p>

<p>we have the illusion of freedom and that is by design, but we are slaves</p>

<p>Liberals share a political party with socialist marxists, they genuinely believe that a Massive Deep State Controlled Government rule over us. They trust  them to take care of us , want to allow it to make all major decisions without our input, hand them the keys to our privacy,  cede every guns over to them, allow them to control all media outlets and direct the narratives, open the borders  (at least in our gate-less neighborhoods) and just have blind faith that this government will always be good with no no failsafes in place because they promised nicely. </p>
