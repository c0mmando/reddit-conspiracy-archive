<p>The comments look like any other day on r politics, there is clearly a lot of “people” trying to splinter this group. Which in my mind means they are trying their best to keep something hidden that is bubbling to the surface. </p>

<p>You mean like multiple posts in &quot;new&quot; claiming that anyone who talks about a certain topic or has a certain view is a shill? Yeah, that seems like a really obvious attempt to discredit a news story while deflecting from a political group who is actively lying to defend a pedophile. If that isn&#39;t worth discussing in this subreddit, what is? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So they didn&#39;t lie about a sexual assault to try to discredit the other victims? So they aren&#39;t actually defending an accused pedophile? As far as I&#39;m concerned both parties are horribly corrupt so I cannot possibly understand why someone would chose to ignore all of the issues with one side just to attack the other. Project Veritas is shit, and they just got busted for it. How are you actually okay with this? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This whole thing is merely an attempt to not only discredit the findings of Project Veritas, which are confirmed. Bob Creamer resigned because of their video about the DNC, and a producer at CNN really did say the only reason they are reporting on the Russia/Trump collusion is because they were told to because it’s good for ratings. These things ACTUALLY happened. They did not, I repeat, they did NOT edit the interview footage. Watch it for yourself and make up your own mind. </p>

<p>Back to my point. This is an attempt to discredit Project Veritas, to link them to Trump, and to make them look like terrible people because they were trying to expose the corruption of WaPo using a corrupt means. Was it wrong what this undercover person did? Yes. But she was lying to professional liars. </p>

<p>Project Veritas is not shit. The merit of the videos they released stand alone. The response from the establishment to those videos shows us that they were very real. </p>

<p>I could give a shit about the innocence or guiltiness of Ray Moore. All politicians are corrupt.  WaPo got lucky and caught this undercover journalist and now they’re using it to discredit PV and make this a controversial moral issue, because the journalist was falsely accusing Ray Moore of sexual assault.  Yes it was fucked up, but this world is fucked up. And WaPo is fucked up beyond belief.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well it seems like they are linked to Trump, at least loosely. He&#39;s donated some decent chunks of money to them recently, so at the very least he supports them and their actions. The fact that he also appears to support Moore and they were attempting to discredit Moore&#39;s accusers all seems connected to me. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Who said Moore was corrupt? I said he&#39;s accused of being a pedophile. That goes way beyond just &quot;corrupt&quot;. I find it particularly interesting that you don&#39;t care about this case when you seem so interested in plenty of other accused pedophiles with all of your Pizzagate comments. What&#39;s so different about this one where you care more about discrediting the Washington Post than you do about Project Veritas attempting to protect a pedophile?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I guess that was it. I thought there was something more recent but after double checking it was just the $10,000 in 2015. And it was in fact from his charity, but is that any different in your opinion? I consider the Trump Foundation just as bad as the Clinton Foundation, especially with all of the other shady uses of funds that have come out. Clinton Foundation = Clinton, Trump Foundation = Trump. This seems like a pretty questionable use of charity funds as well, but it&#39;s not illegal and it isn&#39;t my money so I guess I can&#39;t really complain.</p>

<p>Plus the general public thinks that most people are borderline retarded with some of the garbage that gets posted/said here.</p>
