        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m an agnostic in the truest sense. I know that I don&#39;t know what I don&#39;t know. Almost anything that someone can conceive of is possible, and so I am willing to say that <em>Sure, there might be malevolent forces that wish us harm</em>.</p>

<p>So I sit at home and meditate and try to reach out to the universe and ask, &quot;Why, oh good and powerful beings of the universe, would you let evil beings harm us?&quot; All of this happens in my own head. I feel like the universe answers me, but obviously it could just be my own subconscious.</p>

<p>But there is an answer that keeps coming back to me. It feel like the universe is telling me this.</p>

<p>The answer is &quot;Whatever you allow yourselves (humans) to do to each other is implicitly allowed for others to do to you.&quot;</p>

<p>If you imagine an infinite universe full of space-faring or dimension-faring beings, you can also imagine what the rules of a universal society might be. I think the most basic rule is the golden rule. There is good and bad in everyone and everywhere. We have finite resources and so we compete for control of those resources. By definition, if we have competition then some people will be winners and some will be losers. We could theoretically strive for perfect equality, but no one <em>really</em> wants that. </p>

<p>The idea of socialist equality brings up impossible problems. What do you do with people who have more babies than they can afford? Are we responsible for everyone? What if I love my family and I want them to have enough, but in order to give them enough it means someone else gets less than they need? Don&#39;t I have a right to fight for survival?</p>

<p>Right now there are millions of people facing starvation in Yemen. Rohingya people are being massacred in Myanmar. Palestinians have been living in an open air prison for 75 years. Bad shit happens and as a species we are not fixing it. </p>

<p>So if I were an inter-dimensional superhero and I heard some Earthling saying &quot;Why won&#39;t you help us against being who are more powerful than us?&quot; I think the answer would be &quot;Because you aren&#39;t helping people against beings that are more powerful than them.&quot;</p>

<p>If we take the conspiracies at face value - that aliens (or demons or whatever) are enslaving us and harvesting our souls, it seems like the way to be rescued is to deserve to be rescued. If we, as people, band together to protect and save our unfortunates then we would have a right to expect the same from any higher powers that want to see themselves as altruists. From their point of view is ignoring some succubus sucking my lifeforce away from me any worse than me ignoring Myanmar as it murders Rohingya people?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the ability to stop a &#39;demon&#39; by shouting bible quotes is fucking stupid strategy.  Shouting seems more like a show than a fight.  Moloch wants blood.  To fight it it would take something physical.  Shouting at a fist won&#39;t stop it from smashing your face.  If demons are real, and demons can have an effect on your physical state, then the law of equivalent exchange applies, you can use your physical state to effect a demon.  </p>

<p>We interact with the universe around us and we have the ability to change and direct our interaction with it.</p>

<p>By definition, if we have competition then some people will be winners and some will be losers. We could theoretically strive for perfect equality, but no one really wants that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think there&#39;s some things that everyone should have, like food, water, and shelter. There&#39;s enough for everyone, there&#39;s no reason for people to go without, especially for the sake of competition. TPTB want everyone to think scarcity, as far as basic needs are concerned. Other than that, competition is good and healthy and breeds excellence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So if I were an inter-dimensional superhero and I heard some Earthling saying &quot;Why won&#39;t you help us against being who are more powerful than us?&quot; I think the answer would be &quot;Because you aren&#39;t helping people against beings that are more powerful than them.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it&#39;s like that someone you know who goes deep into drugs, you know you can&#39;t help them unless they want to be helped. Same thing here, only most don&#39;t even care unfortunately. As long as their needs are being met, they don&#39;t give it a second thought, so why should the aliens? </p>
