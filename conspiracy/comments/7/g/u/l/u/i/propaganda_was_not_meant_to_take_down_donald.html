After the whole year of MSM BS, it was all about protecting left ideology, not about taking Trump out legally, and so the truth of the matter is, if Trump stays for another term, then people will become a lot  more conservative. By giving the left hope now, well it&#39;s kinda like giving them a temporary forcefield </p>

    <div class="md"><p>North Korea and Iran would have been problematic either way.. Your not making some grandios prediction here. And Trump and his “right wing Nazis” aren’t doing anything radical. Not yet, it’s still early obviously..</p>

<p>Just imagine if you were put into Presidency after years of Bush and Obama wars across the world.. What would you do? Would you pull everybody out and get JFK’d? Let North Korea get nuclear weapons on ICBMs? I don’t even know what to think about Israel and Iran fighting like idiots and heading towards nuclear war..</p>

<p>Left Wing is crazy and doesn’t belong in power. Right wing is scary because they actually have to solve problems that are hard and dangerous. There’s obviously old Bush Free Mason right wing types deep in the government. But I’m still not convinced they’re working with Trump after the Bush legacy keeps getting smashed apart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is identity politics. You&#39;ll notice that there is no longer a centrist or middle ground. You&#39;re either a Nazi or a genderless fluid hooligan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree completey, we&#39;re thinking the same way. But apparently its too much for most people to grasp. I get it though. It took me years of research to come the full on realisations about how controlled and pointless all this really is. And on top of that, nobody wants to believe it, not even people like us who do. My mind would fight me in the earlier stages, because I had been so brainwashed, like we all have been. But atleast after going through the proccess, we dont have to worry about all the things that they fret over, because none of us is real anyways. Not in the way they believe it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re waking up and what you wrote above was me within the last year. It’s very difficult at first. Understand, you’re not alone and what’s happening to you is part of the process — and that many others are doing the same thing. There might not be many people around you right now who are at your level but that will change. </p>

<p>We are winning and we know we are based on how frequent these fear tactics are coming at us. We keep evolving and changing — but these tactics are the same from 200 years ago. To keep winning all you need to do is keep doing what you’re doing. You will wake up others — not by telling people but by asking them questions. </p>

<p>You need to use the Socratic method. You can’t just tell people the truth they need to be walked to it and allow them to internalize it and explore it. To tell them will trigger cognitive dissonance. That will make them cling even harder to false beliefs. To get through to people don’t just tell them - ask them why are things like this. Provoke their own awareness of conscious so it kicks into action. </p>

<p>I believe in you. </p>
