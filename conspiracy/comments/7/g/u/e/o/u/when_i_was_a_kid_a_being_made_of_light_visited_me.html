       When I was a kid, a being made of light visited me. I was 6 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       People could dismiss the following story as a kid dreaming, or making things up, but what I saw is still as clear in my head as my mother's face back then. I can remember my childhood as well as I can remember any part of my life. Hell, my earliest memory is literally wearing a diaper and pooping it in when my mom was trying to potty train me. At age 13.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Jokes. I was around 1 or 2 years old in that memory. The point is, I have the uinfortunate recollection of shitting in my diaper as a kid. Mom chased me up the stairs when she saw me grunting, and I threw my bedroom door closed and finished the deed like a boss.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, so when I was a kid, I used to have bad nightmares, like any kid does. I'd often crawl into my parents room at night and sleep at the end of their bed. These continued on for almost all of my childhood. I can even remember my worst nightmares as a little kid. One of them involved "Satan" (my family was religious) chasing me around with a puppet of Grover from Sesame street. Satan, in the dream, was a man with a decapitated head. He had no head, just a severed, bloody neck stump, with a long iron nail sticking out of it. Disgusting, I know. I remember that being one of the most terrifying dreams I'd ever had, despite the ludicrous aspect of him biting me with a Grover puppet. (Listen, if a guy with no head and a nail in his neck was attacking you with a Grover puppet, you'd be pissing yourself too.) Even as the dream began to end and I had finally fled that horrific neck-stumped "satan", I can remember being in a "saloon" (my knowledge of which came from Looney Toons cartoons) with a "connect the dots" on the wall. I watched as someone "connected the dots", and when they did, the resulting image turned into a large fleshy eyeball on the wall, which wriggled around terrifyingly, and then glared at me.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, I'm just setting the stage here to let you all know that I remember my childhood vividly, including the nightmares I had.
      </p>
      <p>
       My dad was a pilot, so while I was growing up he'd often be away flying for 7 or even 8 days at a time. During one of his frequent overseas trips I was having a bad bout of nightmares, so I was sleeping along side my mom's bed in my worn out "Get-along Gang" sleeping bag. For those of you who don't know what that is, it was a crappy 80's cartoon about a bunch of idiot animal characters. Youtube it. It's typical childerns entertainment, but I loved it like any kid would.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this one night, I woke up in the dark in this sleeping bag next to mom's bed. I'd had some sort of nightmare, however I unfortunately can't remember what it was about, and I wish I could for the sake of my story. In any case, I wake up feeling scared, get up on my knees, and shake my mom awake.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Mom, mom I had a bad dream. I had a bad dream!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Mom wakes up and comforts me. She tells me that the reason I had a bad dream was because I watched Transformers at Chris's house. Chris was a childhood school friend that I had recently had a playdate with. Chubby asian kid. During the playdate he hit his sister on the head with a hammer while we were playing outside (Not hard, just a dumb bonk on the head) and she went inside, told on him, and I had to sit for an hour in the hallway waiting for my mom to pick me up because he was sent to his room over it. But yeah, I watched an episode of Transformers with him before that.  Since my parents were super religious at the time, anything even close to being violent, including robots shooting lasers at each other, was a big no-no in our household. Mom had found out that I had watched a single episode of Transformers with Chris and scolded me for it days earlier. (I could go into a lot more about what my upbringing was like, but my parents did the best they knew how to. They were simply just idiots.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I wake up in my Get-along Gang sleeping bag next to mom's bed, shake mom awake because I had a bad dream, mom tells me that I had a bad dream because I watched Transformers, and tells me not to think about them, and that then I'll be able to sleep. She rolls over and goes back to sleep herself. So given her counsel, I kneel on my sleeping bag, facing her bedside table, and start childishly repeating the mantra to myself,
      </p>
      <p>
       "No Transformers. No Transformers. No Transformers."
      </p>
      <p>
       Even looking back at this is hilarious to me, because it's such a little kid thing to do. "I had a bad dream, mom said not to think about Transformers, so let's get 'er done. No Transformers. No Transformers. No Transformers..."
      </p>
      <p>
       Now here's the meat and potatoes of my experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I was chanting this to myself, I felt someone touch me on my back. Being a child in the dark, with no one else home but my mother and younger brother, this should have instantly made me scream. I'm 35, and if I was in bed right now, and I felt a hand on my back, I'd lose my shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       This wasn't just any touch however. It wasn't just a hand on my back, or a finger poking me. See, as a little kid, I would wear these shitty kid pajamas with a shitty elastic waisdtband. I'd run around the house like an idiot, they'd get all twisted up, and my father would fix the twisted waistband for me by runninmg his thumbs along their edges and straightening them out. He did it frequently. "Johnny, your pajamas are all twisted up! Come here!" Then he'd straighten out the waistband for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       So as I was chanting "No Transformers" by myself, alone in the dark, with my dad away flying the DC-10, something reached out behind me, and did that very same, exact, "waist-band straightening-out" thing on my pajamas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I should of shit my fucking pants, because dad was away flying, mom was asleep, my brother was sleeping in his room down the hall, and I was the only one awake.
      </p>
      <p>
       But somehow, I wasn't scared by this. I just simply turned around.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I saw, was a being made of light, sitting at the end of my sleeping bag. I can draw exactly what I saw. It's still in my memory as clear as anything was back then. It looked like a person. Like a human. Specifically a human male. It was human size, and it was sitting on the ground with it's legs bent, and sort of holding it's arms across it's knees, like someone would sit on the ground. It was bright. Very bright. To the extent that I can remember squinting. Light shone from all of it's body to the point where I couldn't make out any definite facial features. Like, think of taking a photograph of someone, putting it into photoshop, and turning the breightness all the way up so the shape of the head is still there, but you can't see the eyes or nose or anything; all you can see is a bright outline of a human figure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's something even more strange though that I remember specifically: despite the fact that whatever this was was so bright I couldn't see it's face and had to squint at it, it didn't illuminate the rest of the room. I mean, if you take a halogen floodlight and put it in a room in the middle of the night, it will light up everything else. But this thing didn't. Everything else in the room was still dark, but somehow, this thing was glowing like the sun, but not lighting anything else up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, this should have been the most terrifying experience of my entire life. A scared little kid feels something touch him in the middle of the night, and sees a glowing human in his mom's bedroom. But somehow, some-fucking-how, I didn't feel any fear. Like, literally, no fear at all. No fear, no anxiety, nothing anything even close to it. All I felt, was confusion. I was confused. I didn't know what I was seeing. I looked at it, for a good ten seconds at least, squinting, thinking in my childish brain, "...what...what is that? What is that thing? How did that get there? What....what is this?"
      </p>
      <p>
       It just sat there. I couldn't tell if it was looking directly at me, but I remember watching it as it just sat there, and I tried to reason what the fuck I was looking at. I just looked, and looked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, in my childish brain, I knew that things like this simply couldn't be. "There's no way a glowing human could exist at the end of my sleeping bag. Those sorts of things only happen in dreams. Aha! I'm dreaming! Okay, I better wake mom up again and tell her I'm having a bad dream!"
      </p>
      <p>
       So I turned from this figure and started shaking mom, saying "Mom, mom I think I'm having a bad dream, mom wake up."
      </p>
      <p>
       She murmered and didn't wake up this time, and after I abandoned my effort of shaking her, I looked back to the end of my sleeping bag, only to see the darkness of the room. Very, very puzzled, I crawled back inside of my sleeping bag, laid down, and eventually went back to sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       To this day my mother remembers me waking her up that night, and telling her the story the next morning. I've even talked to her about it in recent years and she says "Yeah I remember you waking me up that night."  I've never forgotten what I felt and saw that night, but for so many years of my adult life, I never talked about it, with anyone. I'm not even sure why. Now, you'd think that this sort of event would be (and is) the most significant thing that had ever happened to me. So why wouldn't I talk about that constantly? I'm still trying to figure that out. I'm 35, and it almost feels that the same way that I didn't feel any fear over this happening, is almost the same way I never questioned why I never talked to people about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, of course, a person might be reluctant to talk about this sort of thing happening to them because they don't want the people in their life to think they're crazy, or a lunatic, or making up bullshit for attention. And I think that maybe that's part of why I never talked about this for so long. But right now as I'm writing this, it almost feels like it was something more than that. Like, it was less that I was afraid of sharing it, and more that for some strange reason, I just simply didn't. It's hard for me to explain right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've spent a lot of time thinking about the experience in my adult life now though. As real as any childhood birthday party or recess game of hockey (Yeah I'm Canadian), I have a clear memory of feeling something touch me on my back in the same way my father would, and then seeing a being made of light sitting a few feet away from me.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the conclusions I've drawn from this experience:
      </p>
      <p>
       One, whatever this was, it had either watched me, or somehow knew how to first initiate contact with me in a way that I would find personable and loving. My father is a very gentle and kind man. When I was 20, I moved back home with a cat that had fleas. I remember coming upstairs as he was giving him a flea bath in the bathroom, and he was speaking to this tiny creature with the most comforting and soft voice, trying to help him through the experience as gently as possible. I tear up when I think about it, because I always imagine how much more gently he must have treated me when I was an infant.
      </p>
      <p>
       So whatever this being made of light was, it knew that it should replicate a touch that only dad ever gave me, in a fatherly way. It somehow knew that fixing my shitty pajama pants waistband was something I'd recognize as a loving fatherly touch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two, I never felt any fear when I saw it. I'm 35, and when the same cat that my father gave a fleabath to jumps out at me in the dark (cause he's a fuckhead. Siamese cats basically hate you as much as they love you), I still jump. But somehow when I saw a human figure made of light a few feet from my sleeping bag, I didn't feel any fear. Like at all. I just looked at it. I looked at it like I'd look at a member of my family. But even then, if my dad had suddenly materialized at the end of my sleeping bag, and I turned around and saw him, I would have jumped and been startled. I mean obviously. He was away flying, and to see him appear would have been like seeing anyone appear when they shouldn't be able to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three, whatever this was, I think that it appeared to me for many reasons, some of which I might not understand for many years still, but right now I think that one of the reasons it appeared to me was to allow me to have a much deeper perspective on what this existence is. I'm a well adjusted adult who lives in a nice part of town, attends a college that he's dedicated to and successful in, and yet I've had an experience which lets me know that there are things about this existence which we haven't even scratched the surface of. That there are life forms which are wholelly different than what we are, that have interactions with us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Four, I think that whatever this was interacted with me at exactly the right time. As an adult, if this happened to me, I might be traumatized. Or maybe, I would just not experience any fear, and be fine with it, like I did as a child. But I think if I had experienced this as an adult, it would have been much different. I would react differently. I wouldn't accept it in the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       For anyone still reading, be skeptical. I don't blame you one bit for being skeptical. I mean, how could you not be. The few times I've told this story though, what I get back is, "well you must have been dreaming". I wasn't though. Ever had a dream where during it, everything was absolutely real, and when you finally wake up, you're insanely relieved that it was just a dream? Like a dream where your best friend dies, or a family member dies, and it's completely real to you, and then when you wake up, you're so fucking relieved that it was just a dream?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's no different than when I was a kid, and woke up from my "Satan with a decapitated neck and a Grover puppet that was biting me" dream. When you wake up, you know that it was just a dream. Me seeing this light being at the end of my sleeping bag though, it just simply wasn't a dream. I was awake.
      </p>
      <p>
       This experience is why it's easier for me to listen to stories and accounts of "Close encounters of the third kind" and such. It's why it's easier for me to listen to some really far out tales that sound like bullshit fantasy, and actually consider them as perhaps possible, because I have one of my own.
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, I'm not some weirdo basement guy who just makes shit up on reddit because his life sucks. I'm an artist, I go to a good college, I have a great life for myself. Broke up with my girlfriend recently because we just weren't clicking, got sad about it, drank alot, got over it, just a regular human like anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I saw a being made of light visit me when I was a kid. And not just visit, but touch me in a way that only my father tenderly touched his son.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's still as weird to me as it is to you reading this. But that's the reality of this world I find myself in. It's not what we think it is. It's far, far more.

       I'll spend some time tomorrow reading through it. I enjoy hearing about other people's experiences, for obvious reasons. I mean, I think a lot of them might be made up for attention, or maybe because they have schizophrenia, but I've read a lot of really weird, weird experiences that I feel were probably actually real. We live in a really big universe. We barely even know what is possible in it yet. That much I know for certain.

       Thanks man. And yeah it's definitely not a conspiracy, but I felt that some people on this sub would appreciate it. Like, I'm just a regular guy, but this is what I experienced. And I think I should be talking about it more that I have been.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, it's weird. Really, this was the most significant thing that's ever happened to me. And yet for most of my entire adult life, I've just bee afraid to talk about it. Why? I think maybe I've stopped caring what people think about me because I already have a solid group of friends. It feels like it's something more than that though. Like I indicated in my post, it almost feels like I just for some reason didn't talk about it for no real reason, like how there was no real reason for me not to feel afraid of what I saw.
      </p>

       I dunno man. This world is a lot bigger than what we think it is.

       r/conspiracy is one of the 5 subreddits I'll bother reading through. Even though it's not directly a conspiracy, I'm still so glad it's here so that my cross would path with it. My aunt told me a similar story years ago and I'm afraid I wrote her off as a touch odd or, perhaps, dreaming.

       The sub used to be filled with stuff like this. These days it's just a political battleground, but at one time there was a lot of good paranormal material, UFO sightings, esoteric stuff, and so on,
       <em>
        alongside
       </em>
       the more politically-driven conspiracies.

       I've read of various colored light orbs that visit young kids, especially at night due to their sensitivity.

       A physical body though is gnarly. Had it been any other physical exterior like leathery or pale skin rather than what sounds like a calming glow worm doll Illumination, I would have been terrified.

       It wasn't any sort of orb or pale skin thing. It just looked like a human male with the adobe photoshop brightness turned up to max. That's the best way I can describe it in a modern context. I've really looked around on fringe sites to try to figure out what this was. I've found sites which describe "light beings" as coming from star constellations like Andromeda or Pleiades, but I mean, really, how seriously can I take any of it. All I have to go on is what I saw, and a plehtora of internet sites that may or may not be run by complete lunatics.

       Well if the Christian god is real, like the one in the old testament, he's a complete dick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus was cool though. I don't think Jesus was "god", but I do think he probably existed, and even if he didn't, the things he taught are very valuable. I don't consider myself "christian", but I do consider the actual teaching of Jesus to be fucking fantastic. Everyone can gain from understanding them. However I wouldn't be surprised if over the years some of what he tried to teach people has been distorted, or twisted by people who want to control others.

       Well, maybe. I don't believe in "demons" though. I do however think that there are a lot of different life forms in the universe, and that some of them might gravitate towards order or entropy. Maybe some even feed off of negativity. I mean, plants turn light energy into their food. It would make sense to me that humans might give off some sort of energy that another entity would turn to food. And if that food was negative human emotion, then that entity would essentially be a "demon" to us.

       I'm familiar with dreamwalking or spiritwalking. This was me waking up and experiencing something though. And not like those dreams where you "wake up" from a dream, but you're still dreaming. When you wake up from both of those you know you were dreaming. With this experience, I was awake, and always felt awake when remembering it. It was unlike anything I've ever experienced.

       Yeah, I wasn't meaning you were dreaming, but perhaps your dad was &amp; sought to comfort you? What u/DefNotJRossiter said about astral projection would probably be a more accurate term for the experience. Either way, very cool story.

       Now that's an interesting theory, that maybe my dad was dreaming and sought to comfort me. Maybe his being, or essence, manifested in some way. As if his astral body took form and appeared to me. I'd be willing to explore that sort of theory, definitely.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing I'd bring up though, is that what I saw looked nothing like my dad, or anyone I knew. Now maybe our astral forms look different from our physical forms. But if that's the case, why would an astral form look anything like any physical form at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       I really have no answers to this. I'm just kind of talking out loud and posing questions to myself.

       I think our astral forms look like our physical selves - or rather, I think we mostly manifest the same physicality in every realm, in every lifetime. You already said the face was whited-out, so who knows?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're sure it wasn't your dad, then it wasn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you don't know, idk either, friend. All I know is it's a hella fascinating story, and I'm certainly compelled to believe it. I would love for you to definitively tell us what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meantime? I like dad on this. He seems like a solid dude. Parents are often psychically connected to their children. I really like the idea that he instinctively knew you needed him &amp; crossed dimensions to get to you in your little, flame-retardant joggers to straighten out that janky, twisted biz you had goin' on. 😆😆

       I would love to be able to say I've had some kind of otherworldly experience to make me think this place is anything other than some kind of simulated hell I am doomed to repeat, but unfortunately I cannot. It's nice to hear the experiences of others still, as it's about all of the hope I have left. I am skeptical but a part of me wants to believe as well.

       I see earth as the sort of cosmic "hard mode" in a video game. If you're suffering here, like most of us are, it might be because your soul came here to challenge it's self. This place sucks, don't get me wrong. I mean....sweet jesus. That doesn't mean our life has to suck though. We get to create hope. We get to, well, create period. I'm not saying that forcing yourself to smile is gonna make everything sunshine and rainbows, but I am saying that you shouldn't discount how much power you as an individual actually have.
      </p>
      <p>
       A great analogy is, in movies about time travel, the characters are always worried about going back into the past, because the slightest thing they change might have insanely far reaching consequences in their future.
      </p>
      <p>
       But none of us in the present seem to act as if what we do right now will have the same insanely far reaching consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every action we take creates a series of events that will stretch on into infinite. Put your hands to good things. That's really all we have to do.

       I have considered this as well, and it certainly is preferable to the idea of an eternal punishment, but I guess my pessimism defaults to the worst case scenario. You're right though, we can make a difference on our time here even if the game is rigged. Anyway, thanks for sharing.

       I didnt read your story at all, the first line is the only thing thats important to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       In late March early April of 2012 ( I didnt document any of this), I was also visited by two glowing beings. I woke up in my bed, they were standing over me, the one in front put its right hand across my forehead, and I was waking up in the morning in less than a second. I know it was real because I remember thinking "No way this is where I die and Im at peace with that". My room was vibrating like nothing i've ever heard. It was like there was a couple jet engines in my room, so much vibrations, but no sound, like, it wasnt loud or anything. Just powerful as fuck. Their glowing did not exscape their bodies, or their figures. They were 6 1/2 to 8 foot tall I would say, my dad is 6ft so I kinda used him as a reference.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yea, thats my story. Wish I had more to share than a split second expierence. But I know it was real, I was waking up in my bed and I remember actively thinking in that second (it literally lasted a second, nothing longer) how I was going to die but I also felt more peaceful than I ever have felt too. So strange. I was meditating a lot at the time. Afterword I got real good at lucid dreaming. Idk. I wish I had more answers cuz I still talk about it to this day to friends and family and no one, I mean no one has ever said to me "yea Ive experienced this too"

       No there was no noise, just vibrations. But I agree, maybe it was that, who knows, Ive looked into it of course. But, why was I waking up in my own bed and feeling consciously fearful for my life? Everything in my room was where it should have been. And why were there two, not one or three, of these glowing white figures? Why was the one standing behind the first doing nothing, while the one in front leaned over to me while swiping its right arm/hand over my forehead? Were they just like, na you ain't ready bro or? Cuz I'm telling you, this wasn't in my head, I wasn't dreaming. I'm certain of that. I've experienced both astral projection and lucid dreaming before. They were nothing like this.

       No idea what they wanted, obviously I would have no clue haha. And I was as terrified and also as peace filled as Ive ever been. It was like two conflicting emotions were rising up in me at the same time in the brief second on time.

       When I was a kid, what amounted to a standing shadow - a black humanoid figure - kept glancing around the edge of my doorway and made occasional charging "runs" towards me every night for two weeks. Then it disappeared entirely and never appeared again.

      <p>
       At least, not when I was conscious of the fact. For all I know it's staring at me while I'm asleep, inches away, every night.

       The thing is Satan/Lucifer is real and that was a familiar spirit assigned to you by whatever principality is over you.   It knows you better than you know yourself.  That's why it knew about the pajamas thing:

      <p>
       1Ch 10:13  So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire of it;

       It's the exact opposite.  Jesus Christ sets you free.  Organized religion is a control device but the King James Bible is God's word.  That's why the Vatican was burning people at the stake for having it's predecessors, preaching it, or translating it.  It's simply the truth that Satan doesn't want you to know about.  Literally everything else is a distraction.

       I'm sorry man, but I just don't agree with you on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was raised in a super, DUPER Christian family, and I believed well into my mid twenties. But little by little I began to be exposed to new information which led me to understand that there was more to this world than what my religion had taught me. The scariest thing I've ever, EVER done in my life was finally admit to myself that I no longer believed in the christian god. I'm not telling you that you need to do the same. Take whatever path you take. I'm just saying that the path I took was one of being neck deep within the religion, and making my way out of it, and becoming a better person as a result. I do good things now not because I fear what will happen to me if I don't, I do good things because I recognize that I'm essentially a creator god, and I can make new and good things happen in this world that didn't exist before.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I for one believe that doing good things for the sake of creating good is far more powerful than doing good things because of fear of punishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways though, I'm not trying to insult you for your beliefs. I'm just trying to explain that I used to have the exact same ones, and why I don't any more.

       If you were doing good things out of fear then you weren't in true Christianity.  True Biblical Christianity admits that we cannot do any good work ourselves to get us saved.  We can only trust in what Jesus Christ did for us.  It's unfortunate there are so many religious groups claiming Christianity that preach good works when the truth is it's grace by faith alone that saves us, not our good works.

       Then there are other things like coming to the realization that NASA is lying about outer space and the world is flat which completely destroys any faith in modern science.  So there's that too but that one is hard to accept due to to lifelong indoctrination.  Yes, I really do believe those things and they are part of why I became a Bible believing Christian.

       I don't buy into the whole Christ died for our sins thing. We were all supposed to be eternally punished by God for our sins until Jesus was crucified, and by simply believing that that happened for that reason, we will go to heaven? It doesn't make any sense to me. I believe in a creator, I just don't buy the dogma.

       Before Jesus Christ died people who followed God went to paradise under the earth (this is where all the Hitler/hollow earth stuff comes from) but after Jesus was crucified he went down there and ministered to the saints in paradise for 3 days and then brought them and paradise up into the 3rd heaven.  So it was basically a holding tank until Jesus paid their price.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes in the Church age all you need to do to be saved is believe Jesus paid the price for your sins.  He's the King of Kings and he took your death penalty so you wouldn't have to.  All he asks is for you to believe that.  That means you know Jesus was God in the flesh, you know you are a sinner, you know what you deserve, and you understand that your God did everything for you because he knew you couldn't do it yourself.  Once you get all of that it brings you to a state of repentance.  Our pride (what caused Lucifer to fall) is the biggest thing that blocks us from being able to admit we are sinners that are in rebellion against God.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read the Old Testament about the Sacrifices and understand how they did animal blood sacrifices to cover their sin (not remove it) and then understand that Jesus Christ is the "Lamb of God" who is the final blood sacrifices that actually washes away sin for good it starts to make sense.  Those people in paradise only had their sins covered so they couldn't go to 3rd heaven.  Not until Christ ministered to them and told them his gospel could they be cleaned and be brought up.

       Even if everything he did was true, it still seems odd to me that he'd require us to believe it. We weren't there and we didn't witness it, so it's tough to believe that. Don't get me wrong, I believe in his teachings though.

       It's called grace by faith for that reason.  We have to believe in something we cannot fully see.  In this era he's building his Church which is also his bride.  We are really lucky to be living in this age where grace abounds.

Joh 20:28  And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. 
Joh 20:29  Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.

       I had a similar experience. It’s called a lucid dream.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my experience, I was laying in bed with my wife in the dark in our new house and I was staring at the closet as I was drifting off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suddenly, I see a glowing person walk in front of my closet and start rummaging through one of my drawers and I immediately shouted “hey!” and startled my wife.
      </p>
      <p>
       I woke up, looking at the same thing as in my dream except there is no figure in the room and my wife is asking what’s wrong.

       Oh I've had plenty of lucid dreams. The thing is, a lucid dream is where you become aware that you're dreaming. You realize that you're actually laying on a bed asleep, and that lets you do whatever you want within the dreamworld.

       I had a shroom trip recently and saw what I sensed was god (but not in the sense of any religion I know), but appeared to me in just a beautiful golden light. I felt as if god was focusing all it's focus on me, and I was overcome with positive emotions. The only way I could describe it is a spotlight focusing on you, but instead of just shining a light on you it's also giving you the most pure love and happiness you can experience. Just total warmth and joy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if you've tripped shrooms, but at least for me it's like you just have a sort of intuition to all sorts of ideas. You will think of some shit you've never thought of before, but it doesn't feel like your thought. During this trip, I had the sense that we are god. We are all one person, and that person is god.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on my experience, I think you saw god. The version I saw didn't have a human form, but the theme of it (light) and the feeling you felt (comfort, like I felt love) makes me feel like these are kinda similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't say if any of this is really true or anything, but it's what I felt without any bit of uncertainty in my mind. I can't say I understand the meaning behind what I (or you, or anyone) saw, so take my words with a grain of salt. This is just speculation based on what I felt, and I think there'll be some time before I can even begin to understand reality (if I even get to that point).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you haven't, I think you should experiment with hallucinogenic mushrooms. Work your way up in dosage, do as much research as you can, and keep an open mind. What you saw as a kid sounds truly special, and I'd be interested in hearing if you can experience/learn anything similar through mushrooms.

       I had a similar experience except that I left my body and I felt deific, like I saw myself on the couch of the living room in complete darkness at night, while my other body was radiating light. At first I though it was someone else that was glowing but I was able to see through it pov walking throughout the house. I remember talking to a relative that was in the house at the time and they said I never walked around the house. (they're a very light sleeper) I don't necessarily believe in god but I do believe something created all this, albeit not more advanced than us. Here's an analogy, we make robots that are better than us in every way. Perhaps whatever created us must be the most basic thing compared to the complexities of now.

       I enjoyed reading about your experience. I also had an incredible lsd trip that allowed me to understand how the universe works. Everything was connected on a spiral like a slinky and we were all part of the same life force that created us. It was so incredibly clear at the time but now I can't remember it exactly.  Psychedelics certainly do open your mind, don't they? As happy as I am to have had that experience, I never took that big of a dose again. It did though, instill empathy and sensitivity in me that I know I would not have had otherwise.

       Ahh, the spiral-like slinky. Psychedelics most certainly open our minds. I wish our culture saw them as the tools they are, and not as recreational nonsense. I'm not saying that recreational nonsense is inherently bad, I'm just saying that a chemical which unlocks the mind so thoroughly should be researched and explored professionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can say for a fact that there have been a few times in my life where I have fallen into a deep depression, and very high dose of LSD forced me out of it. It let me confront the feelings that were holding me back, and forced me to recognize how many good things I actually had in my life. I think that psychedelics can be used as very powerful tools to actually help people resolve their problems from within. Modern medicine seems to treat symptoms, like trimming the leaves of a weed. But I've had experiences with psychedelics which seem to treat the very root, or seed of my issues. Like pulling out a weed from the soul because you can finally find it's roots, rather than trimming it's leaves as they keep cropping up.

       It's heartening to know so many people have explored hallucinagens and been opened to the spiritual realm that comes from those experiences. There is so much to our world that we can't see with our eyes. They say we only use 10% of our brain's capacity. It's likely we only see 10% of the world surrounding us, as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am an optimistic person when it comes to believing in my fellow human being, but I am the absolute opposite when it comes to confidence in my government. I believe wholeheartedly that, as you say, this "chemical that unlocks the brain so thoroughly" has actually been fully researched. I'm certain the government knows what hallucinagens are capable of, and therefore wants them kept away from public as much as possible. We are much easier for them to control, if we're not aware of what we are capable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad you found a way to fight your depression. As hard as life may seem to be with the hassles of day to day life, love and responsibility, it's also a beautiful, wonderful, joyous gift. We may not ever meet in person, we may not even live in the same country, but I'm your friend. So there you go. When life gets rough, you know you always have at least one.

       Shrooms? My good sir, I would never partake of an illicit substance.
      </p>

       (checks the local laws)

       Wait, it says that they're legal as long as they're not dried. Well in that case yes I've taken them many times, and they've benefited my life greatly. I personally feel that everyone deserves to have at least one psychedelic experience in their lifetime, and new research is showing that people almost universally benefit from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I don't think that what I saw as a child was "god". I think it was a being not much different than you or I. Maybe even, it was me, from the far, far reaching future. (Ever seen the movie "Interstellar"? If not, watch it on shrooms. Legit. It's absolutely spectacular, and I don't say that lightly.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think I've ever connected with "god" or "the source" on psychedelics before. I'm not sure that's even possible. But I can say that one time I connected with some sort of dimension, or realm, where all pleasure comes from. If the idea of "heaven" or "nirvana" is actually real, they I would say that during this specific trip, I connected with it. And I don't mean just being "drugged out" and "euphoric". I mean that I made a connection with a place of pure bliss. It was a beautiful experience that I'll never forget, because I'm always reminded that that place is still out there, whether it was in my head or not, and that regardless of how shitty this world can be, there are places free from the problems we have here.

       The god I saw (if that even is a good name for it) didn't feel much different than you or I, either. Despite looking visually just like a golden glow I felt a strong sense of recognition and familiarity with it. Your interpretation is just as valid (if not more since it's your experience) than mine though, but I think your interpretation isn't exactly incompatible with mine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never seen interstellar, but reading the plot summary it sounds like a great movie. Despite how much sense it makes to interact with the arts while tripping, I've never really been able to focus on that (in any form, whether that be making art or consuming it).

       This sounds a lot like how I felt, except I interpreted it as some being. I don't know what to call it, but you said it best with "a connection with a place of pure bliss".

       Exactly, this experience for me was only a little over a week ago but the "high" (not as in the trip, but as in how it's impacted me) I've felt from this has seemingly already changed me in big ways. I've had trips before this that have changed my perspective and outlook on life, but nothing has changed the way I look at life more than this experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if that feeling is anything I can "achieve" (if you look at it like heaven or nirvana) or experience again, but the moment I saw that light I knew it was something I should aim for. Not that I necessarily know where to aim, but aiming to make the world feel as good as I did in that moment seems like the right place to go for.

       It's fine, I understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just finished reading your story, pretty interesting. I had a thought when reading your conclusions.Think of human existence and essence, and also time as something different to what we perceive or believe it works like; what if that's you communicating with your own child self?
      </p>
      <p>
       I had an experience once being high (in my own experience being high allows me to be more introspective and easily in touch with myself in some kind of spiritual realm that is more difficult to reach in other circumstances) in which a song triggered a strange thought and deep feeling in me: the fact that that exact moment of realization was triggering an event in my life that had happened 10 years before, as if my own self listening to that song and being permeated by its lyrics in a very deep and personal way was actually influencing a past event and at the same time that past was simultaneously influencing other moments including the present one. I don't really know how to explain it all that well, but in short, as if time itself was absolutely meaningless and all my life experiences were giving feedback to themselves continuously.
      </p>
      <p>
       That experience, by the way, was very comforting and touching, as if my own self was somehow caressing itself, being gentle, understanding and loving to itself...
      </p>
      <p>
       Weird.

       That's what I think it was. Although I might now use the term "spirit". I'd be more likely yo use the term "being" or "life form" or "entity". Although, really, "spirit" is kind of interchangeable with all those terms. I just try to steer away from anything that's used as a manmade religious colloquialism. I'd really like to someday understand what this thing actually was, and why it came to me, and I feel that if I try to understand it within the confines of our current terminology, I'm limiting myself in my potential understanding.

       I had a being of light come into my house before very similar to your case. I believe 100% it was a child's ghost. I heard child running steps down the hall, and a child's voice. It turns out that a young child did die on the property.

       As a sidenote, "demonic headless Grover wielding Satan" would make a great album cover for a black metal band.

       What happened in your dream with the red buttoned shirt though? Was it just a floating shirt that was trying to cover your mouth? Or was there some person holding it or something?

       Well, I remember it starting off with a little girl smiling before locking me in my own garage, among random antique items for sale. Once she closed the door, they started to take on a lifelike nature (think what the Venus Flytrap is to plants). The buttoned red shirt started yelling at me (along with the rest) and got closer and closer, the collar folding whenever it spoke with the buttons resembling eyes. All I remember is it getting closer and closer, until I woke up. No idea why I remember it so vividly to this day...

       you know, sometimes I think it could be! The conspiracy would be that "they" try to disconnect us from our spirituality. Our spiritual power! Hiding our connection with the universe, mother earth, everything etc etc ..  It's not too far stretched when you think about it. (when you believe it's real)

       I agree with the idea that religion is a tool used to control people. However that doesn't mean God, in whatever context you feel comfortable with, doesn't exist. I use God as a blanket term to mean the force that has provided me with life, the force to whom I owe gratitude. I think that it's possible that God came to you as a being made of light because he knew you were a being made of love, one of his children, and you were being tortured by a being made of hate and iron nails. He came to you to mark you as his own. But I guess I should have asked first, did you ever dream again about Satan?

       Never dreamed about "satan" again. Now, it would be really cool if I could say that after this instance, I never had a bad dream again, but I definitely did. However, eventually in my adulthood, my nightmares stopped. In fact, now when I have a "bad dream", I can either end it immediately, or, sometimes I even like to challenge it. Like for example, let's say something is "chasing me" in a dream. Now I can realize that I'm in a dream, and I'll often turn around and face it, and be like "I'm dreaming, and I'm invincible in this world, so fucking bring it on, scary thing. I can't die or be hurt. Show me what you got."

       Regarding "God", I don't believe in the christian god, however, it would make sense to me that maybe our consciousness has fragmented off from an original incomprehensible consciousness. Like we are small fruits produced from an original tree.I can believe in a "source", because that makes sense to me. But what also makes sense is the fact that a bunch of men got together one day and found out a method of controlling how people acted within society. Which I can;t even blame them for. We need to organize ourselves somehow, and telling people that they will burn forever if they're not good, well, that worked, to an extent. I don't think it's needed any more, and I think it's been horrifically abused by greedy people, but it did what it needed to do. I'd like to see a new shift in our evolution where we act as good people simply because we want to, and not because of the threats of "eternal damnation".

       If you can do that, become aware inside of a dream and challenge it, then you have a capability that most people don't have. A strong mind, a strong sense of self. No wonder a light-being wants to keep you safe. Not that I have any idea what a light being would want from you, I don't. But it's pretty coincidental, you dreamed about Satan then a being of light sat on your bed.

       Well I had many nightmares back then. I was just telling one which I can still remember quite vividly. It happened quite awhile before the light being incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had another very odd instance where I was "dreaming", but I am quite sure that my consciousness was actually taken out of my body and showed a place. I've had many dreams before, but I've never had a dream like this one where what I was seeing was so clear and detailed, as if I was looking at it through open, awake eyes. I might do a write up about that one too, because I'm pretty sure I was shown an "alien" city, which might even exist on earth.

       Yeah the sub is kinda crazy these days. A lot of it seems to be weird reposts of biased news articles, whether they be left or right leaning. I'm sure a lot of it is bots. There's not a whole lot of "humanity" in the posts these days, but whatever. It is what it is.

       I don't subscribe to the ancient manmade religion of Christianity. It's a control device designed to control how people think and live.

        That said, I don't think that what I saw as a child was "god". I think it was a being not much different than you or I. Maybe even, it was me, from the far, far reaching future. (Ever seen the movie "Interstellar"? If not, watch it on shrooms. Legit. It's absolutely spectacular, and I don't say that lightly.)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The god I saw (if that even is a good name for it) didn't feel much different than you or I, either. Despite looking visually just like a golden glow I felt a strong sense of recognition and familiarity with it. Your interpretation is just as valid (if not more since it's your experience) than mine though, but I think your interpretation isn't exactly incompatible with mine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never seen interstellar, but reading the plot summary it sounds like a great movie. Despite how much sense it makes to interact with the arts while tripping, I've never really been able to focus on that (in any form, whether that be making art or consuming it).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But I can say that one time I connected with some sort of dimension, or realm, where all pleasure comes from. If the idea of "heaven" or "nirvana" is actually real, they I would say that during this specific trip, I connected with it. And I don't mean just being "drugged out" and "euphoric". I mean that I made a connection with a place of pure bliss.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This sounds a lot like how I felt, except I interpreted it as some being. I don't know what to call it, but you said it best with "a connection with a place of pure bliss".
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It was a beautiful experience that I'll never forget, because I'm always reminded that that place is still out there, whether it was in my head or not, and that regardless of how shitty this world can be, there are places free from the problems we have here.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Exactly, this experience for me was only a little over a week ago but the "high" (not as in the trip, but as in how it's impacted me) I've felt from this has seemingly already changed me in big ways. I've had trips before this that have changed my perspective and outlook on life, but nothing has changed the way I look at life more than this experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if that feeling is anything I can "achieve" (if you look at it like heaven or nirvana) or experience again, but the moment I saw that light I knew it was something I should aim for. Not that I necessarily know where to aim, but aiming to make the world feel as good as I did in that moment seems like the right place to go for.
