<p>Created by Erik Meldik and Čeněk Stýblo</p>

<p>It looks like they make prank videos but in the last year they started making Elsagate videos. </p>

<p>Then you have mama domisha <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSRlb1dm79tom9_f5eCeV6A">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSRlb1dm79tom9_f5eCeV6A</a></p>

<p>Who has a child with Erik and in my opinion, that baby doesn&#39;t look happy. Together they made videos featuring their baby, which have been taken down from their main accounts. <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/rmg6I">https://imgur.com/gallery/rmg6I</a></p>

<p>Until I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/elhambirkia">https://www.youtube.com/user/elhambirkia</a></p>

<p>It looks like these accounts are creating back up accounts and reuploading the videos. Keep checking the &quot;related channels&quot; section or just type in superhero/Spiderman. I don&#39;t think these videos are going to go away.</p>

<p>Back to Domisha and Erik. You can easily find Erik on LinkedIn and from there you can find Domisha&#39;s. She happens to be an account manager at <a href="https://www.bosbank.pl/">https://www.bosbank.pl/</a>, a very large bank in Poland. And not sure if this is related at all, but that bank founded <a href="https://www.fundacjabos.pl">https://www.fundacjabos.pl</a> , on their Wikipedia it says
  &quot;the Foundation has been conducting educational projects to promote healthy nutrition, physical activities and ecology, which engages over 200,000 Polish children, youngsters, teachers, and parents.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is some impressive investigative work.</p>

<p>First off, there have been other examples of child abuse being put on youtube for views. Any individual running a channel that features violence or vulgarity featuring children should be looked into.</p>

<p>Secondly, it seems as if there is a group of people doing this collectively. Its not just a fad, its as if there have been directives to put this vulgar content out there. </p>

<p>There are a ton of pedogate tie ins to this stuff, and when you connect the creators of these videos to <em>the world banking system</em>, then you have some serious juice. If they are being used for pedo purposes, then connecting a non-profit directed at interacting with children to a creator of these videos is damning. </p>
