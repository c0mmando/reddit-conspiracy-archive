<p>It could be as simple as you committing a crime and leaving DNA evidence for a nice open and shut case.</p>

<p>Maybe the government wants to take you down and once science permits it they could plant your DNA as evidence of a crime you didnt commit.</p>

<p>If you go right off the deep end you might as well consider them whipping out full scale clones to replace you in general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is less of an issue than these companies selling your DNA information without your consent. There is currently little regulation on the subject of DNA as protected private information.</p>

<p>My major concern would that insurance companies will use your genetic information to adjust your rates in the future. If you have a gene that makes you predisposed to a condition, they could justify higher rates. Health insurance would have some protections i imagine, but life insurance could become extremely expensive and unaffordable if they start using this info.</p>

<p>On the more fringe side of things, DNA info would allow a malicious power to tailor custom pathogens to target specific genotypes. </p>

<p>&quot;...And advanced forms of biological warfare that can “target” specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool.“</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sim software. Take dna you ALREADY have and run it through a &quot;procreation sim&quot;. Whatever dna you CAN get a hold of you use to adjust your sim code to make it more accurate. From there you can begin data points to each strand of dna you have that matches up with an actual living being. In this way you begin to predict a great deal of situations. Everything from societies reactions to shit down to who has what personality traits and what they will likely do in life given certain stressors. All it would take would be a series of super computers that gets updated from time to time.</p>

<li><p>23andme is Google</p></li>
<li><p>The US government can legally request DNA from these companies.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That may be enough for you, but there are also these counterpoints</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We leave DNA everywhere we go. If a nefarious actor wanted your DNA it would not be hard.  </p></li>
<li><p>They claim they only sequence some of your DNA</p></li>
<li><p>They claim they will destroy your DNA sample at your request. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>As a counter counter point though</p>

<ol>
<li><p>While its posisble to get pretty much anyone&#39;s DNA if you want it bad enough, its also much easier and cheaper to harvest millions of people&#39;s DNA this way. Same as mass surveilence. </p></li>
<li><p>You have no way of verifying what happens to your sample once it leaves your possession. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Having an extremely large sample of human DNA across across major haplogroups would enable an unprecedented level of data analysis, which would be very helpful when designing treatments to effect whole populations or specific groups.</p>

<p>It would also be super handy if you were a fan of eugenics or were looking for a specific type of human. </p>

<p>23andMe is Google, and the US government can access their data. Given how secretive and powerful these entities are, its pretty tricky to guess what they could do with such valuable data. We would be basically trying to predict the future of covert research.  </p>

<p>Broadly its up to you if you want to donate your alleles to their secret databases in exchange for a report which only talks about a tiny portion of your DNA and often contains very little actionable insights. </p>
