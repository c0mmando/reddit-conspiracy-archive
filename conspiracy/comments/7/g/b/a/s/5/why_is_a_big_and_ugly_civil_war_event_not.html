<p>But no, none of these happened. Instead, what they are doing is slowly grinding our freedoms away.</p>

<p>What is stopping the elite from unleashing a civil war against America that can erupt into world war iii? </p>

<p>Are they continuing to grind down our freedoms and destroy our economy before they unleash the civil war scenario where everything comes from the inside and thus a full scale armed foreign invasion is not needed at all?</p>

<p>Or are we already in the last days and the &quot;war&quot; consists of the destruction of all our freedoms so they can unleash the &quot;New World Order&quot;?</p>

<p>Things are strange.....7 Years of predictions had passed and the foretold &quot;civil war&quot; has never came.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why isn&#39;t there war?  The rule of law will need to have failed so miserably that there is no choice.  To do this the corruption needs to be so blatantly obvious that those citizens who are members of a police force and those in the military would need to be able to recognize who the enemy is. Patriotism can be subjective when the lines are blurred.</p>

<p>In part its why there&#39;s divisions between groups of people.  Republican v Democrat, white v black, have vs have nots.  Keeping groups focused on an obvious or common enemy will prevent them from recognizing the actual one.  </p>

<p>The same can be said for other countries. If we continually see that other country&#39;s are doing horrible things and are committing crimes against its citizens then most people will only be thankful that they don’t live there and not that certain groups have their own interests in mind and its got nothing to do with life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness.  I&#39;d go so far to say that every country has allowed their citizens to develop just far enough to maintain dependency on the governing body. </p>

<p>Without the obvious common enemy most groups aren&#39;t organized enough to  pose much of a real threat without the technology&#39;s we&#39;ve become so dependent upon. Consider the massive network known as the surveillance state.  How does a group communicate without alerting any party&#39;s that they oppose?</p>

<p>Family is another reason we aren&#39;t at war.  Alot of people choose love of family over choosing to fight. Make no mistake war with the powers that be will be bloody.  If even a small group were to appear there would be civilian casualties.  This would cause people to turn to the government to stop them not bolster the spark of support they would need.</p>

<p>All in all its not the right time.</p>
