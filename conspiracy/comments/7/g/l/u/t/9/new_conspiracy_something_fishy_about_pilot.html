       During the summer, Europes biggest budget airline Ryanair announced thousands of flights being cancelled or postponed. The reason given at the time was an internal error where all of the pilots were allowed to take overlapping holidays producing a staff shortage during their busiest time of year. Some people also mentioned Ryanair had lost pilots to a rival airline during the year, but somehow a massive company couldn't foresee this major problem before it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       This week in the US, at another extremely busy time of year American Airlines puts out a similar sob story, that a glitch in their HR system allowed overlapping holidays or in some cases additional holidays to be booked by flight crew and there's nothing they can do except cancel flights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Call me cynical, but when I see a pattern, I get concerned. There's something bigger going on here. Anyone want to join me on this?

       This is the thing, there could be something small, or something larger. On my list at the moment are the usual things like corporate espionage, but another one thats way out on left field is climate change. Check this out....

       So they're doing it to save the planet? Or for an experiment? Why wouldn't they just say if that was the case, people might be annoyed, but would be less annoyed than some glitch cancelling flights and it would make companies look good if they were taking a hit in profit in order to produce fewer contrails in order to help combat the unnatural warming they cause?

       Same reason they don't talk about chemtrails. They don't want us to know how bad the weather patterns have gotten, and how they are trying to block o it the sun to cool the earth, and how they have to seed clouds just to get it to rain.

       The computer systems used by airlines to manage their operations - including preferential bidding systems that are used to assign trips - are ancient technology. They don’t need to be hacked in order to start screwing up.

       I used to work for a fortune 500 company that still used a system from the 80s. It was atrocious. The cost to hire and then rebuild an entire new system while still maintaining current functionality makes it a much bigger deal than it sounds to be.

       That something a lot of people don't realize. Everyone assumes these huge corporations would be running tech more state of the art. That's just usually not the case, companies stick with old faithful instead of investing money into newer better software because they know what they have works and the costs to implement and retrain can be pretty astronomical.

       I can tell you with confidence that there's no way a large corporation would just cancel flights based on too many pilots being on vacation. They would come up with a plan to force some to work. They don't just give up the profits because of a glitch.

       My father was a delta pilot, he actually just retired after 33 years.  But he worked every holiday for 23 years, starting in 1984.  We moved christmas so he could work.  The company doesnt shut down because too many people ask for time off.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to this.  Pilots fly to other cities to pilot airplanes.  My father lived in FL and was based in Detroit and at one point Alaska.  He had to commute everytime he was called in.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are more than enough pilots out there to fly.

       Well there's another simpler idea, but its less conspiracy related, the airlines cut additional flights, blames lack of pilots, and push up the costs of the remaining flights increasing their profits. See, kinda boring

       Airplanes sitting on the ground don’t make money. Capacity will be high without cutting segments. Pilots have to be paid whether they fly or not. Most holiday travel has already been purchased.

       Adding sections makes money around the holidays. Not the other way around.

       Ah. Good one. It's manufactured shortage that will cause a temporary jump in prices, and when the "shortage" is over the prices won't drop all the way back down. Just like everyone in commodities keeps doings.

       There is something weird about it, because you still have to register when you're leaving for vacation with your higher ups, and they have to have other pilots scheduled for the time periods that others are scheduled to be gone. Does no one make a word of small talk in that place?...........
 "my vacation starts tomorrow" ..."oh, so does mine" ...."that's weird, mine does too"  ....."yeah mine too"

       If I go to my boss and lodge time off in the system, a manager looks at the request and says no, thats overlapping. They expect us to believe that the glitch allowed all of the pilots to book their holidays without any oversight or confirmation. Its BS

       They dont care, as long as they make money things like this dont matter. Them keeping flights grounded due to radiation means that they care. They Dont.

       To me the airline is trying to accumulate adjunct pilots for maybe a future strike by their pilots? Whatever it is it's really fishy

       In the last few years there have been several airline scheduling problems caused by pilots not responding to calls for optional flights because the airlines were abusing that process. There has apparently been a call up of pilots in the reserves which I read about here but nowhere else. Can’t really give you any sources but I imagine you could find some if you looked.

       What if a massive internal error did happen, but in other much serious area. What if they found a glitch in the navigation sofware that could lead to a catastrophe or something similar, canceled all flights to fix it. Instead of telling people that they've been flying with an unstable system for some time, they just tell about overlapping bs.

       You’re underestimating the incompetence of management. I can’t speak with any real knowledge of the Ryanair fiasco. But I can tell you with firsthand knowlege that American Airlines is largely managed by retards.

       The company will eventually reach an LOA with the APA to increase pay above the 150% allowed by the CBA for overtime. And as the price goes up, more and more guys will pick up trips. After all, there’s  alamony and boat payments etc.
