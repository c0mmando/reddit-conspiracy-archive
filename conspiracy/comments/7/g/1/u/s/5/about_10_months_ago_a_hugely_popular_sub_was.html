       It's sad that
       <a href="/u/pee_tape">
        /u/pee_tape
       </a>
       is getting voted down when he's totally correct. This post is complete nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The domain names were registered using the WhoisGuard privacy protection service. End of story. That's all that we can determine. WhoisGuard is located in Panama so that it's difficult to get them to reveal who their customers are. If they were located in the US, a subpoena in a civil suit would likely work to get their customer's name.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Millions
       </em>
       of web sites are registered using WhoisGuard. Literally millions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then DukeOvNukem links these web sites to goethalsconsulting.com because ... they're in the same
       <em>
        country
       </em>
       as WhoisGuard.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, according to this "logic", every one of the millions of web sites registered using WhoisGuard is linked to every business operating in Panama.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you strip away all of DukeOvNukem's obfuscating bullshit about "Open Societies", that's all he's found.

       He was voted down because he gave no info.  Did not meaningfully add to the discussion.  You however, I thank.  I thought it didn't all sound kosher but I didn't know for sure.

       This is my first comment so not sure if it will even appear but I thought I would post anyway since very few comments here seem to be pointing out that the above post is nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have checked both domains (magaimg.net and thingimg.com) and can only see that they both have been registered through NameCheap.com. Like most domain registrars, NameCheap also provides WHOIS privacy protection feature and they are using WhoisGuard for that. Whoever registered those domains simply chose to use the privacy protection feature offered by NameCheap during registration. NameCheap probably has the personal details of that person unless fake details were provided during registration. And seeing as NameCheap is a US based company, they can probably be subpoenaed for the personal information of whoever registered those domains.

       Yeah.  It isn’t run by Soros...  it is run by someone involved in partisan bullshit and has long been under the same copying process as the original Tea Party.

       This is funny, because one of the mods in a recent sticky made it so every post is automatically archived. EXCEPT they chose not to use archive.org, they chose some other lesser-known one, archive.is...
      </p>
      <p>
       Now picture this:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Users here, who used to archive certain posts themself, now feel as if they don't have to anymore because 'the bot will take care of it automatically'
       </li>
       <li>
        If in a censorship event or some other SHTF incident, and this sub ends up being wiped or blocked or prohibited, we will turn to archive.is
       </li>
       <li>
        This is all conjecture, but the sticky post about auto-archiving got me rattled and thinking: archive.is is compromised, and while it may be archiving now there is no certainty that this content is safe from manipulation or also being censored/taken down if indeed compromised
       </li>
       <li>
        We end up with no archives or backups because we stopped archiving it ourselves because we trusted mods to set it up and keep it safe and sound
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The author of this auto-archive feature was one of the mods who came in all of a sudden along with 3-4 others. Either around end of last year or beginning of this year. The choice of their username suggests that he/she consider themselves Enlightened and above common people and doesn't have our best interests at heart (if they have one). Not going to say their username since it's all out in the open and goes without saying. They're probably going to come along now, see my comment and smirk, and ban me.

       Huh.  Another thing possibly worth noting is that magaimg is one of few whitelisted image hosts you're allowed to use on that subreddit.  I think it's only magaimg.net and imgur.com that you can use, otherwise it gets automatically removed.  I would think kek.gg would be approved but as of 4 months ago (last time I tried to share a meme in the comments) it was just imgur and magaimg.  So if indeed there was an infiltration, I guess it would make sense for them to try to collect all the memes on hosts they have control over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?  Maybe so one day they can nuke all the Trump memes?  Maybe just to get an infiltrator on the mod team by offering the service?  Make it easy to analyze all the memes?  Something about collecting info on people?  (I don't really know what info is exposed to magaimg when you upload an image to it).  Interesting stuff.

       Also, the whois anonymizer service isn't anything unique and I doubt it has to do with Rackspace either, it's probably the product of a particularly clandestine domain provider. When you lookup
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=P.O.+Box+0823-03411">
        the address of the Panama PO Box
       </a>
       that OP references, you see numerous lists of scammers that apparently use it. A fake loan site, two domains that appear to be bitcoin miners, fake job sites... the list goes on. The person operating this dns provider is clearly INCREDIBLY scummy. But also totally unaffiliated with Goethal Consulting, because as you said, they share absolutely nothing in common.

       At best, he has determined that both orgs might’ve used the same anonymizer.

      <p>
       ...isn’t this the point of an anonymizer?

       To have many, many websites registered at the same P.O. BOX so no one can really send a message through?

       Let me see if I can clear this up a little bit. The company "operating outside of the law" in Panama is actually very commonly used. So much so that it's a single click away for every DNS (the thing that lets you register a name) provider I've ever used. For goodness sake both my websites have it enabled mostly because one of them is associated with my Reddit account and as much as I know someone could find my real identity I want to not make it too easy. The other I just keep up to try to reduce spam. It's really darn common nothing scary to see there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I think I should mention how cloud hosting works. Anyone can buy a server in that server farm. It by no means is likely to be owned by the same person. Just someone else using the same hosting company + WhoisGuard which again lots and lots of people do.
