I have been following this sub for a while even though my name is relatively new. I just never had anything to say. I have something now. To start off I am a veteran. I went to Afghanistan in 2009. I am not bragging I am just setting some background. I just want to sort of clear the air when it comes to the military in the context of conspiracies. Most of us become &#39;red pilled&quot; upon entrance. Yes we are told to follow orders. Yes we have been deceived in Afghanistan and I am sure the case is the same with any other war we are in. I just wanted to say that those who join the military are not just blindly following orders but we are constantly reminded of what an unlawful order is. I would dare to say that 90% of those who join the military believe strongly in America and what it is supposed to be. Yes we were lied to. Yes the wars we are currently in are BS but the military supports the American people and The U.S. Constitution. The troops that some say will trade hats to the blue caps and begin taking firearms are feeding some other narrative. The United States Military is comprised mainly of Patriotic kids that have been lied to, however the longer time you spend in, the more you realize those who are &quot;elected&quot; are the real bad guys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire process of entering a military branch is one big scam...to the point where any other company or business would have their balls sued off for false advertising, truth in advertising and every other scam they use to sell products.</p>

<p>My room mate is a Marine gulf war vet and they have totally destroyed his life by denying him medical benefits, calling him a liar regarding his PTSD and a plethora of other things.</p>

<p>For those of you who live with war vets, you know exactly what I&#39;m talking about.
I&#39;ve seen my best friend deteriorate before my eyes and its a truly sad event.</p>

<p>The VA in our state is by far worse than Cook County hospital. You go there and the disorganization, employee moral is on a level of a inner city McDonald&#39;s.</p>

<p>Everything is passed on to everyone else and the care they give is deplorable.</p>

<p>Along with being wounded in combat, his crippling PTSD and ongoing opiate addiction (from  prescription pain killers)
His monthly disability is $450.00.
He has a heart condition which will require bypass surgery and is unable to work however, someone else with a bad back receives $4000 a month.</p>

<p>Its really sad when you see those super awesome commercials portraying the military as a video game...they make it look so enticing with the flashy production of them you bascially say...&quot;where do i sign up?&quot;</p>

<p>The money and bonuses they promise is total bullshit and for anyone thinking of joining I say...please do some research ...ask former personnel and read as many blogs and stories before you decide to sign that contract.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t agree more. The VA is a disgrace. The way you are treated after deployment is absolutely absurd. I was kicked out and sent to prison for becoming exactly what they trained me to do. I like to equate Veterans to a trained fight dog. We are trained to kill and be invincible. However I bit the wrong hand and was put down in an essence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to tell you and your husband that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. The solution is other vets. We know what we have been through. I cant talk to my fiancée or children about this stuff. The counselors at the VA have no clue. They read a few books on the topic and think they are experts. The truth is people were not meant to kill each other and if you have a problem with that then that makes you human. If you or your husband would like to talk I am willing to talk. Anonymously or whatever. Send me a DM or anything at anytime. &quot;This is my covenant, that ye love one another as I have love you.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your reassurance! And thank you for putting your life on the line for us. It&#39;s unbelievably brave and heroic.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to confess that at one stage in life, before I knew about the elite, I was actually angry at the soldiers. My feelings were &quot;they should know wars are bad, so why choose that line of work?&quot;</p>

<p>These days I realise that it is not them at fault. They were doing what they thought was right and righteous. I now know about the elite, and the blame is on them entirely. </p>

<p>Found this a while back - Veterans for Peace <a href="https://www.veteransforpeace.org/">https://www.veteransforpeace.org/</a>
I think that what they do is really inspiring and they seem to share your view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It takes a different kind of person to know what you are talking about. No one here who hasn’t experienced war first hand will never.. and I will say never be able to even fathom anything of your life. I commend you for your efforts.. and I know you don’t get the respect you deserve. Just know others have no clue and they don’t mean any harm not knowing. People’s perception of the military is 180• from reality. </p>

<p>Realizing that you have sacrificed so much and you can look to your right and left and know they’ve sacrificed as well keeps you going. At the end of the day, no one but them knows anything of who you truly are as a person. I don’t doubt without question you understand who you are as a person. You’ve been in those situations at all time lows and highs and understand the boundaries of yourself more than the normal person who complains at McDonald’s when their order is messed up. Or people say oh I know what I would do in that situation. They don’t.. until you are at the point of failure and you are dragging your body to move and motivating yourself by saying I gotta make it there or I gotta get to them, or if I don’t move I will not make it, then maybe they could understand something about your life. Just hang in there and again realize that people who don’t know just don’t understand and you fought for their right to be privileged assholes. Sorry for the language. I think you know what I mean. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your odds of going to war are and will never be 100%. I know tons of people who are military and never deployed to a war zone. But I know what you mean, but it still sounds like you sort of went on a limb to say you would be storm trooper attacking other countries. It’s more like people have to go to war because they are told, so you are assuring in protecting those innocent lives. No one kills babies or whatever everyone believes. It’s a different world.. soldiers are so far away from political agenda or higher echelon strategic decisions during war.. you are more than likely just charged with ensuring people don’t sneak on your base and kill all your family than being charged to go attack and take innocent lives. There is a huge misconception about the military as a whole. </p>

<p>And I know you just don’t want to be used as a pawn to fight a war you don’t believe in, so don’t feel attacked by my comment. Some people join to make their lives better and don’t get passed anything but I need a job, let alone even knowing we are at war and understanding the severity of their decision to join. These are people who are dual citizens.. come from trailer parks.. come from facing jail time or join military.. some smart.. most dumb academically speaking. Not illiterate but just not aware of all their decisions. But they stand up ready to deploy, engage and destroy the enemies of The United States of America in close combat.  They are guardians of freedom and the American way of life.. they are American soldiers !! </p>

<p>So when these people go to war.. it’s because they are told enemies have threatened the American way of life. And they defend that right Americans enjoy. If at all there is a ounce of truth behind reasoning for protecting our country by way of other countries, these men and women gladly carry that burden with honor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What rank did you achieve and how long did you serve.  This post as disabled combat veteran infuriated me.  </p>

<p>War on terrorism or whatever you call it, there is a war on natural world resources.  You sound like a private who just got out and Im curious under what circumstances.  </p>

<p>The USA does bad things?  Ok but who do you want to win this global struggle? The country you defended or someone else. There is no peace and happy ending. Sorry.  There is not.  So stop lamenting about how the world is and don’t disparage the soldiers, marines etc that give every american on Reddit and in the America their opportunity to liv in a somewhat stable government, economy, and opportunity.  </p>

<p>I hate and have PTSD as a result.  But try to see bigger picture and see the end game you simple sighted boot.   I would always say from the bottom up everything looks messed up.  From top down, you are amazed people don’t kill each other all the time, electricity works, and people show up and do their jobs.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made it to Sgt. but I was court-martialed out and lost everything. Upon my return from combat I started showing symptoms of PTSD. I was drinking just to sleep. I was disconnected from those around me and there was no one to talk to. Eventually it all went bad and I got into trouble for assault. Whenever I would talk to a doctor or therapist they would say I needed help. When my unit would be told these things they would send me to another doctor. The goal was get rid of the problem. I was the problem. I begged and begged for help. However it all fell on def ears. 
The war on terror in Afghanistan was to protect the poppy fields from the Taliban. Nothing more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont disagree with you but your anger is with yourself not the military. I know about courts-martial.  You screwed up bad if it went there. Dont take that out on the gov or the other veterans who didnt screw up. I have ptsd also and more but i didnt get court-martialed.  </p>

<p>Again are things wrong?  Yes.  But again. How do people think the world works?  You think if we dont do some the nefarious stuff we do others wouldnt????  This is not the USA im only referring to. Thats humanity.  Not just the USA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When most people join the military they are young. There is a reason for that other than the physical part. A young mind is not fully developed and can be easily mislead. The weapons and drug rackets that this community all knows about are not common knowledge among most 18-20 year olds. Especially 11 years ago when I joined. I had questions about 9-11 as did most people but I honestly believed that I was doing the right thing. As for some of us walking around and saying &quot;fucking civies&quot;, look at the way the people of this nation are acting. It seems that most of the world is nuts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to hear more from the vets. </p>

<p>The vets know. 2004-2010 for me. </p>

<p>Politicians are one point, but the money behind those politicians are the driving force. Corruption is legal in this country. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen your fair share of corruption and abuse during your time in. </p>

<p>That money that corrupts the politicians also corrupts the families deep in the MIC.<a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/smedley-butler">Smedley Butler warned us of that.</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it would be a great thing if people started opting out of even thinking of going into the military. I know it would take a lot to get to this stage, but I believe it is possible. Either the elites would have to do their own dirty work or there would be no war. One can dream.</p>
