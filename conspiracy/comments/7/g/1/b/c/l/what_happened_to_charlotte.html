    <div class="md"><p>Are you fucking kidding me with this shit? You cannot be serious.</p>

<p>He was already driving into the crowd when that guy hit his car.</p>

<p>This video is <strong>slowed down</strong> to give the impression that he wasn’t moving when the man hits his car. In reality, the man steps in to hit the car was about to plow into dozens of people. </p>

<p>This is all not to mention that he had already come down most of the street nearly hitting multiple people. He was already a threat and people were reacting. Again, he did exactly what he meant to do. He wanted to hurt people. His car would have never ended up on that street otherwise.</p>

<p>No way. You can see the crowd from all the way up the street. He drove towards them for a reason, and the reason was exactly what he did.</p>

<p>Why were people assembling in the middle of the street in large groups? Did they have a permit to be assembling where the hit took place?</p>

<p>Why were they carrying shovels and baseball bats? Were those shovels of peace?</p>

<p>Looked to me like his car was getting attacked, got the hell out of there and ended up running into another &quot;baseball bats of peace&quot; crew.</p>

<p>And this is all irrelevant because it was a deliberate attack.</p>
