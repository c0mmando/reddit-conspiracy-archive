    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it&#39;s a shithole for the people born there but it&#39;s not incredibly far fetched to think there might be more than meets the eye going on in NK. There&#39;s a reason they haven&#39;t been destroyed yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you are right. It&#39;s not out of the realm of possibility but I tend to believe the easy answers before I start speculating over other ideas which have not a single shred of evidence. If there was something I could point to like satellite images showing maybe some enclave in the mountains with lots of big compounds that were clearly for people to live in or if there were whisperings of the rich sending money east I might start to look at it harder but its kind of a shithole country. </p>

<p>I&#39;m American and I have a good friend who is also American and somehow got a visa on art tour (<em>or whatever the hell they call that in passport speak</em>) and he was there for a couple of weeks. When he first rolled in they detained him (<em>as he was worried, might happen</em>) and quizzed the living fuck out of him. He described it as the biggest &quot;oh shit&quot; moment of his life and was thinking &quot;why did I ever think I could do this?&quot; He was studying Asian languages so that helped his cause a lot when they were questioning him. He was able to start speaking in a number of different tongues. As a random afterthought, he thought that was probably pretty dumb because if you were an American intelligence agent you would probably need to speak a lot of different Asian languages. But they let him pass.</p>

<p>I know I&#39;m being a bit long winded but I was absolutely fascinated by his trip and talked to him forever about. I asked him everything you could think of. Details down to the porcelain teacups they use at street vendors - because there is so little crime they actually give you a real tea cup when you order it and you can walk all around sipping your tea and then you just drop it off later.</p>

<p>There is nothing he told me which would lead me to believe that they are harboring the world&#39;s elite. His stories are kind of amazing though and they speak to how backward the country is. They had to have a state-employed escort the entire time. There was one time they took them to this market that was just glittery and abundant with merchandise. He thought it would be cool to buy something but they wouldn&#39;t let him. Nothing is for sale. It&#39;s all a show so people seeing it think that North Korea is really doing well. So all these pretty girls are walking around playing pretend like they are actually trying to work in the store but they are just as much background as the stacks of San Pelligrino water, expensive cognac and clothes. </p>

<p>I mean hell, maybe his state-employed escort was keeping him away from the secret rich people hideouts but he talked a lot about things and how there were more people walking on the sides of perfectly good roads than there were cars because no one can afford to buy one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t a mystery why they haven&#39;t been destroyed, and it has nothing to do with it being some sort of illuminati playground. It&#39;s because of: (a) the United States&#39; and South Korea&#39;s desire to avoid mass casualties in Seoul, (b) China&#39;s desire not to have US troops stationed on its border with a newly-unified Korean Peninsula, and (c) US/SK/China&#39;s collective desire not to have to deal with the massive refugee crisis that would result if DPRK came crashing down.</p>
