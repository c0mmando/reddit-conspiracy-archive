       So I have built some what of a rep for my social existence when out an about at bar scenes, partying, etc.. but it's fucked up because people are making me feel like I'm the weird one because I'm honest,don't have facebook or social media, don't walk around with a mask pretending everything is Willy nilly, I'm practical, and live my life the way I want to and not trying to conform and be socially accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is, these people are the fucking psychos because they are fake as shit 24/7. Especially behind closed doors. Most people in public are putting on a show, and are not being themselves.. some will call this a survival instinct, to me it's fucking looney.. fuck it, be yourself speak your mind, but don't completely abandoned your social etiquette. I'm tired of people making me out to be some weirdo and treating me weird when I'm around, but it's all passive and fake. No body tells you how they feel to your face or looks out for your, and most importantly wants clarity. Because I identify as my born gender and act accordingly with the nature of said gender, and won't allow any of that liberal bs brain washing they are teaching everyone at college to effect my life. I love honesty and learning and speaking truth and all I realize is people are so scared and full of bs, that you become the ball, and they team up on you. But in one on one, some of those people will be reasonable and understanding, but not when they are in groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see all these people who are fucking batshit krazzie in some social scenes get treated fairly, and are accepted.. but clearly are sick in THE fucking head.. but  I have a few drinks, say some real shit and I'm ostracized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who ever truly gets it, and surrounded by people who are all trying to be materialisticly up to date and purposely asleep..
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I wanna thank all of you guys for taking the time to shed your advice and input. Even though I couldn't respond to all of you, I've read your replies and am goin to try my best to apply a lot of the suggestions and tips. I've always been a solo jack sparrow type, adventuring around and exploring. And traveling is something I've always had in mind. I've finally been able to seek refuge at a family members place. And hopefully here I can stay showered focus and brain storm for my coming exploration. I wish all of you the best who have mentioned to be in similar circumstances. Sometimes you gotta talk with someone, even if it's a group of anonymous strangers. You folks are great here and it's one of my favorite subs. Thanks for being awesome strangers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fight the good fight and stay aware.

       Recently I haven't been talking to my " best friend ". They are like the only person who gets it 24/7 that I know and we've known each other for years. But recently I had to end up sleeping in my car due to losing my place to rather unfortunate circumstances.. and I used to park near his place to sleep because parking was rarely regulated. A newly gentrified neighborhood, but still with specks of crime ( shootings and stuff) anyway. He didn't invite me in or offer me a blanket or anything the months I was sleeping In my car. He even had an available room. We would go out to bars and I would drop him off home and he would just go inside, knowing I have been sleeping out front his place in my car. Would sleep with my car on because I had a broken window so it would get cold so I had the heat on all night. Even though I know, it's his full right to invite me in or not, I never asked. But on thanks giving morning I was just beat and finally caved, and I asked him if I could stay in his available room ( I was outside his house ) and he just said he was sleeping and he'd call me right  back.. he never called me until late afternoon. I ignored the call and decided I was goin to stay away from him for a while. I don't know if I'm being selfish or not, but that is not in my eyes what a best friend would let another best friend go through ( even though I know it's not their responsibility to take care of me ). I just felt extremely shitty because on my end, the friendship meant a lot more and I would of neeever let them go through that. So I'm in a weird place. Do you think me cold shouldering our friendship for those circumstances is justifiable? Or am I being unreasonable?

       You're not being unreasonable. If I were you, I'd avoid contact for a bit, and if they're a real friend they'll reach out asking why you've been so distant. Tell them what you've told us. A Real friend will do something to fix this situation, though, having your "best Friend" in the circumstance that you're in, should trigger emotions inside them to begin with and they should immediately want to help you. That's what any real friend would do, let alone a best friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's sad that people aren't more helpful. But, it's not all of them. Just those who are caught up in their own bullshit, like you have said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay strong, you seem to know whats up, and understand the bravery an open mind requires.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't change for others, rather, find others who are willing to give as much as they get.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry to hear about your troubles. Life can get extremely complicated at times, but, to those who are constantly thinking of ways to improve it and come out on top, it will always come around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe try for some family to see if they can help, if that's not an option, I would honestly consider moving, as it seems like on the friendship side of things, you wouldn't be losing a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       You got this. Have patience and trust in yourself.

       You're dealing with friendship Stockholm syndrome amigo.  Clearly if that's the way he played that request he should've made his general feelings more obvious from the get go.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could scrape and find reasons to forgive this kind of selfishness; but that's ultimately a waste of time that you'd regret.
      </p>
      <p>
       I relate to the hard times, but you need to realize that these people around you truly are brainwashed socially.  They don't even know that they've been taught to resort to their own groupthink cia mind control bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       They see redpilling and treat it as an opportunity for virtue signaling and group ridicule.  Not everyone is like that but people don't like seeing the mud when they've got their rose colored glasses glued on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish you the best and hope you'll find a better place to stay.  And if you're still in a car with a broken window I would prioritize that, then you won't have to run the heat and waste your limited resources.  Even a bullshit fix is better than nothing.

       If that guy went around living his life like that, people would totally consider him bonkers no? Let's say he never went around explaining just that bit of realization, but a lot of his actions and perspectives were based around that... people will feel he was unrealistic, no? I can relate. I've been told I was " too optimistic ". Shit pissed me off.

       I don't want this to become conspiracy's shtick but the quality of response you'd get there on topics like this would range from personal attacks about how he challenges new wave gender studies to your basic depression advice.  ie it gets better buddy.

       the wanton destruction of civil society is clearly a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        media constantly promotes distrust / hate of any group, gender, or person
       </li>
       <li>
        legislators ignore the citizens they report to, stealing citizens tax money to feed fat cats, ignoring basic needs of a good society
       </li>
       <li>
        corporations have zero ethnical or moral responsibility to their employees or customers, causing endless pain and distrust
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       humans are a social species. wilfully destroying our healthy interactions over time is killing us all.

       Some people have a harder time socializing than others, but if you harbor resentments toward other people then they pick up on it and will treat you accordingly. So my advice is try to let things go and be more zen. Maybe exercise, try therapy, do some art

       I've definitely faced the mirror on my actions and have definitely fessed up to any wrong doings. But that's just my point, don't we all make mistakes? I realize you can't win everyone over, but I feel like sometimes people are ridiculous with their judgements sometimes. Everybody's been drunk and made mistakes, but I feel sometimes people are fearful of me because I'm not always 100% down for bullshit. And if someone ask me for advice or an opinion I try and be as honest as possible and give insight. I'm realizing clairvoyance and honest advice is not what people want.. because they already know , and want to here something to boost their ego. I think a lot of people are sick in that regard. I feel like my intentions are pretty basic when it comes to socializing, and being amongst the world.. but perhaps my version of a good time isn't the same as everybody else's ? I just feel judged and misunderstood and the only thing I can think about that can help that is if I conform.. and I refuse. I'm a very nice caring person( as much as I can be at least try to practice it often ) and I see people are really used to being lied to and taken advantage of so people always think I have alterior motives. Maybe I should move awAy and start fresh

       Sounds to me like you need to talk to someone. I can totally understand where you are coming from and I used to feel that way, luckily I had some good friends that showed me that everything isn't so bleak.

       The things people have said to me are so strange.. people have said " back in the day you use to be a real nigga, now your just weird ". Because of my style and  appearance has changed and my way of thinking openly.  But they don't realize I've always been the same person. People have called me gay to my face and behind my back because I express myself as I want and grew up with a single mother. People say so much fucked up shit about me, but at the same time there are tons of people who like me and I attract a lot of people because of my style and appearance. It's really hard for people to read me ( so I've been told to have been unreadable ) but people also say I have really good energy.. it's so weird because I'm always looking to have fun grow and learn new things.. could this just be the world as it always has been and maybe I have unrealistic expectations of this peace and loving world I often hold in my head? I have so much social anxiety because when I go out I don't know if I'll be welcomed or shunned? It could be me putting this kind of mixed energy in the universe that I'm cultivating all these up and down experiences? I do believe in putting positive energy out in the world. Perhaps I'm tapped into the bianary more than I imagined. A lot of this did happen after an intense mushroom experience years ago, so maybe my perception has changed and I should just adapt.

       Fasure.. my mom had a heart attack 2 weeks ago and is a vegetable now just like that and may die.. I have been staying In my car because my old place got bedbugs so I booked it before I could get infested on.. so yes while things have been interestingly dark, I always try to stay illuminated.. but people and myself are making me feel bad or trying to, for being so nonchalant during these interesting tines. My family is being sort of passive about what they consider a lack of concern but the reality is fucking crushed me when I saw my mom like that in the hospital. It crushes me to think about it. I'm just trying to stay normal and live my life, work have beers and meet people and build. But I feel subconsciously bad for doing these things sometimes and not being at the hospital with my mom, especially when sometimes I have a weird or bad night, I start to feel regret that maybe if I was just at the hospital none of these weird experiences would happend but in the other hand I don't feel like me being at the hospital would really change anything. I really just feel alone but I'm not miserable.. I just feel misunderstood and judged unjustly. I feel like I give so much but people don't give back, because they just want to collect. And since I give from my heart, I don't bring it up or put it in people's faces, but I can't help but to notice how much people aren't there for you the way you are for them, then i start to feel like s hypocritical asshole because even though me and my mom were never really close and in up and down terms, I feel like the same could be said considering her circumstances in me not being by herside everyday :/

       You say "people" a lot. That's your problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Start by loving yourself and forget about "people" 
Clean your entourage, be who you are. 
Those who can't appreciate the person you really are will just go away and be replaced by people that deserves it.

       I know it may seem difficult, but it is really helpful to remember that what other people say or think of you ultimately means absolutely dick as long as you are bettering yourself and the things around you. I know that to be loved and accepted is one of the most basic parts of the human experience, but when you're so concerned with other people's perception of you, I think most people see that as off-putting, which in turn makes the social anxiety/worry of how others see you that much worse. Compare yourself to the you from yesterday, not the people around you.

       This is where I'm calling BS. You are not some minority in a sea of gender confused peers. You spend way too much time on the Internet and because of that think this is reality. Get off the internet and don't watch cable news. it will do you some good.

       He may live in and area where it’s like that. I don’t think it’s fair to say you know anything about his life. I understand what you mean though. He may be surrounded by other college aged people who sit around and just bash people for being real. Or bash people who support whichever person, etc. just know we are all have different surroundings. I’ve witnessed some areas of my life where what he is getting at seems quite accurate. I Just smile and keep it pushing.

       There is no area like that. It only exists on the Internet/cable news/talk radio.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast majority are not confused about their gender and they are not bashing people for being real. If you believe that, than you're not being honest and getting all your truth from the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both of you said this is the truth, prove it.

       Bud you really don't know what your talking about I guess.  I've seen it first-hand.  Until you really consider the idea that this whole new ideology is a psyop attack on our culture in general the idea seems ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this whole movement starts with redefining gender, however it's carried out in the most ironic way possible and the end result? Self-sterilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       You must be old or maybe your circles have distanced you from this lunacy by nature.  So this ideology has knee jerk groupthink counterpoints built into it for it's followers.   There ARE people out there who perceive anything outside of their view on gender in general as the same as saying niggər.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now with that in mind now learn that these people shun anyone with differing views with passive aggressive politically correct tongue in cheek virtue signaling.  It's a cult of belief that needs to be brought to the light somehow.  The problem is that bringing up the problem makes you a target for harassment from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       -So the problem grows.  Right now you're denying that this problem exists at all; this gives it strength.

       Well the burden of proof isn’t on me to prove what you’ve never experienced. I have seen that, obviously it’s not large scale, but I was just saying you don’t know his inner circle of friends or his city’s situation. Or where he frequents as a consumer.. etc. Even at airports with recent travel there is more and more people I notice that I honestly can’t tell you which gender they were. And if you are around liberal college campuses, it most definitely is a different world. You are being extremely close minded to individual situations. I’m not claiming there is a collective agenda against anything. These groups do exist, and some people may be exposed to them more than others.. is that hard to believe where you need proof.. or can you be an adult and assume that you don’t know so there is a possibility.

       I’m the same way. But we need more real people. I do watch tons of YouTube and Reddit. About the extent of my social media. Other than that.. look up and take in the environment and enjoy life. Others will awaken.. just enjoy life.

       I had friends like this in college. We shared couches, at least, but otherwise they were caught in a life eddy. An eddy is a spot in a river where the current reverses and swirls, which will leave you stuck in one place.
      </p>
      <p>
       They grow content going to bars, over-drinking, sleeping half the day, half-assing their job, and then bitching about not getting promoted (why would they?)
      </p>
      <p>
       They aren't necessarily malicious, they are just stuck. The only route out is hard truth and hard work; which is why they aren't moving forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moment i demanded more of myself and my friends, my life improved and those old friends fell by the wayside and the new friends i encountered were on my same path.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they mock you for trying to be better, they aren't your friends, they are angry that you make them recognize their own inadequacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fill your life with positive change, challenge and self improvement, and watch your failures turn into victories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, who is (are) your role model(s)? It doesn't have to be someone you know, or even just one person. No one person is perfect, so a group of individuals is ideal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I once read an article about creating a council of figures you admire.  Educate yourself in the virtues and beliefs held by your council.  Visit with them in your mind them as a visualization exercise to hold yourself accountable and assist your decision making. Imagine speaking to them and what advice they would give.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been an invaluable tool in my life, and i can guarantee it will lead to happiness and fulfillment.

       Perfect place to post this. Keep being you. Connect with others on a deeper spiritual level and if they can't match you there it's time to move on and find others. Were out here as the minority unfortunately but we do exist!! All will be revealed eventually. Stay up friend!!
