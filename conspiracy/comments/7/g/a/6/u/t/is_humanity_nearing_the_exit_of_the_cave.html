<p>Here is a link to <em><a href="http://www.michaelbaur.com/teaching/PlatoCave.pdf">The Allegory of the Cave</a></em>, which is the reference in the title.</p>

<p><strong>Intro</strong></p>

<p>We are all here because we share one thing in common. We see through all the bullshit in this world. Our journies to this shared belief might be radically different, some may have suffered more than others, but at the end of the day, we wouldn&#39;t be here if we didn&#39;t seek the Truth. We all acknowledge, to varying degrees, a spider web of conspiracies that seem to be suppressing the evolution of humanity. </p>

<p>Whether it is the nature of physics, medicine, the food industry, media, government, space, the list has no end. Knowledge is power, and the ignorant can be controlled like sheep. </p>

<p><strong>The Q Anon...</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCalmBeforeTheStorm/comments/7fq3e2/here_is_the_entire_archive_of_the_q_clearance/">Here is a link to every single Q thread archived</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCalmBeforeTheStorm/comments/7g450v/the_book_of_q_pdf_great_to_share/">Here is a link to the Q threads, saved in a PDF with some context, appropiately named: <em>The Book of Q</em></a></p>

<p>In case this is news to you, the past few weeks a user on 4chan has been posting some really interesting bits of information. The reason he is using Q, is that it is the highest classified clearance level in the Dept. of Energy. The person claims to be a part of Trump&#39;s administration and has touched topics including elite bloodlines, oil money, human trafficking, pedophile blackmail, deep state, compromised intelligence agencies, Hollywood, etc. Don&#39;t take my word for it, see for yourself. </p>

<p>I, at first, was highly skeptical. I assumed it to be a larp, but Q has provided some really interesting evidence to prove his legitimacy. One of his most recent posts said: &quot;Follow the white rabbit&quot;. What this truly means, I have no idea. But, after he posted that, MSM started picking it up...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/six-facts-incredibly-odd-white-rabbit-conspiracy-theory-trump-fans-sharing-131435153.html">https://www.yahoo.com/news/six-facts-incredibly-odd-white-rabbit-conspiracy-theory-trump-fans-sharing-131435153.html</a></p>

<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2017/11/donald-trump-cnn-maga-pill-time-magazine-fox-news-1202214584/amp/">https://deadline.com/2017/11/donald-trump-cnn-maga-pill-time-magazine-fox-news-1202214584/amp/</a></p>

<p>Generally, if MSM starts covering a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, we always have to question the motive...</p>

<p>The final nail in the coffin for me was a few days ago: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUkB5Kk4WAA">https://youtu.be/gUkB5Kk4WAA</a></p>

<p>Either Q is legit, or he needs to be nominated for an Oscar. </p>

<p><strong>What does this all mean?</strong> </p>

<p>Are we in the age of disclosure to the hidden knowledge of humanity? Are we being slowly led through the cave, towards the opening, by the same group that has held us down there for millenniums? How are we supposed to know if it&#39;s the actual exit, or some false door to keep us enslaved? </p>

<p>There is a psychological phenomenon called the Mere Exposure Effect. It simply means the more we are exposed to something, the more likely we are to accept it. In the event that earth-shattering truths are being locked away, but are slowly being discovered by a critical mass, it would make sense to soften the exposure to the masses. No one profits off of total anarchy.</p>

<p>That idea is referred to as predictive programming. Are all those occult/satan references in film, tv, and music just coincidences? </p>

<p>The alien conspiracy is not a topic that I am that knowledgeable in. Once you get that deep, disinformation is everywhere. I will entertain the idea but I still doubt everything. One of the theories I have read is people claiming to have seen a &quot;cigar-shaped&quot; spaceship. Here are a few articles about that. </p>

<p>Those links range from 6 months to 5 years old. NASA posted this last week: <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/first-observed-interstellar-object-speedy-000900819.html">https://www.yahoo.com/news/first-observed-interstellar-object-speedy-000900819.html</a></p>

<p>I cannot accept this is just a coincidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When my friend (who is 5 years older than me) showed me the Allegory of the cave, I felt a fundamental shift in myself. How can someone KNOW that what they know is true? What if it&#39;s just a sliver of the truth, or completely false? And even THEN, how would you know that THAT&#39;s the truth? It&#39;s turtles/caves all the way up :p</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen &quot;Follow the white rabbit&quot; on a few threads in 4chan. I can find/link them if interested.</p>

<p>Oh jeez, the author of this piece did not write it with an agenda at all... /s</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>They will lead us juuuust to say near the exit of the cave, where there is abundant information and evidence of things, so much so that most people will become directionless in which way to proceed.</p>

<p>In our lifetimes (perhaps even in the near future, who knows), we will finally come to understand dimensions (at least the base 4) and how they are linked together and interact. This understanding will fundamentally change our species. No longer will we bound to the dimensions we think we are bound to, but we will go somewhere (not a place per se) where nobody in our (recent) history has gone before.</p>

<p>I have this problem that whenever I say I&#39;m going to do something, I end up not doing it or something comes up, so I won&#39;t say anything more :p</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, they may have to be be getting to that point. Physicists did just conclude that the universe shouldn&#39;t exist. </p>

<p>&quot;All of our observations find a complete symmetry between matter and antimatter, which is why the universe should not actually exist,” says Christian Smorra, a physicist at CERN’s Baryon–Antibaryon Symmetry Experiment (BASE) collaboration. “An asymmetry must exist here somewhere but we simply do not understand where the difference is.”

<p>And they are already creating and using all the smoke and mirrors to redirect us from the actual exit of the cave into a new digital cave controlled by AI.

    <div class="md"><p>The cave has nothing to do with corruption, tptb, or aliens and shit. That&#39;s a blanket over you inside the cave. Going out of the cave is about exploration of the self. Finding your passions. Leaving the cave means finding love life and enjoyment. </p>

<p>Also the allegory of the cavern is meant to teach people you can never know everything because you always have a set frame of reference. Even outside of the cavern is another cave. Caves all the way... People constantly misuse this allegory. </p>

<p>I wrote this post while listening to some 432 hz Frédéric Chopin.</p>

<p>But my song of the day is Crimes of the Heart by Immortal Technique</p>

<p>That is quite range of musical interests. I think it says alot about a person. To me, it shows an open mind, willing to accept things that others would hand wave away. Maybe it&#39;s a conspiracy theorist thing? Who knows.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are we in the age of disclosure to the hidden knowledge of humanity?</p>

<p>I really hope so. This is the one thing that bothers me the most (besides pedo shit), having knowledge and history hidden from us! </p>

<p>The pedo, human trafficking stuff just disgusts me. Knowing an evil that bad lurks in the shadows of this world keeps me up at night. The hidden knowledge stuff truly fascinates me though. </p>
