       Has there been any discussion of hidden/esoteric meaning in the show Westworld? I found that the show weirdly resonated with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon my second viewing of the series I started to get the distinct feeling that the character of Delores is representative not of a future robot species, but of our current selves. Manipulated and controlled, living in a maze that we can't fully understand or escape. Suffering so that we can achieve real consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it especially interesting that the last episode of season one was titled "bicameral mind". Bicameral mind is a fascinating fringe theory that basically says our ancestors normal way of processing the world was the schizophrenic way. They heard their own internal dialogue as an outside force compelling them to do things. I wonder what the implications are for MKultra.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Ford provides Delores a gun at the end and an implied choice. She is given the choice to kill her tormentor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like society is about to get a gun too.
      </p>
      <p>
       If so I advocate for a merciful justice. We need to become non-violent to continue our evolution. I feel like our society is being tested. An assessment to determine if we are ready to leave our cradle.

       Maybe more like, overthrow the tormentors in as non-violent a way as possible. :)

       You're not alone my friend, i do believe in equal rights for every single human being on earth. I do also believe that currently we're controlled by evil entities, that one day an event will occur that will drive mass consciousness on our sphere. And light/love will conquer our realm. Bless our souls

       Not all Transhumanists think that way. Transhumanism is a spiritual journey to find out what humanity is at its core, and to accept ourselves for who we are. Then becoming more having transcended our mortality into something greater.

        Greek mythology
       </a>
       In episode 8, while searching for the maze, the Man in Black and Teddy are forced to fight a mysterious horned figure who appears out of nowhere. In Greek mythology, when Theseus wants to enter the Labyrinth, he first has to fight its guardian, the Minotaur, a creature with the body of a man and the head of a bull. It’s presumably not a coincidence that Theseus and Theodore (Teddy) are such similar names.

        Debussy
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       During the flashback in episode 8 where Maeve freaks out due to the death of her daughter, Ford is called in to help calm her down and the piece of music he uses to do so is Debussy’s Reverie. Sound familiar? The “reveries” is the name given to the new programming Ford created and updated the Hosts with at the beginning of the season, which made them more realistic, but has also might have made them glitchy too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we know that Debussy’s Reverie is Ford’s secret way of rendering the robots docile, it puts a completely different spin on each time we’ve heard the music before. For example, when Bernard is asking Ford about Arnold in episode 3, the host at the piano in his office is playing Reverie...

       The Alice in Wonderland references were made explicit in episode 3, when Bernard hands Dolores a copy of the book and she reads the following quote: "Dear, dear, how queer everything is today. And yesterday, things went on just as usual. I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night."

       I definitely believe there is a limited soft disclosure going on in the media, Westworld being at the forefront.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of how many movies and games recently have featured synthetic humans are serious plot element? Westworld, of course, but also Fallout 4 was ENTIRELY about synths, Blade Runner 2049, Ex Machina, Almost Human, the recent resurgence of the Alien franchise features robotic humans, etc. etc.

       Let me just say this,
I go to a very VERY good university (not to toot my own horn I really don’t deserve to go here), I just got an email today about an IBM person coming to talk about advances they’ve made with artificial intelligence. I can’t even explain the amount of reddit posts I’ve seen about artificial intelligence, from customer services reps being robots, from things not being discernible from robots. For example, I was at work LAST NIGHT and got a weird call which literally sounded like a person but I was suspicious, and when I said “sorry, (whoever ur looking for) is not here,” in the nastiest, bitchiest once, just to see if it was a robot, there was a long pause for 30 seconds and it said “okay. bye!”
      </p>
      <p>
       So, we have someone coming to my fucking school now to talk and promote this bullshit.

       The call I got yesterday was at work, but they call my phone too all the time over shit that isn’t even relevant. Like I don’t own a home, but I always get a call “this call is for homeowners looking to lower their interest rate! We got your number from..” and I’ll chime in and say “oh REALLY that’s INTERESTING because I DONT OWN A HOME.” And they just straight up hang up. Lol. Since I cursed them out they haven’t called my cellphone.

       also, it's a crazy synchronicity that you posted this because i'd never even thought about watching this show but i just had a conversation about this very topic yesterday. a girl was explaining the premise of the show (all i knew was: Wild West theme park with robots) and I wondered out loud, 'I wonder if the people who made the show were trying to tell us something?' and she was like 'idk man, if that's true then there's about to be a revolution bc at the end of the season Anthony Hopkins gives the head robot lady a gun'

       Since you are up on synchronicity...how 'bout this?  My father died on Easter, and my grandmother died three weeks prior to that...yeah, it's not the happiest one, but my dad's name was Bernard and my grandmother...Dolores.  Don't think the odds of that are too probable.

       I thought it was weird that Evan Rachel Wood plays the character
       <strong>
        "Dolores" in Westworld
       </strong>
       , because when she was dating Marilyn Manson, she frequently wore heart-shaped sunglasses, a reference to the character "Lolita" in the Vladimir Nabokov novel of the same name. In the novel,
       <strong>
        Lolita is the nickname of a girl named Dolores
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       During the time that Wood and Manson were together, he released the album "Eat Me, Drink Me", which is full of Alice in Wonderland references.

       , it says, "Manson, a great believer in connections and coincidences, points out that Nabokov translated Alice In Wonderland into Russian." The same article mentions that Lewis Carroll, the author of Alice in Wonderland, was rumored to have a fetish for young girls.

       The logo for the "Eat Me, Drink Me" album is a
       <strong>
        heart-shaped spiral
       </strong>
       , that looks suspiciously similar to the "girl lover" heart-within-a-heart described in the
       <a href="https://aceloewgold.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/pedosymbols.jpg">
        FBI documents
       </a>
       related to symbols used by pedophiles. The website Nachtkabarett, which analyzes content released by Manson, even says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Aside from the raw nature and purpose it symbolically serves, several similar visual representations exist which range from the logo of an ice cream company to
        <em>
         the symbol of a paedophilic organization in support of relationships between a man and young girl
        </em>
        (which can, in part, be seen as a joke even if coincidental given Manson's half-facetious Lolita references toward he and Evan's obvious age difference)."

       Around the time of the Pizzagate revelations, I wrote a lengthy post about the weird connections between Marilyn Manson, Johnny Depp, Hunter S. Thompson, Eli Roth, the West Memphis Three, Satanism, ritual sacrifice, snuff films, 
 trauma-based mind control, the Netflix series Stranger Things, and Pizza Planet in Toy Story:

       Very interesting connections in that link you posted... I think you are prob right about them being involved, and if he actually had to sacrifice his mom for success that is fucked up!
      </p>
      <p>
       Also interesting that you mention Pizza Planet. I have my own theory about a pizza place in a cartoon... specifically South Park and the pizza place the kids go to (Wile E Pete Cheese or something?). Well if you watch the show, you may remember one or two episodes where Stan gets super depressed and you actually see the pizza place thru his window in some scenes. I think it might have been hinting that he got molested by the dude who wears the costume to entertain kids at the pizza place. Fucked up I know, and don't have any proof or anything, tho I feel like I remember that Wily Pete dude being creepy in an episode.... but yea, just something I thought about when rewatching after knowing all this pizzagate stuff.

       Also, on a more random note.... Heart shaped spiral made me think of "heart shaped box" from nirvana... just randomly checking the lyrics (
       <a href="http://songmeanings.com/m/songs/view/15728/">
        http://songmeanings.com/m/songs/view/15728/
       </a>
       ) and it seems there is an interpretation of the lyrics that no one has mentioned, dealing with astronomy (not astrology, tho that is there too). You see pisces, cancer with possibly a black hole, and "magnetar" which most people look at as magnet tar pit... but "magnetar" is actually a real thing, a supernova:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetar#/media/File:Magnetar-3b-450x580.gif">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetar#/media/File:Magnetar-3b-450x580.gif
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The magnetic lines kinda look like a heart, not so much a spiral tho. That is prob just coincidence since most magnetic lines have similar shape. From a scientific/prophetic angle, It did make me think with all this CERN stuff and weird shit in space if it has any deeper meaning, those magnetars are apparently very powerful and can wipe memory from HD's worldwide if close enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       From a more perverse angle, the "heart shaped box" as well as a few other lines like "meat eating orchid" is supposed to be about a vagina (that is also a trap). Not really sure if he is trying to hint at having a thing for little girls tho.... there is stuff about hymens, baby breath and angel hair, but almost sounds like its him trying to crawl back up his mothers womb or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       The song is supposed to be about him and Courtney, but I saw the line about him being "in debt for your priceless advice"... in debt for a vice? Lol, I dunno, and then his untimely suicide is like chester from lp recently. I dunno where I'm goin with that one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Random thoughts there, but it makes me sad to think any of these people I looked up to growing up could have some sick past.

       Synchronicity. I was thinking about making a post about how blockchain tech can enable us to build a real democracy now, it's already being done

       (I only found that site because I did a google search looking for efforts to make democracy platforms from blockchain tech...I've never seen it advertised anywhere yet).
      </p>

       I haven't decided what to say though. Maybe you can think of something better than I can.

       This is the future indeed! I have decided to leave the corporate world behind to help build a new future. I'm currently doing research in blockchain governence and love the idea behind democracy.earth. There are lots of groups actively working on these ideas and it will be exciting to watch it develop over the next few years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it interesting that the ideals of democracy are thought of as the pillers of the American way of life. Yet, most of us wake up every day and go to our corporate run job never batting an eye to the fact that we work within totalitarian organization and have no say over what we get to work on. This is especially true in the tech industry where we all bow down to our glorious leaders (i.e. Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and so on) and if you stray outside lines or become to creative you are no longer welcome. By God, if they say jump, you damn well better jump!
      </p>
      <p>
       The blockchain has the real potential to unend the way we organize. Through the power of decentralization and democratic process we can now put the power into the hands of the people instead of at the whim of a few elite. This is a very exciting time to be a part of reshaping the world to work in a more collaborative way. We have all seen what the human species can accomplish when we work together. We will now have a new way to collaborate and in a truly democratic way that the world has never seen before. In fact I would argue that blockchain will enable us to have true democracy for the first time in human history.
      </p>
      <p>
       To that end, I think that it is incrediblely important for use to educate ourselves about the technologies that will help decentralize the world. It is important to fortify this technology against the elite so they don't turn it into yet another tool as they did with the internet. The elites already know this technology has the potential to topple many cartels and we are only seeing the beginning of the inevitable war against crypto. Government, banks and other centralized institutions are already showing their fears and are beginning to embrace the technology in hopes to shape it's future. This is our chance to put an end to the grip the elites have on us.

       So, I'm involved with the guys behind SecureVote. We're using the technology to power a political party/movement called VoteFlux... a foray into direct democracy, aided by facets of liquid democracy(best way to explain it).
      </p>
      <p>
       But in saying that, all digital democracy is good digital democracy.  Except MiVote, which is useless halfassed shill shit.

      <p>
       The future is here, digital democracy via blockchain is the elite killer. There's a reason you haven't seen it advertised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, a combination of using this to give people power back within their senate/congress/parliament, plus the building of industry around democratic/syndicate lines is a the biggest revolutionary game changer ever, fuck the printing press. The last revolution and it's ready to go. Could even be bloodless if the elites are smart enough to get out of the way.
