        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>These DNA analysis service for your family history is a time bomb waiting to go off.  I cannot believe that people are stupid enough to send their DNA to a company when you have NO IDEA what they will do with it.  </p>

<p>Consider the amount of profit and nefarious purposes even your basic profiles on social media site are used for.  Now multiply this by a billion.  That&#39;s what you&#39;re giving them when you pay them and send them your DNA.  Just think about all the uses we will find in the near future with complete genetic blueprints.</p>

<p>Even if the company says &quot;oh, we&#39;re really good guys.  We&#39;d never use the data to make money&quot;, what makes you think their database won&#39;t be hacked in the near future?  They say they delete all data upon service completion?  Yeah, right.  If you believe that, I have a bridge to sell that you may be interested in.</p>

<p>Furthermore, think about how fast genetic technology is progressing right now.  Do you think it&#39;ll be possible to print out a complete genetic profile in some organic matter?  Hell yes.  Some people can probably do this even now.  Do you realize what this means?  Anyone who hacks into this database can print out your DNA and plant it as evidence, anywhere, anytime.  </p>

<p>Call me paranoid.  I don&#39;t care.  I&#39;d rather be paranoid than be convicted of a rape I never committed.  You should be concerned.  You should be DEEPLY concerned.  And by all means, do not use these services.  If you are genuinely curious about your ancestry, hire a family tree researcher.  </p>

<p>Edit addendum:  It seems that most people are focusing on &quot;well, my company already has my DNA&quot; or &quot;anyone can get DNA from the trash&quot; etc.  The purpose of my post is that these companies are building the most valuable database that has ever existed in human history.  This data base will have your real name, real address, and your complete DNA blueprint.  Imagine a database with 100 million people.   You can&#39;t do that by paying people to go through 100 million trashcans.  You can do this voluntarily by offering this service.  AND MAKE A PROFIT DOING IT to boot.    Just think what you can do with this godfather of all databases as we start to get more and information from your DNA.  Are you short?  Are you blond?  Do you like spicy food?  Are you likely to be an addict or alcoholic?  What&#39;s your foot size?  etc.   The possibilities are literally endless with a database like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there a sub that consists of <em>only</em> posts like this?? I&#39;m sick of wading through all the spam links and stupid news stories that I&#39;m already bombarded with via the lamestream media (and I don&#39;t even watch the news!)</p>

<p>This is a serious question though. I like this sub, but filtering for the good stuff is a lot of work. Is there a better place for me to be reading? (I can&#39;t figure out what retcon is all about, I&#39;m not a huge fan of arguing over misheard lyrics or spelling errors. I enjoy reading CST, but it can be a little slow moving sometimes. Privacy, Hailcorporate, and anticonsumption are also along my lines of thinking.. but none of them are as active and strange as conspiracy, home to my favorite weirdos on the internet.) Appreciate any suggestions. Love and peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to poo on your parade, but your post is wholly misleading.  The Israelis never actually <em>produced</em> ethnic bioweapons, and the intention was not to affect <em>Iraqis</em>.  If you&#39;re going to link a page as a source, feel free to <em>read it first.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In November 1998, The Sunday Times reported that Israel <strong>was attempting to build</strong> an &quot;ethno-bomb&quot; containing a biological agent that could specifically target genetic traits present amongst Arab populations. Wired News also reported the story, as did Foreign Report.</p>

<p>Microbiologists and geneticists were skeptical towards the scientific plausibility of such a biological agent. The New York Post, describing the claims as &quot;blood libel&quot;, reported that the <strong>likely source for the story was a work of science fiction by Israeli academic Doron Stanitsky.</strong> Stanitsky had sent his <strong>completely fictional work about such a weapon</strong> to Israeli newspapers two years before. The article also noted the views of genetic researchers who claimed the idea as &quot;wholly fantastical&quot;, with others claiming that the weapon was theoretically possible.</p>

<p>A planned second installment of the article never appeared, and <strong>no sources were ever identified</strong>. Neither of the authors of the Sunday Times story, Uzi Mahnaimi and Marie Colvin, have spoken publicly on the matter.</p>

<p>FB is able to detect pregnancy before women themselves know, based off of behavioural changes detectable by their algorithms. They&#39;ve used this for advertising purposes to hillarious effect. </p>

<p>At a minimum, I suspect this data will be able to be used to determine information about IQ and sexual orientation. So that&#39;ll be intresting. </p>

I read an article once that discussed some marketing analyst who had been hired by Target to predict huge life changes such as births and weddings, which were deemed best times to target consumers, since this is when many large purchases are made. They figured out how to predict when a woman is pregnant, I can&#39;t remember details, it&#39;s been a while.. then they told a story about a raging father who came in to his local target absolutely furious that they were sending his precious virgin teenage daughter all these ads for baby stuff. The following day the father came back in apologizing for his behavior, the girl was actually pregnant. Busted out to her dad by Target ads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok but its nearly as easy to obtain a target&#39;s dna after the fact as prior. I dont know why you&#39;d want a huge database for nefarious purposes. Scientific purposes that could possibly be used nefariously, maybe, but against an individual I find it ridiculous.</p>

<p>Of course, eventually all humans will be sequenced at birth and genetics manufacturers will have ability to clone... People could be replaced then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A huge database of DNA can and will be traded at very high prices in the black market.  DNA is literally a complete description of you.  From how you look to what disease you are prone to.  And that&#39;s what we can do now with the limited knowledge we have.  What kind of information can we get from DNA in the future?  </p>

<p>A basic list like email and credit information even has value.  Your web browsing history is sold for money.  How valuable do you think a database of millions of complete DNA along with names and address would be worth?  Priceless in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the way I see it.  I&#39;m a middle level IT guy at an ancestry site.  The owners of the site no doubt have an interest in the site so they will want to keep it legit.  I, on the other hand, have no stake in the company.  So I leave a little security hole in the server.  I go to a remote location and hack and steal all the information.  The company will probably get sued and go bankrupt.  I will no doubt get fired.  But who cares?  I can sell a HUGE database of real names, real address, real email, and complete DNA blueprint to any pharmaceutical company in the world through the black market.  I&#39;ll be set for life.  </p>

<p>What would these pharmaceutical companies do with such a database?  Scan thru them for genetic diseases.  Market their remedy.  Screen them for cancer etc.  Find weaknesses in a certain population.  Literally, the possibilities are endless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good for you. Glad you had a good experience with them.</p>

<p>If it weren’t for the Pharma industry, I wouldn’t have taken birth control at 16 (when I didn’t need it) which inadvertently lead to my stomach lining being permantely fucked up to the point I can’t handle acids and I can barely eat.</p>

<p>If it weren’t for them I wouldn’t have been forced to take antipsychotic drugs I didn’t need, which permantely fucked me up, tbh. (Which actually was the result of a mental breakdown I had from, you guessed it, not eating or sleeping.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s funny though, I live in one of the wealthiest areas of the country, so many doctors, etc, and I have always had a bad doctor willing to prescribe me shit without being certain. I, as the patient, have to tell them no. I don’t want to take anything unless they’re sure. So to me, it’s either they’re all crooked doctors, or something else is going on. And I am convinced beyond measure that they are paid to push this shit. </p>

<p>Anyone can tell me otherwise but I’ll stand by that because why else would they want to give me a drug unless they were SURE I had the problem?</p>

<p>(Ex: with stomach issues, I complained about a myriad of things and they said it sounded like an ulcer. The NP started writing me a prescription for ulcer medication and I asked what she was doing and she said she’s gonna give me a script for ulcer medication IN THE MEANTIME while I was waiting for my endoscopy in 3 days. So you want me to fill a whole fucking script of shit, to take in the period of uncertainty, IN CASE I HAVE AN ULCER? Turns out, I didn’t have one. So I’m glad I used my own discretion.)</p>

For example, maybe they&#39;ll be able to empirically match advertising tactics to genetic predispositions, or identify people more genetically prone to becoming e.g. gambling addicts, shopaholics, etc. and exploit those weaknesses for profit via genetically targeted advertisement. </p>

<p>And of course, one of the most concerning things is how it might affect insurance and employment opportunities if this information isn&#39;t protected. See: Gattaca.</p>

<p>I say this as somehow whose DNA is in the databases of multiple corporations. My reasons were worth it for me, but I think there are valid concerns about how that information might be used against us without adequate consumer protection.</p>

<p>You bring up the point that a future &quot;hacker&quot; may plant DNA evidence, but there is ongoing researching on DNA samples and perpetrator conviction--the judicial system is not entirely convinced it is sound evidence in persecuting offenders. Plus, if you&#39;re 500 miles away from the crime scene, have a solid alibi, and no prior arrest record, or motive, then you should be safe. I don&#39;t know, maybe I am naive, but I see no reason to worry.

    <div class="md"><p>OP, I agree with you. People voluntarily giving this level of personal info just BAFFLES me. And they&#39;re not only just giving it away -- they are PAYING these companies money for the ultimate violation of privacy. I can&#39;t think of any info that is more unique and more personal to you as a human being. And it&#39;s not just you that you&#39;re exposing-- you&#39;re taking a risk that can have major consequences for all of your family members, too.</p>

<p>My friend just went to get his blood work done for his company&#39;s health insurance. If they don&#39;t agree to getting tested, then the copay for all doctors visits is twice the cost. That is a fucked up &quot;incentive&quot;, most folks can&#39;t afford that. Also, it&#39;s not just the employee-- anyone else on their health insurance plan is also forced to do the testing or pay double copays. (So spouses, and I think children over a certain age.) </p>

<p>In addition to the typical metabolic panel, they also test for 2 things that I thought were kind of interesting: testosterone and nicotine.   I know sex hormones are critical and play a huge role in how a human functions, but why only testosterone? What about estrogen? And the nicotine thing just made me laugh. Maybe the company just wants to know the odds of their employees developing lung cancer. Or maybe Marlboro wants to know if their marketing campaigns are working as intended. I&#39;ve no idea, but I wouldn&#39;t put it past them to also be testing for illegal substances as well as diseases (they claim not to, but...). If there is ever a workplace accident, they could check their backlog of yearly samples to see if their loyal employee has had a raging cocaine addiction all along, or an undiagnosed seizure disorder or whatever- basically anything that might get the company out of a liability lawsuit. No idea how they&#39;d be allowed to use those past samples as evidence, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s only a matter of time until someone tries.</p>

When these dna tests, and ancestry websites became a thing lots of users on Stormfront used them to find out their heritage only to find out they are part non-white, you know black, native, etc. Many users came to the forums distraught, because we all know 1 drop rule is legit. Some said they were nonwhite, others said the tests were Jewish lies, others said what you see in the mirror counts (ironically making a case against their racist ideology).

<p>I cannot believe that people are stupid enough</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This topic has been coming up a lot in this sub, rightfully so.  As citizens we should be careful giving <strong>ANY</strong> information to ANYONE.</p>

<p>But the massive generalization that people are &quot;stupid enough&quot; to participate in these DNA services ignores a massive amount of people who aren&#39;t, in fact, stupid.  (I am one of those people.)  You are <em>completely</em> ignoring the immediate and life-changing knowledge these companies provide for adoptees and those with inherited disorders/disease.</p>

<p>Perhaps YOU are privileged enough to afford thousand dollar genetic testing, but many of us are not.  So - for $100 bucks I discovered I carry the BRCA genetic mutation which completely alters my future healthcare decisions, as well as a rare colon disorder (which later became responsible for diagnosing one of my children after doctors missed it for years).</p>

<p>I also discovered my grandfather isn&#39;t my grandfather.</p>

<p>So perhaps the government/private corporations are going to do all kinds of nefarious things with my spit sample - hopefully citizens will rise up and prevent said things.</p>

<p>But today, in the here and right NOW?  That sample changed my life.  So... ya know... maybe go easy on the massive generalizations about those of us &quot;stupid enough&quot; to provide such samples.  Just sayin&#39;.</p>

Most online sites do not take prepaid cards because the name, address, and the card number all have to match.  Prepaid cards neither have names or addresses.  Two, you need a fake address to receive the swab test package if you don&#39;t want to reveal your real address.  Three, you&#39;ll need a fake email to request the service and receive the results.    But if you do all these things I would imagine you can do it totally anonymously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to poo on your parade, but your post is wholly misleading.  The Israelis never actually <em>produced</em> ethnic bioweapons, and the intention was not to affect <em>Iraqis</em>.  If you&#39;re going to link a page as a source, feel free to <em>read it first.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In November 1998, The Sunday Times reported that Israel <strong>was attempting to build</strong> an &quot;ethno-bomb&quot; containing a biological agent that could specifically target genetic traits present amongst Arab populations. Wired News also reported the story, as did Foreign Report.</p>

<p>Microbiologists and geneticists were skeptical towards the scientific plausibility of such a biological agent. The New York Post, describing the claims as &quot;blood libel&quot;, reported that the <strong>likely source for the story was a work of science fiction by Israeli academic Doron Stanitsky.</strong> Stanitsky had sent his <strong>completely fictional work about such a weapon</strong> to Israeli newspapers two years before. The article also noted the views of genetic researchers who claimed the idea as &quot;wholly fantastical&quot;, with others claiming that the weapon was theoretically possible.</p>

<p>A planned second installment of the article never appeared, and <strong>no sources were ever identified</strong>. Neither of the authors of the Sunday Times story, Uzi Mahnaimi and Marie Colvin, have spoken publicly on the matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not just facebook. I read an article once that discussed some marketing analyst who had been hired by Target to predict huge life changes such as births and weddings, which were deemed best times to target consumers, since this is when many large purchases are made. They figured out how to predict when a woman is pregnant, I can&#39;t remember details, it&#39;s been a while.. then they told a story about a raging father who came in to his local target absolutely furious that they were sending his precious virgin teenage daughter all these ads for baby stuff. The following day the father came back in apologizing for his behavior, the girl was actually pregnant. Busted out to her dad by Target ads.</p>
