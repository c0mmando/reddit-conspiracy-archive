<p>Dubay got pissy, when people started running with the flat earth topic a couple years ago.  He names many of the players involved in astroturfing this stuff, if you&#39;re interested in looking.  He conveniently leaves himself off the list, of course.  :)</p>

<p>It&#39;s a psy op which was born just over a couple years ago.  They used youtube and places like reddit to seed it out into the community to attract the feeble minded, and discredit &quot;conspiracies&quot;, and similar genres.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a similar tactic to what&#39;s been used to discredit the ufo phenomena.  Put out so much white noise, with hoaxers, shills, and liars, that casual (or stupid) observers can&#39;t sort out truth from lies, and discourage them from pursuing the topics at all.</p>

<p>TL;DR:  Poison the well with so much stupidity, nobody wants to be associated with anything that even resembles it.</p>

<p>I think that the point of debate is to be able to research all sides of the argument and be able to persuade and nullify the points of those who are not on your team. I would have thought that on a sub such as this, that sort of thing would be a great skill to have. </p>
