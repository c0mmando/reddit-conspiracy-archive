       Thats the funny part. I wasnt even criticising. I wanted to listen to what he had to say but came back with "youre obviously too immature from eating all your meat".... Like he had a chance to productively spread his ideas but chose to be condescending... Infuriating. But youre right.

       Personally I like the one where you ask for evidence supporting a claim and you are met with a reply along the lines of it isn't their responsibility to teach you how to Google and find evidence supporting their claim. It's like, no, friend, that really is how debate works. You make your claim and provide evidence to support your claim. Not here, though. Here if you can't connect the dots you are to much of a shill to even discuss anything with. Lolz.

       There’s no point doing research if everyone in the debate agrees what the facts are but just come to different conclusions. Nobody disagrees on the material in Mein Kampf, just the response to it.

       I've been on both ends of the whole provide my source/evidence. I understand the importance of providing a source but i guess it's a little frustrating having to do the research for someone who obviously isn't that devoted enough to the topic to do that little bit of googling. Like sure lemme dig through my internet history for weeks or months worth of research for some proof that the other person could most likely give a shit about or stop reading when they see something that goes against what they believe as fact, then it's a debate about a little thing and we're no longer talking about the main topic.  When I asked for people to provide their evidence or source for something I was curious about back when I first started getting into conspiracies and they told me to google it, I didn't think they were bullshitting me, I just looked it up for myself

       Not necessarily; a lot of it lays in the tone. I've had some unpopular opinions here before, but usually manage to come to a position where myself and the other party at least understand each other's side.

       It's when people say things disparagingly that emotions begin to fly. Keeping a cool head and beginning discussions based on a genuine desire to learn and grow has almost always led somewhere good, save for a few agitators who are only here to agitate.

       Surrounding yourself with one particular topic will effect you and the world you see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy innately is about secrecy and ill deeds, however this is not a picture of the entire world.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really helps me after interacting with Conspiracy to remind myself how awesome people can be. Try watching some of these videos and the opposite effect happens. You will feel inspired and amazed by the world.

       Thank you for this comment. Personally I've been on the conspiracy hunt since my early teens (18+ years now) and it's very easy to become overwhelmed and anxious at all the information presented here. My belief is that this is intentional. If people are going to be aware of all the negative things done let's at least overwhelm them so much that they become static in the anxiety of it all. What has helped me loads is that it has made me a much more spiritual person. It's helped me realize that our consciousness does create our reality so as individuals we have the power to overcome all the negativity by being good to others and just as importantly good to myself. It's helped me get clean of a decade long drug addiction and the mental health issues that come with such a situation. As has been said many times before, Be the light you wish to see in the world. We don't need violent revolution, that would be playing directly into their hands. We need to do nothing more than be good to one another, stop with all this divisive left right, black white, us vs them mentality and just treat each other with kindness.

       Cut it out of your life, there's so much cynicism and nihilism here and it's not healthy.  The world is an alright place, in fact it's pretty good considering how fucked up things have been in even the last few centuries.  Connect with people who are nice and be nice in return and live to a ripe old age doing the things that make you happy.

       I remember that issue with the dam in california with the damaged spillway at risk for being overtopped, and there was a huge thread here about how the govt was going to blow it and flood all the citizens of the cities below it
      </p>
      <p>
       it didnt happen, they did their best with the overflow, the rain stopped, the waters receded, the people returned from their evacuation. the local authorities and engineers did their job to the best of their ability. We dont remember the run of the mill aftermath, so we will have to see another thread predicting bullshit  malevolence by black helicopter govt again

       That's because it's been co-opted by various companies/governments/entities as a way to hide what used to actually be talked about in this sub. At some point in time, most likely pizzagate, this sub did entirely too much good work and it became a liability so spam/bots/filler content started flooding in to the point where pretty much everything is easily disregarded now because of how bad it's all become.
