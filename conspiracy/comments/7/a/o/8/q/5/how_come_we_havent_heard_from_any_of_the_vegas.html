    <div class="md"><p>Congratulations, you found a different photo that shows something (although very unclear) in one of the windows (not both). It still doesn&#39;t explain why there is zero damage in the different picture I linked to, or why said image is clearly staged and fake with people nonchalantly standing feet from cops poised for battle when the threat is already supposed to be neutralized. </p>

<p>And yeah, there&#39;s a difference between not having &quot;absolute proof&quot; of a shooting and having literally Zero evidence of any shooting such as bullet damage, images of anything being shot, or any real medical response. </p>

<p>What a categorically fake, goofy farce this entire event was. I feel sorry for people who have taken it upon themselves to attempt to convince any thinking person otherwise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You got proven wrong and ignore it! WHAT A SURPRISE! </p>

<p>The photo you linked is low quality and grainy, no shit you can&#39;t make anything out. I searched for a high quality picture, found one in one minute, and found the broken windows. </p>

<p>Also, as I said, both windows are broken. The second one is just hard to make out, but you can see the color difference at the bottom 1/2 of the window.. matching what we know to be the damage. </p>

<p>We have a video of a bullet richeting off of concrete. We have many videos of the medical response. We have videos of people being shot (at least 1 caught on camera and 1 on audio, multiple other audio clips that aren&#39;t as clear cut).</p>

<p>You need to do a better job or the Russians are going to fire you. </p>

<p>The entire hoax is so laughably transparently fake it&#39;s hilarious. Again and again people talk about all the video we have yet they can&#39;t demonstrate any of this.

<p>Thanks so much for pointing this out.  It&#39;s suspicious as fuck.  Probably a victim simulation.  There are confirmed victim simulations (vic-sims) in real terror attacks and completely fabricated ones of course.  I have a theory that even when terror actually rarely strikes america, there is always people paid to play victim roles (or completely fabricated identities who serve as propaganda accounting of events)</p>

<p>Kymberley Suchomel posted something completely innocuous on Facebook, and later died in her sleep after suffering a series of focal seizures and taking medication for a pituitary tumor. Her friend Rick (who she mentioned in said Facebook post) has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/79mnri/another_las_vegas_survivor_who_claimed_there_were/dp4budh/">just as, if not more vocal</a> than Kymberley and he&#39;s still alive.</p>

<p>Kymberley talked about organizing a survivor&#39;s group. So have <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/shootings/women-become-friends-support-system-after-las-vegas-shooting/">these women</a>, and they&#39;re all still alive. </p>

<p>There are also <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Sinconsistencies/comments/79tqtn/a_collection_not_comprehensive_yet_of_vegas">all of these witnesses</a>. See comments. Dozens if not hundreds of living witnesses who&#39;ve &quot;spoken out&quot;... Especially Gio Rios, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXBfCIukLmA">Planet Hollywood lady</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/239598518">this guy Kevin</a>, and many more.</p>

<p>Then you have the couple who died in the car accident, who hadn&#39;t spoken out at all. And then there&#39;s the drug dealer who allegedly tweeted about being chased by two gunmen, but his tweet hasn&#39;t been authenticated and there&#39;s no evidence he was even at the concert. </p>

<p>Nobody else associated with the event has died. Lots of people have spoken out, and claimed multiple shooters, and all but one or two of them are still alive. And the living witnesses <em>are</em> speaking out, through their attorneys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>another one of the many questions everyone has that nobody has addressed. </p>

<p>Have there been protesters in LV?? Or any kind of gatherings to ask for answers?? I can&#39;t believe for one second locals would&#39;ve just given up, judging by interviews and social media posts it seems most people in LV didn&#39;t believe the official story and were pretty pissed about it. </p>
