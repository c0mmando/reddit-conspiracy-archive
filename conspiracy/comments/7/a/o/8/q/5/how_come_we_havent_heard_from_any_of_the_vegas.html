       It's just part of the Hoaxer religion. They don't believe civilians are capable of doing bad things, and they believe all mass casualty events are hoaxes. To them, saying you know a victim is blasphemy. On the other hand, if you said you knew someone who was there and didn't get hurt, they'd worship you. It's a very strange cult, the Hoaxers.

       But, there are many other reasons, one of the best being the following fact: following the record-setting mass shooting in front of thousands of witnesses and hundreds of recording devices, in the most video-surveilled city on the planet, there is no video or photo of anything or anyone being shot.  Sorry, but that does not reflect real life.

       Also the windows that were supposedly shot out of the Mandalay Bay hotel is intact in this photo. You can find a picture of the hotel with the holes in the windows and match it up to this photo and they are clearly not blown out, proving that this photo was taken at a later or earlier time and is completely inauthentic.

       You said it yourself, nothing can be proven. You can't prove you exist to me. Most people (well, 99.99%) are smart enough to understand the limits of our understanding and know how to analyze things without absolute proofs. You, unfortunately, cannot.

       Congratulations, you found a different photo that shows something (although very unclear) in one of the windows (not both). It still doesn't explain why there is zero damage in the different picture I linked to, or why said image is clearly staged and fake with people nonchalantly standing feet from cops poised for battle when the threat is already supposed to be neutralized.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, there's a difference between not having "absolute proof" of a shooting and having literally Zero evidence of any shooting such as bullet damage, images of anything being shot, or any real medical response.
      </p>

       The photo you linked is low quality and grainy, no shit you can't make anything out. I searched for a high quality picture, found one in one minute, and found the broken windows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, as I said, both windows are broken. The second one is just hard to make out, but you can see the color difference at the bottom 1/2 of the window.. matching what we know to be the damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a video of a bullet richeting off of concrete. We have many videos of the medical response. We have videos of people being shot (at least 1 caught on camera and 1 on audio, multiple other audio clips that aren't as clear cut).

       Yeah, I think it's 5 now. But that's 5 out of hundreds, if not thousands of people. Yeah it's a strange coincidence that even a few have passed in the past month but these weren't necessarily family members of survivors. Those are the pimple I'd want to speak to. Let's request an AMA. LV Shooting survivor family member.

       Do you realize how many people have spoken out about this? And how few have died?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you realize that the only one of the post-shooting deceased individuals who "spoke" out has a friend named Rick who has been just as, if not more, vocal than her, and he is still alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you realize that the couple who died in the car crash never spoke out at all? And that there's no evidence that the drug dealer who tweeted about being chased by two gunmen was even at the concert?

       Thanks so much for pointing this out.  It's suspicious as fuck.  Probably a victim simulation.  There are confirmed victim simulations (vic-sims) in real terror attacks and completely fabricated ones of course.  I have a theory that even when terror actually rarely strikes america, there is always people paid to play victim roles (or completely fabricated identities who serve as propaganda accounting of events)

       If you think it was fake there aren't any and if it was real why would they want to be subjected to the kind of scrutiny the Sandy Hook and Marathon witness and victims were? 
Maybe that auto crash that killed two was also fake to allow them some privacy.

       This is an absurd assertion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kymberley Suchomel posted something completely innocuous on Facebook, and later died in her sleep after suffering a series of focal seizures and taking medication for a pituitary tumor. Her friend Rick (who she mentioned in said Facebook post) has been
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/79mnri/another_las_vegas_survivor_who_claimed_there_were/dp4budh/">
        just as, if not more vocal
       </a>
       than Kymberley and he's still alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kymberley talked about organizing a survivor's group. So have
       <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/shootings/women-become-friends-support-system-after-las-vegas-shooting/">
        these women
       </a>
       , and they're all still alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Sinconsistencies/comments/79tqtn/a_collection_not_comprehensive_yet_of_vegas">
        all of these witnesses
       </a>
       . See comments. Dozens if not hundreds of living witnesses who've "spoken out"... Especially Gio Rios, the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXBfCIukLmA">
        Planet Hollywood lady
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="https://vimeo.com/239598518">
        this guy Kevin
       </a>
       , and many more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have the couple who died in the car accident, who hadn't spoken out at all. And then there's the drug dealer who allegedly tweeted about being chased by two gunmen, but his tweet hasn't been authenticated and there's no evidence he was even at the concert.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody else associated with the event has died. Lots of people have spoken out, and claimed multiple shooters, and all but one or two of them are still alive. And the living witnesses
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       speaking out, through their attorneys.

       Have there been protesters in LV?? Or any kind of gatherings to ask for answers?? I can't believe for one second locals would've just given up, judging by interviews and social media posts it seems most people in LV didn't believe the official story and were pretty pissed about it.

       This was not a hoax, I know, because I was there, I got shot and killed several times, at least thirty rounds to my chest, I look like sieve now, lucky for me there was a lady crisis EMT at hand to give me a Tylenol and a reach around for a happy finish. The guy next to me wasnt so fortunate, he got shot sixty times in his anus, now his chocolate starfish looks like a chewed up orange.ï»¿
