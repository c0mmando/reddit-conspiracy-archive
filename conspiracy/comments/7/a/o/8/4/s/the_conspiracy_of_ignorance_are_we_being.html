        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Conspiracy of Ignorance</strong></p>

<p><strong>Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs</strong></p>

<p>Have you ever felt emptiness?</p>

<p>Maybe you have a good job, and you have many accomplishments, and you are doing what you are supposed to do.</p>

<p>On the other hand, maybe you are living from pay check to pay check, and at times, you are struggling to survive.</p>

<p>Wherever you are in the course of your life, we all have a common ground we can relate to. We all have basic needs that we need fulfilled in order to feel a sense of purpose in life. </p>

<p>Many are aware of Maslow’s Hierarchy, which states, “people are motivated to achieve certain needs and that some needs take precedence over others.” At the bottom are our physiological and survival needs such as food, water, and safety, and towards the top are our more psychological and emotional needs such as love, belonging, and even, self-actualization.</p>

<p>In the past, it was stated that one need could not be met until one was fulfilled – for example, one could not work on “esteem” if they barely had enough to eat or drink. Now, it is stated that one’s needs can fluctuate and do not necessarily need to follow the exact order of the “hierarchy.”</p>

<p>However, I tend to agree with Maslow’s original conclusions. If one is focused on survival needs, emotional and psychological needs will come later and will not be a priority. Of course, it is fluid and not exact, but you get the idea. Maslow, himself stated, </p>

<p><em>”It is quite true that man lives by bread alone — when there is no bread. But what happens to man’s desires when there is plenty of bread and when his belly is chronically filled? At once other (and “higher”) needs emerge and these, rather than physiological hungers, dominate the organism. And when these in turn are satisfied, again new (and still “higher”) needs emerge and so on. This is what we mean by saying that the basic human needs are organized into a hierarchy of relative prepotency&quot; (Maslow, 1943, p. 375).”</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html">https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html</a></p>

<p>Much of the world, unfortunately, struggles with poverty, and the poor are only getting poorer:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/global-poverty-oxfam-world-economic-forum">http://www.wired.co.uk/article/global-poverty-oxfam-world-economic-forum</a></p>

<p>Many are stuck trying to just survive, and issues beyond that may not be of concern (though I am not claiming they are not of concern!)</p>

<p>What I am trying to say is that whoever is control knows what our human needs are, and first, they will do whatever it takes to keep us at the survival level. If they cannot do that, they will keep up distracted and ignorant so that we cannot reach any type of self-actualization.</p>

<p>This post will discuss the conspiracy of ignorance, and how ‘they’ prevent us from fulfilling needs that go beyond the basics.</p>

<p><strong>Survival</strong></p>

<p>In the United States, most are getting food and water daily, even the poor. The problem is, it is not necessarily the ‘right’ food and water.</p>

<p>I hate mentioning that I’m a teacher now because I am harassed by certain groups, but I feel this is important to mention. Many of my students eat, but what they are eating is literally trash.</p>

<p>It’s one thing to eat an unhealthy meal or two, but many of my students (who are in poverty) are eating Cheetos for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and they do not know anything different.
There is this illusion that their basic survival needs are being met, but they are not. With that type of nutrition, concentration in school is difficult. There is no doubt that nutrition influences student learning:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wilder.org/Wilder-Research/Publications/Studies/Fueling%20Academic%20Performance%20-%20Strategies%20to%20Foster%20Healthy%20Eating%20Among%20Students/Nutrition%20and%20Students%27%20Academic%20Performance.pdf">https://www.wilder.org/Wilder-Research/Publications/Studies/Fueling%20Academic%20Performance%20-%20Strategies%20to%20Foster%20Healthy%20Eating%20Among%20Students/Nutrition%20and%20Students%27%20Academic%20Performance.pdf</a></p>

<p>Then, we have water. Again, we have this illusion that in America everybody has access to healthy drinking water, but maybe that is not the case:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/04/us/flint-water-crisis-fast-facts/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/04/us/flint-water-crisis-fast-facts/index.html</a></p>

<p>I’m not sure that CNN can adequately cover everything that has happened (and been ignored) with the Flint drinking water crisis, but it enough for this post. The point is, things are not as it seems.</p>

<p>So, in America, we have this “illusion” that everybody’s survival needs are being met, but I really do not think so. It’s not just the ‘poor’ who are struggling to survive. Obesity, diabetes, and other health-related issues are definitely on the rise in the United States:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/827698">https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/827698</a></p>

<p>So, if we go back to Maslow’s hierarchy, many may be stuck at basic survival (and not even know it!) That is the part that makes me upset!</p>

<p>Many are eating and drinking plenty, but they may not really be surviving. Many in America are facing severe health issues, and this is affecting our children. Some children do not even know a time where they have not experienced health issues:</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/4306369/childhood-obesity-rates/">http://time.com/4306369/childhood-obesity-rates/</a></p>

<p>Again, we have this illusion that survival needs are being met, but whether you live in a third world country or a first world country, I’m not really sure that’s even true anymore. Is there that big of a difference between starvation and morbid obesity?</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>

<p>It is clear that many on this planet do not feel safe. Many live in war zones, and many struggle to survive daily. I wanted to go in a different direction with this section, but I absolutely do not want to dismiss those who truly struggle survival daily, and there are many.</p>

<p>In America, I feel that many of the events that are happening are meant to make people feel unsafe. Whatever you believe about those events….well, that’s not really what I am writing about. First, the media clearly focuses on the ‘bad’, and fear is used for propaganda purposes:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/war_peace/media/hpropaganda.html">https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/war_peace/media/hpropaganda.html</a></p>

<p>Whether or not we are actually safe is not even the issue. Safe or not, there is plenty of fear. </p>

<p>In the hierarchy of needs, we <em>need</em> to feel a sense of safety. But even fear over ‘stranger danger’ prevents children from playing outside:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9441921/Fear-over-stranger-danger-stops-children-playing-outside.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9441921/Fear-over-stranger-danger-stops-children-playing-outside.html</a></p>

<p>When people are in a state of fear, they do not have time to think. They are more worried about surviving. A society can create fear on different levels, and it does not have to be just a physical. As a teacher, all of the school shootings have kept me on edge. Anytime I ever hear a loud bang or an unusual sound, I immediately jump to conclusions that there is something really bad happening. This fear tactic has worked well for me.
In a more general sense, fear-based media preys on people’s anxieties:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/two-takes-depression/201106/if-it-bleeds-it-leads-understanding-fear-based-media">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/two-takes-depression/201106/if-it-bleeds-it-leads-understanding-fear-based-media</a></p>

<p>From the article,</p>

<p>“News programming uses a hierarchy if it bleeds, it leads. Fear-based news programming has two aims. The first is to grab the viewer&#39;s attention. In the news media, this is called the teaser. The second aim is to persuade the viewer that the solution for reducing the identified fear will be in the news story. If a teaser asks, &quot;What&#39;s in your tap water that YOU need to know about?&quot; a viewer will likely tune in to get the up-to-date information to ensure safety. The success of fear-based news relies on presenting dramatic anecdotes in place of scientific evidence, promoting isolated events as trends, depicting categories of people as dangerous and replacing optimism with fatalistic thinking. News conglomerates who want to achieve this use media logic, by tweaking the rhythm, grammar, and presentation format of news stories to elicit the greatest impact. Did you know that some news stations work with consultants who offer fear-based topics that are pre-scripted, outlined with point-of-view shots, and have experts at-the-ready? This practice is known as stunting or just-add-water reporting. Often, these practices present misleading information and promote anxiety in the viewer.”</p>

<p>If we are always in a state of fear, then how can we move above state of fear?</p>

<p><strong>Love and Belonging</strong></p>

<p>Many (not all) of us are here. While we may hover in the survival and safety stages, most of the population seems to be resting at the level of wanting be loved, fit in, and feel good. I think this is where most of us are getting trapped.</p>

<p>Before we get into love, I feel belonging is one of the greatest, if not overlooked, manipulator in society, especially in online forums. Even on Reddit, belonging is very important. If you take a look at the front page and major subreddits from time to time, you can see that many want to feel important and like they fit in. Many want to feel as though they belong.</p>

<p>Focusing on Reddit specifically, the downvotes and upvotes promote this sense of belonging. Those who have many downvotes are ostracized at times, and those who have many upvotes feel good because they are fitting in with the ‘group think.’</p>

<p>If you have never looked into the Asch conformity experiments, it shows this phenomenon well:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments</a></p>

<p>People viewed a series of lines, and they had to answer obvious answers about those lines. To summarize, people decided to ‘conform’ with the group rather than give the right answer. They were more concerned about conforming than being right.</p>

<p>This need is well-documented, and many fall into the trap of need and belonging. There is nothing inherently wrong with wanting to feel needed or loved; however, this need has been exploited. In the past, we have had families and communities to fulfill this need, but this foundation and structure has been broken down greatly. Traditional families are just about gone:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/lynn-wardle/american-family-endangered-and-disappearing-species">https://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/lynn-wardle/american-family-endangered-and-disappearing-species</a></p>

<p>Further, one third of Americans have never even met their neighbors (including me):</p>

<p><a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/08/third-of-americans-dont-know-their-neighbors.html">http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/08/third-of-americans-dont-know-their-neighbors.html</a></p>

<p>Many of us long for that need and belonging, but family and community just are not cutting it anymore. We look to the internet world to fulfill it, through likes and acknowledgment. Unfortunately, studies show that we are more connected than ever, but we are lonelier than ever:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/the-loneliness-epidemic-more-connected-than-ever-but-feeling-more-alone-10143206.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/the-loneliness-epidemic-more-connected-than-ever-but-feeling-more-alone-10143206.html</a></p>

<p>As somebody who came from a really messed up family, I have always longed for that esteem, love, and belonging. I’m happy I can finally recognize my needs, and in some ways I realize they may not always be fulfilled. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, I do not feel most Americans are that lucky, especially those who are in their teens. They may not understand the complex needs of humans, and they are seeking validation in so many ways, whether it be through the constant selfies…or connecting with celebrities. Many teens are even referring to their favorite celebrities as mom:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/kristinharris/teens-calling-celebs-mom">https://www.buzzfeed.com/kristinharris/teens-calling-celebs-mom</a></p>

<p>The loss of true community has made many stagnant, and needs above that are not being met.</p>

<p><strong>Esteem</strong></p>

<p>Many are in limbo here. Keeping up with the Joneses is as real as it has ever been, and many are stuck in this stage. </p>

<p>In America, it seems as though nothing is ever good enough. No matter how rich, beautiful, or successful, it just is not enough. There is always something more one can have.</p>

<p>Many on this conspiracy forum seem to be here. What I mean is, we all kind of seem to be tired of this concept, and we no longer want to be part of this materialistic world.</p>

<p>For the majority in America, esteem comes from having a nice house, a nice car, and a nice whatever. We are trained this way OUR ENTIRE SCHOOL CAREER.</p>

<p>This is not to say I am criticizing anybody who has these things. It is not ‘good’ or ‘bad’ to be successful.</p>

<p>Rather, I feel that most long for success for the need to fill that sense of esteem. Many have a sense of community and love, but they do not love themselves.</p>

<p>This trap keeps people stuck. No amount of beauty products or money or awards can fill the void. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, studies show we are all going to die (lol). Yet, ‘they’ prey on that by telling us we can feel further youthful with the anti-aging creams, and eating healthy enough, and running enough, and being successful enough. In fact, there is even the promise one can live forever one day through a chip or cyborg technology (which is another conspiracy altogether).</p>

<p>This is the ‘in limbo’ of the United States, and I believe most are stuck here.</p>

<p><strong>Self-Actualization</strong></p>

<p>Most of us cannot get to this point. We are all stuck in different stages, and even if we are at this point, we occasionally have to go back to the other stages and focus on them.</p>

<p>This weekend, I was hanging out with a friend, and I brought up some controversial issues. He said that he would rather not think of them, and this is where I feel ‘chosen ignorance’ comes in. </p>

<p>Many, I believe, are just too scared to even get to this point:</p>

<p><em>All men’s miseries derive from not being able to sit quiet in a room alone.” – Blaise Pascal</em></p>

<p>Let’s just say we do have our basics needs met, including survival, love, belonging, and esteem. Well, ‘they’ have to work even harder then. They need to distract us.</p>

<p>We can be entertained to death:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amused_to_Death">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amused_to_Death</a></p>

<p>Or maybe we are working ourselves to death:</p>

<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=93364">http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=93364</a></p>

<p>Whatever we are doing, we may not actually have time to think of the meaning or purpose of life in the first place.</p>

<p>I feel that everything is made to make us ignore this need. We all get stuck on some level, whether it be living paycheck to paycheck or obsessing over losing 50 pounds. Whatever it is, many just never reach self-actualization, until they actually start suffering</p>

<p>For many, it is ignorance.</p>

<p><strong>Chosen Ignorance</strong></p>

<p>However, I’d like to argue that many have chosen ignorance (oxymoron).</p>

<p>They may see the ‘light’ of self-actualization, but perhaps it is too scary or too overwhelming, and they just do not want to go there. It doesn’t mean they never will.</p>

<p>I think many are in this state. Maybe if they drink more or work more or work out more or purchase more, they will be happy.
In fact, many are in a constant quest of happiness, something that likely can never exist in a state of impermanence:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impermanence">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impermanence</a></p>

<p>Now, I’m not quite the nihilist. Though I definitely believe in the concept of impermanence, I do think like have meaning, and while many resort to nihilism in this stage, I see something more.</p>

<p>Today in class, I actually went over this concept, and one student said,  “I think the purpose of life is to love others and help them.”
When I heard them say that, I smiled.</p>

<p>I think when we truly put others before ourselves, we see God in someway.</p>

<p>Not everybody has to agree with me, but I think that many in the self-actualization stage realize the ego is kind of a hindrance. I do not think the ‘ego’ is evil, and I’m not entirely sure it can be dispelled as many religions claim. However, I do know, if one wants to humble oneself, they must serve others:</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/4070299/secret-to-happiness/">http://time.com/4070299/secret-to-happiness/</a></p>

<p>Because when you help others, I think your soul can feel truly full,</p>

<p>Whatever you believe, I hope we can at least discuss!</p>

<p>Love is the highest value and the DNA of life itself but the purpose of life is to have fun. We are only in a tiny stage in life now where few things make sense but all will be revealed and the more one knows, the better it gets. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think when we truly put others before ourselves, we see God in someway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This here is the secret formula to evolving in life and also is the solution to all societies problems. Why? Because it leads to true wealth. For some reason, it is much more beneficial to be service orientated as a population than selfish orientated. More gets done. Most of the stuff we need we can’t do ourselves and rely on others. It is only fair to participate as a services of society. Once we get rid of money and work for free people will see the amazing and enriching  benefits VS a selfish society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We live in an empty society where horrible, dark people hold the power. They are sad and lonely, never feeling satiated or fulfilled. I used to be an atheist for almost all my life, but I believe in Sophia. This is my God and through her I feel a sense of calm. Jesus taught about Gnosticism and I&#39;m starting to believe that there are influences on us, celestial ones. If you look at the closest nebula, it looks like an eye. It looks like a human eye. Just google Helix nebula. </p>

<p>I believe huge celestial bodies, much like the sun, have an influence on us and these are our gods. They exist throughout the universe and ours is most likely one close to us. </p>

<p>Sophia is an ancient concept that existed among the time of the Pavlovians. A snake/woman idol representing energy. I believe they knew about the influence of the stars and it trickled down to us through fables and stories. Praying to my God, Sophia, helps ease my soul. She is my one true light. In her grace I will be actualized and through her I will find the strength I need to continue.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need a temple or a book to know that I feel peace when I think about her. Even in this hell on earth, my light shines under her influence. Whatever gives you hope, you hold onto that, just don&#39;t let it keep you from making logical decisions. I would never let my faith keep me from trying to see reality. </p>

<p>My faith is what I need to help me get past my fear, but it is not my moral compass or my rule book. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. I was reading up on the Gospel of Judas and it led me to Gnosticism. I always was fascinated with the stars and different celestial bodies so I just kind of married the two together. The Pavlovians I believe were the Atlanteans or the &quot;mythical race&quot;. They were the ones with the oldest known statues like the lion-faced man and the snake woman.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey so I was just reading about the Gospel of Judas:</p>

<p>*It was not written by Judas or Jesus. It claims to be based on a secret conversation between Judas ans Jesus though. Who wrote it and how did this person have access to it?</p>

<p>*It is a gnostic text (very specific phrases used similarly in other gnostic texts). The gnostics claimed that there is this secret knowledge that only some can have access to. </p>

<p>To me, I have seen the bible itself as a document all have access to, no matter their race or wealth or intellectual level. The gnostic belief ties into the Masonic belief that only few can know the truth or be enlighteneded. I disagree here.</p>

<p>*There were many books not put into the bible as we know it today. I actually wrote something on this which I will send you.</p>

<p>I think that the books that were chosen were part of God&#39;s ultimate plan (though I get why many could see this as a cop out. In a moment I will send you something I wrote on this.)</p>

<p>*It does and always comes down to whether or not one believes the bible is the true of word of God. I do but that belief did not happen over night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>John 18:20</p>

<p>“I have spoken openly to the world,” Jesus replied. “I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret. </p>

<p>Luke 22:21-22</p>

<p>21 But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table. 22 The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed. But woe to that man who betrays him!”</p>

<p>Gnosticism and Salvation:</p>

<p>&quot;Gnostics do not look to salvation from sin (original or other), but rather from the ignorance of which sin is a consequence. Ignorance -- whereby is meant ignorance of spiritual realities -- is dispelled only by Gnosis, and the decisive revelation of Gnosis is brought by the Messengers of Light, especially by Christ, the Logos of the True God. It is not by His suffering and death but by His life of teaching and His establishing of mysteries that Christ has performed His work of salvation.&quot;</p>

<p>I agree.  Based on my research, Gnosticism is another form of the original mystery religion.  Some even believe that Freemasonry teaches Gnosticism and that the G in the square and compass symbol stands for Gnosticism rather than god or Great Architect of the Universe.  I believe Gnosticism was created to divert one from the original church&#39;s teachings to another form of the mystery religion.  Being &quot;illuminated&quot; by esoteric spiritual knowledge kept secret from the masses is a common theme of the mystery religions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Learning about the evil in this world helped to solidify my faith.  It started for me with Pizzagate, when I realized all of the mainstream media did not honestly report it.  I also learned from it that people in the highest echelons of society are Satanic.  There is so much more I know now.</p>

<p>Before my spiritual awakening, I studied different religions.  I grew up a Christian.  I kept going back to Gnosticism, Hermeticism, and Christianity.  The Gnostic belief of the God of the Old Testament being the demiurge never sat right with me.  I eventually realized what it meant for Hermeticism to have connections to Freemasonry and Aleister Crowley.  Most importantly, I learned about the mysteries that connect many religions to Lucifer worship:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, Lucifer is not Satan. Gnosticism seems like the most balanced of the religions I have seen so I understand going back to it. I&#39;m glad you see the evil out there. All these things happening now, they are getting either desperate or cocky. What I do know is, once we find the truth, we can heal. I believe Lucifer is seen through many names, even Shiva. He is the first king. I think he was the king of that Ancient civilization. &#39;Atlantis&#39;. The light bringer is part of the tales of ancient India and Ancient Egypt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on the Bible:</p>

<p>I think Lucifer is Satan.  Satan is the serpent in the Garden of Eden who convinced Eve to eat the fruit of knowledge of good and evil.  Lucifer is worshipped as a bringer of knowledge.  Only the chosen were initiated into the mysteries.  To the masses, exoteric sun worship was given.  Lucifer also wanted to rise above God, just like Satan.  Satan is a fallen angel.  Lucifer fell from Heaven.  Lucifer weakens the nations, just like Satan.  Lucifer will be brought down to the Pit just like Satan.  Lucifer destroys cities, just like Satan.</p>

<p>Isaiah 14:12-17New King James Version (NKJV)</p>

<p>The Fall of Lucifer</p>

<p>12 “How you are fallen from heaven,
O Lucifer,[a] son of the morning!
How you are cut down to the ground,
You who weakened the nations!
13 For you have said in your heart:
‘I will ascend into heaven,
I will exalt my throne above the stars of God;
I will also sit on the mount of the congregation
On the farthest sides of the north;
14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds,
I will be like the Most High.’
15 Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol,
To the lowest depths of the Pit.
16 “Those who see you will gaze at you,
And consider you, saying:
‘Is this the man who made the earth tremble,
Who shook kingdoms,
17 Who made the world as a wilderness
And destroyed its cities,
Who did not open the house of his prisoners?’</p>

<p>&quot;Lucifer&quot; is used for that word in some translations of the verse I posted.</p>

<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/5459.htm">http://biblehub.com/greek/5459.htm</a></p>

<p>This is the verse where Jesus says that he is the bright morning star.</p>

<p>I think helel is an allegory referring to the fall of the king of Babylon based on the context of the verse.  I believe that the religion of Babylon was perhaps the first form of the mysteries using Nimrod, Semiramis, and Tammuz.  Nimrod was the first king of Babylon and they hold him in very high esteem.</p>

<p>&quot;That which we must say to a crowd is—We worship a God, but it is the God that one adores without superstition. To you, Sovereign Grand Inspectors General, we say this, that you may repeat it to the Brethren of the 32nd, 31st, and 30th degrees—The Masonic Religion should be, by all of us initates of the high degrees, maintained in the purity of the Luciferian Doctrine. If Lucifer were not God, would Adonay whose deeds prove his cruelty, perdify and hatred of man, barbarism and repulsion for science, would Adonay and his priests, calumniate him? Yes, Lucifer is God, and unfortunately Adonay is also god. For the eternal law is that there is no light without shade, no beauty without ugliness, no white without black, for the absolute can only exist as two gods: darkness being necessary to the statue, and the brake to the locomotive. Thus, the doctrine of Satanism is a heresy; and the true and pure philosophical religion is the belief in Lucifer, the equal of Adonay; but Lucifer, God of Light and God of Good, is struggling for humanity against Adonay, the God of Darkness and Evil.&quot;</p>

<p>What if Babylon is Atlantis? There is balance in nature. The FreeMason portion you posted speaks of this. We can&#39;t exist whilst denying our darkness.

<p>I think the fall of Lucifer was the fall of Babylon. The Babylonian king became corrupted and then his kingdom fell. Then through reincarnation as the &#39;Son of God&#39;, he cleansed himself of the evil he committed through sacrifice and death. I know this sounds silly, but I&#39;m trying to piece together these stories. They all have meaning and they all feel like puzzle pieces.</p>

<p>Gosh, if I can find that story about Egypt&#39;s death story and weighing one&#39;s heart from the actions committed against others and against the self, a heavy heart would send the person to hell or something. I&#39;ll try to find it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t heard the theory that Babylon is Atlantis before.  I think the flood and the story of Atlantis may be connected.  The similarities of the beliefs by native Americans and those across the Atlantic make me suspect their beliefs originated from a common source, perhaps Atlantis.</p>

<p>Plato was the one who wrote about Atlantis.</p>

<p>Bill Cooper - Mystery Babylon:</p>

<p>&quot;[You know, Plato—I wrote this in my book—was an initiate of Mystery Babylon and was actually initiated in the Great Pyramid in Egypt where he lay in the sarcophagus for three days and three nights. He entered as a mortal man and, according to his writings, emerged as a god given, or imparted, knowledge which with he was to guard and keep. Remember, they called themselves the “Guardians of the Secrets of the Ages.”]&quot;</p>

<p>The Bible teaches that betraying God by eating the fruit of knowledge of good and evil was what created our darkness.  The Bible also teaches that we are created in God&#39;s image making us much different from nature.  I still care about nature evidenced by me being a vegan.</p>

<p>I think a strong case can be made that the king of Babylon is symbolic of Satan who can become an angel of light.  The story is very similar to that of Satan and does not seem like it can apply literally to a king of Babylon, which is why I said it might be allegory.  He was cast down to earth after all.</p>

<p>Do you have a source on the Babylonian king being reincarnated as the &quot;Son of God&quot;?  I believe Jesus was resurrected after dying on the cross and will return one day.</p>

<p>I know how you feel with regards to them feeling like puzzle pieces.  That is why I encourage you to learn about the mysteries if you have not already.  I was lost to a great degree until I did.  The pieces will come together for you.  You will see connections, become aware of symbols, be able to see through deceptions better, etc.</p>

<p>I believe you are well aware of the tremendous amount of deception and how TPTB make good things evil and evil things good.</p>

<p>We can agree that the devil is not something we want to associate ourselves with.  :)  I think God is leading you to Him.  :)  God works in mysterious ways as they say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s for sure. I was on my last leg but now I don&#39;t feel alone anymore. The best part is, I did it on my own. No one told me to. I think that&#39;s the best way to find faith. I hope I get to see our true origins and understand the purpose of our existence. Genes hold information and some religions believe in reincarnation, notably as you know, Hinduism. I want to see if reincarnation is the reason for our ghosts in the machine.</p>

<p>If you ever saw the movie, Aeon Flux, people were being cloned and they began remembering their past lives, their original lives. What if we are like that? A mixture of old genes, finally remembering our original selves? Would explain so much!</p>

<p>It was the same for me and I agree.  :)  That is very inspiring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forgot to respond to the rest of your comment.</p>

<p>I thought the celestial alignment was so rare that it might have been the sign.  I tend to think it was not the sign.</p>

<p>I believe we are dooming ourselves to enslavement under the New World Order.  I believe that TPTB would not allow themselves to go extinct.  They only care about us if they benefit from us.  I do feel that we are close to a breaking point.  Technology is accelerating everything very quickly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know. Other sources say Christ was just a messenger. I have to look more at historical documents. Jesus did exist, but not as Jesus Christ. We may not even know if Jesus was a man. There&#39;s a lot hidden and I intend to find out. Look at the Gospel of Mary, another Gnostic document. It doesn&#39;t show Christ thought of Himself as the song of God, rather that we are children of God. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, the way you format posts like these is just right for those of us who run from a wall of text. I agree that many people are stuck on the &quot;Love and Belonging&quot; stage. Many people give up their identity  to fit in with whatever group will accept them and instead of developing as a person, they become stagnant to maintain acceptance. For example, say you like person A over here, but you have a group in which you belong. The group may say person A is to be avoided, he/she is a conspiracy theorist with crazy ideas! Fear of being ostracized will keep you with the group in many cases, while also keeping you from applying any critical thinking to what may be interesting perspectives. Belonging is a double edged sword, to belong in some cases is to conform away from thinking and growing intellectually and emotionally. Thanks again for a great post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a beautiful post.  &lt;3</p>

<p>I am tremendously grateful that God has blessed me with such a great family and great health, which allowed me to automatically fulfill the physiological level, the safety level as well as some of the other levels to a degree.</p>

<p>It took me about 29 years to realize that for me personally, I cannot fulfill the love level without having a relationship with a woman.  I was content to live alone.  I thought trying to have a relationship would cost me too much of what little time I had.  Since I woke up, I now see that love in its many forms is the light of the world.</p>

<p>I have never really cared that much about belonging.  I am the type of person who wouldn&#39;t have chosen the answer to conform with the group rather than choosing the right answer.  One time, in a college class, my fellow students and I were supposed to take sides on an abortion debate.  The teacher didn&#39;t give us this option but being the rebel that I am, I sat in the middle because I felt I was not informed enough to take a side.  Even if I do not belong anywhere amongst my peers, I belong to God.  :)</p>

<p>Esteem is my weak area.  I am very critical of myself and I don&#39;t conform to the culture when I do not agree with it in my heart.  I feel that it is hard for me to have esteem without becoming arrogant because of this separation.  I despise arrogance so I refuse to be arrogant.  I am very objective and analytical so I am only confident if I know something for a fact or feel I am well informed.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t particularly care about career success as in my field, I feel it is based on trying to please higher ups rather than doing what is right.  The work that I do is not what I feel is important in life either though I think it could be a skill for me to someday use to make peoples&#39; lives better.</p>

<p>Self actualization is something I have begun to pursue in the year since I woke up.  I am held back by needing to work, lack of time, irresponsible sleep amounts and schedule, and lack of energy.  It takes a lot of money to be able to retire so I have a lot of work ahead of me so the time I can spend will be very limited.  The sleep thing is something I can change if I want to make the change enough.  I hope that the lack of energy thing can be fixed by getting all of the vitamins and minerals that I need as well as changing the things that I come in contact with to be more natural.  All this while continuing my search for the truth.  :)</p>

<p>It makes me angry that people do not even have a chance at reaching beyond certain levels.  I am not very materialistic, which will allow me to give more to others.</p>

<p>I admire how you long for starting your own family to fulfill the different levels better than your parents did.  I really hope that you and others can fulfill their need for self actualization.  :)</p>
