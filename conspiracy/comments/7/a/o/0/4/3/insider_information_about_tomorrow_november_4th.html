Let&#39;s entertain the notion that those statements were 100% correct; they all of a sudden have a weapons stockpile and cross-country organization?

<p>Going from a total of 3 possible guns we didn&#39;t see to an organized nationwide army with stockpiles doesn&#39;t make sense. And of course they&#39;re trannies </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t make it false. And the original source is an American comedian that went undercover with Antifa (did you read the story?)</p>

<p>They specifically stated that they are stockpiling weapons. And they already have cross-country organization.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Your theory is that Russia created this video because they hate gays and Antifa has some gays so they want everyone to go kill Antifa so they&#39;ll get a few gays that are also members?</p>

<p>And of course they&#39;re trannies</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah dude, I watched the video that shows the same 3 pieces of footage from a weeks-long undercover operation. I pointed out it&#39;s a Russian-ran site because state propaganda like BBC or MSM here. Not to mention, it&#39;s a post from a conservative commentator/comedian, so they&#39;re going to pick the most out-there footage to show people who share the same belief patterns they do. It&#39;s literally right-wing propaganda (note the anti-liberalism rhetoric behind the director when he&#39;s introduced (coupled with the whole, state propaganda site thing). For all the talk about guns and organization, a 5 person group meet-up for a Facebook group with the same footage of a guy being handed a s pocket knife isn&#39;t necessarily looking like organized terrorist actions to me. Granted, they did have some weapons on them, but nothing but words when it came to the guns. And even the guy talking about his rifle, he sounds like he doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about. For all we know this video was forged, and the lack of any substantial evidence has me leaning that way. </p>

<p>How have I lost?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You asked how the Second Amendment has been limited.  I showed you, and so you went and reframed the discussion to when has the Second Amendment been limited <em>lately</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve &quot;lost&quot; simply because I don&#39;t have the same point of view as you. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, you&#39;ve &quot;lost&quot; because you are flatly wrong.  This is not an issue of how you feel about it versus how I feel about it.  You tried to imply that the Second Amendment hasn&#39;t been limited.  You are wrong and have been shown as much.</p>

<p><strong>That</strong> is why you don&#39;t want to &quot;get into the discussion&quot; that you started.</p>

<p>Now, watch this next sentence I&#39;m going to quote to see what a weasel you become when you&#39;re wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t see anywhere in the 2nd that states that gun sales should be a free and unregulated black market for anyone man, woman, or child that wants one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the sale is free and unregulated, why would it be &quot;black market?&quot;  It wouldn&#39;t be.  You&#39;re attempting to add weight to your argument by using scary words like &quot;black market.&quot;  That&#39;s all you&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>As to this point:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t see anywhere in the 2nd that states that gun sales should be a free and unregulated</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you&#39;re flatly wrong.  You would know this if you read it.  Here, it&#39;s right there in the Amendment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>shall not be infringed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shall not be infringed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe next time calm down a bit and don&#39;t get so offended when someone asks for information on something you are claiming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait, that&#39;s exactly what <em>you</em> have done.  Epic projection.  To quote another user&#39;s advice to you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You could have said &quot;I&#39;m a fucking retard, ignore me.&quot; You would have saved yourself a lot of typing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I&#39;m going to start with suggesting you calm down a bit when someone is asking you to present your case. I&#39;m not going after you personally and if you feel that, I am sorry you do. It isn&#39;t my intent. Let&#39;s start first with what I asked. I asked how the 2nd amendment has been continually undermined. I didn&#39;t ask how it has been limited. Semantics are important. I am guessing that you are using the words interchangeably to mean the same thing. That&#39;s OK. I don&#39;t see how the regulation of gun sales does limit the right of a person to own arms. It seems like the original gun act was an attempt to keep track of gun sales. I, personally, don&#39;t see that as an attempt to limit or undermine. I&#39;m guessing that you do. That your right. I then asked for more of your case and your presented me with your second piece of evidence regarding the legality of purchasing machine guns. This is a grey area for me. On one hand I think that there isn&#39;t any real reason to say one gun is worse than another so why place the restriction on one gun. But, on the other hand illegal gun sales of all guns should be banned, in my opinion, so I&#39;m a bit lost on the whole point of that one. (the government&#39;s point and not your point in submitting it as evidence to your claim) Accepting the resolution as what it is, one could ask if it truly infringed upon one&#39;s rights to bare arms. You can still buy a machine gun. It might be cost prohibitive, but it is still available. Now, let&#39;s touch on my use of black market. Again, I&#39;m sorry if you took it as me trying to make it look lurid or scandalous. That wasn&#39;t my intent. I&#39;m simply using the term in an economic sense that black markets are open, free, and devoid of taxation/subsidies and other external regulations. Thing is, though, I find it hard to understand people who argue that the 2nd amendment cannot in any way be adjusted from its original stated parameters under the argument that the constitution was written how it was written and meant to be written and shouldn&#39;t be adjusted in any way simply because of the fact that the second amendment isn&#39;t part of the original constitution. It was the second change to the document that so many people believe should not and cannot be adjusted. Support for the second amendment in itself is support for the belief that the constitution can be adjusted and tinkered if we see fit. That, though, is a whole other can of worms they I don&#39;t intend to open. I&#39;m sure constitutional scholars could argue about that until the cows come home. Not me, though. I&#39;ll just finish up by saying, I hope you enjoy your weekend and be careful of that &quot;civil war&quot; they is supposed to be scheduled to break out today. Stay safe and good day, sir. </p>

<p>&quot;Federal authorities have been warning state and local officials since early 2016 that leftist extremists known as “antifa” had become increasingly confrontational and dangerous, so much so that the Department of Homeland Security formally classified their activities as “domestic terrorist violence,” according to interviews and confidential law enforcement documents obtained by POLITICO.</p>

<p>Since well before the Aug. 12 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned deadly, DHS has been issuing warnings about the growing likelihood of lethal violence between the left-wing anarchists and right-wing white supremacist and nationalist groups.</p>

<p>Previously unreported documents disclose that by April 2016, authorities believed that “anarchist extremists” were the primary instigators of violence at public rallies against a range of targets. They were blamed by authorities for attacks on the police, government and political institutions, along with symbols of “the capitalist system,” racism, social injustice and fascism, according to a confidential 2016 joint intelligence assessment by DHS and the FBI.&quot;</p>

<p>It is painfully obvious that he is a <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/10/exclusive-report-richard-spencer-confirmed-deep-state-plant/">fed</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;Media darling and Alt-Right leader Richard Spencer ran his own Discord chat server, where he required that Alt-Right members submit photographs and detailed personal information about themselves, before they were allowed to join the group planning the Charlottesville attacks.</p>

<p>We have already exposed how Spencer’s close friend and fellow Charlottesville rally organizer Jason Kessler watched while the terrorist attacks were planned on his personal Discord server.</p>

<p>On October 8th, revealed that Richard Spencer employed his close friend, and suspected pedophile, “TheBigKK” to gather data and require photographs of everyone connected to the Charlottesville rally on August 12th. Spencer required these measures to be taken in order to extract EXIF geotagging data from the images, so that he could obtain the home addresses of his recruits...</p>

<p>Richard Spencer is not a conservative. He has praised Bolshevism, and has called himself the “Karl Marx of the alt-right”. His mentor is a confused, retired academic, named Paul Gottfried. Gottfried says that the United States is no longer a republic, and is Nietzschean social Darwinist, who is a disciple of Marcuse and has been described as a “right-wing proponent of the Frankfurt school.”</p>

<p>The robotic talking points that Spencer reads off in mainstream media interviews come from his boss, William Regnery II, founder of the National Policy Institute. While college drop-out Richard Spencer pretends to “run” NPI from the basement of his mother’s 3 million dollar condo in Whitefish, Montana, it is really Regnery who is calling the shots.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Rouge Antifa members have approached authorities and alerted them that Antifa IS stockpiling weapons such as rifles, pistols, shot guns and other deadly weapons. They WILL be carrying these weapons on their persons tomorrow&quot;</p>

<p>There is <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/405081-inside-antifa-undercover-video/">video</a> already showing this:</p>

<p>&quot; In another frame of the video, she says, “I’ve got a handgun. Yeah, we got two AK’s coming.” Then the footage cuts to her saying, “Do what you gotta do.”...</p>

<p>Crowder’s footage also includes audio recording of an alleged Antifa supporter who goes by the pseudonym Clark, saying the difference between Antifa and other activist groups is a “willingness to respond with violence.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not huge into reading too much into these types of things but I work for a democratic orginization that fundraises for grassroot involvement and candidates. Around late august I spoke with a woman who I usually deemed irrelevant and off, like a small portion of other people I end up speaking to, who didn&#39;t want to get involved bc all her time and effort was being put into a &#39;secret&#39; orginization where they&#39;re arming their members and gathering for a huge protest that was being planned for the furure. Their main objective was to fight back against fascism and the Trump agenda. She spoke of an upcoming civil war and protests and now with these rumors I&#39;m just like &#39;uhhhhh&#39;.

<p>I.e. TPTB have effectively tricked you into believing that anyone wanting a revolution is instantly and effectively labeled Antifa, a name which by design has already become synonymous with being either state/soros sponsored or anti-white troublemakers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is what The-SaltLife, the creator of the post write:
I don&#39;t care if you don&#39;t believe me. It doesn&#39;t affect me at all because I already know this information to be true as I was told this by people who work in important places.<br/>
Tomorrow Antifa will be protesting in major cities across the U.S, including but not limited to Birmingham Alabama, Tuscaloosa Alabama, Atlanta Georgia, Philadelphia PA, San Francisco California and other locations.<br/>
Rouge Antifa members have approached authorities and alerted them that Antifa IS stockpiling weapons such as rifles, pistols, shot guns and other deadly weapons. They WILL be carrying these weapons on their persons tomorrow, so I warn everyone and anyone to STAY AWAY from the protesters.<br/>
Additionally, aside from the weapons, Antifa will be paying children to ride bicycles around the protest groups to keep law enforcement and authorities at bay.<br/>
There will be a massive event tomorrow. It will be a false flag set up to stir national outrage.<br/>
DO NOT BELIEVE IT.<br/>
To those who live in Birmingham Alabama, your protesters will be flown into Georgia&#39;s main airport and bused to Birmingham. Keep an eye out for the buses.<br/>
Be safe.</p>

<p>Dude, I&#39;m basing it on the fact that you tried to pass off straight right wing propaganda as 100% fact.</p>

<p>It is painfully obvious that he is a <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/10/exclusive-report-richard-spencer-confirmed-deep-state-plant/">fed</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;Media darling and Alt-Right leader Richard Spencer ran his own Discord chat server, where he required that Alt-Right members submit photographs and detailed personal information about themselves, before they were allowed to join the group planning the Charlottesville attacks.</p>

<p>We have already exposed how Spencer’s close friend and fellow Charlottesville rally organizer Jason Kessler watched while the terrorist attacks were planned on his personal Discord server.</p>

<p>On October 8th, revealed that Richard Spencer employed his close friend, and suspected pedophile, “TheBigKK” to gather data and require photographs of everyone connected to the Charlottesville rally on August 12th. Spencer required these measures to be taken in order to extract EXIF geotagging data from the images, so that he could obtain the home addresses of his recruits...</p>

<p>Richard Spencer is not a conservative. He has praised Bolshevism, and has called himself the “Karl Marx of the alt-right”. His mentor is a confused, retired academic, named Paul Gottfried. Gottfried says that the United States is no longer a republic, and is Nietzschean social Darwinist, who is a disciple of Marcuse and has been described as a “right-wing proponent of the Frankfurt school.”</p>

<p>The robotic talking points that Spencer reads off in mainstream media interviews come from his boss, William Regnery II, founder of the National Policy Institute. While college drop-out Richard Spencer pretends to “run” NPI from the basement of his mother’s 3 million dollar condo in Whitefish, Montana, it is really Regnery who is calling the shots.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How have I lost? I don&#39;t see anywhere in the 2nd that states that gun sales should be a free and unregulated black market for anyone man, woman, or child that wants one. I&#39;ve &quot;lost&quot; simply because I don&#39;t have the same point of view as you. That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t want to get into the discussion. As for &quot;moving the goal post,&quot; you said it was a continuation so I assumed that meant there had been multiple infractions of the undermining of the 2nd. Hence, I asked for the next exhibit. Maybe next time calm down a bit and don&#39;t get so offended when someone asks for information on something you are claiming. </p>
