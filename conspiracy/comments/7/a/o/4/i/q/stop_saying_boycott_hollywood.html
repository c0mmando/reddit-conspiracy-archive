       When people say ‚ÄúBoycott Hollywood‚Äù, it seems what they mean (or how it can definitely be interpreted) is ‚ÄúBoycott the Hollywood entertainment industry!‚Äù since this of course is where a lot of the sexual criminality is taking place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The honest truth is that this in no way is ever actually going to happen.  Hollywood is absolutely
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       going to get boycotted.  People like/love the entertainment industry
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       too much.  People saying ‚ÄúBoycott Hollywood!‚Äù need to make sure and differentiate the sexual criminality taking place in Hollywood that absolutely SHOULD be done away with on the one hand, and the music, film, and television entertainment aspect of Hollywood that ultimately most people
       <em>
        don‚Äôt
       </em>
       actually want anything to happen to (whether they admit it or not).
      </p>
      <p>
       Do away with the sexual deviants?  Absolutely.  Cannot agree more.
      </p>
      <p>
       People need to make sure they specify what
       <em>
        aspect
       </em>
       of Hollywood they want done away with, however, because just saying ‚ÄúBoycott Hollywood!‚Äù is ultimately an empty statement that almost
       <em>
        no one
       </em>
       is going to move forward with.
      </p>
      <p>
       People love their movies - and justifiably so.  Movies and good art are indeed cool and inspiring and awesome.  The entertainment industry
       <em>
        shouldn‚Äôt
       </em>
       in any way be done away with.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shit criminal aspect of it definitely
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be done away with, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, again, people need to specify and not just say ‚ÄúDo away with Hollywood!!‚Äù as if they‚Äôre calling for the downfall of the entire entertainment industry en toto.  That‚Äôs a ridiculous assertion and that will absolutely
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do away with the
       <em>
        shit
       </em>
       aspect of the entertainment industry.  Sure.  Yeah.  Easier said than done, but I don‚Äôt disagree with that part.  People need to specify that, however.  Otherwise the whole ‚ÄúBoycott Hollywood!‚Äù movement comes across as empty and is a statement that means nothing and will do little.

       See?  This is exactly what I'm talking about.  How many comments have been made just like this one?  How many people who on one hand yell and scream for "all sexual deviants to die!  Fuck Hollywood!" and yet on the other say "Oh but please, please,
       <em>
        please
       </em>
       don't take away my 'X, Y, Z' show!!  I
       <em>
        love
       </em>
       that show!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying
       <em>
        you're
       </em>
       doing this, mind you.  I'm just using your comment as a launching off point for saying what I've seen from others and how it's not "ALL OF HOLLYWOOOOOOD!" that should be brought down, but a specific
       <em>
        aspect
       </em>
       of it that definitely needs to get brought down.
      </p>
      <p>
       People need to specify more clearly - and if we do, then we can fight against sexual deviance in Hollywood
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       also still keep the good aspects of the entertainment industry that many like/love intact.

       Yeah...You're going to go exactly nowhere in that way because there's absolutely nothing wrong with visual and audial arts, and recommending that "No one listen to any visual or audial art!" is...is simply not going to happen.

       I listen to music every day, by real musicians. I go to concerts, to see/hear real performing artists. I go to the ballet, I go the the opera, and I go to the theater.

       I don't watch TV. I don't go to the movies. And, I sure as shit don't listen to that nonsense that they call "popular" music. It is propaganda and kid-fuckers. That might be funny and entertaining to you, but I am not into that shit.

       You assume and it does nothing but make you sound more and more stupid.  Whatever "culture" you think you're involved in is obviously not helping your critical thinking skills because you couldn't be more incorrect about your assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't even understand that the "real musicians" that you listen to, you know about BECAUSE of that very industry you vilify so blithely.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...You're just...not thinking right.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to be a critical thinker - and you're

       being that.

       Anyway.  I have a definite feeling this particular dialogue will likely go nowhere and your next response will likely be some sort of inane attempt at qualifying your worth as a "cultured human being!", so it might be a better idea to just stop this particular thread here.

       It has nothing to do with culture. It has to do with training. I am a professionally trained and educated musician. Everyone surrounding me are visual/performing artists. We appreciate and support each others artistry. We don't appreciate shit kid-fucking propaganda passed off as "art." It is insulting to the men and women that devote their entire existence to their art form.

       lol.  The sad and ironic thing about this statement on your part is that I‚Äôm a professional and educated artist - and I bet you might have even come across me and/or my work before - so your continued assumptions, as I said above already, simply keep making you look stupider, and stupider, and

       Indeed, I'm going to stay right here, as a constant reminder, that people should encourage everyone they know to boycott EVERYTHING Hollywood. Say it loud, say it proud. If you support anything Hollywood, you support kid-fucking innuendo like yours. Every dollar you spend, a kid loses their innocence to peditors.

       The world I live in and support does not fuck children. Pedowood does. There is a difference. Why do want to support people fucking children? That is such an odd thing for someone to openly support. Whatever floats your boat, I guess. I'm just saying: think of the children, but don't fuck them.

       No, children are not involved. Professionals require training and education. Kids don't have that, and hence aren't part of that. Kids are, however, a BIG part of Hollywood. There is a difference.

       You support things touched by pedos and abuse. What makes your choices more righteous than someone else's choice to go see a movie? It doesn't. Here is the problem...Hollywood is so vast that a simple boycott won't work. Everyone in Hollywood needs to come forward and air all the laundry and clean house. They give zero shits about a boycott of music, movies and TV. They have many other avenues of income and influence.

       No, you're not. You won't even boycott the few things that you partake in that are known to have abuse within. You simply aren't going to effectively boycott anything with as much commitment as you seem to have for not seeing the bigger picture.

       I have people custom make my clothes. When I eat out, I choose to eat at local-family eateries. When I travel, I don't do anything touristy. I do my own thing, and support the locals. Clearly, we have different ways of living our lives.

       Wait, you said boycott ALL OF HOLLYWOOD... now you say just to boycott what you can. Lmfao. That isn't how an effective boycott works. What you mean is... You will boycott things of Hollywood that won't hamper your everyday life in order to do so. Good job. That is sure to be effective. Might as well say "hey, I won't give you money to pay your light bill but I will pay your gas bill" either way..YOU ARE STILL SUPPORTING HOLLYWOOD! Screaming for a boycott that is ineffective is equal to doing nothing

       Boycott all of Hollywood. Obviously, some people can't avoid everything. That doesn't mean that everything else is ineffective. The most effective means is to talk to strangers and to spread the word to boycott everything Pedowood and Propaganda related. You may think a boycott is ineffective, but people are already leaning that direction. You know why? Because they focus on kid-fucking related themes. Normal people aren't into that shit. Give people permission to boycott, and they'll do it. Remind them that every movie they go to, a kid gets fucked in the ass. That works. People don't want to pay to have someone fuck a kid in the ass. They feel guilty.

       People are leaning to boycott what they perceive things to be. What they don't get is that it is much more than entertainment. Boycott means to remove from anything related. That isn't possible in this case. A lot of people don't pay for movies and music anymore... You think it has slowed anything down? Nope. For a true boycott you don't pick and choose which services you unsubscribe to you...you banish all. Can't do that with Hollywood because their hands are in everything.

      <p>
       Boycott does not mean "anything related." It is an expression of protest. And, I doth protest. You have no say in how that happens. I can protest as much, or as little as I want.

       Nope. You're wrong. People can boycott anyway they want to protest. You have no say where it start, nor where it stops. That is not how boycotts works. They do, however, work. You don't need to take part. It is a free country, and you are allowed to support those child abusers anyway you see fit.

       Again, you fail to understand the meaning of the word boycott. You say boycott Hollywood which means all of Hollywood not just a little bit. Abstain means to not. No gray area. You don't abstain from Hollywood derivatives. No matter what you say...the very means that you are using to say it is brought to you by the very entity that you claim to boycott. Sorry, doesn't work like that.

       It works however I say it works. That is how personal protest goes down. If I wanted to boycott only movies, that's cool. If I wanted to boycott more, that would be cooler.

       You're support Pedowood, and you say a boycott is pointless. Everyone, there's nothing to see or do here. but, child abuse is a serious thing. Diddeling little kids is fucked up. And, you're arguing with me about internet service and who pays for what. You are enabling kiddy sex with adults. I am going to remind you often, because it seems you forget.

       I never said a boycott was pointless. What is said is that it isn't possible to effectively boycott Hollywood due to their wide reach. The fact that they are connected to so many every day things.

       I say those things because those acts are vile. Oddly, it is something that you need be constantly reminded of in every post: kid fucking, and the act of raping their innocence is not OK. If you support the people fucking them, then you are part of the problem. It bothers me, so I feel the need to say it. If you don't like it, then boycott Hollywood, or at the very least, stop justifying their existence.

       No one said anything about you supporting what u do. Nor did anyone say don't support those who have been ABUSED. Your initial comment came of as that you already don't support Hollywood and you have placed support in the things you mentioned. I replied that abuse takes place there too so it is no better than the Hollywood that you denounce.

       Again, you are missing the point. A point in which I'm tired of trying to get you to see. Perhaps no one you support is under 18...good for you. But the overall bigger picture of those avenues that you support all lead back to an industry that does abuse. Regardless of it you know someone or not. Book a concert....who funds it? What ticket agent? The venue? The agents?
      </p>
      <p>
       Theater show...same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Music...the goal there is to go main stream.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enjoy your night. Fool yourself that you are making a difference while in reality you are supporting abuse and Hollywood.

       When we book a concert hall, the venues are almost entirely city/government run. We fund the costs, which is through non-kid fucking non-profits. Classical musicians don't go mainstream like you think. The venues sell the tickets through their box-office at a contractually agreed upon percent. Hollywood is not part of it.

       The performers don't have bottled water? I have been to events you speak of. With the exception if classical concerts...beverages are served at plays. But that was on Broadway... Your events may not. You are really sticking it to Hollywood tho...even tho most of the equipment you will use to have the event is tied to Hollywood lol

       Nope, wrong again. Classical music doesn't rely on Hollywood equipment. Our instruments come from makers, whom most of us know personally. It's acoustic, so...

       Classical music doesn't use sound reinforcement. That practice is shunned. Sound reinforcement is shit. The hall is meant to reverberate the sound. You are supposed to feel the music, not have it blare into your ears.

       Seek help. Because now you are spouting nonsense about the very areas you say that you partake in. Run from it all you want but you are in the clutches of Hollywood as are the rest of us. The disc you record music on? You make those? For ballet and plays you would use a sound system. Unless you put on those shows in your garage...which you very well may from the way you express yourself. What theater shows do u see? Who wrote and produced the script and the music?

       No, the concert venues don't put anything on in the way that you think. The venues are usually city run, you know, for the good of society, and the space is contracted out by different organizations. The halls are very expensive to rent out. I don't have anything to do with Broadway, or entertainment shows that lead back to Hollywood. High art forms are not "entertainment" for the masses.

       No. Long dead people do not have copyright. It varies by country, bit no one pays a penny for Tchaikovsky. And it doesn't have anything to do with your Pedowood. Modern ballet is a thing; popular ballet is classical. Words are confusing, I know, you are having a hard time.

       Every single one of those are riddles with either physical, sexual, emotional or mental abuse. Basically, you are condemning the mainstream but condoning the smaller scale all because it doesn't SEEM Hollywood to you. Well, most of those acts are hoping for their big break....into HOLLYWOOD.

       You gonna pay that cable bill next month? Or the internet? Of course you are lol. Right into Hollywood's pockets...you can't escape them no more than the next person. You are delusional and part of the problem not the solution. And you certainly like to use then word kid in conjunction to fucking. It is disturbing. You could refer to it in the technical form - rape or molestation. For someone who claims to be so above it all...you sink to the basement in your choice of words.b

       No, I don't have to pay either the cable or the internet. It is paid for me by outside sources. I am only tangentially involved, in a way that I have no influence. If I did, I would cut it off in a heartbeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       I call it how I see it. Every dollar you knowingly spend on Pedowood, a kid gets abused, mostly likely in the ass. Call it rape, call it molestation, call it whatever you want. If you are not part of the solution, then you are part of the problem. The kid-fucking problem.

       Hey genius... You are using the very internet that is paid for right now. Therefore you benefit from it. You may not physically pay the bill but it is paid FOR YOU. Get it? Same as rent or water...it gets paid in your interest. You use it. The money is paid for you to use. No you, no payment. If they didn't pay it...you would. You aren't going to not have internet. Esp not in the business you claim ur in...a cell phone would be pretty mandatory too. But it's OK...we all can see that you are full of shit. You don't even know the basics of things you claim to be in the middle of.

       But, the thing is, I don't use it. And no, if I had to pay for it, I wouldn't. Furthermore, there is free wifi all around me. And, no a cell phone is not mandatory. Many people don't use cellphones. Forget to turn one off, in a rehearsal, and your ass is grass. But, you don't need to worry about any of that. You are just butt hurt that none of your points apply. Now, pull-up your pants, and move along.

       Sure.  If you want to say/do that.  Then sure.  That's up to you.  If you really mean that, however, (and I wouldn't be surprised if you actually don't, and you in fact watch movies like most normal people), then you are in EXTREEEEMELY dismally small company in not being someone who's viewed films.  The vast majority of humanity absolutely digs movies and moving pictures, so disregarding the industry that has been #1 in that area from the start is not the way to go and won't solve much.

       to a great extent, but there's a lot of film and television that doesn't have that.  Don't do away with the aspects that aren't implicated in the criminality.

       Watching others who are very adept at any particular sport or activity (sport or non-sport oriented) is often
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       educational and can help one who is learning improve significantly in their own craft, so watching others who know what they're doing can be a very, very worth while thing to do and shouldn't be discouraged offhand.

       Well, I think it's important to effectively specify who "they" is.  The big money changers in Hollywood?  Yeah.  To a great extent, that might not be a horrible idea.  However, the industry is a gordian knot of very intertwined interests at this point, and navigating through it in a manner that keeps money out of their hands on one end, while still allowing one to continue engaging in worthy art on the other (whatever it might be) is no easy task, to be sure.

       Holly wood in ancient lore was the wood that was preferable in wand making. Wands were used by witches and wizards to caste spells and to 'enchant' people. Usually for nefarious reasons. It gave the wand holder the ability to put the target under the influence and under their control.

       It goes far beyond materialistic and physical crimes but, more into the realm of the spiritual war going on. The black arts manipulate people through 'Hollywood' and it should be boycotted all together en masse. We are in the great awakening and the veil is falling.

       Hardly.  If you want to boycott Hollywood, then so be it.  The entertainment industry will absolutely not go anywhere, however -
 nor should it.  Various aspects of Hollywood should be boycotted, true, but art in general - visually, audially, etc - shouldn't.

      <p>
       No one does that en toto - nor should they - and unless you haven't watched any tv or film or listened to any music whatsoever in, say, the last 10 to 20 years, then YOU don't even do that either.  I haven't owned a television in coming on TWENTY years, and yet I wouldn't be oblivious enough to say that I don't watch films, etc.  Again, it's part of the human experience to experience visual and audial arts, and there's nothing wrong with that.

       Movies and TV are shit. A shit product.  There are less than 4 good movies a year.  Try watching an award winning documentary without a spoon fed narrative in it...it doesn't exist....then once you see it in documentaries you see it in almost all tv and movies.

       I wouldn't disagree with this.  Doesn't seem that the 1-3 films per year that are worthy and aren't tainted with scandal should be done away with just because so many others do suck, however.

       I see the exact opposite.   Why let this media power center exist for 3 good movies a year?  The prize is not worth all the  poison. Start a new hobby or new family activity. ..you wont miss all this crap programming after you cut it out of your life.  Try it for 2 months and see.

       lol.  It's not about me "trying" or "not trying" it.  I haven't owned a television in coming on nineteen years.  I know.  My point is that pretty much EVERY form of entertainment you/everyone engages in is connected to Hollywood in one way or the other, and anyone who clamors for "Hollywood to go DOOOOWWWWN!!" probably doesn't really understand what they're actually asking for.
      </p>

       Not just entertainment. That is what people don't get. Hollywood backs a lot. Investors in food, clothes, sports etc. Buy Nestle? Support Hollywood. Buy soda? Support Hollywood. Any food item that has ever promoted a movie..that's Hollywood. Those adorable Band-Aids with Disney characters... That's Hollywood. Cute characters on kids clothes...that's Hollywood. Disney Parks and resorts...that's Hollywood. Fast food that has promotions... That's Hollywood.

       The whole industry has declined significantly in the last 10 years. Almost everything I watch or listen to is at least 10 years old. So it's quite easy to boycott the whole industry in my opinion. Besides a lot of harmful propaganda and brainwashing is injected into TV Shows and movies. They do not even try and hide it these days. Whether it's sexualising everything or promoting racism and racial stereotypes or promoting individualism, dumbing down of documentaries  and consumerism i think for the most part Hollywood is doing more harm than good. We need the entertainment industry to become more beneficial and more educational and more reflective of positive moral values to help build a more ethical and prosperous society.

       It‚Äôs likely that whatever you watch that you

       like COMES FROM that very industry, however, so boycotting it means not just doing away with what‚Äôs coming out now and is ‚Äúnew‚Äù, but doing away with everything you likely have watched up to this point.

       Your favorite shows in HD minutes after they air, Blu-ray

       I'm not sure everyone even knows just how far those in Hollywood reach. It goes beyond movies, music and TV. They back many websites, games, resorts, cruises, airlines, towns and cities. You can't punish all for the deeds of others. Hollywood needs to clean out their own house and keep it clean. The general public can't boycott every aspect. You can't boycott dentist and doctors because some are molesters. You can't fix Hollywood with a boycott. It is absolutely terrifying how much any person in power can get away with. There has to be a solution but a boycott isn't it. It won't reach far enough or have enough financial impact to change anything. I don't have the answers but I'm pretty certain a boycott isn't in the realm of realistic or even effective.

       Cannot agree more with everything you've said.  The overwhelming amount of people on here (and elsewhere regarding this issue) are
       <em>

       I forgot to mention that they also have their hands in fashion and culinary. People can boycott the obvious things marked by Hollywood but those are just the tip. In order to place a true boycott you would have to stop reading magazines in print or online, stop most of social media, stop with a lot apps and games, remove scholarships funded and backed by Hollywood...the list goes on. I don't have the answers but like I said...this one isn't it. Boycott music, movies and TV if it helps you feel better but know that you are still supporting them in other areas.

       People just don't know. But they need to. If you really stop to think about it...it is overwhelming and alarming at just how much we support Hollywood every single day. From our cell providers to what we eat. If people would research and connect the dots they would understand that there is no way to effectively boycott all of Hollywood. If there was...I would all for it. I don't think anyone is going to toss out their gaming systems and games which use music and graphics produced by....well you know. They aren't going to stop watching sports..backed by...well you know. Put down that soda and bottled water...because...well you know. Turn off your cell and WiFi because.....

       Agreed.  As a result - and as is the point of my very OP - people need to stop saying "Down with all of Hollywood!!  Arrrrrgh!" and simply work toward trying to take down the
       <em>
        aspects
       </em>
       of Hollywood that are criminal and illegal.  Pretty simple concept really.

       Correct.  I feel people just need to be more discerning with
       <em>
        where

       they spend their money.  Simple as that.  Understand that this planet is overtaken by certain forces that are very evil and corrupt, and do your best to steer as clear of them as possible - while understanding that sometimes it might not be all that easy to do so.

       You are exactly right.

       Just try to be as true as possible to having a personal stance against supporting that which seems to involve harm to others.

      <p>
       I'm an ethical vegan, for example (as opposed to one for dietary or health reasons).  I try to abide by the concepts of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa">
        ahimsa
       </a>
       in this life.  I understand that it may not always be possible to be a
       <em>
        total vegan at all times
       </em>
       given just how ubiquitous are the use of non-human animal products on this planet.  Sometimes I might eat something that unbeknownst to me might have been made with an animal product or whatnot.

      <p>
       I
       <em>
        do

       try to keep my harm of others down to as much of a minimum as possible, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be delusional of me to think that it's possible to
       <em>
        neeeever
       </em>
       harm another form of life EVAR while I still live.  Hell, every breath I take constitutes the death of millions of other forms of life on at least the cellular level if not on other levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I can do is my best at being aware of my actions, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       That other user you were communicating with is just, like you said, delusional in their thinking that they're not pretty heavily plugged in to the system they live in.  If nothing else, his abject, delusional ignorance makes him all the more likely to continue perpetuating the very things he claims to be against in his life.

       I'm not saying do nothing. But in reality...most people already pirate movies, music and TV. Idk the answer. A boycott won't solve it because it won't even dent their review really. But it could make the public feel better but they need to be informed that while they are not the light bill they are still paying the gas bill.

       Sadly, I don't see it. Which is why I say there has to be a better way. But idk what it is. Even if we could boycott all of Hollywood it wouldn't stop the predators. There has to be a way to find out who they are and prosecute. Going forward Hollywood needs to be more transparent and every single child getting in the business needs to be required to have a chaperone and legal counsel outside of their parents and Hollywood big wigs. Women and men who are harassed need to speak up immediately without fear of blacklisting. Idk how to make that happen.

       Yes, we can. We can and will boycott Hollywood. We can do whatever we want. The ONLY solution is to boycott. Honestly, though, it will mostly happen because people are losing interest in the propaganda that they are pushing. It is already working. People just aren't interest in the kiddy-porn comping out of Hollywood.

       I'm not saying don't boycott. I'm saying that in order for it to be effective you would have to boycott every single aspect of Hollywood..not limited to music, movies and TV. You would have to boycott your "real music", theater shows etc. Boycotting every aspect of Hollywood isn't feasible or even practical. Once you delve into just how far it reaches...you will see that a boycott that will be effective is next to impossible. Over the years we have given them too much power.

       OK. That's fair. You are right, their reach is far and wide. I, for example, am required by contract to pay for cable. I have no way out of it. I've paid for cable for over ten years without ever hooking up a TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       Boycotting, on whatever level people can do, is the only real option we have. Every little bit helps. Some of us will take more aggressive stances than others. As long as every does their part, things will improve.

       Sadly, it won't. People already pirate movies, songs, TV shows etc. It hasn't stopped a thing and wont. I'm not sure how to fix it but I'm pretty sure a call to boycott things that are obvious Hollywood while still supporting the things that are under the umbrella isn't it.

       Boycott EVERYTHING Hollywood. Don't support anything under their umbrella. Simple. Done. It works. People are already doing it. A simple conversation with a stranger waiting for the bus sets the wheels in motion. People just need a little nudge in the right direction. The time in now.

       Says the guy who pays for cable lol. I can promise you that you buy nestle products....which is tied into Disney...which ties into Hollywood. Do you know the investors for every single item you support? Nope. You would surprised to find out just how much you support Hollywood without even knowing it. Again, a boycott of all of Hollywood is almost impossible. Go and tell all of these people to give their sports that they watch religiously lol good luck. That too supports Hollywood. Just about everything leads back to HOLLYWOOD.

       I don't drink soda because it sucks. But if I liked it I would. You dont buy Nestle? Lmao... that is another corp that people have no idea the reach and sub brands. So, are you saying that you personally know who makes every food you eat? Not likely. You don't own a cell phone? Interesting.

       Yes, I personally know who makes the food I eat. I don't consume any of that process shit. It is undesirable. I enjoy cooking and fine foods. I travel for food, not to see some touristy crap hole. No, I don't own a phone, and it is awesome. That was one of the best decisions I ever made. I am so glad I got rid of them.

       I boycott Hollywood. I'd suggest you stop supporting the kid-fuckers, but hey, that's on you. The more money you give to Hollywood, the more kid's lives you destroy. But, hey, out-of-sight, out-of-mind, am I right!

       No matter who pays it for you..it is still paid because of you. "It is what it is" tho when it pertains to something u want or need. That right there is the end of your so called boycott.

       It is not about want or need. Some communities, and even countries, require people to pay for it (i.e. some even by law). I am in that situation. However, I don't pay for it directly. Regardless, there is nothing I can do about that. I have no choice or say in the matter.

       Wait...you said that EVERY dollar that goes to Hollywood pays for a child to be molested. So...the internet that you are using is paid for by someone....so yeah, based on your logic and words...your internet payment and usage funded that.

       Which is still paid for by someone idiot. Your internet is paid for even if not used. Just because you don't use it...it is still paid for. No matter how you look at it...you are using a tool that Hollywood is invested in heavily. It is paid for on your behalf monthly. The free internet you speak of is paid for by someone. Are you that dense that you dont understand the flow of money? You must be because this has had to be said to u more than once

       Are you still here?!? You've said you were leaving like three times already. No matter. Use your internet, and figure out what a boycott is. It is what it is. You don't have to like it. You don't have to agree with it. Hollywood doesn't hamper me in the slightest. Their undesirables are undesirable to me. Stop supporting kiddy sex.

       Yep, I'm using my internet as you are using yours. Difference is...I'm not delusional... I know exactly how the system works. You do too but you like to place blame elsewhere. Lol. I could go to bed and not engage you but I'm not sleepy yet, I don't want to read a book, not a big movie or TV person and everyone else is sleeping...that leaves you. You are a contradiction waiting to happen. I'm here to watch you seesaw back and forth while digging your hole deeper. This is entertainment not produced by Hollywood but yet in still Hollywood got their cut by payment for the WiFi.

       People just don't know. But they need to. If you really stop to think about it...it is overwhelming and alarming at just how much we support Hollywood every single day. From our cell providers to what we eat. If people would research and connect the dots they would understand that there is no way to effectively boycott all of Hollywood. If there was...I would all for it. I don't think anyone is going to toss out their gaming systems and games which use music and graphics produced by....well you know. They aren't going to stop watching sports..backed by...well you know. Put down that soda and bottled water...because...well you know. Turn off your cell and WiFi because.....

       My community forces everyone buy contract to pay for cable. There is no way out of it. No, I don't buy anything Nestle. Yes, I know the products I buy, and the people that make them. It's not that hard. I don't have a cell phone! Why the fuck would you drink soda?!? Open your eyes asshole, that sugar shit will kill you!

       Dude, get bent. You don't know what you are talking about. If you want to support people fucking little kids, that's on you. That is Hollywood. There is plenty of non-hollywood related performing arts and centers. Not every wants to be involved in people abusing children.

       Yep, I'm using my internet as you are using yours. Difference is...I'm not delusional... I know exactly how the system works. You do too but you like to place blame elsewhere. Lol. I could go to bed and not engage you but I'm not sleepy yet, I don't want to read a book, not a big movie or TV person and everyone else is sleeping...that leaves you. You are a contradiction waiting to happen. I'm here to watch you seesaw back and forth while digging your hole deeper. This is entertainment not produced by Hollywood but yet in still Hollywood got their cut by payment for the WiFi.

       You could not use the service perhaps? Just because something is given doesn't mean you take. But simple logic is lost on you.

       In all honesty, man, I don't think you're schooling him on anything really.  "Schooling" implies that the one being schooled is actually
       <em>
        learning
       </em>
       something...and I somehow don't think that's happening with that person.
