       The shiny distractions and magic tricks the Corporate - backed media wave in front of us serve only the interests of their parent companies. These companies have deep interest in keeping the status quo. Everyone profits from a good war and they're losing their chance at these profits with Clinton out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blaming Russia is their desperate hail Mary, their last chance. Seth Rich is one name they're trying to bury. He can't be forgotten. WikiLeaks is the last honest journalism we have and TPTB can't allow the DNC leaks to be tied to Rich or they lose their Russian War Circle Jerk. They lose discrediting WikiLeaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are right about the other parts of this scandal, then Seth Rich was murdered for what he believed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could  be any one of us next.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Look at the brigade to determine whether or not I'm right. Compare vote count with surrounding threads. The evidence is presenting itself -  they want his name buried.

       1) The actual agreement, which states explicitly that it should not supersede the DNC's requirement to be impartial and is focused on general election strategy:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to violate the DNC's obligation of impartiality and neutrality through the Nominating process. All activities performed under this agreement will be focused exclusively on preparations for the General Election and not the Democratic Primary," the memo states.
       </p>
       <p>
        "Further we understand you may enter into similar agreements with other candidates," it continues.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       2) Emails obtained by the Washington post, from the DNC to Sanders' campaign, which discuss setting up the same arrangement (which Sanders declined):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "[I]f youâ€™re raising significantly more than the amount to cover the voter file for the DNC, DNC staff would be happy to chat with the Sanders team and come to an understanding about the best way to use those funds to prepare for the general election at the DNC," Graham Wilson of the firm Perkins Coie wrote.
       </p>
       <p>
        "The DNC has had discussions like this with the Clinton campaign and is of course willing to do so with all."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       3) Brazile making the rounds today making flatly unbelievable and self-serving claims, like that she considered replacing Clinton with Biden despite the DNC chair not even remotely having that power.

       These are not sources - these are opinion pieces. Half the reason the Democratic party is falling apart right now is because of the inability to ascertain the difference. Let me show you what sources are:

        <a href="https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/6107">

       I literally cited the agreement that's at issue here. There is no more important source than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, your message shows exactly what's been happening from the get go -- people being very confused and mistaking completely normal campaign work for something sinister.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC and RNC's job is primarily
       <em>
        fundraising and public relations
       </em>
       .  That's literally why they exist, to coordinate national fundraising and campaigning.  (The DNC has done a shit job of this through the 2010s, but that's another story.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything you cite is just the DNC doing its job.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Are you serious? What organization
       <em>
        doesn't
       </em>
       push back against negative coverage?  What political entity doesn't have a PR wing trying to get favorable news coverage? You honestly think there are no emails from Sanders' media relations staffers complaining about negative coverage? Come on.
      </p>
      <p>
       2)  You know that guy was fired for that, right?  Btw, he was obviously shut down -- point me to Clinton, the DNC, or any other Democrat who publicly made any remarks about Sanders' religion.  They rigged the primary cause some guy sent an email and was ignored?
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Are you serious? "Pull the segment" means "get a copy."  That's why he's talking about a rush transcript.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) I'm sure the DNC had people tracking the Clinton and O'Malley campaigns too.  Why is it weird that a party would want to keep tabs on what the candidates using its brand are doing?
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Yes, that's the only concrete example we have -- and it's also why I don't think Donna Brazile is a trustworthy person.

       It was pretty elaborate for a suicide but you will never convince these Tin Foil hat boys that a 27 year old can shoot himself in the back twice, get rid of the gun and confiscate all of the security footage in one of the most monitored places in the world.

       Read it again, Stevie wonder...
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <em>
        primaries
       </em>
       are rigged. DNC played dirty tricks to beat Bernie, RNC played dirty tricks to force Rand Paul to withdraw.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that, it doesn't matter because both of them are in on the scheme and behind the scenes they are pals. Bushes, Clinton's, trumps all get along. It's a big political club.
      </p>
      <p>
       They elite are still using trump as an asset to forward their world government. He's great at creating racial hysteria, partisan tension...I mean just look at you, you got all defensive immediately in defense of the guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I'm not falling for the idea that Clinton and trump are enemies...he can say "crooked" Hillary all he wants, but both of them are criminal elements of the NWO to me. Same shit, different election.

But I'm definitely saying its rigged.

       Nice attempt at making me appear apathetic about the situation. The reason I'm expanding on it is because it's a rudimentary aspect of being a conspiracy theorist that used to be the foundation of understanding how rigged the political system is. You should know this shit...and I won't stop bringing it up. Inherently most of us know this already.

       That's a huge stretch. There's been no new news about the DNC, you weren't right about Uranium One. Funny, though, you'd have a case if you could prove Seth had access to emails and that he leaked them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know if anyone responds they'll say Assange never reveals sources but if I thought one of my sources was killed for leaking to me, I'd raise holy hell and be outraged, not like wink wink, maybe he did, maybe he didn't.
