        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The reddit of the default subs and <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> has always had a bit of a hivemind, but now it seems particularly bad. The likes of the Correct the Record super pac and other such astroturfing operations have forever changed reddit and the kinds of people who participate in the popular subreddits. The responses and top-rated comments on threads are always so incredibly predictable, it really as if one is sitting in an echo chamber. Everyone seems to have the same blank spots in their systems of reasoning, the same things about which they just close down all thinking about, the same humour, the same likes and dislikes, the same responses to the same responses. Reddit was always like this, but it did at least used to be quite alternative; it supported people like Ron Paul and more recently Bernie Sanders, it was liberal but didn&#39;t have those contradictions, those leaps of faith, those pills that one has to swallow to be a fully paid member of the club, which the most zealous of the modern left harbours, such as their absurd defensiveness of Islam. Reddit had it&#39;s own culture, and it attracted certain people with a certain view of the world, but it was never the hivemind it is today, which seems to be increasingly statist and dedicated to establishment politics. The story of the DNC rigging the election against Bernie Sanders barely seemed to stir up much anger. Any mention of Brexit is followed by someone mocking Brexit voters as stupid and racist. Trump voters are similarly maligned. </p>

<p>I&#39;m no Trump supporter, I&#39;m not a right-winger (although I do support Brexit, because the EU are an awful organisation, but I&#39;m not bothered by immigration), I&#39;m a liberal really, but fuck this hive mind shit. It&#39;s so eye wateringly boring, but it is also worrying that so many hundreds of thousands of people can act in such a programmed and predictable manner. I feel like Reddit, and other social media platforms, are some of the most powerful propaganda tools to ever have existed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think youre confusing bots with how unoriginal and boring most people are. I once started dating someone and thought he was so funny and clever and loved his little one liners and puns... then he introduced me to reddit and i realised that all of his jokes and “cleverness” was exactly what everyone on here was parroting. He instantly became the most boring person i’ve ever met.
Reddit is a hive</p>
