       You cant make this stuff up! On Thursday The New Orleans Saints issued multiple statements, in which they called the actions of Navy vet. John Wells "sad and divisive." This was in response to Wells, who runs a veteran advocacy group, respectfully refusing to accept an award at the Saints stadium. Wells refused to accept the award because he considered the Players kneeling as a "slap to the face." Are you understanding this? the Saints are publicly bashing a retired vet who actually has integrity and supports this country. I feel like this a bad episode of the twilight zone

       I refuse to be outraged by players kneeling, and I refuse to be outraged by a soldier that refused to accept and award.

       I also refuse  to be outraged because the two sides are outraged at each other.

       I pretty much made it clear that I’m well aware of the division people are trying to create on both sides.  I refuse to be part of that attempt at division, and not sacrifice my enjoyment of football.

       It’s faux outrageous trying to be drummed up on both sides of this argument.

       so your attempt at refusing to be a part of division is to religiously sit in front of a tv like a programmed zombie and continue to give your time and money to an organization that is openly using its popular platform to invoke division in this country. Yeah ok buddy, when the denial wares off. We'll be here waiting for you

       I don’t know what you’re trying to accomplish by arguing with me on this.   I’m not invested in this fight.  I don’t care about what the players do.  I don’t care how outraged you or others are about them kneeling.     I’m not at war here, so I’m not sacrificing my viewing habits because it offends you that they kneel

       Too_Much_Saucee is riding that high horse, making you out to be a brainwashed zombie because you enjoy the NFL.  Apparently every "woke" person should boycott all things owned by a conglomerate.  Maybe he'll reveal how he lives 100% organically and powers his home on solar energy and a windmill.

      <p>
       Or maybe everyone should tear him apart for using a website owned by Condé Nast.  LMAO.

       This is just stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole point of the kneeling in the first place was in protest to inequality, done on a stage where they are most visible.  Somewhere along the way, the rhetoric got focused on the military.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, if you're against players that took action during the national anthem before games, whether it be kneeling or standing behind in the tunnel or locker room, then you are against equal treatment for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are blinded by patriotism so much that such a simple message can get lost because MUH RED WHITE 'N BLUE.  These same mother fuckers blowing up twitter and Facebook are the same ones that keep their asses planted in their lazy-boy recliners and couches during the National Anthem at home, if not taking a pre-game piss, or grabbing pre-game nachos and beer.  NEVER have I EVER been in someone's home or at a bar where everyone stopped what they were doing, stood at attention in respect to the anthem.  I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but it hasn't happened in my presence.

       So, stay on track, people.  It isn't about your mommy's or grand-daddy's service.  It's about people of color in America getting treated differently and more harshly under the strong arm of the law.   Do I think that's the best time to stage such a protest?  No.  Do I think they have the right to do so because America?  You're damn straight I do.  I watch football for entertainment and would prefer politics are checked at the door but I'm not going to look down on a peaceful protest in the name of equality for everyone, regardless of race.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the fuck did this country become so divisive?  When the fuck are we going to see through the bullshit and come together as a nation?   We're not because we're collectively too arrogant, egotistical, and opinionated to stay focused on one message to push another.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Proud to be an American
       </em>
       ... Get the fuck outta here with that bullshit.  If you're proud to be an American, fucking act like it or shut the fuck up.

       You obviously dont even understand what that flag represents. It represents the entire nation of the USA as a whole. The red stripes specifically represent the blood of those spilled serving this country. When you kneel during the anthem your basically saying "fuck you" to service members. Of course this is about military members. Maybe you should actually take the time to learn what this is all about before you give your uneducated input. No wonder you dont understand what this is about with your head so far up your ass

       Red stripes representing the sacrifice of soldiers is completely untrue
      </p>
      <p>
       No federal law, resolution or executive order exists providing an official reason for the flag’s colors — or their meaning. The closest thing to an explanation are the words of Charles Thomson, the secretary of the Continental Congress, who was instrumental in the design of the Great Seal of the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thomson’s report to Congress on June 20, 1782, the day the seal was approved, contained a description of the colors, the same as those in the flag: "White signifies purity and innocence. Red hardiness and valour and Blue ... signifies vigilance, perseverance and justice."

       "The colors red, white, and blue did not have meanings for The Stars and Stripes when it was adopted in 1777. However, the colors in the Great Seal did have specific meanings. Charles Thompson, Secretary of the Continental Congress, reporting to Congress on the Seal, stated:
      </p>
      <pre><code>"The colors of the pales (the vertical stripes) are those used in the flag of the United States of America; White signifies purity and innocence, Red, hardiness &amp;amp; valour, and Blue, the color of the Chief (the broad band above the stripes) signifies vigilance, perseverance &amp;amp; justice."

       The following is an open letter from Green Beret, Nate Boyer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that." -- Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dear Every Single American,
      </p>
      <p>
       Every. Single. American. Including President Trump, Colin Kaepernick, and my brothers in arms overseas who are wondering, "what in the hell is going on back there?" I'm sitting in the same chair, in the same apartment that I sat in almost a year ago when I wrote an open letter to Colin Kaepernick. I was hurt when I saw him sitting on the bench during the national anthem, but I'm much more hurt now. Not by him, not by where we're at now with the protests, but by us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply put, it seems like we just hate each other; and that is far more painful to me than any protest, or demonstration, or rally, or tweet. We're told to pick a side, there's a line drawn in the sand "are you with us or against us?" It's just not who we are, or at least who we're supposed to be; we're supposed to be better than that, we're Americans. This doesn't even seem to be about right or wrong, but more about right or left.
Today it feels like this national divide isn't even really about the anthem, or the flag, or kneeling, or sitting, or fists in the air. It's not about President Donald Trump, it's not about Colin Kaepernick, it's not about the military, or even police brutality. It feels like it's about winning. That's what makes America so great, our sheer competitiveness. We're winners, and we won't quit until victory is ours.
      </p>
      <p>
       We see it in sports everyday, we "live and die" by the outcomes of our teams. That desire to win at all cost is costing us greatly now among our neighbors. This winning mentality seems to have spilled over into an obsession with being right and not willing to admit that maybe, just maybe we were wrong. We repeat mantras to ourselves like, "no matter what I will never ever surrender."
      </p>
      <p>
       Earlier this week I sat down with a group of five Combat Arms and Special Operations Veterans. The round table discussed our individual feelings on the flag, the anthem, and the players who knelt when it was played. We all had very different takes, but what surprised me most at the end of the discussion was that we all agreed on one thing. Colin Kaepernick and President Trump should be the ones uniting our country together. Wait ... what? I know it sounds crazy, but maybe that's exactly what we need to see. Maybe that's how we start to heal. Two men sit in a room and talk, simple as that.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how it all started with Colin and I, neither of us knew that kneeling would be the result of our conversation. Colin wanted to sit, I wanted him to stand, and so we found a common ground on a knee alongside his teammates. I believe that progress and real change happens in this world when you reach across the divide, you build a bridge, you swallow your pride, you open your mind, you embrace what you don't understand, and ultimately you surrender.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I don't pretend to speak for everyone who fought overseas, many veterans rightfully disagree with my position. But I do feel that I echo the sentiments of most war fighters when I say that what we hope for more than anything right now in America is unity. To deploy overseas, train, live with, fight alongside, and ultimately defend foreigners that you have little in common with is truly a challenging task. But returning home to a country that is so divided, so judgmental, and so hateful of one another is almost as difficult to deal with as burying a fallen comrade. In fact we're still losing our brothers in arms overseas right now and it's hardly mentioned it in the media; but that's OK, we don't risk our lives and sacrifice so much for fanfare or recognition. It's not at all why we do what we do. We do what we do because you are worth it, because we love you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would love for those two leaders to have that conversation, but more than anything I just want us to love one another again. One great thing about freedom is that you get to choose everyday how you treat your neighbor. This IS the best country in the world, but we can always do better. I'm laying it all out there because I have to, I swore to defend this land and its people, and I will die trying. I know some people will hate this (we love to hate things these days), and I'll get called a disgrace to the Green Beret once again. But I don't care, the United States mean more to me than any of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the past year I've come across veterans from various walks of life. We may actually be the most diverse sub-culture in the America. Since I myself am a Green Beret, I want to share with you a couple of messages that were sent to me from men in my former unit. One of them is white, and one of them is black:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Hey brother. At first I was with you on the Kaepernick issue. However, I just stood in formation while one of our brothers was pulled off a plane with our nation's flag draped over the coffin. I had to fight back tears as I saw the pain in the eyes of Staff Sergeant T's wife and family. While I would like to sit here and tell you that I rose above it all, I have to be honest. My heart filled with rage. Rage for anyone who takes for granted the ideals and symbols that we fight and die for."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Hey Brother, this is J. I spent nearly 18 years in 10th Special Forces Group and wish I had an opportunity to meet a brother like yourself. I just want to say I appreciate your views on this national anthem and flag issue. I love our country, but at the same time I have to take the time to tell my sons to act a certain way out of fear for their lives when dealing with police officers. Most of my neighbors and friends here in MD are law enforcement personnel and will tell you they also have to act a certain way to avoid confrontation and situations that normally don't occur for those that are not of color. Not all officers are bad, the majority I believe are good and poor training is attributed to some of these issues we hear of. I really just want to thank you for your taking the time out to understand and convincing him to take a knee and not sit out on what we have fought for. God Bless You Bro!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Different backgrounds, different experiences, different colors, but at the end of the day they just want the same basic things for their families.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please, no more lines in the sand, not at home, not among our people. No more choosing sides, no more "for or against." I believe our Veterans will be called upon to lead the way in healing the world and solving its problems; right now our country needs that more than I can remember. So I'll be here, standing in the radical middle, doing what I can to continue fighting for those that can't fight for themselves. Let's get this thing fixed together, you and me. I love you all with all my heart.
      </p>

       Hell yeah brother. They dont understand the flag represents ALL OF US. Not just the gov, or police, or military. So when you disrespect that flag your disrespecting ALL OF US, including yourselves. Especially those who've sacrificed for this country. You may not agree with the military but in one way or another you are undoubtly benefiting from their sacrifices. Sure this country isnt perfect and of course some things need to change. But having the mindset of "fuck you" to this country and those who support it isnt going to change jack shit. Its only going to make things worse. We need to rally behind one another and come together as a nation. We need to believe in and support this nation. I emphasize the word nation because i mean exactly that. Not just the gov, or military, left or right. This entire nation as a whole. Then we can begin to move forward
