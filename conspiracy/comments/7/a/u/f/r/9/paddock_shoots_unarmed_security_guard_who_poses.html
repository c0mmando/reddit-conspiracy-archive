        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">28</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-11-05 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/mediocrityisevident.html">mediocrityisevident</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So lets get this straight, Paddock had access to room 32-134 (2nd broken window room) and had cameras setup to see into hallway.</p>

<p>He has already shown intent and willingness to shoot through doors at approaching people (jesus campos) but for some reason when he &#39;senses the wolf is at the door&#39; as the sheriff puts it he doesn&#39;t get into any strategical position such as the room 32-134 so he has clear access to spray at the stairwell and anyone setting breach charges on 32-135.</p>

<p>Paddock had every tactical advantage, he had knowledge of the entry points they had to come through, he had vision of them (camera&#39;s) and he had the advantage of stealth by the SWAT members not knowing if he was in room 134 or 135 and even where abouts in the room he was.. He had every advantage and he had designed it so he had that advantage but didn&#39;t use it... the only conclusion is someone else was there, killed him and escaped. It sounds like a movie but its really the only logical conclusion unless your prepared to accept he accomplished his goal and just suicided. Im not</p>

<p>He had 4000 more rounds of ammo in the room the sheriff stated but instead of using them he just put a bullet in his mouth. They really expect anyone to believe that?</p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t people in Vegas protesting for video and evidence to be released? Does no one in Vegas care or what?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The lawyer for some of the victims has stated 2 bellhops did help paddock take 10 bags up to the room so Paddock definitely had a part in it, i&#39;d suggest if he bought the bags up that he likely was one of the shooters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assuming he really did the shooting, there’s the possibility that he felt remorse, guilt, or fear for what he did (or was doing), got cold feet, and decided to end it. </p>

<p>Might also explain the long period between volleys as he was contemplating what he was doing. Might also explain why he was only able to kill 58 people from a perched position while firing a machine gun into a crowd of 22k.</p>

<p>Not saying I believe it, just saying it’s a possibility. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I listened intently while Jesus Campos told his story on the Ellen show, and it basically went like this:</p>

<p>So Campos suspects nothing about the room Paddock is in, but he’s real close to it cause he’s lookin at this unalarming, securely shut fire door that was not opened. Meanwhile, Paddock is watching him on camera from inside the room, holding his breath like “please don’t know I’m in here with a buncha guns... please don’t know I’m in here with a buncha guns...” and just when Campos starts walking away from the room Paddock goes waait, wwAIT... NOTIICE MEEE and clears two full magazines into the door. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sossy_   That&#39;s pretty much my interpretation of it, Campos was walking away but yet Paddock decided to shoot him and bring all the attention to the room he was in. It screams out &#39;bullshit&#39; where i come from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mesquite locals claim they saw Paddock at the senior centre around 11am on Thursday the 28th. They said he would normally sit down to eat but that day he went straight to the counter and asked the cook for her Enchilada recipe. 
<a href="https://m.frasercoastchronicle.com.au/news/marilou-speaks-gunman-lay-bed-moaning-screaming/3231925/">https://m.frasercoastchronicle.com.au/news/marilou-speaks-gunman-lay-bed-moaning-screaming/3231925/</a></p>

<p>So at some point I’m expecting Lombardo to issue a statement saying that after many months of very intense analysis, the FBI has determined that the note found in room 135 was an Enchilada recipe written in Spanish.</p>
