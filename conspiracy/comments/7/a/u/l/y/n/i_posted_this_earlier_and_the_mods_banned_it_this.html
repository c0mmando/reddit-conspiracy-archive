<p>If you&#39;re going to share a new link, at least elaborate a bit in your OP as to what you think may be happening, or drop a comment. We need to discuss and pick each other&#39;s brains to get a better grasp on which direction the social engineers and elite are trying to steer us. </p>

<p>I’ve thought about this, and really only way is the create a rule to limit a post on same topic over a certain amount of time.  I don’t know if that’s ideal, and would have to be enforced consistently without causing another conspiracy.  </p>

<p>I have to disagree here. You did not post this; you posted a one-sentence self.post. I think this is an excellent idea and post, and you argued for it well in your self.text. But I probably would have deleted the earlier one, or perhaps asked you to flesh it out a bit more. </p>

<p>I think you might have too much faith in the mods here. Many of us believe they may potentially be compromised.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t exactly fault you for this idea—you&#39;d be a poor conspiracy theorist if you didn&#39;t at least suspect it! I think for the most part, though, the mod team we have now is for the most part pretty good and wants what&#39;s best for the sub, though we do have slightly different ideas on what that entails. </p>
