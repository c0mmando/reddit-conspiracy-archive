    <div class="md"><p>why do you think that&#39;s relevant?</p>

<p>also, it was my understanding that all the rich saudis have their hands in US politics. in fact, i just assume that every single billionaire in the world is buying off congressmen and hiring lobbyists and donating to &quot;foundations,&quot; since the US gov&#39;t is basically controlled by special interest money.</p>

<p>i am doing the complete opposite of that here.</p>

<p>it is my opinion that this is a nefarious power play by the crown prince, ahead of the abdication of the king. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean, it’s obvious you’ve done no research on Saudi Arabia or their corruption, otherwise you wouldn’t be asking for proof of the corruption beyond the word of Saudi media.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>again, you are mistaken about my beliefs. my research has indicated that they are all corrupt, the entire saudi royal family (the adults at least, those in power) are rotten to the core.</p>

<p>this episode is in-fighting among those people.</p>

<p>So like I said: what would you say it is that you do here?</p>

<p>learn, read, discuss, debunk, speculate, make friends, get hyped, get disappointed, find hope, find despair, and broaden my world view.</p>

<p>what about you?</p>

<p>i realize you are thinking i&#39;m a shill, that&#39;s incredibly obvious from your leading questions. but i&#39;m not. believe me or don&#39;t, makes no difference to me. it&#39;s a shame this the level of discourse people have sunk to. all my comments are in good faith, all my questions meant to increase my understanding. </p>

<li><p>Sheldon Adelson — Vegas hotel/casino owner, Trump&#39;s biggest donor, Netanyahu&#39;s biggest supporter (was interviewed by police in Israel regarding Netanyahu corruption while Trump was there in late May), met with Trump and Kushner at the White House the day after the LV shooting in a pre-arranged meeting, had beef with MGM&#39;s CEO...</p></li>

<p>Kushner obviously went for a face to face as internet and phones are not secure, which would then infer someone doesn&#39;t trust the spooks.</p>

<p>It does feel like a big battle going on at the moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering Kushner has been less than upfront about his foreign contacts, I don&#39;t assume that he&#39;s been above the fold. Plus if he had a hand in bringing down corruption, I would assume he wouldn&#39;t be secretive about it. </p>
