       why do you think that's relevant?

       also, it was my understanding that all the rich saudis have their hands in US politics. in fact, i just assume that every single billionaire in the world is buying off congressmen and hiring lobbyists and donating to "foundations," since the US gov't is basically controlled by special interest money.

       it is my opinion that this is a nefarious power play by the crown prince, ahead of the abdication of the king.

       again, you are mistaken about my beliefs. my research has indicated that they are all corrupt, the entire saudi royal family (the adults at least, those in power) are rotten to the core.

       Kushner obviously went for a face to face as internet and phones are not secure, which would then infer someone doesn't trust the spooks.

       Right. It seems to me that he went there to encourage what happened today. I don't know enough about Saudi Arabia politics to know if what happened today is a good thing though. Unless you think he is in cahoots with those punished today.

       Considering Kushner has been less than upfront about his foreign contacts, I don't assume that he's been above the fold. Plus if he had a hand in bringing down corruption, I would assume he wouldn't be secretive about it.
