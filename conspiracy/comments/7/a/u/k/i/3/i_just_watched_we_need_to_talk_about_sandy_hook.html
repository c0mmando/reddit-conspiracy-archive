       Just got finished watching. So much shit I had no idea about. The school looking like it hasn't been maintained in years, the behavior of the parents and officials, it's all so fucked up. Man I just can't believe an entire community could be in on it. Also, the video talked about a fund being put online 2 days before the shooting. Do you know how credible that is?

       I think it's possible. It's been a while but that was the first thing that got my attention. I always new the government was corrupt but Sandy Hook opened up a world of WTF for me. Ever since I researched SH I have looked at new and old mass casualty events under the same microscope and honestly believe most are hoaxes. One of the reasons I believe this is because when I comment on something like the LV shooting and point out the lack of blood or ridiculous survival stories I get a lot of people giving me shit. Even in this sub which is a conspiracy sub. You can easily tell there is an effort to push a narrative in which people died. If you look at my comment history you can easily see what looks like an effort to make deniers seem dumb and heartless. It just blows my mind that they don't think we see what their doing.

       I think the most chilling line in that documentary is towards the end, when he points out that a side effect, the most direct side effect really, is the creep of prison-like policies into elementary schools.

       What's crazy is people get violently angry at those who question Sandy Hook! It's one of those conspiracy theories that people won't even look into, yet they'll vehemently defend it. It's very strange.

       I live in CT, near Sandy Hook. Come visit, come talk to the families that lost their children. People get pissed because children died and you want to play games from your arm chair about how it was all fake just so you feel like you're in the know about some conspiracy without a point. The silver lining is that this conspiracy instantly outs someone as a persons whos opinion no longer holds any weight.

       Are you one of those people who got a free house out of the whole thing? Or did they skip over you? It's late can't find links but google sand hooks free houses. So really interesting activity around there going down. Lots of properties sold for very little to people who already owned them.

       I've heard this reply elsewhere. From someone defendimg John Podesta. Cause random internet people are defending John Podesta? Same people supporting Hillary. Seriously, what's the upside there?

       Says the one arguing on a conspiracy sub. If you believe the SH narrative tell us why. Make US believers. Otherwise you're just like every other person who says "don't question". Its uncomfortable and its tragic.... isn't that enough to want truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's enough anomalies in the case to question it. Just because children died doesnt make this open and shut. You should be outraged that children died and want to know why... how... i understnad your reasoning but we shouldn't be satisfied with "this is what happened, no questions please." Thats what turned Vegas into such a cluster fuck. Silencing a contrary belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure its bad taste to question the death of someone's loved one... But if it keeps you and your loved ones safe wouldn't it be worth it?

       What does that prove? Just someone writing nonsense with zero evidence to back anything they say up. The website itself is full of other unverified or false nonsense.  This is why nobody takes you guys seriously.  You lack critical thinking skills and you jump on any unverified claims that back up your preconception.  You dont use any scientific method and constantly work backwards from your claim. You angry Infowars​ junkies can down vote me all you want, but its never going to make anything your claim any truer and never going to make anyone take you serious without actual verifiable evidence, which none of you have.

       What I understand is verifiable evidence.  There is nothing wrong with making a claim, however, if you want that claim to hold weight you must provide good evidence.  If that evidence is disproven or found unreliable,  you must start again and find new evidence.  What you cant do is make a statement and pick through things you find that you think validate that claim then plug your ears and cry shill when it doesn't hold up to criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its like the shooting near San Antonio today. Before the day was over you already had claims that it was a false flag done by Saudis.  Zero evidence,  however, it fits what the person making the claim already believes. So now they will search the internet, shove square pegs into circular holes and claim it all fits.
      </p>
      <p>
       It so simple to make any claim that sounds good. I could say Trump had orgies with his daughter and teens from miss America. I can find a lot of tweets and news reels that I can say show proof that it seems plausible. But, it would be bullshit,  because without strong scientific modeled evidence, its all speculation and and imagination,  and nothing more.

       The whole sandy hook is fake thing would require sooooo many "normal" people to play along to keep the story going that it's just not feasable. With something like 9/11 you don't have to have as many normies keeping the story going.

       Have you watched some of these videos about it and read into WHY so many people think there's something fishy about the whole thing that doesn't add up? Maybe it would help to really look into why people think that because these aren't all crazy horrible people or anything, so many are totally baffled and with good reason. Maybe the whole thing wasn't faked and maybe some people did die but there is definitely something going on, some lies and fakery. Have a look at what people are talking about, don't just automatically assume that your fellow human beings are crazy and dismiss them.

       In high school a kid actually played a video of the weird stuff that went on during English class and everyone actually thought it seemed pretty shady. I think a lot of people actually listen to it, the problem is that they never even get to see it so they never question it.

       100%. IME, baby boomers have the most narrow minds. The indoctrination levels run deep within them. Not all of them, but most of them. For example, an old coworker will not speak to me after we spoke about 9/11.

       That's not really a logical prediction unless by "wipe the slate clean" you mean wipe everything living thing off the face of the planet once and for all.

       We don't really have much time for re-writing history, they knew that when they set it up like this. The game was rigged from the start...

       No I'm not. There are other explanations, namely that the photos shown of the allegedly deceased kids weren't taken at the time they were alleged to have been taken. That one's a lot simpler than what you proposed.

In regards to sandy hook, I don’t see any reason why I should believe it was entirely staged and no children were murdered. It’s like denying the holocaust happened

       There’s no law that criminalizes investigating the holocaust so I’m not sure what you mean. It is, however, illegal in some countries to deny the genocide ever occurred - similar to outlawing hate speech. If you research the holocaust you will find overwhelming evidence it occurred, while if you research evidence it did not occur it is difficult to find  anything from trustworthy sources. I just don’t understand how people can legitimately say kids or people did not die and they were all part of a made up story.

       Then clearly you haven't investigated it. If you have some corroborating evidence that events unfolded as reported in the MSM narrative feel free to pass it along.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should sit down and spend a couple of hours looking thru the State Police report on SH. The one where one part of the report that claims Lanza shot himself in the back/side of the head with the bullet passing the top/front of his hat leaving a bullet hole but no blood or brain matter. While another part of the report claims the suicide wound was "intra-oral"…through the mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dozens upon dozens of these types of contradictions and anomalies litter the final report. If these sorts of things don't call into question the official narrative then you are probably operating from "feeling" rather than intellect.

       Nice way of just taking what I said the wrong way. I'm saying I hope you guys here don't go around talking about conspiracies saying Sandy Hook didn't happen. Hollywood has nothing to do with that. Sick fucks everywhere should be gone.

       I originally bought the website dates evidence for a while until Mandalay Bay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Website date errors on Google aren’t unusual and were witnessed happening right after Mandalay Bay. There were a few posts about dates of articles being days prior to the event that were easily shown to be Google’s error.

       Are you referring to the Dawn Hochsprung Bing caching evidence? If so, comparing the Bing caching spider, which is designed specifically to visit sites and cache pages, is a different animal from Google's apache dates.

       I can see either side of this debate. I don’t know much about this conspiracy, but it sounds like there are a lot of things that don’t add up. It’s definitely interesting. But I went to Chardon Middle School at the time of the Chardon High School shooting, and I vividly remember that day. There are people who firmly believe that our town’s shooting was faked too. You don’t know how it feels when someone claims that something traumatic that you experienced never really happened. I’ll have to watch this documentary or whatever, but even if Sandy Hook was faked, it would probably be best to give the witnesses the benefit of the doubt, and your sympathy. If you weren’t there, you can’t really know.

       THIS, you just verbalized something VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT here without even realizingit I suspect!  You just defined and described how the human mind reacts to WHAT IT THINKS IT SEES AS REAL.  If you are a student of the Human mind, you might understand what Im referring to. If you are someone familiar with military and authoritative mental indoctrination and 'psy ops' of ANY entity or organization you RECOGNIZE what this persons "reasonable and compassionate" human mind did in this comment. UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A VALUABLE AND WELL USED FACTOR IN MANY MANY AREAS BY MANY DIFFERENT AGENCIES. What you described about victims of trauma being minimized also happens in other life traumas such as rape or extortion. However, what every LEO or psych student knows from first hand experiences and historical data is that the eye witness will "see" as "real"  ONLY WHAT THIER OWN MINDS WISH TO SEE OR CAN ACCEPT AS REAL. For example, if the witness/victim sees a cop shoot a child, and the cop is a close freind of thiers, what does that do to the witnesses state of mind and that traumas "affect"? Or even more common in everyday life, you have a friend who is married and you have known them awhile and think they are awonderful happy normal couple, and then one day you are "told" via your neighbors or newscaster theyre running a child sex trafficking ring using thier own children to scout for kids ? Its called cognitive dissonance for a reason! And since the advent of tv and instant communications technology fed into EVERY MIND ON THE PLANET. Again, its much easier for the non witness to give "the benefit of doubt" to a traumatized witness simply because theyve got no relatable first hand experiences with trauma themselves and believe it or not its a biological and statistical fact that this LACK of shared experience deeply affects and colors your perspective as well, often under the guise of compassion. Sad fact is, we do this because we want to instinctively move away from and distance ourselves from the " unknowns and unthinkables."  As for how such "conspiracies of silence"  can occur in great numbers, again, it only takes a very few who know the entire deal.  The pyramid scheme and design of many orgs both good and bad operations, is well known and well used because it WORKS.

       Unfortunately even being there doesn't mean you know what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sad truth is if a person walked into a building and started firing off blanks, people would be scared out of their minds, would run for cover and if told later a number of people died, even if they saw no personal indication of it, would believe it whole heartedly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The notion often expressed that "everybody" would have to be in on something like this is pure fantasy. Residents of the community (and people in the building at the time) would believe what they were told…period…and would react with the type of shock and sadness one would expect.

       I know a girl who was in the cafeteria when the Chardon shooting took place who now has PTSD. I didn’t SEE what happened, but I KNOW she did. I had a teacher who put on a bulletproof vest, pulled an injured boy into his classroom, gave him first aid, and saved his life. I didn’t SEE that happen, but I know this man and I trust him. I have a friend who knew one of the boys who was killed. He was like a brother to her. If those three boys in Chardon didn’t die that day, then what do you suppose happened to them?

       You don’t have to know about Chardon. I’m using my town as an example bc I can relate to the people who say they know what happened bc they were there. I didn’t see what happened, but I still KNOW what happened. As for my teacher, idk. He’s a survivalist. But it ended up being a good thing that he had it. I’ve had another teacher who kept 16 metal baseball bats in a cupboard in his room.

       I’m not talking about you specifically. And I’m generally very interested in conspiracy theories. But as someone from a town where a school shooting took place, I think this thread is more than likely a complete load of crap. Yeah, I’m sure that the government fakes stuff all the time. But give Sandy Hook witnesses the benefit of the doubt, because as someone who’s been in a similar situation, I concur that they most likely know what they’re talking about, and you’re in no position to tell them that they don’t. Maybe you’re all right about this, and Sandy Hook WAS faked, but it probably wasn’t, and you’re hurting people who watched their close friends grieve for their dead children.

       Can you point out where I said it was "fake"?

       But here's a question that continues to vex me…why would friends and families of alleged victims scour conspiracy sites to read what others have to say about it? Would you? Or would you deal with your grief and get on with your life?

       Nobody died, the parrents of the alleged victims all got free houses (seriously its in the real estate DBs), and they all got a shitfuck ton of money. The whole town partisipated, it was a joint fema/dhs drill that involved everyone. Everyone made bank, it helped the whole town. The kids are all still alive... thank god. Its alot of work to believe some shit like what they say on the news. I was so happy to get to the bottom of that one let me tell you...

       And to all the alphebet soup bungholes following this sub, just want to say I hope you realize how fucked up it is to control peoples minds like that. Its manufactured consent, and it fuckin wont last. So enjoy it while you can

       In my experience anyone who is offended when you suggest sandy hook was a hoax has avoided really looking in to it. I was one of those people. I accidentally listened properly to the hoax argument via a podcast called those conspiracy guys. It sent me on a month long spiral of re viewing all of the original sandy hook media and realizing for myself how manipulated I am. It has put be in a bit of a dark place honestly.

       I’m not talking about you specifically. And I’m generally very interested in conspiracy theories. But as someone from a town where a school shooting took place, I think this thread is more than likely a complete load of crap. Yeah, I’m sure that the government fakes stuff all the time. But give Sandy Hook witnesses the benefit of the doubt, because as someone who’s been in a similar situation, I concur that they most likely know what they’re talking about, and you’re in no position to tell them that they don’t. Maybe you’re all right about this, and Sandy Hook WAS faked, but it probably wasn’t, and you’re hurting people who watched their close friends grieve for their dead children.
