        this video
       </a>
       about a shooting at a start bucks on Thursday night (11-2-2017). so the shootings mentioned in the Tribune Article are not talking about the shooting at the Starbucks...and it seems there is no local news broadcasts about the shootings in the article? That seems odd don;t you think? Maybe police/Press are trying to keep an organised shooting spree on the downlow so people don't panic or something?

       or maybe it was just a typical Friday night in Chicago.  Chicago had 758 murders last year, so a day when 5 people were injured but none died is not going to be front page news.

       Yeah maybe...i just find it odd that there are 5 separate shootings with seemingly similar circumstances, and the only news I see about it is an online tribune article that is sort of buried. Especially when the suspect is not in custody, the article mentioned is so vague, and because it happens on a day when organised violence is rumored before hand.

       i would be more likely to believe something was connected if violence was supposed to happen in a small quiet town and then it erupts, but not the violent murder capital of the U.S.   I did a quick google search to find Chicago crime from last week, and this one popped up:

       that's 32 people shot over the weekend....   I actually think if only 5 people were shot on a Friday night in Chicago that it's a slow night.

       Years ago, you couldn't own a firearm in Chicago. This was reversed, and now law abiding citizens can have them.  This doesn't magically get rid of all the illegal firearms that are already in the streets, in the hands of criminals.
      </p>

       Chicago also isn't the murder capital of the country. Per capita, Chicago isn't even in the top 30 when it comes to murders.

       Illinois still has pretty heavy regulations. And the point of my comment was, as you said, legislation does not stop criminals from obtaining guns...it just makes it harder for law abiding citizens to do so.

       To be fair....Harvey is only like 20 miles away from Chicago, and Illinois as a whole was ranked 15 of 51 (including DC) in 2015 for murder/non negligent manslaughter per capita, and ranked #4 (including DC) in overall murders/non negligent manslaughter.

       Fair enough. But it still doesn't make it the murder capital. Thank you very much for that source. It's intriguing to see where other states lie.

       It's because unfortunately this is a ever weekend occurrence, not some conspiracy. If you look at litterly every weekends news here it's the same thing. Another string of murders, with  suspects rarely caught. So, no, stop. There's nothing to see here.

       It just seems really deliberate that a string of similar shootings over a relatively short period of time would go so widely unreported...I mean, that online Tribune article was the ONLY report i saw...is that really normal? Not the shootings, but the lack public reports on them? Because that sounds like a real liability to me...

       The Tribune and the Sun-Times are both reporting them, the two major newspaper companies in the city. They hardly ever get into detail and mostly put out blurbs or headlines. This is a very typically weekend, and in the summer it's even worse. Yes even if there is no one in custody, since sadly, there hardly is ever any arrest. Are you from Chicago? Because this seems really normal and you're really reaching for a conspiracy where there is none.

       no I'm not from Chicago...that is why I am asking questions...I'm not "reaching for a conspiracy", i just find the circumstances odd...probably because I'm not from Chicago and things would be very different where I am.

       No it is not strange because dnainfo was in a blackout.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if they reported in detail about every shooting in Chicago it would never end. They usually get blurbs, usually no one is in custody, and no ones screaming conspiracy, you're just freaking because one was on the north side. Otherwise this type of article is 100% typical

       Extremely sad.  The news always leads off with 2 or 3 shootings and those are just the ones reporting.  To be honest though it's only the last couple years that we are seeing robberies and gun violence start to creep into all parts of Chicago.  Growing up as a kid and through my 20s it was always just "stay away from that neighborhood and your ok".

       Yeah the violence has gotten more widespread here and they don't seem to be able to come up with any plans.  The solution is obviously changing the mindset of the inner city youth.  But it's one thing to say it and another thing to do it.  Also, how can you change the mindset of a kid that grows up avoiding bullets and surrounded by "thug life".
      </p>
      <p>
       Last 2 years we strangely had a long line of shooting on the highways from one car to another.  That's when I the news started focusing on violence coming to areas where there never was this violence before.  Scary

       Dude...i was asking questions. It seems odd to me that something like that would go largely unreported and treated so casually. I didn't really grasp just how common shootings in the area are and just how numb to it people there are. So remove your boot from my sack.... :P

       It just seems really deliberate that a string of similar shootings over a relatively short period of time would go so widely unreported...I mean, that online Tribune article was the ONLY report i saw...is that really normal? Not the shootings, but the lack public reports on them? Because that sounds like a real liability to me...
