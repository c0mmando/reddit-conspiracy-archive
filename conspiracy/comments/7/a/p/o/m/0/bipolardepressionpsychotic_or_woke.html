       I am exhibiting signs of bipolar/depression/psychosis according to signs/symptoms posted on the internet. I feel like I am going crazy, but here is the thing, I am not crazy. Everything I read on r/conspiracy is stuff I have already known. I tried to tell people throughout my life and of course they just thought I was insane. It is as simple as this. I am up all night lately, reading, about all this crazy shit that goes on in the world. The real news, not the shit people watch on televison, connecting dots, seeing the world for how it really is and it is not a conspiracy it is fucking real. Now if I was to post any single submission from this sub and post in on Facebook with my own identity to my hundreds of family and friends I have on there, I would get a shit storm of people probably making snide comments or thinking I am losing my mind.  I can stop, get my little 9-5 go to work, go to dinner, buy iphones and than retire and die, the thing is, I fucking can't. I can't unsee what I already know to be true. I can't go to a movie when I know that all these Seth Rogans and shit aren't necessarily the actors that are the most talented or who worked the hardest to get there, but probably just the ones who sucked some billionares cock. I can go on for days and days but I just don't now what to do anymore guys. What good is posting all this shit if we aren't going to do anything about it?

       You have to find friends.  I don't drink, but maybe going to a bar or something to find someone, ask them about harvest 91, something that is obvious and benign.  If they show signs of skepticism, perhaps you can help light their way to go onto your level.

       None of it matters anyway, at least not enough to stress yourself out.  You could die tomorrow and would you think that you had used your time wisely?

       Rather than worrying about a bunch of vague conspiracies, find something you genuinely believe in and go volunteer. Or learn to paint. Something.

       Stick it out bro.  We've got to.  I can relate, as the John Podesta email dump did the same to me when they were initially released.  The ensuing pizzagate "theories" birthed this kind of rabbit hole digging that hasn't stopped since.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best advice I can give is to maybe get off FB a bit and stick to what makes you feel comfortable discussing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I truly believe we are nearing a turning point in all this, given the recent political and movie industrial developments (Clinton being thrown under the bus, 4chan breadcrumb guy, &amp; the Hollyweird sex/rape allegations).  That being said, I feel it's kind of exciting watching this unfold during our lifetime.  It's something special.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ride it out and know that you are not alone in this.  There are people out there that genuinely care about the course of humanity and want nothing but the best for you and I.  Be safe OP, you ain't THAT crazy ;-)

       Truly. I understand how people are attempting to use the word in this context, but it's become a pop culture buzz word that doesn't mean anything most of the time other than to signal to others how hip one is. This doesn't necessarily mean you, but I feel obligated to come in when the subject presents itself.

       I believe you just described what a lot of us are going through/been through.  I also had a terrible time. I was in a state of shock at first. What you are feeling now will get better and you will find yourself in a much happier comfortable place. You are right in saying that we can't 'unsee' and go back to who we were so embrace it and keep going forward. Think yourself lucky because we are witnessing an important and amazing time in history. Find someone that is also 'awake' to talk to. It definitely helps to have someone that is on the same page, or in the same twilight zone as we call it lol  ;)

Without warning, the wizard walks by
Casting his shadow, weaving his spell
Funny clothes, tinkling bell
Never talking
Just keeps walking
spreading his magic" - Black Sabbath, the Wizard

       We live in a fallen world. We were born on an already sinking titanic. Of course you cant go back to sleep once youve woken. The only thing that matters in life, is service to others. Not higher ups, but to fellow man and woman. Mother theresa saw the holy shit moment of indias dying. She was so overwhelmed by the needs of the poor, some of them just needing a clean drink to stay alive, that she never left. She was woke to indias poor people and their plight.

       If you imagine the game shoots and ladders, imagine the elites all have ladders to the top, while seemingly putting all the chutes in place for regular people to fall down. But the elites can never win. There is a slide for them too that they cant cross. The only ladder to the exit, the one with no slide down or back, is service to those weaker and smaller than yourself. Trust me.

       I am right there with you. I have always occasionally gone down the rabbit hole for a day or two, but living in Las Vegas and experiencing the effects of a mass shooting event that was in real time like 1/2 a mile from where you were had taken me to the next level. Seeing Snapchat and tweets pretty much as they happen make you want to know why. What caused this, how was it done, who did it these are things I asked. Funny thing, I had joined Reddit and this sub thread a day or so before this happened and ever since then there have just been so many coincidences that have happened to me. Not sure if I am just paying more attention to events in my life or I have lost my damn mind. Nobody takes me serious when I talk about these said coincidences and people think my want to be prepared is pointless. I have even been asked if I was on meth, making me think do I act like that?  I get pretty passionate about my point of view and sometimes my way of thinking is nowhere inline with any of my direct peers. It’s an interesting time now and forward thinkers are going to be the people that move us forward. Sorry for the TL post. I just get where you are coming from and wanted to pose some insight into your OP. You aren’t crazy. Or maybe you are. Who knows who cares.

       A lot of conspiracy theory is one long chain of guesses, coincidences, and theories, not facts. The deeper in you go, the more you fill in the gaps with more guesses, coincidences, and theories and the more you forget how you got to where you are. Many people aren't intrigued or interested in these things so the deeper in you are the less they can relate to what you're talking about. People can relate to the "magic bullet" question about the JFK assassination because it's only one step away from the fact that he was shot but as soon as you forget that "magic bullet" question isn't settled and build deeper the less they can relate.

       I will say that I've been open-minded and don't take whatever is being told, but it wasn't until the Vegas shit, that I felt like I went through some sort of awakening. Even believing that there are major conspiracies didn't really prepare me to realize that we were all being lied to in big ways. I mean, that was the police! the FBI! the reporters! the President!

       Not sure if it was on a TIL or some other sub, but remembered a post about Paris syndrome:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It helped to realize that I wasn't insane and was just experiencing a shift in what I thought to be true and now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also went through the whole wanting to post on facebook and realized that my friends would think I'm insane. Instead, I messaged a couple that were open-minded but then just left it alone and stuck to less identified spots. Right now, you don't need to try and 'prove' it to others, but instead work on yourself. Personally, I'm a lot better than I was at the beginning of October. I'm trying to tune it out a bit so that I don't stay up late researching, but it was just a 'Holy fuck! This other thing, too, was fake! And this! And this!'
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, just take a breath and realize that you aren't alone. Also, remember this because you need to have some empathy for others who go through the same and need a little help to get though without losing their fucking mind.

       There's a lot of things that could cause depression. It could very well be caused by all the fucking disgusting shit you know about but it could just as well be caused by lack of sunlight, lack of exercise, malnutrition, genetic disposition to mental illness etc. I think you can easily find a lot of info how to deal with depressive thoughts caused by all this but if you want to read the best info about physiological aspects of depression and other mental illnesses you should definitely read Nutrient power by William Walsh. He's done so much in this field.
