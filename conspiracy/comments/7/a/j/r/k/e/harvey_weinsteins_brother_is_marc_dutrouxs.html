    <div class="md"><p>Article translated with Google</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marc Dutroux spoke today from his cell in Mexico City about the rape charges against Harvey Weinstein, a Hollywood producer.</p>

<p>He claims that if he had been left at liberty, he would have, after removing Bernard, executed Harvey the rapist in the same way.</p>

<p>Recall of facts:</p>

<p>ARLON After the sequestration of Pierre Rochow, Philippe Divers and Benedicte Jadot in the story of the theft of the Fabricom truck, relations between Dutroux and Weinstein deteriorated. We are there in November 1995.</p>

<p>Weinstein is wanted for this episode. Dutroux knows that if he gets caught, he runs to disaster. It is there that germinates in his mind the idea of ​​liquidating Weinstein. The latter does not suspect anything and apparently wants to flee abroad. Either in Hungary, at Gérard Pinon, or back in France. Dutroux and he consult Nihoul on this subject for obtaining false papers.</p>

<p>But before deleting it, Dutroux wants to take over Bernard Weinstein&#39;s money. He will then sequester it in the Marcinelle cache between 13 and 20 November. He will explain to Julie and Melissa that it is the bad guy who wants to hurt them. While Weinstein will be in the cache, they will move freely around the house.</p>

<p>Weinstein, meanwhile, will eat loaf of pies filled, without his knowledge, Rohypnol.</p>

<p>Once back to him, he will be tortured. Dutroux will place the testicles in clamps. He has no choice but to confess where he has hidden his money and Dutroux will only have to liquidate it.</p>

<p>Dutroux will proceed exactly as in the case of An and Eefje. He dug a hole in his property in Sars-la-Buissière, where he will throw Weinstein alive before covering it with earth.</p>

<p>The experts are formal, they found exactly the same things on the bodies of An and Eefje as on that of Weinstein.</p>

<p>Dutroux has accused Pinon and Martin, this similarity with An and Eefje tells the judge that it accredits the fact that not only Dutroux participated in the elimination of teenage girls, but that it is he who deleted Weinstein.
The charges were rife Tuesday (October 10th) against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, including several leading actresses, but also other women, three of whom claim that the tycoon raped them.</p>

<p>After the New York Times revelations on Thursday that sparked the scandal, The New Yorker magazine took over, publishing an article containing overwhelming evidence.</p>

<p>Italian actress Asia Argento and two other women claim to have been raped by the co-founder of the Miramax studio, which revolutionized independent cinema in Hollywood in the 1980s and even more in 1990. According to the daughter of director Dario Argento, Harvey Weinstein would have a non-consensual oral sex with her in 1997 in a hotel room on the Côte d&#39;Azur.</p>

<p>Read also: Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein now charged with rape</p>

<p>In the same article, actress Lucia Evans accuses the producer of having forced her to give him a blowjob in 2004; finally, another young woman, who wished to remain anonymous, accuses her of forced sexual intercourse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find the beginning really interesting:</p>

<p>Marc Dutroux spoke today from his cell in Mexico City about the rape charges against Harvey Weinstein, a Hollywood producer.</p>

<p>He claims that if he had been left at liberty, he would have, after removing Bernard, executed Harvey the rapist in the same way.</p>

<p>wtf?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Marc Dutroux isn&#39;t in Mexico City, though, he&#39;s in a cell somewhere in Belgium, I live in Belgium...</p>

<p>I mean, the names obviously match up, and from all that I&#39;ve read about the Dutroux case: Hollywood (aswell as royalty and business elite) were mentioned as being the guests to the &quot;sex-parties&quot; and rituals held.</p>

<p>I&#39;dd say there&#39;s a high chance of this being true (brothers), but I wonder why the article states Marc Dutroux is in a cell in New Mexico.</p>

<p>I definitely haven&#39;t seen anything about this in the Flemish news papers, though I don&#39;t think they&#39;dd even print this. Our media, like the USA, has a strict narrative they follow.</p>

<p>I&#39;dd say is definitely a lead worth investigating, though it&#39;s just speculation for now.</p>
