       There is absolutely nothing that says he was the festival lawyer NOR Jason Aldeans. Please people do your own research before giving backing to things like this. They just end up discrediting the whole story.

       Not in the article cited, but...
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a story from The Argus Leader, which is the daily newspaper of Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The article is from July 19, 2015.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <a href="http://www.argusleader.com/story/mattzimmer/2015/07/19/outtakes-with-jed-lance-jason-aldean-lawyer/30362445/">
         Outtakes with Jed Lance and Jason Aldean's lawyer
        </a>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The story is mostly about Jed Lance, but the author was also able to speak with Orville Almon - Jason Aldean's attorney at the time the article was written.  I'm assuming he was still Aldean's attorney, but I don't know for sure.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Still, maybe the most entertaining part of working on the story was my interview with Orville Almon, the Nashville entertainment lawyer who acted as a sort of manager/agent for Jed.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Almon is still very much active in the business today, counting Jason Aldean as one of his clients.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I tried searching to see if Almon was the Route 91 Harvest Festival attorney.
      </p>
      <p>
       The concert itself wouldn't have had an attorney. People filing lawsuits are not going to be filing them against the Route 91 Harvest Festival. They'd be filing them against Live Nation - the concert's promoters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did a search and found references to two law firms representing Live Nation in previous cases. One was Greenberg Traurig LLP and the other was Latham &amp; Watkins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Orville Almon's law practice was called Almon &amp; Pike. I can't find any links at all between them and Live Nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       think he was probably Aldean's lawyer, I don't think he was a lawyer for Live Nation.

       Honestly kudos to you for digging that deep. I couldn’t find anything that led me to believe he was a lawyer for either party, but go figure he was for Jason Aldean. However, I fail to see how this would lead to added suspicion in the story. If the lawyer had been seen making accusations of multiple gunmen/conflicting the narrative I could see it, but it honestly just seems like an old guy in a stress full job passed away to me.

       And keep in mind Almon was an entertainment lawyer  not q criminal lawyer..  He would have been the one to draw up contracts, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Minor correction here.  Almon's law firm used to be called Almon &amp;
       <strong>
        Mc
       </strong>
       Pike but I guess McPike retired or left and effective February of 2017 it was renamed Alom Law according to the firms twitter account.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, and I haven't verified this, but it's my understanding that Almon was not licensed to practice law in Nevada.
      </p>
      <p>
       One other thought I had is that people could sue the concert promoters (Live Nation) but they could also sue the owners of Las Vegas Village - the concert venue.
      </p>
      <p>
       And who owns Las Vegas Village you might ask?
      </p>
      <p>
       MGM RESORTS FESTIVAL GROUNDS LLC

       I never see the media bring that up.

      <p>
       Same company owns the hotel where the shooter allegedly was staying and the concert venue where most/all of the victims were killed.  Convenient, no?

       That's fine by me.  I've posted it as a comment a couple of times but never as it's own post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind as the owners, MGM would know every square inch of that place.  Also I think I saw a vieo that proved there were at least some security cameras at the venue, yet we haven't seen anything from those.  Not expecting to see people being shot mind you, but maybe some shots before the shootings showing what areas of the venue could be seen.
