<p>I am linking this post because it does a great job of summarizing the hate surrounding <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>. In the link, the comments go on to bash Trump with focus on T_D, and I engage them in debate. </p>

<p><a href="https://NP.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/7a6n6n/spez_returns_to_rannouncements_to_do_an_ama_much/">https://NP.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/7a6n6n/spez_returns_to_rannouncements_to_do_an_ama_much/</a></p>

<p>99.9% of the drama in the AMA was about banning  <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>, or the Donald as a controversial topic in general. </p>

<p>Do you all think all of this hate is organic? I argues with some of these people. They are insane, deluded, and refuse to look at facts. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll link some of my arguments/&quot;discussions&quot;</p>

<p>What the heck is with all of this hate? 
* The dam sub is pretty mych isolated from the rest of reddit. 
* They are not allowed to post a link to another sub- they have to take a pic and remove the sub name, they don&#39;t hit the front page, 
* They can&#39;t name another sub like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, it used to come out as <a href="/r/redacted">/r/redacted</a>
* Overall, the left is less violent than the right
* A small sub reddit, even if did spew hate, did not reach near as many people as Hillary and Obama, and the media repeatedly calling all Trump supporters; uneducated, Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, irredeemable, not America,and a basket of deplorable. This is  much worse than anything a small isolated sub reddit can do. </p>

<p>I am totally confused. WTF is going on in this world? Can someone help me connect the dots in my head logically? </p>

Some moderators (looking at you <a href="/r/offmychest">/r/offmychest</a>) even go so far as to ban people who subscribe to TD regardless of posting history or hateful comments. Reddit censors things and this has been made a parent many times over when right-leaning things never make it to all despite lots of up votes to get there. Its unfortunate but what can you do, you know. That&#39;s why no single website is a good source for anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s alot of things. Yes people don&#39;t like trump so anything associated with him is gonna get hate. At the same time t_d has pulled alot of shit over the past year or so, all those things you listed are direct results of those things. T_d folks also regularly go out of their way to go to other subs and &quot;red pill&quot; those subs, then cry fowl when they get yelled at / banned. I have zero problem with the sub existing everyone should have a place to go talk with folks they agree with but t_d tends to skate on really thin ice and needs to cut some of the bs out before they get removed and we all have to listen to their bitching.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me clarify, they must have been breaking rules before I joined or paid attention. i can see that. I guess my concern is banning them for what they are now. They are basically pigeon holed.  </p>

<p>They used to title stuff like &quot;get this to the front page.&quot;</p>

<p>Back when I was a Bernie bro I used to see their posts hitting the front page often. It was annoying, but i just figured they were high spirited. I remember that one sub, circlejerk I think it is, would dominate the front page from time to time just to mess with people. </p>

<p>I just figured T_D was doing that. I could not stand them back then. And you still can&#39;t go there for non-partisan discussion. It&#39;s gung-ho Trump or go home. </p>

<p>Hold on thier skippy. Someone that was a user on T_D killed his father. That does lead into T_D drove him to kill his parents. </p>

<p>And if you want to go there, then allow me point out the violence the left has carried out. Let&#39;s not forget that the President of the US and the DNC Presidential candidate said for months that all Trump supporters are acist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, irredeemable, not America,and a basket of deplorables. </p>

<p>I would say that drives hatred more than a small sub on Reddit. </p>

<p>So, lets look at violence committed by your people one the left:</p>

<p>This: <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article156228494.html">Terrorism experts say Virginia shooting highlights disturbing increase in left-wing violence To be clear, this guy said he was coming after Trump because of his opposite beliefs</a> </p>

<p>Is more concerning than anything you wrote. You failed to address the terrorist experts being concerned with violence from the left. If the right is worse, you certainly have a source for the same for the right? Yes? Numerous articles about terrorism experts worrying about the left. </p>

<p>You need me to link more? </p>

<p>**Before I continue; are you saying the right, Trump supporters, since Trump ran for office, are more violent than the left?  </p>

<p>I do not care to talk about someone shooting a church in 2015. That is not what this is about. </p>

<p>I want to make it perfectly clear that this is about people on the left complaining about violence done by Trump supporters, and T_D subscribers; when ironically, the left has been much much much more violent. </p>

<p>Se lets make your position perfectly clear before I tear your argument to shreds showing how violent the left has been. <a href="https://i.redd.it/1j3aqtu0xzwx.png">Stronger Together</a>**</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Violence committed by the left far out numbers violence committed by Trump and or T_D since Trump began running for president. </p>

<p>Because that person killed his father and sub&#39;d to T_D does not mean T_D inspired or drove him to do that. </p>

<p>However, i will say vitriolic statements made by Hillary and Obama against Trump supporters have drive much of the violence and hatred against Trump, and Trump&#39;s own words manipulated by the media added spark to the fire. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. He was a frequent commenter there and used their rhetoric to justify his act. He&#39;s a byproduct of an extremely toxic group. If you want to point to extreme left violence, you certainly can. But the only deaths we can attribute to either group at the moment is this kid&#39;s father, the woman an alt-righter ran over, individuals at the mosque that was attacked last year, Dylan Roof&#39;s victims, and I&#39;m sure others I haven&#39;t even considered. Violence happens on both sides, but one group is winning the war on who can kill the most in the name of their cause. </p>

<p>You have something top back this up? A facebook post saying he was inspired by hatred for the left and going to act on it? Something like that? </p>

<p>I can go on, but the point is, saying that kid killed his father because of T_D passes no test. It&#39;s pure BS aimed at getting T_D shut down. </p>

<p>I will argue; however, the rhetoric where Hillary and Obama toured the country for 6+ months telling everyone they came across that all Trump supporters are racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, irredeemable, not America,and a basket of deplorables, then have the mdeia repeat it over and over does more to incite violence than a small sub reddit with a few thousand subscribers that has now been pigeon holed. </p>

<p>You should be outraged at the real rebel rousers and stop trying to shut down a sub that has been pigeon holed. Get over the election loss. Trump is your president, and with the type of behavior everyone one of you I have argued with displayed, he will your president another 7 years. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t tell you  I&#39;ve been called; Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, irredeemable, not America, deplorable, black feminist, live a sad life, muslim terrorist, delusional, actively preach hate against LGBT, gullible, terrible person, embarassment to America, and a disgrace to the human race. All because I defended T_D as I am doing here. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t give a shit whether you believe me or not when  I say I am none of those things. But you better believe it pisses me off and I will make dam sure I go to the polls and vote against your candidate in 2020. and many people like me will do the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No sir. You are not correct. </p>

<p>/U/Spez banned the subreddit <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a>, but allowed an actual pedophile sub called <a href="/r/pedofriends">/r/pedofriends</a> to remain. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/r/Pedofriends">/r/Pedofriends</a> is a text only subreddit hosted on Reddit and open to all. The forum takes advantage of a loophole in the law – text discussion of paedophilia is legal in Britain, the United States and other English speaking countries. The subreddit claims to only allow constructive discussion amongst paedophiles who wish to resist their urges and change their ways. It claims that discussion of children and illegal activities is prohibited</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://matthewhopkinsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PFEvidenceA.png">yet they posted stuff like this, and it was allowed</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Under Steve Huffman’s leadership Reddit bans Conservative forums, but acts as a haven for pedophiles to discuss how oppressed they feel when searching for child pornography on Google causes legal warnings to appear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Users in T_D had called for <a href="/r/pedofriends">/r/pedofriends</a> to be shut down for quite some time, but their requests were ignored. Seemingly, out of the blue, <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> was shut down. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://matthewhopkinsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PFEvidenceB.png">Other topics of conversation include sharing angst about the challenges those members who work with children face in their day to day jobs </a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://matthewhopkinsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PFEvidenceC.png">Other topics of discussion include how best to legalise child pornography.</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://matthewhopkinsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PFEvidenceD.png">Users of the forum also discuss their opinion that there are, ‘obvious problems’ with the current age of consent system. The remarks are very similar in concept, (if not eloquence) to Peter Tatchell’s remarks in a Betrayal of Youth. The left and paedophilia apology have ever gone hand in hand.</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Emails were sent to the reddit executives expressing concern and disgust with the pedophile sub reddit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my email, I put things to the Reddit executives in graphic terms. Amongst other things the email said,</p>

<p>[…] It is my understanding that there is a public subreddit called <a href="/r/PedoFriends">/r/PedoFriends</a> and an associated private subreddit called <a href="/r/PedoChat">/r/PedoChat</a>. I am told that topics of conversation include the nutritional value of semen. The nutritional value to growing pre-teens.</p>

<p>I am also told you are on notice of the existence of these subreddits and have allowed them to remain. I consider an article about this to be very much in the public interest. Many people feel it is incredible that Steve has such hostility for <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> but allows those other subreddits with nary a word.</p>

<p>Given the apparent support of Reddit’s leadership for this minority group I consider you should all receive credit. The proposed headline writes itself – “PedoFriends”. Can I have your preferred press pictures to place in a row underneath? […]”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See the problem yet? As well as <a href="/r/Pedofriends">/r/Pedofriends</a> there is also a board called <a href="/r/Pedochat">/r/Pedochat</a> that is private. This is said to have less restrictive rules.</p>

<p>Out of utter frustration, users of T_D began calling Spez a pedophile in posts. Instead of closing the pedophile forum, as he closed <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a>, Spez violated the prime directive of Reddit and edited every instance of him being called a pedophile with the names of mods from  from T_D. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went there last night and was in a post about Hillary explaining off funding the Dossier. </p>

<p>Somehow, the conversation shifted to steroids. A dialogue opened up about steroids. All of the posters knew what they were talking about. They were spot on. </p>

<p>I love that about T_D. People seem to know their shit about what they speak of. </p>

<p>I go into another forum or sub not dedicated to steroids, and peopel spout off bullshit talking points and they don&#39;t know WTF they are talking about. </p>

<p>I really like going into a forum/sub where people know what they talk about, especially when the sub is not dedicated to that topic. </p>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t.  People are sick of t_d posters brigading every subreddit that says mean things about trump.  This sub is basically a mirror of t_d at the moment, with t_d posters constantly starting threads about HRC and the DNC.  It&#39;s not isolated at all, their shit leaks into every facet of this website.  Posts about HRC get downvoted on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> because everyone is incredibly sick of hearing about her, and they also already know that sanders got fucked by the DNC.  </p>

<p>This is a false aligation!!!  We are not allowed to mention another sub in T_D. We have to take screen shots of another sub and not include the ub name if we wish to expose comments, or something in another sub. We are not allowed to mention <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> at all. It is called <a href="/r/redacted">/r/redacted</a>. Loolk ujp <a href="/r/redacted">/r/redacted</a>. </p>

<p><a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> loves HRC, dont tell me that crap. Tehy want Trump to step down so she can move up. I&#39;ve seen it mentioned in there many many times. </p>

<p>**Before I continue; are you saying the right, Trump supporters, since Trump ran for office, are more violent than the left?  </p>

<p>I do not care to talk about someone shooting a church in 2015. That is not what this is about. </p>

<p>I want to make it perfectly clear that this is about people on the left complaining about violence done by Trump supporters, and T_D subscribers; when ironically, the left has been much much much more violent. </p>

<p>Se lets make your position perfectly clear before I tear your argument to shreds showing how violent the left has been. <a href="https://i.redd.it/1j3aqtu0xzwx.png">Stronger Together</a>**</p>
