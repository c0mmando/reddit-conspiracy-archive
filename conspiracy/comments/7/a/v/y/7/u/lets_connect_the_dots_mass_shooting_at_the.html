<p>It looks like it could go one of two ways. A) they had something to do with the shooting and perhaps something bigger was going down. Speculation is weapons or pizza B) their interference in US politics through lobbying and bribing politicians like Clinton</p>

<p>I hadn&#39;t heard that before, but it would make sense of the whole Las Vegas shooting. Plan/stage a mass shooting, assassinate the Prince and say he was a victim of the shooting.</p>

<p>Or else someone knew about a plan to arrest or assassinate the Prince, and planned/staged the shooting for cover to get him out.</p>

When the security guard saw who it was he had to let them go because they were royal family or more likely body guards/ soldiers.  So he shut his mouth for 70 minutes until the VIP was gone</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, it&#39;s the Four Seasons, just to be nit picky. </p>

<p>42.5% owned by Saudi prince known to &quot;donate&quot; large funds to Clinton Foundation, another 42.5% owned by Bill Gates. </p>

<p>My guess, paddock helped traffic kids for the CIA &amp; got his weapons sent from the top floor through a Saudi-owned chopper, that&#39;s all I can say there. </p>

<p>I personally think the arrests were really to stop them from doing whatever could possibly aid the individuals who will all be prosecuted by Monday/Tuesday. Don&#39;t forget, it isn&#39;t just like 5-10 people arrested in SA: it&#39;s about 80 honestly considering members of their defense agencies have been arrested as well. All of these people could be swayed to act in whatever way deemed necessary by those named in these recent sealed indictments...easier to start with the cronies before you hit the boss in the dungeon right?  </p>

<p>The storm hits this week I think. Hope. </p>

<p>...........</p>

<p>Yeah. You don&#39;t see anyone or anything being shot or having been shot, because no one was shot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didn’t attend my friends funeral.... </p>

<p>You might be sadly mistaken there.... if you go into my history you will find the link to our invite and also talking with someone else who felt it didn’t happen.</p>

<p>This hit too close to home for me. I am someone who thought sandy hook was a fake. And now... here I am missing my friend, Brennan Stewart’s presence. He didn’t have to even talk to you for that smile to light up the room. </p>

<p>I remember he was a grade ahead of us. He gave me my first pooka shell necklaces.</p>

<p>Good guy. Rip. </p>

<p>:/</p>

<p>FWIW... I don’t blame you for thinking it may not have happened because I have been there with sandy hook and I’ve seen the crisis actors. Maybe it happened with both in Las Vegas? </p>

<p>Maybe... innocent people did die but crisis actors were there to tell a different story. After all, witnesses are dying. </p>

<p>Just food for thought not an attack. I don’t want to let the loss of a friend and my beautiful home dictate how I treat you. </p>

<p>We are all here to ask questions and that’s the point of the sub. So.... that’s just my food for thought. </p>
