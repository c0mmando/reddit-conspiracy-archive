       Yep, fleeing by helicopter from the rooftop, which is accessible from the Four Seasons. Don’t know if it’s true, but it’s what I’ve seen discussed

       I believe one of the choppers couldn't be accounted for even after contacting the tourist companies and some type of flight website. I didn't do that research but I believe there was one that wasn't police, media or anything else. No flight plan found. Ppl speculated about shooters from up there but that was debunked. Perhaps THIS is the explanation.

       Fucking crazy. He also owns a great deal of twitter. I imagine he wouldn't be getting arrested, unless he was apart of something really foul, due to like you said, someone that rich never getting arrested.

       To be honest, I'm not sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks like it could go one of two ways. A) they had something to do with the shooting and perhaps something bigger was going down. Speculation is weapons or pizza B) their interference in US politics through lobbying and bribing politicians like Clinton

       It could even be both, as we know for sure there are deep Clinton/Podesta ties with not just Saudi but specifically Talal as well. And what we've learned about the shooting thus far isn't adding up, especially how he get all of those weapons in there and had them all sprawled out like that.

       I hadn't heard that before, but it would make sense of the whole Las Vegas shooting. Plan/stage a mass shooting, assassinate the Prince and say he was a victim of the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or else someone knew about a plan to arrest or assassinate the Prince, and planned/staged the shooting for cover to get him out.

       The theory I lean towards believing the most.  There was some kind of deal going down in that room and when it went wrong the shooter shot Paddock and then the crowd. When the security guard saw who it was he had to let them go because they were royal family or more likely body guards/ soldiers.  So he shut his mouth for 70 minutes until the VIP was gone

       Shooting fuel tanks may have been diversionary tactic to give chopper cover for escape, or to keep local law enforcement occupied, or saw military recruitment trucks and thought they were there for target, so tried to shoot tanks to blow them all up near army trucks at country concert for recruitment.

       I think you mean the four seasons hotel inside of Mandalay Bay, as the Mandalay Bay itself is owned by MGM Resorts, which is ran by James Murren, I could be wrong but I'm pretty confident there is no Saudi Prince named James

       First off, it's the Four Seasons, just to be nit picky.
      </p>
      <p>
       42.5% owned by Saudi prince known to "donate" large funds to Clinton Foundation, another 42.5% owned by Bill Gates.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess, paddock helped traffic kids for the CIA &amp; got his weapons sent from the top floor through a Saudi-owned chopper, that's all I can say there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally think the arrests were really to stop them from doing whatever could possibly aid the individuals who will all be prosecuted by Monday/Tuesday. Don't forget, it isn't just like 5-10 people arrested in SA: it's about 80 honestly considering members of their defense agencies have been arrested as well. All of these people could be swayed to act in whatever way deemed necessary by those named in these recent sealed indictments...easier to start with the cronies before you hit the boss in the dungeon right?

       The storm hits this week I think. Hope.

       "Alrighty Steve, remember the plan? Go down a couple more floors so no one connects the dots too fast:)" probably how that happened.

       Really though, thank you for clarification, it's better to have exact numbers. I see how this can put a hole in my &amp; other's theory on this matter yet I'm more inclined to believe Paddock was given all the tools necessary to do what he did from either three letter agencies or extremely wealthy individuals both American &amp; not.

       It's interesting pondering this scenario isn't it? I've attempted to lessen this pattern though as I see it being redundant, to an extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shooting was nothing more than a tool to give the MSM a topic that could distract the masses from little breadcrumbs the paranoid/truly vigilant will recognize as dominos falling. Unless of course it served a greater purpose by way of symbolism towards a specific group but that could easily coincide with my prior guess.

       No, the owner of the Mandalay is not a Saudi prince. Mandalay is the hotel it’s self, the top 4 floors are Four Seasons which are however owned by a Saudi prince.
