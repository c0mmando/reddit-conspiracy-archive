        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>First of all, I would like to preface this post by making a few points.</strong>  </p>

<p>1:  This post is not intended to denigrate any ethnicity or religion, it is just an interesting historical anomaly that I would like to discuss.</p>

<p>2:  I am not &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; and I have no agenda to push, I just wanted to share what I believe I have found and discuss it with open minded people.</p>

<p>3:  I have not made a post of this nature before so I apologize for poor formatting.</p>

<p>Recently I found myself going down a pretty old rabbit hole.  In a conversation on Reddit I got into a discussion about the possibility of human sacrifice having been a piece of Jewish religious identity in the past.  At the time my argument was that the number of alleged human sacrifices through out history tended to make me believe that it was perhaps possible, historically, that there was a basis in fact for these allegations.</p>

<p>I took to Google to try to search out for historical cases, knowing that there were at least some Catholic child Saints that were canonized due to the belief that they had been sacrificed in a religious ritual perpetrated by people of Jewish faith.</p>

<p>Obviously these searches only yielded two types of results.  I found obviously anti-Semitic websites and lots of references on Wikipedia to &quot;debunked&quot; claims of &quot;Blood Libel&quot;. </p>

<p>For Instance:</p>

<p>1823–35 Velizh blood libel: After a Christian child was found murdered outside of this small Russian town in 1823, accusations by a drunk prostitute led to the imprisonment of many local Jews. Some were not released until 1835.</p>

<p>1840 Damascus affair: In February, at Damascus, a Catholic monk named Father Thomas and his servant disappeared. The accusation of ritual murder was brought against members of the Jewish community of Damascus.</p>

<p>1840 Rhodes blood libel: The Jews of Rhodes, under the Ottoman Empire, were accused of murdering a Greek Christian boy. The libel was supported by the local governor and the European consuls posted to Rhodes. Several Jews were arrested and tortured, and the entire Jewish quarter was blockaded for twelve days. An investigation carried out by the central Ottoman government found the Jews to be innocent.</p>

<p>In 1840, David Drach, the son of the Head Rabbi of Paris and a convert to Christianity, wrote in his book De L’harmonie Entre L’eglise et la Synagogue, that a Catholic priest in Damascus in that year had been ritually killed and the murder covered up by powerful Jews in Europe.</p>

<p>In March 1879, ten Jewish men from a mountain village were brought to Kutaisi, Georgia to stand trial for the alleged kidnapping and murder of a Christian girl. The case attracted a great deal of attention in Russia (of which Georgia was then a part): &quot;While periodicals as diverse in tendency as Herald of Europe and Saint Petersburg Notices expressed their amazement that medieval prejudice should have found a place in the modern judiciary of a civilized state, New Times hinted darkly of strange Jewish sects with unknown practices.&quot;[40] The trial ended in acquittal, and the orientalist Daniel Chwolson published a refutation of the blood libel.</p>

<p>Here are some Wikipedia links:</p>

<p>I will not be linking to anything that I found that I deem to be obviously hate driven.</p>

<p><strong>Now, the definition as given by Meriam Webster for Blood Libel is thus:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>the false and maliciously perpetuated accusation that Jews have murdered non-Jews (such as Christian children) in order to use their blood in rituals</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/blood%20libel">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/blood%20libel</a></p>

<p>(We will come back to this link)</p>

<p>I also found some books published in previous centuries that were collections of first hand accounts of trials that occurred throughout the 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th centuries in which Jews were tried and found guilty of Ritual Sacrifice.  These books, besides having a lot of interesting information, were obviously written by people that <strong>hated</strong> Jews with a passion.  The difference I noted however was that in these cases their hatred did not seem to be blind.  These were scholars and linguists who had translated parts of the Talmud and found things that shocked, angered and frightened them.  </p>

Zamyslovsky</a></p>

<p>I decided to read the Talmud to try to corroborate or debunk their claims.</p>

<p><strong>That is where I ran into what I believe was a secret reformation of the Jewish faith.</strong></p>

<p>I came upon <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/FullTalmud.pdf">this</a> 1903 English translation of the Talmud by MICHAEL L. RODKINSON.  In the preface to this translation the author makes it clear that it has not only been translated, but has been <strong>edited</strong>.  Here are a few of his remarks on why:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To reproduce it as it is in the original is in our judgment an impossible task. Men like Pinner and Rawicz have
tried to do so with single tracts, and have only succeeded in, at the best, giving translations to
the world which are not only not correct but also not readable. If it were translated from the
original text one would not see the forest through the trees. For, as we have said above,
throughout the ages there have been added to the text marginal notes, explanatory words, and
whole phrases and sentences inserted in malice or ignorance, by its enemies and its friends...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Side note, I could not find either of the other mentioned translations.  It appears the Penner translation only published a single volume before having Penner was denounced and demanded to stop by high ranking Jewish leaders)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In other words, we have merely removed from the text those accretions that were
added from outside sources, which have proven so fruitful a source of misunderstanding and
misrepresentation.  We continue our labors in the full and certain hope that &quot;he who comes to purify receives divine
help,&quot; and that in our task of removing the additions made by the enemies of the Talmud we
shall be purifying it from the most fruitful source of the attacks made on it, and thereunto we
hope for the help of Heaven...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now back to the Meriam Webber definition of Blood Libel.  At the bottom of the page I found this:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>First Known Use: 1911</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe that in correlation with this translation, there was a deliberate effort to remove from the Talmud mentions of Ritual Sacrifice and blood rites that were previously included.  Even still, this version still retains 381 references to the &quot;Gentile&quot; which I am still sorting through.</p>

<p>I believe this reformation was carried out in secret because it was possible that some of the references to &quot;Gentiles&quot; would have been incredibly damaging to Jewish relations had they been revealed to a much wider audience through a translation onto a modern language.  </p>

<p>In addition to the removal of references to Jewish supremacy and blood rites, they also created a new term to obfuscate their past, that of &quot;Blood Libel&quot; which conveniently found it&#39;s first usage within only a few years of the release of the first English translation of the Talmud.</p>

<p>The Talmud in it&#39;s original form was written in a collection of multiple difficult languages and was all but impossible for the uninitiated to comprehend.  By translating and editing the release of the Talmud into modern language, the Jewish people were able to reform their religion in secret.</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;Not only is the ADL emphatically not a Jewish civil rights lobby; the ADL and its parent agency B&#39;nai B&#39;rith have been from their inception, arms of the British secret intelligence services and secret societies that are sworn enemies of the United States. The B&#39;nai B&#39;rith and the ADL have used their nominal Jewishness to conceal their actual allegiance and agenda.&quot; (&quot;Ugly Truth&quot; p. 3)</p>

<p>The B&#39;nai B&#39;rith/ Scottish Rite was instrumental in starting the Ku Klux Klan and causing the US Civil War, which destroyed the flower of American manhood. A B&#39;nai B&#39;rith leader, Simon Wolf, was a Confederate spy and was implicated in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the first of many such coup d&#39;etats (i.e. the assassinations of Presidents Garfield, McKinley, Kennedy.)&quot;</p>

<p>Kind of. The rot of occultism had been present in Judaism long before that, it was going on in Jesus&#39; time, just as the rot of occultism slowly took over Christianity after Constantine. </p>

<p>The best comprehensive work on this subject is Bill Cooper&#39;s Mystery Babylon, which traces the work of the Mystery Schools from ancient times up until now:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t necessarily mean a true reformation.  I believe that before this translation the Talmud was very open about Jewish supremacy, Ritual Sacrifice and considering &quot;Gentiles&quot; as no better than beasts.</p>

<p>I believe that these passages were edited out in an attempt to paint Judaism in a more widely acceptable light because they realized that a translation into a more modern language was unavoidable.</p>

<p>I believe the Pinner translation (which attempted to be a &#39;word for word&#39; translation) was stopped because they realized the blowback they would receive when heretofore uninitiated people read passages of this nature.</p>

<p>I can offer no opinion on whether there was any change in behavior by Jewish people as a result of what I am calling a reformation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this post points out at least one very concerted effort to release a version of the Talmud to a wider public audience that was edited with the clear intent to remove those passages that their &quot;enemies would use against&quot; them.  </p>

<p>This seems to indicate to me that before this reformation the content of this version of the Talmud was quite a bit more divisive than what we have access to today.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but wonder what was removed, but from my research there are few copies left of the Talmud in it&#39;s original form, and these seem to be not available to the general public.  What is in the original that we are not allowed to see?</p>

<p>The only way we get around this is to follow the other clues. It might be worthwile for you to look at the jews immigration to the US in the 1840s (20 YEARS BEFORE THE (((((((CIVIL WAR))))))))) ). Any changes or slight reformation you see could very well be their manipulations to enter the US, a CHRISTIAN country. </p>

<p>they never seem to amuse the idea that a jew could commit a crime </p>

<p>Also, physiology and religion are definitely connected. Jews reportedly have a weird fisure of rolando, where language is processed. Their selfish, primal pleasure philosophy is likely a result of their larger rear skulls, where the reptilian center is located. Not to mention they are heavily inbred. </p>

<p>ADL was likely formed to work with the federal reserve. Whatever excuse they used is akin to the civil war legally being about slavery but not actually. </p>

<p>And now that you&#39;ve seen the graph consider this part of the article of secession: </p>

<p>Sectional interest and animosity will deepen the irritation, and all hope of remedy is rendered vain, by the fact that public
opinion at the North has invested a great political error with the sanction of more erroneous religious belief. </p>

<p>and the fact they cite &quot;20 years&quot; of disobeyed laws. </p>

<p>I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars--I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is another rabbit hole entirely.  There is a distinction between Talmudic Jews and others.  Perhaps you have a point.  There is also another version of the Talmud I have yet to look into, the so-called Jerusalem Talmud.</p>

<p>I would be very interested to learn more on this subject, but it is incredibly difficult to research.  Too many extremists on both sides to sort through the bullshit.</p>

<p>In this case, it isn&#39;t just the names.  I believe with this translation they altered many of the core concepts in order to make it palatable to a wider audience.  Before this translation the Talmud was in multiple difficult languages, nearly indecipherable for the uninitiated or linguistic scholars. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously anyone with modern scientific knowledge knows a mammal consuming its own species blood or flesh incurs prions and changes the way their brain folds proteins, and they slowly go insane and suffer dementia to the degree of consumption.</p>

<p>So.... Has anyone found any historical texts describing any possible ancient, pre-prions-knowledge-motivation for these blood drinking ceremonies ?  </p>

<p>Perhaps the idea that drinking the blood of any particular group you plan to study/hunt/confront/destroy, would give the plotting group an advantage against the group whose blood was consumed ?</p>

<p>Perhaps they thought once a mammal has tasted the blood of another group, they will biologically feel superior and predatory towards them?  And so they sought to do this, as a primitive guesswork tactic to overcome the deep fear of Europeans whom they could not ever conquer physically like they could other groups ?</p>

<p>I read another supposition that the act rose from a passage in the Talmud that was basically (Paraphrased):</p>

<p>The people shall rise like a lion...  And quench their thirst on the enemies (?) blood.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember enough of the quote to offer that as anything close to a fact.  If I find it in my reading I will correct this, but it was something like that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I was just looking at this yesterday.
<a href="http://www.radioislam.org/islam/english/toread/toaff_book.htm">http://www.radioislam.org/islam/english/toread/toaff_book.htm</a></p>

<p>I wonder what percentage of Jews are Talmudic. Of them how many belong to political parties/mafia like likud. 
<a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/180440">http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/180440</a></p>

<p>It is really pretty scary what these jews believe, I can only imagine what behind closed doors sounds like. Enough to make even hardened racists stagger.</p>

<p>It is really depressing to think about what they are capable of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they are any more or less capable of anything than any other people.</p>

<p>I imagine, like most ideologies, they have their extremists, their moderates and their innocents.</p>

<p>What I find troubling is the fact that it is obvious that they have made overt attempts to mislead outsiders on what their religion was/is.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that there can be any doubt that they have edited the very most influential literary source on what their religion is.  What it is attempting to achieve.  That is the basis of every religion, what their proposed end goal is.</p>

<p>It seems as if at some point in the early 1900&#39;s they decided that it was more important to have an in-road into popular society than it was to represent their religion as it is.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know the motivation for this, but the very fact that they believed that the foundation of their faith was too divisive to be released to the public leads me to believe that the tenets of that religion may have been truly frightening.</p>

<p>Christianity also was made to suffer a reform, but their atrocities have been made public.  There is no attempt to <em>secretly</em> reform Christianity (that I am aware of) and it would seem that an attempt to <em>secretly</em> reform the language of a holy scripture would point to some pretty damning original texts.</p>

<p>I really want to be able to access translations of the Talmud as it originally existed, but I have zero faith in the idea that this is even possible for someone like me.</p>

<p>that Jews rallied around him in massive fashion and were integral to his defense leading to the commutal of his sentence and post death pardon </p>
</blockquote>

<p>they never seem to amuse the idea that a jew could commit a crime </p>

<p>Also, physiology and religion are definitely connected. Jews reportedly have a weird fisure of rolando, where language is processed. Their selfish, primal pleasure philosophy is likely a result of their larger rear skulls, where the reptilian center is located. Not to mention they are heavily inbred. </p>

<p>ADL was likely formed to work with the federal reserve. Whatever excuse they used is akin to the civil war legally being about slavery but not actually. </p>

<p>And now that you&#39;ve seen the graph consider this part of the article of secession: </p>

<p>Sectional interest and animosity will deepen the irritation, and all hope of remedy is rendered vain, by the fact that public
opinion at the North has invested a great political error with the sanction of more erroneous religious belief. </p>

<p>and the fact they cite &quot;20 years&quot; of disobeyed laws. </p>
