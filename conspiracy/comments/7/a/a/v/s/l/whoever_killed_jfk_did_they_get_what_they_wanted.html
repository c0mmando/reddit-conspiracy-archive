        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Most of the groups and individuals who people have speculated organized an assassination of Kennedy where Right Wingers who thought JFK was too liberal, or &#39;soft&#39; on the Communist Soviet Union.  Perhaps some Right Wingers thought Kennedy sounded too conciliatory and tolerant toward black people and the Civil Rights Movement.  </p>

<p>Lee Harvey Oswald was like a &#39;communist&#39; from a dime store spy novel - where he probably got the idea.  Oswald was doing some strange things and seemed to want to put up a facade of a &#39;socialist&#39; activist, but he does not seem to have been a leftist of any kind.  One moment he was supporting the US Communist Party who were Stalinists, the next he was setting up an office of the US Socialist Workers Party who were Trotskyists.  Oswald&#39;s explanation for why he switched from Stalinist to Trotskyist?  None.  He never really was interested in socialist or communist politics and ideas.  He wanted to be a spy.  </p>

<p>The claims that Cuba had a motive and thought they would benefit from assassinating the Commander in Chief of the US military is like an idea out of a comic book.  Cuba would gain nothing from assassinating the US president.  The leaders of socialist Cuba have lasted 60 years on the doorstep of the most heavily armed capitalist country in the world because they are smart.  Killing Kennedy would not have been smart.  Cuba had no motive.  </p>

<p>So, did the Right Wingers get what they wanted.  If Oswald acted alone, would he have liked what happened politically after Kennedy&#39;s death?  If there was an organized conspiracy of Right Wing elements - did they like what they got after the assassination?  The US elected a wave of young Liberal congresspeople who passed the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and many other leftist flavored social and political programs.  Did the Right Wingers or who ever where the assassins anticipate that?  </p>

<p>Or, did they think the US would go to war with Communism and attack Cuba, or the Soviet Union?  The US did go to war with Communism in Vietnam for the next ten years after Kennedy&#39;s death.  Is that the kind of thing the assassins wanted.   </p>

<p>Did the Right Wing assassins think the US population would be rallied as after Pearl Harbor and begin a final battle with the cry &quot;The Communists Killed Kennedy!&quot;  Because, history didn&#39;t move that way.  Where did they get their ideas on how history is shaped and influenced?  Did they believe their own propaganda.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you think it was about some kind of right/left ideology? </p>

<p>It was about money and power for the deep state players. Kennedy wasn&#39;t playing nicely and neither was his brother. They had ideas about about not playing the deep state money and power agenda and they were taken out.</p>

<p>Simple as that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;They&quot; were well on their way as soon as they got Nixon in the White House, and the goal was suppress wages, destroy unions, eliminate the anti-poverty programs, especially housing and health care and did. (Nixon used E.O. to hand over the anti-poverty funds to his developer friends,) then the conservatives spent 30 years claiing the anti-proverty program failed.
They also gained total control of the major news organizations and later made it legal with the de-regulations in the 80s.  </p>

<p>So yes it has taken them a lot longer than planned but they have very successfully returned the U.S. worker to poverty and nearly eliminated the middle class as it once existed.  </p>

<p>Do  you know that the &quot;middle class,&quot; once meant? </p>

<p>The Watergate Crimes slowed them some, but the first major false flag, (remember a real false flag included wealth theft,) was very successful and that was the first oil embargo which threw the nation into chaos. Another success was the Creation of E.I.T.C. instead of increasing the minimum wage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But JFK was a wealthy child of a capitalist.  Kennedy never worked a day in his life.  He never, ever had a job.  He had multiple apartments and fucked all kinds of willing women.  JFK was a Liberal Democrat, but that was no kind of Leftist who was threatening capitalism.  How does getting rid of this one man who had few political ideas and was mostly a marketing phenomenon advance the cause of capitalism?  Or did Right Wingers simply talk themselves into believing Kennedy was some kind of Leftist.  Kennedy was no Leftist.  JFK was a Cold War anti-Communist.  Was this Capitalist on Capitalist violence with no real sound justification?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because Republicans and conservative organizations have spent the last 60 years labeling U.S.liberals as commie leftists doesn&#39;t mean they ever were, both FDR and LBJ were liberals but certainly not commie, but you forget, our conservatives consider liberal policies such as public funded education for all  to be commie/socialist.  </p>

<p>So really I have no idea if you even know what the traditional U.S. liberal political ideas, policies and agenda is. </p>

<p>As for Civil Rights, Kennedy was cautious, but unlike Eisenhower at least willing to move ahead to eliminating legal race based discrimination. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ineffective playboy JFK was standing in the way of Capitalism?  Is that what the killers thought.  The quintessential Capitalist Prince - was an opponent of Capitalism.  Did Capitalism get noticeably stronger after Kennedy was killed?  Capitalists have been in charge around the world for about the last two hundred years.  JFK is a minor footnote in the history of Capitalists power.  Why kill him?  Essentially it is a misunderstanding of the dynamics of history.  The killers believed their own propaganda, and facile understanding of the world.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are close to truth. The idea is that each individuals &quot;Truth&quot; is Truth to them. The killers did believe they changed something by killing Kennedy. It was a meme to kill him in the first place. Now, You and I have the benefit of retrospective perspective to understand that this method of &quot;handling business&quot; produced a short term win at best and may have actually back fired in the long term. Imo, The bigger deal about JFK is the &quot;dont trust the government&quot; meme that was created when the Warren commission obfuscated the investigation. Who did it some 50 years later is not as important as the question of why our government did a diservice to the US citizens that day by not providing a transparent, fact based trial. In a lot of ways, the naive American public, died that day with JFK. Culture shifted. Change is inevitable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen so many documentaries - and many seem plausible when I am watching them.  But - are populations supposed to believe the government?  Throughout history have subjects of countries been supportive of the rulers because they &#39;believed&#39; in them?  Every government in history ultimately ruled by force.  That&#39;s why they have  police, courts, prisons and armies.  Many have said that the US lost some special &#39;innocence&#39; in 1963.  Where they the first people in history in love with their government?  Was the post-war boom of the previous two decades that sweet?  </p>

<p>Some on this comment section have proposed that the &#39;Deep State&#39; got what they wanted in JFK&#39;s death because he was an obstacle to them taking the happy democratic capitalist US and subverting it from that Golden Age.  So Kennedy dies and Paradise was lost.  Sounds like a religious understanding of history.  Reads like a story for children...of all ages.  Kennedy was no opponent of the US rulers who were capitalists just as he was.  So how can he become so Saint John of the Just who resisted the evil Deep State Capitalists.  Sounds like a good Marvel Universe movie.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think that was one thing that was supposed to be special about america, it was supposed to be the first land where there were no kings and queens. That was original dream of america or at least the one that is romanticized. </p>

<p>Did Americans love their government after the revolution? I would say, yes. They just fought for it, so yea they are proud of this government that broke free of English tyranny. Even the most skeptical are likely bought in. Leading up to the world wars, I mean, the american people are pretty damn complicit. Joyfully prepping bombshelters and running around with gas masks for children. This was normal. We were fighting the &quot;great evil&quot;.  (in retrospect: Maybe they didn&#39;t have a tool like the internet to commiserate and organize via).</p>

<p>To your last points. Ideas and metaphors are extremely powerful. Even more powerful than any leader. You are answering your own question. Killing JFK was important because it is a meme. Like killing Julius ceaser, like paradise lost comment. It is a public show of power that &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; is subjective and just as susceptible to death and pain as evil. It is art. It is like graffiti. You do it because you can and you leave it for everyone else&#39;s interpretation. Damn the consequences because if you get away with it, you are god, Creator of your universe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is the answer so obvious?  There have been assassinations throughout history - the assassins did not always produce the outcome they sought.  </p>

<p>In Ancient Rome people who wanted to keep the Republic killed Julius Cesear because he was acting like a king.  The result was an Empire and an emperor.  Not what the assassins wanted. </p>

<p>What provoked WW1 was the assassination of the Archduke of the Austria-Hungarian Empire.  The assassin was a Serb who wanted independence for Serbia.  At the end of WW1 the Austria-Hungarian multi-state empire broke up.  Serbia got independence as part of Yugoslavia.  The assassin got what he wanted. </p>

<p>So...it is not an illogical question to ask.  Not every assassin produces the outcome the killers want.  The best laid plans of mice and men oft go astray...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because Republicans and conservative organizations have spent the last 60 years labeling U.S.liberals as commie leftists doesn&#39;t mean they ever were, both FDR and LBJ were liberals but certainly not commie, but you forget, our conservatives consider liberal policies such as public funded education for all  to be commie/socialist.  </p>

<p>So really I have no idea if you even know what the traditional U.S. liberal political ideas, policies and agenda is. </p>

<p>As for Civil Rights, Kennedy was cautious, but unlike Eisenhower at least willing to move ahead to eliminating legal race based discrimination. </p>
