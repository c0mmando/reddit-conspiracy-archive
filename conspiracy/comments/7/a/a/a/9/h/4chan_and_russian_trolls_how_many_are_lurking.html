       With the activity of Russian trolling of US politics through social media becoming clearer, it makes sense to assume that Russian trolls are active at 4chan. Considering that the Russians have been setting up fake events, fake pages, fake websites, selling fake political merchandise, and much more all in the name of causing racial discord and unrest, it makes sense that some will be active over there. It is also clear that many of the stories seeking to sow confusion around Russian interference can be sourced to 4chan. Before anyone jumps in to say I am a libtard who has drunk the Koolaid, I fully acknowledge that the Russians have also tried to influence politics on the left too through disinfo. I am also not saying that the Russians won the election for Trump, or that Trump is guilty of collusion. I am just interested in people's opinions about the logical assumption that the Russians have an interest in infiltrating 4chan and using it for their own purposes in the same way they used Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc. I am very skeptical of the impact of these trolls, by the way, particularly in light of the low reach of many of the posts and videos that I have seen. Nevertheless, it is particularly interesting, for example, how following any breaking story on Trump-Russia it was always 4chan that was out of the blocks first with a counter story. Of course, the "channers" don't need much help in this regard, but the FSB aren't idiots either. 4chan looks like the perfect place to lurk and spread disinfo for it to then be spread to the ends of cyberspace and work its magic.

       Sure, but that's not the question. It is always funny how often the reaction to Russian interference is: "Yeh, but our government does it too." Not only that, these same people often put more trust in Russian talking points that other sources.

       Russia does everything the US does, just more openly. Russia wants globalism, but on its terms. Russia agrees with colonialism, on its terms. Russia agrees with oligarchy, on its terms. Not only that, 
its historical tradition and forms of government are opposed to liberalism, classical liberalism, the rights of man, liberty, and all of those things that made the West great.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly, the US government (and Deep State) is not upholding these values as it should, but Putin does not even pretend to uphold them. It is frankly illogical to see Putin on your side. It is clear that Putin's main interest is in dividing the US to make it weak. And it seems you have drunk his Koolaid.

       That's exactly what propaganda is designed to do. Speak to you. Geesh, this is elementary stuff. And yes, we do the same in other countries. Of course Russia is going to try and appeal to disaffected Americans. They'd be idiots not to. But they'll stab you in the back the minute they have the chance.

       How do you differentiate between propaganda that is exposing propaganda and just propaganda that is propagating propaganda? And bearing in mind that Donald Trump is currently POTUS, do you believe that the US is equally as undemocratic as Russia? And would you not agree that for all its faults, there is more chance of justice in the US than in Russia? For example, how likely is it that an effort to impeach Putin would get as much success as Democratic efforts to impeach Trump? Alternatively, do you seriously think that anyone like Trump would rise to challenge Putin in Russia? In fact, many populists like Trump are currently in prison, dead, or in exile because they challenged Putin and there was not even the pretense of a trial.

       But propaganda is much more in what is not said, or what you are not hearing or seeing. You know this so well with the US yet your guard is down like an infant with Putin. Putin has engaged in acts every bit as bad as the US within its capabilities and it does so more openly. A global order with Putin at the top does not bear thinking about.

       It is intellectually dishonest to say that just because the US has done some terrible stuff, then it is on a par with every other nation that has done some terrible stuff. I think you know that too.

       It is dishonest because these are not equivalent. 
We can both agree that the US has performed poorly when it comes to protecting human rights within its own borders, but that is not comparable to how Putin controls his own people. It starts at something as simple as freedom of speech which is heavily policed and punished. Journalists are routinely murdered and imprisoned in Russia and speaking out against Putin is likely to lead to imprisonment and possibly death. Anyone posing a challenge to Putin is strongly controlled and European cities like London are full of exiles who would be imprisoned or worse upon return. There are no free and fair elections so even if there is widespread support for Putin, the people cannot really show it objectively. And in an arena where dissent is heavily punished, how on earth can support for the president be judged? On top of this, homosexuals are imprisoned and put in camps within Moscow's jurisdiction and homosexuals are heavily oppressed through state laws. Russia engages in widespread suppression within territories in ways that are qualitatively different from how the US might, for example, over-police Black communities. We can look to the Caucasus and suppression of minorities there as well as to various examples of annexation (real term: colonisation) of lands. This is why it is dishonest to just claim that the US does unethical behaviour, therefore it is equivalent to Russia. I agree with you that the US has committed some horrific crimes, but anyone who believes that Russia is guided by higher values is deluded. With the power the US wields, Russia would be much more dangerous. Any honest look at the human rights situation within Russia would indicate this. Furthermore, this shows the dishonesty of taking Putin’s talking points at face value and swallowing his carefully chosen words, designed no less to appeal to disaffected Americans like yourself.

       Us has killed millions of civilians in the recent wars. Poisoning its own citizens. Torturing its own innocent people. Running addictive drugs like heroin in the country. Creating false flags in their own or in some other country. Created and funded al qaida. Supports terrorist groups when its convenient for them. Assissinates people, even their own president. Tries to and has succesfully in the past controlled elections of other countries.

       Russia has also done all of the above in their own theatres of conflict. And, internally, Russia is far worse in terms of poisoning, torturing, terrorising its own citizens. Read up and wake up.

       If you don't trust one outlet then you must triangulate sources and see where the evidence points. Don't rely on CNN at all, but look to human rights organisations, the testimony of exiles, footage from non-western news organisations, even the cultural traditions of the country and how these are likely to impact on politics. Read the history of the country and look at how there are both continuities and innovations. By looking at it in a holistic way we can form an picture of what the country is like. No one is saying you should watch CNN and take it as gospel. People who believe CNN at their word are just as bad as the idiots that do so with Breitbart.

       Id like to ask a question and it's not really directed at you.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many of these Russian trolls are just people around the world using a vpn? How many of these Russian trolls are using vpn's on purpose to further this Russian narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've gone from Russia hacked the election to Russia and trump colluded and now we are at the point where it was "Russian trolls"
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence that I just saw presented and what these ads are was a tweet of a meme some 4channer made. A fake meme is classified as an ad? How ridiculous does that sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes me laugh how hard they are trying to convince people of this Russian collusion that really wouldn't of changed anything even if it was legitimate. Which can never be proven because if no one can say for sure that these weren't people just using vpn's then it can never be a true fact and will always just be a theory

       I agree. It is frankly scary how little we can ever know. And of course both sides are taking advantage of that. I believe this is one reason we have seen an explosion in conspiracy thinking. The world is becoming more and more complicated, and conspiracy theories help to make it a little bit simpler. And, of course, the existence of real conspiracies is a big factor too.

       Когда активность российского троллинга американской политики через социальные сети становится более ясной, имеет смысл предположить, что русские тролли активны в 4chan. Учитывая, что россияне создавали поддельные события, поддельные страницы, поддельные веб-сайты, продавали поддельные политические товары и многое другое во имя причинения расовых разногласий и беспорядков, имеет смысл, что некоторые из них будут активны там. Также ясно, что многие из историй, пытающихся посеять путаницу вокруг русского вмешательства, могут быть получены 4chan. Прежде чем кто-нибудь скачет, что я - либтард, который выпил Кулайда, я полностью признаю, что русские также пытались повлиять на политику слева тоже через disinfo. Я также не говорю, что россияне выиграли выборы для Трампа, или что Трамп виновен в сговоре. Меня просто интересуют мнения людей о логическом предположении, что россияне заинтересованы в проникновении 4chan и использовании его в своих целях так же, как они использовали Facebook, Twitter, YouTube и т. Д. Я очень скептически отношусь к влиянию этих тролли, кстати, особенно в свете низкого охвата многих сообщений и видео, которые я видел. Тем не менее, это особенно интересно, например, как после любой разбивки на Trump-Russia всегда было 4chan, которое было из блоков первым с встречной историей. Конечно, «каналам» не нужна помощь в этом отношении, но ФСБ тоже не идиоты. 4chan выглядит как идеальное место, чтобы скрываться и распространять disinfo для него, чтобы затем распространиться до концов киберпространства и развить свою магию.
