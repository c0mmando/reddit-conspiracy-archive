       As it was told to me
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple weeks before the shooting happened, MGM  had been basically prepping their workers for something about to happen. They know they're about to be unionized on October 1st. Now the guy kept telling me that MGM says when you get hired there they tell you that it is all about "the show, the spectacle". It's Las Vegas after all. But what happens after a mass shooting? Fundraising, donations, Mass amounts of sympathy and believe it or not a lot of Tourism because people are morbid in that sense. I'm sure you all know if the Red Cross conspiracy how it's just the rich trying to milk and guilt the middle class into giving them even more money. This is basically the same thing, except it's a shooting instead of devastating hurricanes. Case in point Puerto Rico
      </p>
      <p>
       So when you are about to unionize your workers on October 1st, you would really want a lot of money going into the insurance that they're about to get. Well if Orlando and Sandy Hook and Columbine and and all that shit taught us, it's that people are going to dole out  millions and millions and millions of dollars without even thinking about it, and what better way to do that then to pick a guy who was relatively unknown wouldn't really be questioned if he was alone or not cuz he basically was all the time. He also stayed at that room for significant period of time. So you have a lonely older guy who stays at Mandalay Bay on a regular basis keeps to himself and stayed in his room when he wasn't gambling. So what better way than to pick somebody like that who really wouldn't be missed or at the very least question his motives as much. The key of this being people are we're going to focus more on why did the guy like that do something like this and they're just going to be so focused on the on what his mental state would have been to do something like that then to stop and think okay with this makes no sense no terrorist organization, no grudges against the political system nothing so people were going to ponder over that while they just put it under the rug and got their donations. I'm sure you all know if the Red Cross conspiracy and  how it's just the rich trying to milk and guilt the middle class into giving them money all while   "helping" means staying in luxury hotels and maybe doing a blood drive. 
This is basically the same thing, except it's a shooting instead of devastating hurricanes. Case in point Puerto Rico. Ironic that the two happened in close succession to each other huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this guy didn't speak like the best English, and so what I did was just ended up interviewing him about it and this is the best that I could do with it. I didn't want you to think I was full of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, from what he told me a few people got clipped but nobody was killed unless it was a heart attack. But as with all conspiracy theories you know take it for what you want don't believe it 100%but just keep an open mind. Cuz this one is the only one that actually has made sense to me
      </p>
      <p>
       Also considering the Vegas strong signs were up in less than 2 hours after it occurred that should have Arisen suspicion alone. This guy was risking his job telling me this information, because my other friends that work at the casinos vehemently deny anything like this is true and it was a gunman. Obviously that's what their superiors and the hotels are telling them to say.

       Actually all you have to type is "MGM" and "MGM shooting lawsuit" should pop up as the second predictive option.

       Now, if your screen looks anything like mine, half of the page will be filled law firms ads looking for victims so they can get the money they're owed from Mandalay Bay.

       I have several links and snippets of the traction they've made with existing lawsuits in my Comment history, but I'm on mobile now so don't have an easy way to access them. Will re-respond with them when I get to my laptop.

       I saw video posted to reddit of a guy at the event going through triaging patients on the ground at the event dead. Now this video was removed immediately.. but I am sure with a little effort you could easily find the video. He was checking all the remaining bodies for any signs of life. Most of the people I saw has gunshot wounds to the head and were absolutely dead. People did die, I think you discredited this entire post. Sorry, I know you are unaware of that video.. but I watched it personally and people were dead.

       No.. it’s of a young man about 19 I would guess who’s mother is a nurse I believe.. but he frantically goes through and checks bodies.. he also argues with a staff member from the event to turn on the lighting in order to better see the victims. But there is clearly people who are absolutely dead in those videos. Very very sad. It was removed because I don’t think people were notified yet and they didn’t want people to find out their daughters/sons, mother friends were dead through a video. It was posted in watchpeopledie Reddit just hours after the shooting happened. If I find a link I’ll post the link.

       There is bullet holes.. I don’t think people were stabbed. People are clearly dead. Have you ever experienced a mass casualty situation after gun fire ? .223 or 5.56 nato which was a majority of the gunfire, goes through and through and bullet holes are extremely small. These bullets were designed that way. Now I don’t know what distance it is.. but you won’t see gaping open gunshot wounds.. heads blown off, unless the bullet impacts bone and and changes direction etc.. most will be through and through small amounts of tumble barely causing major damage except to where it entered and exited. These bullet holes will barley be the width of your pinky finger if that on entrance, on exit could be larger depending on what slowed the bullet down inside your body.

       I'm fully onboard that people were shot, I'm just saying in that video or any of the others there are no visible bullet holes.

       What does visible bullet holes mean ? Maybe I am not fully understanding what you are saying.

       7.62 or .308 is a different story. They will do some damage as the round is larger and starts to lose its perfect trajectory faster.. 5.56 or .223 goes through like butter.. 7.62 or .308 enters like butter and exits a little worse.. but a lot of these are through and through as well. I’ve seen tons of people shot by 7.62/.308 and when I says tons it’s exaggerated and more than anyone should witness.
      </p>

       When something is fast and spinning perfectly it’s slide in. Getting shot by a pistol is worse because it’s a slower round and uses more force to penetrate.
      </p>
      <p>
       But either way the bullet holes will be super small. Pinky sized at best.

       So I don’t see bullet holes either. But these people are clearly dead in the video and it was just in a centralized area. The one girl, RIP, but you don’t have that much blood loss from inside and not drown. It’s sad, sorry we have to debate this.. but here

       I appreciate the huge block type in the middle, because that's where I threw in the towel. Went to the comments, see this is the horsoroshit I was expecting.

       I asked before. I’ll ask again. What union? Name? MGM is union now. Now there could be a new group policy coming up. But, why would this benefit MGM? Why would this benefit the union which is the Culinary union I think. What would the massacre do to benefit either?

       I'm calling BS. You get an interview with a exec of MGM which could lead to some juicy details, yet you fail to record the conversation.. only to write a poorly worded post on Reddit. Fuck off with your clear lie.
