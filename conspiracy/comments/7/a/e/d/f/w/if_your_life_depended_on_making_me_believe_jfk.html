       I truly think JFK was a CIA assassination, and that possibly the FBI helped cover their tracks afterwards.  But I don't where to start researching.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I know there are some experts in this out there and I'd love to hear what they have to say.

       His suspicion was that Allen Dulles -- basically the guy behind every horrible thing the CIA did from the 1950s to 1960s -- iced him because he was insufficiently committed to fighting the Communists.  He reaches that conclusion mainly from looking at relationships between Dulles and key actors and the guy's general history as a monster.

       That makes sense. I can definitely see how the powers that be in the US would not want JFK around. He shot down all the covert ideas to attack Cuba, was getting friendly with Russia, and wanted to dissolve the CIA.

       I think one thing that people get hung up on and why they believe Oswald did it, is because in the film, they're thinking the bullet entered the back of his head and the pink mist is the exit of the bullet from the front his head

       They pushed "Oswald was the shooter" into everybody's heads. Plus when Ruby killed him there wasn't anybody to say he wasn't the shooter.

       I feel like that's such huge red flag. LHO is saying he didn't do, saying he's a patsy. Then ruby decides to shoot him and now he can't testify for himself. How convenient...

       The bullet entering the front of his head. It matches with some of the autopsy photos that show a huge chunk of head missing behind his right eye. 
All of the coroners report how his brain was falling out because the hole back there. 
But that was left out of the warren report if I'm not mistaken

       Shot came from the front, slightly below, and to the right - indeed from a sewer drain along the curb, which can be seen upon close examination. But he was still shot at multiple times, from several elevated positions (most missed, then the limo driver slowed down).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fatal shot was almost certainly from that sewer drain.

       I'd like to hear from ballistics peeps or gunshot witnesses talk about if misting happens at entry or exit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The googles seems to indicate that misting is more consistent with an forward splatter, meaning exit wound. Evidently, it is said that back splatter (from the point of entry back to source of gunshot) is less of a mist and is much less common, to the extent that some believe it is not possible, although (it apparently took) a scientific journal proves it possible, even if not common (still not a mist, evidently).
      </p>
      <p>
       Many say that the autopsy photos are questionable, and, if there was a coverup, then published coroner reports may not help give us a clue either. Could the autopsy photos be faked or bodies be switched? I don't care to argue one way or another as the internet is the owner of that current debate, not me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the Zapruder film contradicts the autopsy photos and that if we had to choose something to go off of, the "footage" of the event is something that is at the center of it, and even if that was tampered with (it surely was), it puts us at the scene of, and at the moment of the crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, the film shows misting and smoke from the top and front. It needs to be explained, and anyone that knows the slightest about gunshot wounds in the real world should give their opinion on that and back it up so we can judge its credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to convince or make any conclusions, I'm just offering something that seems to not be mentioned, and, if someone is trying to find a "conspiracy" then it probably shouldn't been thrown out right away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, it doesn't have to be a shot from Oswald nor a grassy knoll shot for there to be anomalies with the event. If we believe the government is covering something up, we should ask how Oliver stone had has no problem getting the back-and-to-the-left word out to the public without retribution, relatively speaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       All my opinion, for perspective, and not looking to debate. If you have a counter to this, then I'll just say "you win" and you can ignore this post and not worry about my motivation for offering such speculation.

       Yes - take the time to watch the video linked above - Everything is a Rich Man's Trick. He lays out a very, very compelling story for motivation, execution, and cover up of the JFK assassination, among other incredible tidbits. Spoiler: there are Nazis running our gov't to this day.

       It's a strange world we live in. When I was in 10th grade my teacher had us shut the book after the JFK chapter and he explained a lot of possibilities. He was a good teacher. He told us how the FBI, CIA, and mafia really work. He was a mafia buff and his take on things made a lot more sense than the official report.

       So they say that it was probably a conspiracy, but it didn't involve the soviets, CIA, FBI, Cuba, no second gunman, and that the warren report was shitty, but mostly got it right?

       Also when you watch the clip again, notice how a silver object tumbles away from Jackie onto the trunk. She seems to be trying to retrieve it. What might that be? The Warren commission tried to say it was a piece of his skull. That's a funny ass lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       She also confessed about wanting to commit suicide (supposedly) to a
       <em>
        Jesuit
       </em>
       priest named Richard McSorley.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Jackie was family friends with the first CIA director Allen Dulles. He gave her a job in the CIA before she met JFK.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       She met with a man named
       <strong>
        Aristotle Onassis
       </strong>
       after learning of JFK's adultery, but before JFK was assassinated. She then married Aristotle Onassis after JFK was assassinated. Does he look like someone she would marry? Her family already had money...
      </p>
      <p>
       If you dig deep enough, you will find out Onassis is synonymous with Saudi Arabian oil.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It was around this time that the CIA planted a listening device in Onassis' Paris apartment, which led to his indictment by the U.S. Government for conspiracy to violate the false statement statute of the Ship Sales Act when his companies filed applications to buy surplus vessels.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Note how in all of this Jackie had an instrumental position which could be taken advantage of by the CIA, especially considering that job she had with them.
