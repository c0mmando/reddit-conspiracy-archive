    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to hear from ballistics peeps or gunshot witnesses talk about if misting happens at entry or exit. </p>

<p>The googles seems to indicate that misting is more consistent with an forward splatter, meaning exit wound. Evidently, it is said that back splatter (from the point of entry back to source of gunshot) is less of a mist and is much less common, to the extent that some believe it is not possible, although (it apparently took) a scientific journal proves it possible, even if not common (still not a mist, evidently).</p>

<p>Many say that the autopsy photos are questionable, and, if there was a coverup, then published coroner reports may not help give us a clue either. Could the autopsy photos be faked or bodies be switched? I don&#39;t care to argue one way or another as the internet is the owner of that current debate, not me.</p>

<p>I think the Zapruder film contradicts the autopsy photos and that if we had to choose something to go off of, the &quot;footage&quot; of the event is something that is at the center of it, and even if that was tampered with (it surely was), it puts us at the scene of, and at the moment of the crime.</p>

<p>Regardless, the film shows misting and smoke from the top and front. It needs to be explained, and anyone that knows the slightest about gunshot wounds in the real world should give their opinion on that and back it up so we can judge its credibility. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to convince or make any conclusions, I&#39;m just offering something that seems to not be mentioned, and, if someone is trying to find a &quot;conspiracy&quot; then it probably shouldn&#39;t been thrown out right away. </p>

<p>Again, it doesn&#39;t have to be a shot from Oswald nor a grassy knoll shot for there to be anomalies with the event. If we believe the government is covering something up, we should ask how Oliver stone had has no problem getting the back-and-to-the-left word out to the public without retribution, relatively speaking.</p>

<p>All my opinion, for perspective, and not looking to debate. If you have a counter to this, then I&#39;ll just say &quot;you win&quot; and you can ignore this post and not worry about my motivation for offering such speculation.</p>

I mean, that sucks. But  might react like that in the moment. She freaks out knowing he&#39;s dead and tries to get away. She probably hated seeing him like that. </p>

<p>She&#39;s not trying to loosen his tie either. Watch it a few more times. Note the exit wound. The bullet fragment trajectory. Where would the shooter have to be to cause that?</p>

<p>To your point, there&#39;s smoke also. Literally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also when you watch the clip again, notice how a silver object tumbles away from Jackie onto the trunk. She seems to be trying to retrieve it. What might that be? The Warren commission tried to say it was a piece of his skull. That&#39;s a funny ass lie.</p>

<p>She also confessed about wanting to commit suicide (supposedly) to a <em>Jesuit</em> priest named Richard McSorley.</p>

<p><strong>Jackie was family friends with the first CIA director Allen Dulles. He gave her a job in the CIA before she met JFK.</strong></p>

<p>She met with a man named <strong>Aristotle Onassis</strong> after learning of JFK&#39;s adultery, but before JFK was assassinated. She then married Aristotle Onassis after JFK was assassinated. Does he look like someone she would marry? Her family already had money...</p>

<p>If you dig deep enough, you will find out Onassis is synonymous with Saudi Arabian oil.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was around this time that the CIA planted a listening device in Onassis&#39; Paris apartment, which led to his indictment by the U.S. Government for conspiracy to violate the false statement statute of the Ship Sales Act when his companies filed applications to buy surplus vessels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note how in all of this Jackie had an instrumental position which could be taken advantage of by the CIA, especially considering that job she had with them.</p>
