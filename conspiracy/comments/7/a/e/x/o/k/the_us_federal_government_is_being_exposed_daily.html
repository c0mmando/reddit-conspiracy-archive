       The chaos that Trump and the reaction to Trump is going all over the place.  It's a pretty cool time to be alive and witness all this shit go down.  I give it a 10/10, pretty fun ride.

       I hate that it got to this point.  But it started well before any of us were alive.  I believe it can be changed regardless of the Bankers, politicians, Rothschilds, etc.  This is the first time i've ever felt we at least have a chance to start changing some of it.

       they wont risk a change as significant as that to their lifestyle.  They can go to their New Zealand mansions but they will have to do shit like grow their own food.  No way they choose that.  Their lifesryle is impossible without us.

       Why not, we're talking about the elite here, they probably have plantations in South America on Bush's property with local people to do their bidding (I made that up, but I'm sure they have exit strategies).

       Indeed.   According to the Georgia Guidestones they think they need only 500 million of us.    Their lifestyle is much more than relaxing on a plantation with servants.  It takes entire cities, universities, factories and infrastructure to maintain the technology we have now.  Something luxurious like a smart phone or a private jet require tens of thousands of people to design and take from mines to fabrication, then tens of thousands more to maintain the infrastructure that make them work.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sinister part is that the elite think that is the natural order of how things are supposed to be.  That their proper place is ruling as master above many slaves.

       Control through fear is part of the reason we got here.  Have you ever read Osama bin Laden's letter to the American ppl?  While i fundamentally disagree with how he tried to make change he said if the US govt accepts collateral damage of his ppl he must do the same.  Its a fucked up world &amp; we will never be able to fully control things ppl do.  We can only recognize it &amp; share how we see things &amp; hopefully that leads to change.  I dont know if there are any governments in the world that actually represent regular people.

       I don't see the CIA or the FBI being affected. In fact Trump got to select a new FBI and CIA director who's first action was a false flag in Las Vegas on behalf of the Trump admin.
      </p>

       Trump has nothing to do with outing Hollywood pedos. He is one. He's an elite who's been around Hollywood and even sought to put himself in a movie with a child actor.

       Pro sports? Nothing but mad people protesting because of their political beliefs on both sides.

       If anything the FBI and CIA are going to get worse and more powerful.

       Trump is a pedophile and called for 58 people to be gunned down because he didn’t like the press coverage.. Sounds believable.

       Your comment brings up the most important untalked about fact, that all of this would still be going on if She had won. Think about that. It makes me realize that all Democrats basically have no moral compass, that blindly following a witch would have been their ideal reality.... I have a child and this degenerate world is no place for such a sweet innocent child. Trump is trying to make the world a safer place, I hope people finally finish off their addiction to the MSM.

       Who in the federal government has been exposed? Who in the FBI or CIA had been exposed? Yeah there are people you don't like who are investigating your guy, is that was "expose" means? Trump had nothing to do with Kevin Spacey or Harvey Weinstein. What the hell do you think he did? Hit up those women and encouraged them to finnalt speak out? Sure bud. Lobbying is absolutely no different today than when Trump took office.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy to pretend things wouldn't be the same if Trump wasn't elected when you think he's in charge of everything good that happens.
      </p>

       Pro sports? What the fuck? Who was "exposed" in pro sports? Last time I checked, millions of Americans still love pro sports.

       Millions of Americans have checked out from ESPN and pro sports.. While they still have a big loyal fan base, the ole charm of the game is wearing if you ask me. It’s all a political money grab at this point and not pure entertainment competition.

       The only people actually being exposed are those in the Trump administration/campaign, who are being charged with crimes.

       Calm down nothing has happened yet. We need to work harder on solving vegas. We can help make this happen. We dont get oportunities like this ever... and you're right about trump winning. This may be the only good thing that happens. We need to rip vegas wide open, and all the others will fall apart after.
