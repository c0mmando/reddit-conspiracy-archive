       I had never realized Reddit was this blatant in censoring content until today. The Donna Brazile article about the DNC cheats cannot be found on the front page.  What does Reddit gain by burying the Politico article about the DNC rigging the election?

       Well I knew it was suppressing anti-hillary information and pushing anti-trump during the election. However, something like learning the DNC was laundering money at the behest of Clinton, as confirmed by Donna Brazile is legitimate news.

       shaun king is fake black guy who was pushing the black lives matter thing to divide and conquer but I think at some point he woke up and realized Hillary was no good, he was on to this money laundering scam a year ago:

       It appears to be a money laundering scheme. Do you remember when George Clooney said that Bernie Sanders and his supporters were right to be disgusted by the fact that some seats at the fundraiser cost $353,400 per couple, but that he could live with it because the money was mainly going to help smaller candidates win local elections?
      </p>
      <p>
       He was wrong.

       And let's be real about this, too: nobody's spending that much
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       to attend a dinner. This is like saying that Russian banks were spending $500k
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       for a speech from Bill Clinton. This is pay-to-play or straight up money laundering.

       It was a fund-raising dinner and that's how they work.
       <br/>
       Nothing is untoward about the price on its surface.
       <br/>
       The money was even distributed according campaign finance law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where this becomes a crime is where they side-stepped campaign finance law and funneled the $10k state donations to the national party and then moved the money to Hillary's campaign.

       no he supported Hillary at first and was just a grafter con artist who glommed onto the black lives matter thing. I might be wrong about him waking up, he may have then just glommed on to true libs like Bernie when he saw that tea leaves that Hillary was unpopular.

       Can't fucking wait ... What about 9/11 your loving Republicans pulled off ? Yeah what side is  being investigated as we speak ? That's right the scum Republicans working with Russia ! Uranium one is an old no story being brought up to distract the views from the FBI investigation .o yeah in case you missed it the FBI found absolutely nothing in there investigation of Clinton that's why she's out of jail lol.

       That's classic you are SO delusional!!! Bush's were behind 9/11, NOT TRUMP!!! Guess who's aligned with the Bush's? Obama and Clinton's, great pals, all pieces-o-shit! Uranium One was never investigated properly, but now will be hopefully, and that will only prove Podesta/Clinton's ties with Russia!! "The FBI found nothing on Clinton that's what she's out of jail" ???? Everyone knows that was the most rigged "investigation" to ever happen, a complete embarrassment to investigations! She had dirt on puppets, DESTROYED all her devices (is that not an admition of guilt?). Trump's been slowly dismantling the whole scummy system built and maintained by Bush/Obama/Clinton and they're losing all support. There Saudi sponsors just all got arrested too! #cantstopwinningitscontageous

       If that's your evidence destroyed evidence then Trump is a rapist I would agree and honestly they can all burn for all I care I vote Democrat for many reasons but if you actually think after hearing Trump admit to grabbing women by the pussies and kissing them without asking ! That's sexual assault! Not to mention Trump is one of the only presidents not to show his tax returns that's not guilty to you? He is a con man and if he opened them up he would be in jail too! Money laundering is absolutely going on in his family for years ! He's a draft dogging bitch but talks about military so often it's sickening! He's just good at talking to his stupid redneck military base ! But if they actually knew him they would realize he's a spoon fed rich boy and has made a living fucking people over and being an asshole his entire life he could die today and this world would cheer !! You would see rejoice in the streets ! Never has there been a more hated president EVER! how can you stand listening to him speak .Huge , believe me " his face is very punchable.do me a favor do some research on Trump's corruption and not just Hillary ! That's the difference if Hillary was proven to be a real criminal not just from brietbart or Alex crazy Jones ! Then I'd be happy to see her ass thrown in jail because that's a REAL American but you trumptards can't even admit a guy with like 15 sexual assault cases you guys just say o there all fake or any REAL evidence coming forward about his corruption you guys say fake news bla bla bla it's not a fucking team it's real life ! I used to here idiots like you defending bush back in the day too! Saying he's keeping Americans safe ! Lol neocon Republicans are the most evil group ever in politcs !

       More like "pro deep state" controlled (which has no political affiliation), but yeah. It's also the reason why George Bush puff pieces get upvoted when 5 years ago on Reddit, his name was synonymous with "war criminal." Those were the good old days...

       Which company pays you to go around leaving pathetic comments that nobody believes? Trump is taking Hillary to the cleaners, guaranteed, it is in progress! And Uranium One has not and will never be "debunked"! You shills are getting worse by the day 🤣

       I could ask you the same thing ? Sucked Sean hannity's cock lately seriously your on the wrong side of history! Time will show absolutely no indictments will be made on Democrats and multiple Republicans will go to jail . Republicans are pure filth and scum.They spin ever negative story to try to trick the American people into believing there lies but it's not working anymore. Trump will be impeached and I will love watching Fox afterwards lol.

       Tell me about it.  I was killed on the \livefromnewyork thread when I tried to make the point that maybe SNL shouldn't asseverate Sarah Sanders and within three posts someone called my family retards.  I told the Mod and they did nothing.  I should have asked that fucknut for his real address but alas, I let it go and left the subreddit.

       A lot is due to the pizzagate bs spread from this sub and others that lean heavily right. Anything with Podesta now just screams desperate right-winger trying to change narrative away from Russia. I hate Podesta, but all the nonsense from The D makes us look bad.

       So with that logic Trump is a pedo too? People have actually alleged shit against him. It's just autists who say Hillary is a pedo. Also heard she makes and sells meth, which is impressive, imo.

       That is nothing but horse shit! It goes far deeper, pro-Trump posts being autovoted down immediately, some posts disappear completely. Then you have the hoards of paid groups that lurk around downvoting comments supporting Trump, and replying to comments 3, 4 at a time trying to make people who are trying to expose Hillary, Podesta, Obama look like lunatics etc. They also usually post exactly like you, supplying some lame link supporting as "proof". Where do I find Reddits statistics page for their narrative pushing staff???

       What's your definition of pos/neg/neutral? Every headline I've seen is incredibly objective and just stating a fact.

      <p>
       Clinton isn't
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news

       because she hasn't done anything newsworthy. Trump is, ya know, the president, and the president's actions tend to be newsworthy.

       Can you name anything newsworthy Clinton has done in the last few months?

       I knew someone was going to try and nitpick.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's subjective.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the story appears intended as criticism, a hit piece, or falls under some time of investigation, then it was counted under the negative tally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Positive would be praise, neutral is reporting without an objective bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone might have different tallies, but I tried to remain objective in rating tallies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tallies above 200, i didn't total due to time.  I could go back as the search results were archived.

       So you read every article to determine if it was positive, neutral, or negative? Fascinating. You'd have to because every thread title is objective and neutral.

       When I see the Trump articles I see threads involving specific people, actions, or events. It's an article on the effects of the politics. Your Clinton articles are not. They are news articles about politics and about politicians.

       OP is probably referring to his front page then. Some days you don't see the top posts of certain subs, and that has been explained by being subbed to many different subreddits, and the front page can only hold so many. I have seen on certain days that I can scroll to the 500th post and not see a single post from this sub.

       He said front page in the title, so I'm guessing that's what he means. It's totally possible it didn't show up for him, although that isn't necessarily a conspiracy to hide it. That's apparently how Reddit works.

       I don't bother with people's history. Don't really care if I get negative points or positive point in comments, you would have seen that if you saw my history. It's really not about who scores browny points for the team. Because team is really an illusion, the siloed reality, echo chamber, the social media groupthink is just a small box that confines your reality.

       Tulsi is so unqualified for the presidency that I can't take anyone who suggests that seriously. She also happens to be the one Dem who is actively courting Putin, Assad, and more wars. What a coincidence.

       The DNC and the Democrats really fucked up in the Primarys and in the Election. There was clear lack of a 1.6 Billion dollar enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton and it was the Democrats and the DNC  rigged fuckery that led to Donald Trump getting elected.

       Berners are about as delusiional as they come.. anything to push the "Bernie woulda won" narrative. Because that somehow vindicates them? Cuz the alternative is acknowledging their "Bernie or bust" is the reason we have this clown in the oval office, and that's too hard to accept.

       I made this point in the thread that WAS on the top page of reddit about trump pulling us out of the international push to reveal revenues from big oil. Yeah lets sensationalize an article about Trump doing something marginally bad and not put anything throwing shit at HRC on the front page. Its literally just blatant now, just like during the election when politics LITERALLY was 95% Trump smear articles and then like one post about something really shitty HRC did that is article downplaying whatever she did. Its insane, we live in the fucking twilight zone dude.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like HRC was just confirmed to have rigged the primary in her favor with that deal, and was caught lying red handed about "not knowing" about the dossier only to come out this week and say yeah well heres why its ok that I did that. In which she paid for the research on the RUSSIAN dossier obtained by a British Intelligence officer who used to work in RUSSIA. Any neither of these things are on the front page, probably the 2 biggest confirmed cases of election fraud in history.

       Besides knowing about the indictments and papawhoever, you're absolutely right. I avoid politics and the news (as much as this sub allows), so it was a bit shocking to see stuff that isn't filtered through our apparently right wing sub.

       No I'm referring to during the election, I remember just seeing post after post of basically articles grasping at straws or little insignificant things and sensationalizing them, meanwhile with all the shit that leaked about HRC during the election, you saw basically 0 posts that were critical of her.

       Hot take: I hope they keep doing this. Keep trying to bury the mess that is the dem party so that shit hits the fan during the 2018 election cycle--or better yet hide it until 2020! Remember when all they could talk about was how the RNC convention was going to be a civil war between trump and cruz/establishment and the DNC convention was going to be a celebration? How did that turn out? Oh right the republican establishment fell in line and the dems had to use white noise machines to drown out the booing from the 40% sanders delegates who were ultimately kicked out where they joined the OWS progressives protesting outside.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conservatives are all on the same page whereas liberals have built a house of cards that has to eventually collapse. Identity politics dominate the left to the point where they are openly sexist towards men, openly racist towards whites, openly hateful towards christians, and openly heterophobic towards straights. And unlike the republicans who have long-since put their kkk/nazis in their place, the left's bigots are squarely in the limelight. They're not just the face of the democrat party but the future if you look at the moves they've been making since 11/2016. The left is doubling down on hateful rhetoric and identity politics, and the only way they can possibly win going forward (since they don't want to admit fault, have an introspection, and change their ways) is to try to convince everyone that right wing extremism is the only type of extremism that exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't wait to see their 2020 primary when you have a black panther candidate, an lgbt candidate, and a feminazi candidate trying to argue about who has the most oppression points. I said it before and I'll say it again; the next fascist leader will almost certainly come from the most protected class.

       The right has issues.... the establishment hacks are still trying to mitigate 'trumpism' at every step. (IE corker, flake, McCain, Bush, etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       That said... the right have lost trust in the political system.... almost entirely. They primaried trump to spite the RNC.  Then they voted him into the whitehouse to spite the crazy leftists, the corporate media and the corporations who back the establishment.

       Are you new? I guess 6 months is not long enough to experience that dramatic shift after the democratic convention.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the convention, correct the record basically took over reddit. Because of their forum sliding, vote manipulation, bots, infiltrating Mod seats, many communities were censored in an alarming way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even today, try to post anything positive about Trump in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       , or say anything negative about Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       More over, it is anything against the Democrasts/left wing ideology. They do not want any truth getting out.

       It's downvoted because reddit is incredibly liberal. Are you saying that before the convention a pro-conservative articles would have have been routinely upvoted? Because that's a fucking joke. Get real.

       Yeah, the right-wing subreddits definitely aren't quick to dole out bans and censor dissent. People get banned from THIS sub for mentioning that it's biased for Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at this subreddit right now. Trump administration and campaign officials have been indicted in a corruption investigation. One of them has probably been wearing a wire for the last several months. Zero threads. But, hey, plenty of threads about the DNC.

      <p>
       None of the right-wing subreddits are discussing the corruption investigations. So we can say they don't want any truth getting out, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're just regurgitating right-wing talking points. Think for yourself. ShareBlue isn't the only propaganda machine out there. A mention Cambridge Analytica was notably absent from your post- probably because it's a right-wing astroturfing campaign?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Ugh, yes they are. This Russia nonsense has been brought up here over and over again. Let me break it down for you why discussion has become so sparse on this topic:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        You're ignoring context that informs most people interested in the "conspiracy theory" community. So what's the relevant context here? Though you're in r/conspiracy subreddit, you've apparently never picked up on the widespread skepticism of the CIA, FBI, and NSA. Allegations that are coming from sources within US intelligence will be subject to this skepticism. I won't go into all the examples that justify that skepticism here, but there is good reason to believe that US media getting these "scoops" is not an accident or an example of good investigative journalism, but rather a deliberate attempt to manipulate the public through the media (c.f. Operation Mockingbird). Furthermore, many here, though not all, believe that the top-level conspiracy is to bring about a NWO. There may be some disagreement about who the ultimate puppet masters are (Illuminati, Jews, the Pope, etc.), but there is not much disagreement that this conspiracy is not guided by benign motives. In that context, the attempt to portray Trump's relations with Russia as sinister, whether those relations are real or not, looks a lot like propaganda. Trump and Russia are commonly regarded as enemies of the NWO. That may or may not be true in the end, but at this stage it seems likely that their opposition is genuine. This is relevant because we would have to be naive to think that a person who has frustrated the ambitions of a (if not the) global elite would not come in for some retaliatory attempts to discredit him.
       </li>
       <li>
        Another specific and significant reason to be skeptical of this and stories like it is that there have been so many stories about Russia recently that have turned out to be false. It really starts to look like a pattern of lies, even to ordinary people who are oblivious of the motives of TPTB. Here are several recent examples:

        </a>
        (The fact that even the Washington Post disavowed the story should tell you something)
       </li>
       <li>
        Another specific reason to suspect that these attacks are highly motivated disinformation meant to discredit Trump and raise fears about Russia is the events in Syria. As I've discussed many times before in this sub—since it's an area of particular concern to me—the US ran a CIA led campaign in Syria to topple Assad. Among this project's objectives was that of securing the route for the Saudi-Qatar pipeline into Europe. The US is complicit in arming ISIS and Al Qaeda to bring about this objective. For that reason and many others, to be explicit, the US are not the "good guys" in this scenario. The relevant point here is that Russia has now thwarted that plan by stepping in for Assad. So do you think that the powers behind that objective will just passively accept this result, or do you think they will use every dirty trick they can to seize back the reins? This explains why anti-Russian propaganda, which has been going on for years, has reached a peak recently.
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5itgwp/the_obama_administrations_role_in_the_overthrow/">
         https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5itgwp/the_obama_administrations_role_in_the_overthrow/
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        Another important point is that a lot of these reports, and the reddit "dossiers" of evidence linking Trump to Russia are based on the assumption that such relations are sinister. But to be clear, I want the US to establish peaceful relations with Russia. Americans happily swallow propaganda showing the Russians, and Putin in particular, as aggressive, murderous, and scheming. And it is propaganda: any country can be shown to be sinister if certain facts are given the spotlight and others hidden. Americans who happily indulge in negative Russian stereotypes should be more judicious and realize that the US has more than enough sins of its own that could be spun the same way. The main point here is that conflict with Russia is neither inevitable nor desirable, so if members of Trump's team are contacting Russia to facilitate better relations, why would I be bothered by that? Yes, the allegations about the Rosneft deal would be damning, but that is not substantiated. These reports are spinning mere contact as sinister, and that is fucked up. Here is a comment I made in response to some of these issues recently for context:
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5roev7/donald_trump_lifts_sanctions_on_russia_that_were/dd9ifc7/">
         https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5roev7/donald_trump_lifts_sanctions_on_russia_that_were/dd9ifc7/
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        Finally, none of these arguments necessarily imply support for Trump! There are specific policies of Trump's that I agree with, but many that I don't agree with. Also, I don't find his personal ability or character particularly suitable in a leader. However, in terms of conspiracy, these 2-dimensional political policies and personal qualities are secondary. While I'm not sure exactly what Trump represents, and while he clearly does have links to some part of the establishment, he clearly does represent some kind of change. I am ambivalent as of now about whether that change is for the better, but I'm not naive enough to think that the establishment that he's replacing was in any way more ethical or less sinister than Trump is currently portrayed to be. The forces that he has displaced and whose interests he is frustrating are pushing this anti-Russian narrative hard.
For these reasons, I am skeptical of these allegations.

       Holy shit. Just wow. You just start right off and acknowledge the reason for the bias in this sub. I was going to respond to all your points but I don't need to go further than this. You've broke it down for me. Trump is regarded as an enemy of the NWO and, as such, gets the benefit of the doubt. Skepticism regarding federal investigative agencies arises when Trump is the focal point, but everyone in this sub is drooling at the chance for one of those agencies to target DNC or Hillary. Trump-Russia conspiracies are a huge nothingburger, but Clinton's involvement with the Russian uranium "scandal" is a massive deal. Real news regarding the indictments has been occurring every day and the front page is flooded with posts about the DNC.

       I would expect Reddit to have a community of intelligent, like minded people capable of research critical thought and analysis.  I would expect the hillary bashers to continue bashing her.

       Since when do conspiracies need sources? You're quick to call Hillary the most corrupt politician the world has ever seen. Republicans have been trying to nail crimes to her for over 20 years and nothing has stuck. The only evidence that Hillary is a criminal is circumstantial- the same type of evidence that points to Trump and his campaign maliciously colluding with foreign agents.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Hillary was in the exact same position as Trump and his campaign right now would you really be giving her the benefit of the doubt? Have you ever given her the benefit of the doubt on any accusation?
      </p>
      <p>
       You already stated your opinion that Russia and Trump are enemies of the NWO. So now any evidence or information you read that contradicts that will be internally manipulated to fit that narrative.

       Hold on man. It is a fact hillary hired a group to delete emails from her server after a subpoena was issued. It is also a fact she had black berries smashed with hammers.

       I voted for Obama in 08. i voted for Hillary in the 08 primaries. i gave to both candidates in 08. After Oabam's 1st year, it was clear he was corrupt, and I abandoned him. I will do the same with Trump.

       But what i see happening right now is a total all out media frenzy attack on Trump. David Brocke received several million to make sure Trump gets impeached. He has been wire taped, bugged, followed, surveilance, and over 10M has been poured into finding dirt on him and the best they came up with was "Grab em by the pussy."

       Both sides are the same. They create division in the US populace using wedge issues that do not amount to a hill of beans. Obama just continued Bush era policies. They get along great. They are pals. But no one in politics seems to like Trump. I wonder why?

       The real conspiracy in American politics right now is widescale collusion with Russia. Anyone who engaged in quid pro quo activity with Russian officials or representatives (private or public parties) should face investigation, and potentially indictment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who believes in conspiracy theories should pay attention to the
       <em>
        actual conspiracy in front of us
       </em>
       and quit trying to spin the investigation on the conspiracy as the conspiracy itself. It's conspiracy-ception at that point, and it's stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the other half of the conspiracy: anyone who doesn't recognize that Russia is playing both sides against the middle is, again, ignoring the actual conspiracy right in front of us. Bernie subs, politics, news, etc. All of these subs are being targeted and used by bots and trolls to create chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, anyone out there that's pro-Trump and believes in actually conspiracies needs to recognize that their candidate did something illegal or at best very unethical, and then simultaneously come to the objective realization that we are
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       being played by an opportunistic dictator named Vladimir Putin.

       Can you elaborate on this? I am not aware of anything illegal or unethical done by Trump in Re: to Russia.

       Gee, it's almost like having a system where content is voted on opens the door for political biases to strongly influence visibility of content. What is the conspiracy here? The only thing you've uncovered is that reddit is liberal, which is an absolutely astounding realization for everyone here, I'm sure.

       Never said that. People tend to upvote stuff that is bad about the other side and downvote stuff that is bad about their own side. If Trump did something similar it would be plastered on the front page and it has nothing to do with corruption or conspiracies.

       1) It's not election fraud. DNC is a private organisation and their primaries are private processes.

       It's not at zero, it's at negative karma. You just can't see negative karma on a post as opposed to a comment because that's the way Reddit works. Most of the comments likely disagree with the post and it's seems most people who voted on it also disagreed with it.

       cirlcejerk in this context is usually referring to a group of people who are of similar opinion conversing about something (usually in the positive) with no consideration for other end of the issue. its basically everyone do something completely pointless that just makes everyone in the conversation feel good for a couple minutes but accomplished nothing. like a circlejerk. in this particular case he would be implying same fagging to create a solo circle jerk.

       It doesn't make sense demographically that an article critical of the Democratic Party from the left would be at
       <em>
        zero

       on a left leaning political subreddit populated mainly by young people. And there is very good reason to believe that Shareblue (formerly CTR) have basically taken over

       Are you a conservative? That's the only way I could under your complete lack of understanding of the conflict between the left and the Democratic Party establishment.  During the primaries
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       almost always favored Bernie over Hillary, and Bernie supporters have long been resentful of the DNC for pulling shit like this. Something changed in that subreddit, and that something is named David Brock.

       That's just not true.  I know
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is not exactly a leftist sub but I'm surprised by the ignorance people here have about what's going on with the Democratic Party.  Groups like Justice Democrats, Our Revolution, Brand New Congress, and to some extent the Democratic Socialists of America have made reforming the Democratic Party a major goal, and they are definitely paying attention to the DNC.  The DNC chair campaign, where Tom Perez was pushed in by the Obama team to prevent Keith Ellison from winning, was just one example of the ongoing conflict between the left and the center/right wings of the Democratic Party.  As is the recent purge of Bernie supporters from the Rules Committee of the DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you mean "most of the left," you mean most of the American population who tend to vote for Democrats, then sure, most people in general don't care about this shit.  If you're talking about activists and politically opinionated people, the story is very different.

       Yes that's exactly who I'm talking about. I think we agree here. As a large sub, I think most members of
       <a href="/r/politics">

       are more casual political observers than real activists. Activists exist there too, sure, but the large subs are always swallowed up by come-latelies.

       Well maybe that's true. And maybe that makes them more susceptible to manipulation by groups like Shareblue. But I definitely still think that it's happening and that that's playing a role in articles about this being basically disappeared on that sub.

       Shareblue is out in full force.  There is a huge increase on any comment that would be interpreted as "splintering the party".

       A lot of hate for Sanders too.  Most comments follow the same themes.  They are trying to tie the Russians directly to why the Dems lost big.  They are attempting to minimize the DNC handing the Hillary campaign all of the campaign money for down ticket candidates.

       Just so you know, that's not how it always worked, yiu use to be able to see tge true score w/ both upvotes &amp; downvotes separated on both comments &amp; posts.  They've slowly changed it to this way saying they were trying to protect against vote manipulation, but I tend to believe it was because users were pointing out manipulation.

       No, it was definitely a RES feature. Here's a thread from r/enhancement (the RES subreddit) describing it as such:

        https://redd.it/3lsxue
       </a>

       The feature ended up breaking because the site decided not to expose that info (ostensibly to fight spam).

       The site might have removed it and someone used RES to create it again, but that is how the default reddit worked back in the day.  I'll try and see if I can find it, but I've never used RES and distinctly remember the break down on comments and posts.

        They've slowly changed it to this way saying they were trying to protect against vote manipulation, but I tend to believe it was because users were pointing out manipulation.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Vote fuzzing is only a small part, the big change is they changed from a "net upvotes" model to an algorithm calculated "score". For bigger posts the score can be wildly different than the net number of upvotes. There is proof of how wildly inaccurate estimating number of votes from score here:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/5wjlfy/suggestion_remove_total_vote_count_as_its_wildly/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/5wjlfy/suggestion_remove_total_vote_count_as_its_wildly/
       </a>
       , the closer to 50% a post is the higher the error. In that linked post I link to an admin comment confirming a post had less than 50k total votes, but the number given by res was 900k, way, way off.

       The rules are so draconian, and open to interpretation, that almost every post can be removed if they want to. This allows them to convince people like you that they are behaving reasonably, even when they are really belligerent, as the rest of those comments show.

       As a resident of r/politics/rising, posts are often pushed into the negative when they've been posted already.  Whether it's karma whores or shills, it gets tiring seeing the same shit over and over again.  When a story is actually fresh, you'll see different sources and even the same source with upvotes.  Hours later and you're still posting the same shit?  Get the fuck out.

       The same story gets posted on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       over and over again, and there are people from both sides that just troll /new/ and post there. Duplicate stories generally get downvoted. I can assure you this was on the front page of

       Nonsense. Getting a middling response and not making it to the front page isn't the same as not being down voted into negative karma, and they reflect very different processes.  Search "Mueller" by new and there's not a single article at 0 in the first 25 results, and that includes duplicate stories. Many that definitely won't make it to the front page of course, but none at 0.

       I don’t think questioning the DNC is inconsistent with the subs typical readership at all. The phenomenon you are describing happens on all the big subreddits. People lurk /new/ and their voting patterns tend to guide which articles get a foothold in the voting. That doesn’t mean topics are censored by TPTB or there is a conspiracy to hide information from the masses. You can go to /politics/new/ right now and there will be dozens of articles on thensqme topic, some with zero karma and some with hundreds. It’s not vote fixing, it’s just the complex machinations of the hive mind and an illustration of the theory behind Reddit.

       No, it's not, which is exactly my point.  It is consistent with it, which is why it's abnormal that the vast majority of stories critical of the DNC are disproportionately downvoted into negative karma when compared with stories about other subjects.

       You are obviously determined to chalk these blatant detectable voting patterns up to "complex machinations of the hive mind" but the more obvious and likely explanation is astroturfing by organizations such as Shareblue that have
       <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/337535680/Full-David-Brock-Confidential-Memo-On-Fighting-Trump#from_embed">
        openly announced their intentions

       to use thousands of paid employees to influence narratives on social media.
      </p>

       Sometimes when something seems obvious, it's true.  Why
       <em>
        wouldn't
       </em>
       they try to manipulate the story?  It's not shocking or outlandish.  This kind of thing happens

       Well again, it's not
       <em>
        censorship,
       </em>
       so it's not like these stories are never seen at all.  But there are definitely external forces trying to influence
       <em>
        how much
       </em>
       certain stories are seen and discussed, and it seems likely that could have a corrosive effect on the casual reader's perception of the relative importance of events.  ie, thinking that Russian oppo research is a more pressing issue than a Democratic Party establishment that is completely opposed to the notion of class struggle.

       Regardless I always manage to see every "Trump said what?" Thread on r/politics and every post that's arguably backhandedly anti republican, like that dumb thread about Germany's amazing (shitty) wind energy program. That's just reinforcing anger against people like Trump who are supposedly doubling down on coal instead of harnessing this infinite clean energy. Normies don't know anything about this shit but their feels so those types of posts are effective

        A memo obtained by NBC News details the way in which the Democratic National Committee struck a deal with Hillary Clinton in 2015 that gave her campaign input on some party hiring and spending decisions.
        <strong>
         According to the memo, it related only to preparations for the general election and also left the door open for other candidates to make similar arrangements. The document provides additional context to claims made by former interim chairwoman Donna Brazile, which sent the party into a tailspin this week.

       Follow the link through. That seems to be an entirely different agreement.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The agreement supplemented
        <strong>
         a separate Clinton-DNC standard joint fundraising agreement, which was first reported over a year and a half ago, but gained new attention this week with Brazile’s book.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        In an excerpt of her book, "Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House," published this week in Politico, Brazile wrote she was stunned to find out about the agreement, which she called a "cancer" on the party and claimed led the DNC to treat Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., unfairly during the primaries.

       It's not a different agreement. The fundraising agreement is not the one the Berntards are throwing a tantrum over.

       It's hilarious a year later these idiots are still looking for any excuse they can to avoid admitting Sanders got fucking destroyed in a primary.

       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       the one described in that Daily Beast link, is the one that Donna Brazile was talking about.  The memo you posted is NOT describing the agreement that Donna called a "cancer."

       Are you referring to this - "The Sanders' campaign later signed its own joint fundraising agreement with the DNC, but did not utilize it."  That's a different agreement, with different terms, AKA not giving the Sanders campaign control over staffing, strategy and finance before the primaries ended.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that complicated. We aren't upset that there
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       an agreement, we're upset over the
       <em>

       of the agreement.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In a letter to DNC members, Chairman Tom Perez noted that the party reached joint fundraising agreements with both Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. "The joint fundraising agreements were the same for each campaign except for the treasurer, and our understanding was that the DNC offered all of the presidential campaigns the opportunity to set up a [joint fundraising agreement] and work with the DNC to coordinate on how those funds were used to best prepare for the general election."
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         That may be true — but two Democratic officials tell NPR that Brazile and Perez are referring to two different things. In addition to that joint fundraising agreement the DNC reached with both campaigns, the party and the Clinton campaign struck that separate memorandum of understanding giving the campaign staffing and policy oversight.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The separate deal they're talking about?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That document was signed on Aug. 26, 2015 — before, among other things, Vice President Joe Biden ruled out a run for president.
       </p>
       <p>
        The DNC has not denied this characterization or timeline.
       </p>
       <p>
        A Democratic official who has reviewed the document pointed out that in addition to the Clinton signoffs Brazile characterized, it included language stating that "nothing in this agreement shall be construed to violate the DNC's obligation of impartiality and neutrality through the Nominating process" and that "all activities performed under this agreement will be focused exclusively on preparations for the General Election and not the Democratic Primary."
       </p>
       <p>
        The agreement also noted that the DNC "may enter into similar agreements with other candidates." (Read the full memo below.)

       Yes, you should've linked to that article in the first place, because it had information about the agreement in question that wasn't included in your other link.
      </p>
      <p>
       After reading through the agreement, it seems to be self contradictory and somewhat vague. I mean it starts out at the very beginning with this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "HFA's obligations under this agreement, and the release of the Base Amounts each month are conditioned on the following:
       </p>
       <p>
        With respect to the hiring of a DNC Communications Director,
        <strong>
         the DNC agrees that no later than September 11, 2015 it will hire one of two candidates previously identified as acceptable to HFA
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Which is obviously giving HFA control over the DNC before the primaries are over.  And then it goes on to list the things Donna described, but it does end in the caveat that everything in the agreement is intended for "preparations for the general."  The only way for that not to be a contradiction is if the meaning of "preparations" extends all the way back to September 2015.  Also of note is that no one in the DNC has actually denied that Hillary's campaign
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       given the authority that Donna listed. All anyone has done is point to that specific contradictory wording within the agreement, like "we couldn't have done that, we said we wouldn't."
      </p>
      <p>
       So you're right, this definitely is an important consideration, and I guess we end up in a he said she said situation. But everything I just said, along with what was revealed about the DNC's obvious favoritism during the primaries, leads me to believe that Donna's interpretation of the agreement is probably what was actually acted on, and that the caveat about the general election was effectively meaningless.  But who knows.

       <p>
        The agreement—signed by Amy Dacey, the former CEO of the DNC, and Robby Mook with a copy to Marc Elias—specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings.

       Funny, it was clearly sitting at over 10k votes on our front page when I responded.. don't think it would get there if it was "reset to 0".

       I think too many people like to play make believe about how technology works. Maybe you saw an error that's clearly not in effect for the rest of us (even OP).

       I just had a guy respond telling me that the post was "reset to 0" yesterday.. meaning it must have hit 10+k

       My personal favorite is when they are total dicks in comments that get removed by a local mod and they start crying site-wide admin abuse towards some random asshole that reddit apparently cares enough about to wipe their existence from the website.

       I've followed this sub for a long while, you didn't see that so much until r/the_dumbass started thinking they fit in here. Multiple posts about people claiming censorship by r/news "they won't let my anti Hillary post stay up!" When it clearly has already been posted, or it's a source that isn't allowed, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really hate how many posts that are clearly just political in nature (no conspiracy, almost always right leaning) are left to stay up here. I come here to get away from the drama of r/politics and news..

       Yeah this place has a heavy TD presence, but given that Trump's popularity with the right started with him never giving up on the birther conspiracies it's no surprise they are a big part of this sub.

       I love that anything dealing with Russia's influence, however, is rarely put to the top here. It's painfully obvious how influential TD is here.

       I think it is because Alex Jones likes Trump so much. I have no idea why he loves Trump as much as he does...It makes it easy for people to dismiss Jones when he supports Trump like he is doing.

       So last part 2015 until now reddit has been bombing controversial political posts. Anyone who pays consistent attention to that type of thing realizes it. You may be stating the actual case for this specific post, but overall Reddit is owned by establishment corporation Conde Nast &amp; anything that promotes a socialist leaning candidate or populist politics is not staying on the front page as it was able to back in Early to Mid 2015 when Bernie made his ascension.

       I think it has a lot to do with the fact that theres much more pressing and interesting things happening at the same time with a party in power.  We already pretty much knew this had happened, but the dnc isn't in power right now and it isn't as consequential to the public.
      </p>

       This issue will have to be addressed, but I understand the urge to not let this muddy the waters in regards to the perception of the corruption facing the actual president.

       There's just too much going on and people are getting scandal fatigue to the point that people feel that nothing matters anymore and there's nothing we can do because everything is shit. I'd like to think people can multi task, but there are just way too many shit balls in the air right now to be adding any more right this second.

       I think the desire to sweep it under the rug goes beyond what you're saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's easy to hate Republicans because we are postured to think that their policies have short term gains for the rich and long term detriments to the middle and lower class. In truth, true conservatism follows the principle of trickle down economics is that the more capital they have not being paid out to mandatory expenses, the more they can invest in themselves, their employees, their businesses, thus creating cash surplus, increasing the consumer spending index, and facilitating economic growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is completely disingenious and biased to not hold the DNC to the same type of investigation and to hold Hillary and her campaign responsible for what they've done. They are just as much at fault for what we are going through as Donald Trump is. If she and her campaign did not disenfranchise American voters, we would likely have a new president and none of this would even be happening right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       She needs to be tried.

       If a person purposely lets a bull into a China shop and starts wrecking the place, you deal with the bull first.  It's causing the most immediate damage. The person who allowed it should of course be held accountable, but they're not going to be the focus while the bull is still fucking up the shop.

       Let's talk about how the bull got into the shop in the first place. We had a swarm of sheep bicker over whether it should be the sheep or the lamb, and the bull exploited their quarrel and snuck past security during the fray. Noticing this, the sheep drops a banana peel underneath the leg of the lamb (lol) and lies to everyone who supported the lamb, despite the fact that more people preferred the lamb to begin with. Which left the bull to destroy the significantly weaker sheep and then take control of the entire store.

       Analogies aside, Hillary duped Bernie and his supporters. If she ran a fair campaign, she still wouldn't have been the president, but qualified officials on the subject say that neither would Donald Trump. Just because you're partial to Hillary and her politics doesn't make her any less divisive. Her book is bullshit, and she fucked over America and is a significant part of why we are living in Trumpland. She needs to be help accountable, it's not like there's a shortage of political lawyers waiting to take her down.

       Investment follows opportunity. If there are no clear opportunities, there is no investment.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are only two exceptions to this rule: passion projects, which tend to lose money for a long time, and 'forced' investment which occurs as a means of hiding wealth from the tax man. Ie: taxes are high and palms are greased or there is a specific tax cut given for investment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Businesses by and large do not exist purely out of the goodness of the owners hearts. They exist to make profit. If there is no opportunity for profit then something else is going on.

       Trump had a bad week.  You or he has insight into the mind/emotions of that guy?  You think Manafort committing crimes under the Obama era has something to do with things?

       Do you think Mueller is circling the wagons around Mueller....for fun? You do realize his goal is to get to the bottom of Russian collusion, and going after Manafort for these financial related crimes is what we call "the low hanging fruit". Once he has Manafort where he wants him, he'll leverage that to find out what he can about what Trump knew, and when.

       The DNC did nothing illegal. No crimes were committed. Unethical, yes, but legal.
      </p>

       Meanwhile, present and former members of the Trump administration are the focus of an ongoing corruption investigation and not a single thread about that is on the

       Are you being serious? Really? REALLY?? Wake up. It doesn't matter if you used to believe in those people, I used to, but I was honest enough with myself to see what they really were and what was actually going on. Trump is no angel, of course, but the thing is - EVERYBODY who is anybody pretty much in DC, in the media etc, are going after Trump, they are investigating him, if he is corrupt, if he's done something wrong, we will definitely find out about it and he will face justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference, and this is what so many fail to see, is that EVERYBODY pretty much is on the other hand COVERING UP for Clinton et al. The media, people in law enforcement, the DNC etc, have been covering up for Clinton for what appears to be a very long time. Social media is rigged in their favor, the MSM for the most part chooses to ignore revelations about Clinton and the DNC that it would be screeching about were they about Trump instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why people push the Clinton crimes on subs like this, because if we don't, no one will. Trump corruption is more than covered by TPTB. Clinton corruption is not, and that is a massive problem for justice and democracy and national security and everything that the US supposedly stands for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be that person who allows their cognitive dissonance to direct them into being a completely amoral human being. The DNC is not your family, Hillary Clinton is not your Mom-it's okay if you acknowledge that they have broken the law, that they are as corrupt as the universe is large. They duped you, they duped a hell of a lot of people. The only shame is in NOT admitting that, and being part of the crowd that tried to help them get away with it (and failed, btw).

       Yes. Mostly. Also to see how effectively the Russian trolls have managed to turn what was once a legitimate conspiracy subreddit into an anti-clinton, anti-DNC, pro-trump, pro-russia echo chamber.

       Never said you were, I said it seems dumb to make fun of conspiracy theorists like they're crazy for jumping at shadows (this thread) when there was an actual real live conspiracy just exposed, which goes to show that conspiracies actually do happen. Thus validating this sub to at least some degree.

       Nobody is saying conspiracies don't happen. You can't deny though that this sub has a terrible history of jumping at shadows and imagining coordinated conspiracies against them exist when there is zero evidence of it and actual evidence to the contrary...exactly like OP did with this post. Those people deserve to be made fun of because they're ridiculous.

       Lol, haha sorry my sarcasm offended you bro, just calling it like I see it. I've watched this sub devolve over the past few years from a place of passionate discussion about wide ranging conspiracy theories into a highly politicized, anti-hillary, pro-trump sounding board. It's shitty and deserves to be called out.

       Unsurprisingly, this pair of comments I made on r/Political_Revolution (not r/Politics mind you, I don't have the time to talk to those morons), was not well perceived:
POST 1: 
The DNC also manipulated the electronic voter rolls, physically blocked ppl from voting, threw out millions of ballots, and "lost" thousands of voter registrations
POST 2:
You can chose to believe what the media tells you. But here's some evidence for you.
(1) The DNC also manipulated the electronic voter rolls: Stanford Study showing statistically significant differences between the exit polls and electronic voting machines final tallies, compared to no statistical differences between exit polls and paper voting machines. Anyone actually watching the live results trickle in could witness these anomalies first hand. If it takes a bunch of CS students 90 minutes to hack one of our electronic voting machines, how fast do you think the DNC or other gov't agency can do it. Electronic voting machines are not safe, they are easy to hack and manipulate without detection. Go ahead do some research, open your eyes to how easy it is to change vote totals on electronic voting machines.
(2) physically blocked ppl from voting: Bill Clinton decided to stump for Hillary Clinton in front of a polling station, physically preventing people from entering the station for over 2 hours. This is just one small instance. Other instances include less than 1/2 of the polling stations being open across many states and counties, Rhode Island, Arizona and New York to just name a few, causing long lines, eventually preventing ppl from voting. There are many more examples across almost all 50 states, but I don't have the time this morning to cite them all.
(3) threw out millions of ballots: In California 8 million ballots were cast, but take a look at Wikipedia, the final totals are hovering around 5 million. So what happened to the other 2.5-3 million? They were never counted, another source. The mainstream media has worked double-time to downplay this situation, but the fact that provisional ballots were not counted, even though they should have been is deeply troubling.
(4) "lost" thousands of voter registrations: All of the votes from an entire district in Brooklyn were "lost", every single person that registered as a Democrat in this district were unable to cast primary ballots. Its just coincidence that this is heavily populated millennial area, and that the Clinton HQs were in Brooklyn, right? Or take Maricopa County, Arizona as a lovely case study.
And just in case you were still hunting for more facts, why don't you take some time to read the Election Justice USA report on all of the voting inaccuracies, suppression and other fuckery that happened during the DNC primary. Election Justice USA is a non-profit, non-partisan organization whose mission is to expose voter corruption.
I don't have more time to cite sources, and unfortunately a lot of information has been intentionally buried and other misleading stories have taken their place. The truth is Bernie had the people behind him, he had the momentum and he had the popular support, through decentralized efforts to commit voter fraud, manipulation and suppression, the DNC and Hillary's camp (who controlled the DNC) were able to ensure that Bernie lost. You can continue to live in your fairy tale, but until you are able to accept that our government is not accountable, and our voting practices are untrustworthy, you will continue to be part of the problem.

       Excellent post. Ironic all the discussion of Russian trolls and bots trying to sway public opinion by impersonating organic users, but no discussion of Hillcamp using ShareBlue to do the same. And still vast discussion of Russian hacking of DNC despite no evidence, and absolutely no discussion of the undemocratic election manipulation discussed in those emails between DNC and Hillcamp.

       This is no different from all that goddamned prohillary antisanders ShareBlue spam. Reddit didn't do anything to curb that either. Nor did any of the leaked emails showing undemocratic DNC and Hillcamp behaviors float for very long. Anyone that doesn't think Reddit is being influenced by private interests are delusional.

       because Reddit is a liberal hive mind that has abandoned all of its roots in favor of blindly following the leftist agenda no matter what it takes - which includes heavily censoring anything NOT leftist... just look at r/the-donald and it's sub count - the actual sub number is wayyyyyyyyyyy fucking higher than what it shows

       I posted the article on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       yesterday and the upvote count stayed exactly at 0 even though it was swamped by comments. Not —2 or at least +4 but just 0. Someone tell me how that works.

       I'm noticing that everyday there's a different post on the Conspiracy top page complaining about a certain topic not getting enough attention. Look, we get it. We know that the MSM suppresses certain news stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to put our energy towards uncovering more truth, rather than complaining and being frustrated over censorship which we already know exists. Funnel that energy towards something more productive, and let's stop upvoting this kind of news story.

       I'm pretty sure I saw bots or paid posters in that Elizabeth Warren thread, someone commented saying her not being Native American was Russian fake news, then I check the poster, same reply to like five people and at least like 20 in the same thread and two comments ever before that. But I saw the dnc thing a couple times, reddit also moves fast sometimes.

       the bigger conspiracy is that you're here complaining about something that happened a year ago that doesn't really matter anymore, at a time that the winner of the election is in deep shit. this coupled with all the other attempts to distract people back to Hillary leads me to the belief that you're a goddamn schill.

       What is the obsession with how things get rated or posted or displayed on Reddit?  People who want hard news will seek it out.  The casual reader may bump into the news.  The obsession with Reddit's placement of upvoted articles seems to be the desire to be presented to a low level audience so they might accidentally click on the article.  If the information an article has to share is really important and a small audience sees it - that is enough.  Why spend so many hours trying to prove that Reddit, which is a private comany offering a free service, of not acting like a public forum that is absolutely fair to every view offered.  What is the obsession.  Post your interesting material and move on.

       Are you being serious? Really? REALLY?? Wake up. It doesn't matter if you used to believe in those people, I used to, but I was honest enough with myself to see what they really were and what was actually going on. Trump is no angel, of course, but the thing is - EVERYBODY who is anybody pretty much in DC, in the media etc, are going after Trump, they are investigating him, if he is corrupt, if he's done something wrong, we will definitely find out about it and he will face justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference, and this is what so many fail to see, is that EVERYBODY pretty much is on the other hand COVERING UP for Clinton et al. The media, people in law enforcement, the DNC etc, have been covering up for Clinton for what appears to be a very long time. Social media is rigged in their favor, the MSM for the most part chooses to ignore revelations about Clinton and the DNC that it would be screeching about were they about Trump instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why people push the Clinton crimes on subs like this, because if we don't, no one will. Trump corruption is more than covered by TPTB. Clinton corruption is not, and that is a massive problem for justice and democracy and national security and everything that the US supposedly stands for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be that person who allows their cognitive dissonance to direct them into being a completely amoral human being. The DNC is not your family, Hillary Clinton is not your Mom-it's okay if you acknowledge that they have broken the law, that they are as corrupt as the universe is large. They duped you, they duped a hell of a lot of people. The only shame is in NOT admitting that, and being part of the crowd that tried to help them get away with it (and failed, btw).

       I've followed this sub for a long while, you didn't see that so much until r/the_dumbass started thinking they fit in here. Multiple posts about people claiming censorship by r/news "they won't let my anti Hillary post stay up!" When it clearly has already been posted, or it's a source that isn't allowed, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really hate how many posts that are clearly just political in nature (no conspiracy, almost always right leaning) are left to stay up here. I come here to get away from the drama of r/politics and news..

      <p>
       No, it's not, which is exactly my point.  It is consistent with it, which is why it's abnormal that the vast majority of stories critical of the DNC are disproportionately downvoted into negative karma when compared with stories about other subjects.

       You are obviously determined to chalk these blatant detectable voting patterns up to "complex machinations of the hive mind" but the more obvious and likely explanation is astroturfing by organizations such as Shareblue that have
