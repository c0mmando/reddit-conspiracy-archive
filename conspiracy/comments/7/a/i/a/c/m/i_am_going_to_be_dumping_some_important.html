        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are various reasons I want to make sure I have a large audience before I release this info.</p>

<ul>
<li>My safety</li>
<li>To ensure others don&#39;t try to profit from this information which would prevent me from getting my info out</li>
<li>Others may try to use this info to promote their own agendas</li>
<li>So people get the legit info before disinfo is spread to counter this info. This might have already happened, unfortunately. It seems disinfo agents flooded the scene when I discovered this info and started looking for someone to help me get this info to the masses.</li>
</ul>

<p>What i am looking for is a method to generate hype here and other places and to create as large an audience as possible so when i do put this info out it makes an impact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I were you, I would actually send it everywhere all at once - send it to mainstream news channels - I think people forget to do that because they assume the MSM is totally corrupt and not worth bothering with, which is true in some sense, but in other ways it&#39;s not like all the journalists are &#39;in on it&#39; and many of them genuinely think they&#39;re doing a good job, they&#39;re just as brainwashed as everyone else. So send it to mainstream journalists, but pick ones from each organisation that you have a good feeling about, and send to the general tip email addresses.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s scientific information, send it to universities and academics - again people think/assume that academia is all corrupt and in some senses it is, but again the vast majority of scientists are genuine and honest and really are trying to investigate the truth. Again they are often just as misled as everyone else, and the majority will not try to cover up information at all. Send to relevant scientists, and probably try for slightly less senior scientists, ones that don&#39;t have their careers funded by Lockheed Martin etc.</p>

<p>Email everyone, basically. But it&#39;s very important that you present your information in such a way that it&#39;s taken seriously. Do not start with grandiose claims. Start with questions, come from the position of someone who isn&#39;t sure what to make of this info, but you know it&#39;s important. Explain the info simply, don&#39;t interpret it. If you start interpreting it&#39;s much more likely you&#39;ll accidentally end up making yourself easy to dismiss.</p>

<p>There is one independent journalist that I personally think is very very good and decent - Jake Morphonios at End Times News Report. he has a YT channel and is one of the most genuine and respectable honest decent investigative independent journalists there is out there. Just watch a few of his videos first and you&#39;ll see what I mean. He has a secure email at which people can send him information. He also has experience with getting out sensitive information and has himself put out his own research through other outlets to ensure his own safety and that the information gets out properly. So even if you don&#39;t feel comfortable sending him the info, I think he could give you some really good advice about how to go about it. </p>

<p>Obviously go watch him first and check that you agree that he is an honest decent person who would really help you. He&#39;s done a lot of recent research on the Las Vegas shooting, but he has research going back decades into all kinds of things, he has contacts in various places, he seems very professional and very unbiased and basically a good and intelligent man.</p>

<p>Good luck my friend!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for all the great ideas and taking the time.</p>

<p>This Jake Morphonios sounds ideal too.</p>

<p>But just to give you an idea of my situation and why I feel I need to do things the way I am.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to go into too much detail here because again people will take this info and try to profit from it.. anything I say i feel that is the case.</p>

<p>But these people who keep the secrets... they are not stupid. They have made the truth so difficult to get out it may be impossible. And this isn&#39;t for the reason most believe... when I start revealing the info i will go more in depth on that though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your motto. :) </p>

<p>For the record, I am interested in the information that you are claiming to have. I would love to watch your videos once you start making them. Your most essential progression will come from just doing it. Although other people may have great ideas to get you started, nothing is better than real experience.</p>

<p>Create a logo. Create a channel. Start building the experience that you will desperately need once you are ready to drop the knowledge. Just starting off, your channel does not need to be about the information you plan to put out there. Keep in it a similar realm so that you attract the correct audience that will then hopefully spread your truthbombs. Good luck friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Will do! </p>

<p>Take into account that most of these other Youtubers have years of experience writing, editing, and publishing videos. You can&#39;t just start day 1 and expect to be a great. It ALL takes time. Set a small goal. Possibly start by publishing one video a month. Keep pushing youself to be better. Progressively reduce the amount of time between releasing videos until it&#39;s about once a week. Your audience will definitely pick up once you get there.</p>

<p>You need something that will set you apart from the rest. Maybe your info? Is there any part of your information that doesn&#39;t give away the whole thing but almost teases it? On that note: One fault I see a lot of people do is constantly claim to have info but never reveal anything. We are on the internet. There is SO much information out there to look at and dig through and absorb. If you don&#39;t have anything new, people will lose traction.</p>

<p>Yeah if I were your in your position (secretly jealous I wish I had something awesome to share lol) I would just go ahead and spend as much time as possible on making a video with the most credible evidence you have (don&#39;t leave anything out, don&#39;t suggest anything without proof) save copies to a physical hd or something give them to family/friends and just go share it dude. Don&#39;t be worried about not getting views because if it&#39;s as good as you claim it to be then it&#39;ll get the attention and people (especially on this sub) even though many of them can be nasty and cruel- they all care about the truth and would do their hardest to protect it and save it from being deleted den the web. </p>

<p>What???</p>

<p>There are my conclusions and how I came to these conclusions. It will take me a long time to explain how I came to these conclusions - the evidence.</p>

<p>If I post my conclusions which have shock value and others post them to boost their own agenda before i can explain all my info then these people take away attention from me or prevent me from getting it - then i could be killed or people just ignore the important info I need to explain so they understand my conclusions.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t about credit.. it&#39;s about what can be done with this info. If people don&#39;t know I am the one who presented it then I can never get the full message out. It takes too much time and teaching to understand it.</p>

<p>And I need Youtube because it will help me teach people what they need to know in a more entertaining and effective way. This info is very tedious if just reading it.</p>

<p>Take into account that most of these other Youtubers have years of experience writing, editing, and publishing videos. You can&#39;t just start day 1 and expect to be a great. It ALL takes time. Set a small goal. Possibly start by publishing one video a month. Keep pushing youself to be better. Progressively reduce the amount of time between releasing videos until it&#39;s about once a week. Your audience will definitely pick up once you get there.</p>

<p>You need something that will set you apart from the rest. Maybe your info? Is there any part of your information that doesn&#39;t give away the whole thing but almost teases it? On that note: One fault I see a lot of people do is constantly claim to have info but never reveal anything. We are on the internet. There is SO much information out there to look at and dig through and absorb. If you don&#39;t have anything new, people will lose traction.</p>
