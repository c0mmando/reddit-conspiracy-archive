       Did the FBI cover up an elite Saudi crime against US citizens? Was the attack in response to some action Trump took against him? How are pedophiles like the Podesta's tied into all of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I am making some assumptions but it explains why it seems like the FBI has been making the story up as they go.

       Looking at this post, it seems to be shilling with bot vote manipulation. Never before have I seen the request for supporting evidence met with down votes and verbal assialt. In addition, this post is in  succession of exact time frame style disinformation posts.. It shows how much they are trying to gaslight and spread disinformation on the topic of LV murder spree that the deep state inflicted on us citizens.

       I like the FBI sting gone wrong idea, and this only adds credibility to the theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Saudi prince tries to buy some guns, for whatever reason, and finds out his source is an FBI plant. Kills the plant, and shoots at the crowd to create enough chaos to escape.... UPSTAIRS.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI can't let ANY of this out because of their own exposure and the connection to the Saudis.

       Yeah I never understood the rhetoric about exits being blocked. At a ticketed concert you always have choke-points for entrance and exit so people don't just walk in for free.

When do we stop and say, no people died and we aren't just going to make up fairy tales. This is. Real event. If you have a theory base it in reality out of respect for the event itself.

       People are comparing variables and information in order to come to the truth. Accepting any part of it as concrete truth, denies the fact that every bit of this is being distributed through sanction channels except what is leaking.

       I personally think it makes a lot more sense to think that the Old redneck was attending the concert and died, and was dragged into a hallway to cover up a CIA weapons deal, then to think he decided to just shoot into a crowd his peers for no reason. Mass Shooters Target the other, not people they identify with

       The door to the stairs was sealed. No escape. I am believing. There were more people who were in that room who were captured or killed. Campos just stumbled onto to sealed door and was caught in the crossfire. The hour it took for lv swat to breach the room was plenty of time for them to remove those captured in the sting. The shootings were to cover the planned escape via helicopter. Some were captured some escaped.

       That stairwell was blocked, but the others?? I think there are too many variables to cover exactly how they got out. Which leads to your point that
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       they didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI would
       <strong>
        <em>
         anything
        </em>
       </strong>
       to cover very high ranking Saudi Royals getting caught red-handed in a terrorism related event. And the royal family would be deeply indebted if they were granted the favor of taking care of the issue themselves.

       IF any of those arrested in Saudi Arabia get executed, I just

       I find it totally unbelievable it took swat to breach a room held by a single man no matter how many guns he had (he only has two hands) over an hour to do so. No snipers on other buildings to take him out? No grenades to throw into the room. They couldve just shot him from  another room by making a hole in any of the walls. It sounds absolutely fucking ridiculous.

       Swat aren't assassin's. When someone is no longer actively shooting they take their time and try to negotiate. This isn't anything crazy. Someone discharging their weapon when a subject is lying in a pool of his own blood? Nah that's not normal

       Yeah but I'm sure the negotiation manual goes out the 32nd floor window after the first few hundred rounds into the crowd. I don't get your second comment? Because someone else was injured? Who cares. Surely they're all trained to realize they were in the middle of possibly one of the biggest terrorist attacks on US soil outside of 911 or any bombings: an automatic assault rifle literally going ham on a crowd of thousands. I'm obvioulsy no expert, just seems really fucking stupid to me your goal isn't the immediate end of his life as he's firing magazine after magazine into an open crowd.

       They had no idea there was only one person in there. In fact, they've outright admitted they were convinced there were a bunch of shooters in there, and that's most likely why the SWAT guy accidentally discharged his weapon when they breached the adjoining room.

       A Saudi Prince staying in the top floors was to be taken into custody, the operation turned sour and the bodyguards opened fire on the crowd to create sufficient diversion for the prince to get away. The guns were all already in the hotel -- stockpiled arms for Saudi security. The Saudi prince got away. Paddock was an agent shot during the operation. Saudi bodyguard bodies cleaned up and the event pinned on Paddock as a more public acceptable turn than what actually happened. Too soon to reveal the operation against the Saudi princes.

       The only problem with your theory is that the guns are all documented as purchased by Paddock. He could have bought them for the saudis, but I don't think so.

      <p>
       The fact of the matter is that Paddock buying he guns in his own name is doesn't fit smoothly into any theory, for me at least.

If he was an agent, that paperwork could have been produced as needed.  I've only seen one gun shop owner interviewed.  The story goes that he bought guns in three different places.

       I ascribe to the theory Paddock was lured into a fake gun showing under the premise of a potential legitimate buy, shot, and then the guns were hijacked for the attack by a third party.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP's point and this information seems to affirm that suspicion when combined with the fact that all the guns were Paddock's and the timeline of his death/Campos' arrival being fucked.

       If you read my post I ask the same question. They traded a lot of insults and Trump warned him if he became president he wouldn't be able to use daddy's money to interfere in US politics any longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked the question because I was hoping someone would point out something Trump may have done to make good on his threat. Leaving a mass of dead bodies for his administration to deal with would have been good retribution if he thought he was untouchable, which apparently he is not. I am speculating. Some people can't handle people thinking outside of the elites mainstream narrative.

       But if this was a personal vendetta against trump, why not attack one of his actual properties to directly impact Trump's holdings rather than a general 'attack on something in the USA'?

       I mean, 99.99% probably wasn't him pulling the trigger, but some people don't need more motive than to have the will and the power to do it, and get away with it. Could have just simply been a cathartic experience for the Saudi Prince.

       Well if he's friends with Trump, maybe they wanted to make the FBI look bad by getting a bunch of citizens killed during an FBI operation. Saudi Arabia in that situation would never have planned to take ownership of it. It would be a terrorist attack by Isis. But the narrative would remain the same- that the FBI's ineptitude lead to a terrorist attack.

       It's been openly stated in the press that Trump, from the beginning of his presidency, has been at war with our nations alphabet agencies. If we can stipulate that, we can suppose; if something is going on behind the scenes, both parties have  motive to keep things that would make the public look poorly on them under wraps.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, back to the random theory; I think the most problematic part of conspiracy theories is asking someone to describe exactly what happened. The who crashed in to whom and exactly how is hard to say. Conspiracy arises from doubt. The solution to doubt is asking questions and answering them with evidence. So until we are given the evidence, it's all conjecture.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it is fair to say that when the world knows that our government is in disarray (especially from a security standpoint) other countries might see angles that would benefit themselves. So if the Saudi prince sees an opportunity to get someone in front of him out of the way, the question becomes; is it plausible?
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on what we know
There's been a power shift in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi stakeholder in Mandalay Bay is on the outs. The most deadly attack in modern history just occurred under very suspicious circumstances at said building. The FBI is doing a piss poor job getting a legitimate timeline and motive to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can easily see a scenario that involved a botched FBI operation where the country was attacked &amp; the FBI is keeping it under wraps for fear they will basically be burned to the ground if it comes out that a terror attack occurred during an FBI operation. Especially when they killed this many people.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this may be true but without the transparency how will we ever know?

       I believe LV shooting was carried off by a Saudi Prince in a game of Big Game Human Hunting.  I posted this claim here less than a weekt after the event and said I would create a separate post to elaborate but never did because honestly I was scared to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didnt want to be right because i knew being right on such a wild claim would make myself a target for exposing the insane nature of the claim.

       Remember that the Saudi Prince owns The Four Seasons hotel that is in floors 35 to 39 in the Mandalay Bay hotel with separate entrances and elevators and linked by a fire escape, and not one stinking news organization has reported this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we find out that the Saudi Air Force rented an entire hotel in Las Vegas one month before.

       There are no coincidences.  There is SOME connection between all of this and the Prince being arrested.

       The prince owns shares, not the whole company of the four seasons. And fire escapes where? Separate elevators doesn't help, and owning it benefits them how? They going to refuse the FBI or police entrance to the floor?

      <p>
       I'm all about the Las Vegas shooting, but nothing anyone has said here makes any logical sense, they're simply trying to add unrelated shit that doesn't hold water.

       And whose said the FBI can't come in? What it means is that people can enter and exit the Four Seasons while everyone is fixated on Mandalay Bay entrances elevators.

       I've seen plenty of floor plans, they are called stairs, not fire escapes. Fire escapes are typically built into private housing like large apartment buildings.. I've never seen them in any hotel, ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point was, that there's no advantage to owning that part of the hotel, especially if it's just shares of the overall company. Also, all the elevators were locked down by police, that was given by the police timeline as well as said on Ellen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not assuming the FBI wasn't in on it, I'm considering all possibilities which include the idea that they weren't, and looking at that scenario.. there's no benefit unless you're claiming they denied law enforcement from entry, which in the beginning was the police, not FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the stairs was barricaded also goes against this thought process. The elevators all have cameras on them, so why would they block off the stairs, their only way of moving undetected.

       Ill give you guys some fun strings to follow. Podesta was receiving 140k a month from the Saudi's. The Mandalay Bay Resort was owned by the sone saudi who just got arrested. The Saudi's through the prince that just got arrested donated extensively to the Clinton campaign which had a large gun control stance. Paddock who did the shooting was an accountant with a pilots license who flew to other country's for "work" (seems like a CIA agent to me).

       Tony Podesta and the prince has a sizable stake in the 4 seasons, which occupies the floors above the Mandalay Bay portion of the hotel where Paddock was saying. The prince does not "own" either of the hotels. Just wanted to clear up the specifics on those two points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure what the connection between Saudi donations and gun control would be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes Paddock had a pilots license and a plane. Not sure that there is evidence that he flew that plane to other countries or that he took commercial flights for work to other countries.

       Somebody more like crown prince Mohammad bin Salman with sociopathic personality would be much more suspect. Alaweed seems like somebody of good character and good will.

       That stairwell was blocked, but the others?? I think there are too many variables to cover exactly how they got out. Which leads to your point that
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       they didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI would
       <strong>
        <em>
         anything
        </em>
       </strong>
       to cover very high ranking Saudi Royals getting caught red-handed in a terrorism related event. And the royal family would be deeply indebted if they were granted the favor of taking care of the issue themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF any of those arrested in Saudi Arabia get executed, I just
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       forgive the FBI for this one....might.
       <sup>
        prolly not

       I find it totally unbelievable it took swat to breach a room held by a single man no matter how many guns he had (he only has two hands) over an hour to do so. No snipers on other buildings to take him out? No grenades to throw into the room. They couldve just shot him from  another room by making a hole in any of the walls. It sounds absolutely fucking ridiculous.
