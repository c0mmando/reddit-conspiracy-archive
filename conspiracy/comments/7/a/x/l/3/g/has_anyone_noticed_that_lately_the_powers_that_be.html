       I think a better example would be the indictment of Manafort &amp; Gates.  They're being charged with lobbying for Ukraine as unregistered foreign agents and laundering money and did so with Tony Podesta (who was also unregistered) during the Obama administration &amp; possibly under Bush.  It was reported
       <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ukraine-lobbying-idUSBRE9BJ1B220131220">
        Tony Podesta was doing this back in 2013
       </a>
       , so everyone should be asking, IMO, why wasn't this investogated back then?  Why did it take 4 years and an investigation into a Russia Dossier paid for by the DNC &amp; HRC, created by a former UK spy, who used Officials of Russian as sources to get any investigation?

       I tend to agree, it's why the FBI &amp; DOJ officials who passed on investigating Russian money laundering and kick backs during the Uranium One deal should be questioned... Who was the head if the FBI again during that time???

       I think it's reactionary, all damage control. Rather than let the party take the huge hit it deserves, try to pin the blame on some fall guys they feel are no longer useful, and appeal to popularity to portray a façade of being on the people's side. Meanwhile, Tulsa Gabbard is out vocally pretending not to be a part of the party elite so they can prop her up for a presidential run in 2020 or 2024.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone who is coming out is blaming individuals and not party corruption and morals. Hell Donna Brazile even said she feared for her life "from the Russians" after Seth Rich was murdered. So, it seems like damage control mode is blame some individuals, pretend the entire power structure of the party wasn't involved, nobody did anything wrong except a few people who can no longer help the party gain power anyway due to damage to their reputations, and oh yah, don't forget the Russians. They probably killed Seth Rich even though there would not be any possible motive for that. They're all just pushing the party line while reacting to popular opinion.
