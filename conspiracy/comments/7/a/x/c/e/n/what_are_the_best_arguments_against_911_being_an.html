    <div class="md"><p>No comprehensive scenario has ever been presented that accounts for all the facets of that day.  Think where the passengers went, where the planes went, who planted explosives, covered them up at the site, who faked cell phone calls, faked footage, faked interviews, faked all the evidence of the hijackers, created the &#39;official&#39; narrative backed up with physical evidence, and created an apparatus to keep it secret and cover it up for 15 years. </p>

<p>Conservatively, how many people would it take to have the three largest controlled demolitions in history occur undetected in one day, with no evidence existing that corroborates the concept.  Not to mention the pentagon, or shanksville.</p>

<p>Add to the on site cover up, the media cover up, military cover up ATC cover up, the FBI cover up, NYPD cover up, FDNY cover up, Shanksville police/media cover up etc.  Still not one whistleblower to this day.</p>

<p>Or 25 guys over 2 years and about 350k hijacked 4 planes and crashed them.  With physical/forensic evidence existing and verifiable of their movements and actions.</p>

<p>The counter to that would be that all of these guys were only able to fly small Cessnas (some not even that) but then flew these huge commercial aircraft at really high speeds at low altitude doing advanced/complex turns on their first try.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Higher air density while going the same speed (500+ mph) leads to more turbulence/unpredictable behavior as well as higher stress on the airplane.</p>

<p>The complex maneuvers were basically making a huge loop to smash into a specific small area of the pentagon that was recently reinforced (much harder to do) vs just crashing from the top of the pentagon which would do much more damage as well as being much easier to pull off</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The towers weren&#39;t small/low altitude, and the consensus is that it is fairly straight forward.  Shanksville crashed, and the pentagon had the &#39;best&#39; pilot flying it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You brought the passport up, and now avoid the practical implications of it being fake.  This is a perfect illustration of why the CD/no planes/mini nuke/scaler weapons theory&#39;s hold no water.

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not arguing. I cited reasons why I don’t believe it was an inside job. You brought up the passport, so I ask what’s your hypothesis on it, it must be comprehensive, because it’s enough for you to ignore what my initial post was about.  You further ignored my question about other plane debris found all over NY, and if it was also planted.   </p>

<p>If you believe the passport surviving is impossible,and jet fuel soaked (a loose change reference), then it stands to reason that seat back literature, luggage plane parts and human remains are also impossible and therefore planted.</p>
