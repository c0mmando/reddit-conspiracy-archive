       I'm fairly certain there was thousands of people working on the atomic bomb and they didn't talk about it until it was basically being dropped. This is the Neil deGrasse Tyson argument of nobody can stay in the quiet that long which to me is bullshit. That's a very presumptuous statement

       No comprehensive scenario has ever been presented that accounts for all the facets of that day.  Think where the passengers went, where the planes went, who planted explosives, covered them up at the site, who faked cell phone calls, faked footage, faked interviews, faked all the evidence of the hijackers, created the 'official' narrative backed up with physical evidence, and created an apparatus to keep it secret and cover it up for 15 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conservatively, how many people would it take to have the three largest controlled demolitions in history occur undetected in one day, with no evidence existing that corroborates the concept.  Not to mention the pentagon, or shanksville.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add to the on site cover up, the media cover up, military cover up ATC cover up, the FBI cover up, NYPD cover up, FDNY cover up, Shanksville police/media cover up etc.  Still not one whistleblower to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or 25 guys over 2 years and about 350k hijacked 4 planes and crashed them.  With physical/forensic evidence existing and verifiable of their movements and actions.

       The counter to that would be that all of these guys were only able to fly small Cessnas (some not even that) but then flew these huge commercial aircraft at really high speeds at low altitude doing advanced/complex turns on their first try.

       What's the technical difficulty in flying at high speeds at low altitudes? What complex turns did they make?

       Higher air density while going the same speed (500+ mph) leads to more turbulence/unpredictable behavior as well as higher stress on the airplane.
      </p>
      <p>
       The complex maneuvers were basically making a huge loop to smash into a specific small area of the pentagon that was recently reinforced (much harder to do) vs just crashing from the top of the pentagon which would do much more damage as well as being much easier to pull off

       The towers weren't small/low altitude, and the consensus is that it is fairly straight forward.  Shanksville crashed, and the pentagon had the 'best' pilot flying it.

       That counter pales when compared to a handful of points i mentioned.

       you forget to mention the jet fuel soaked passport that survived a fireball and fluttered down unbesmirched to the waiting hand of an fbi agent. yea all that evidence and people want to think there was something weird going on that day...

       Were the in flight cards, passenger luggage and seat parts that were also found all over the area planted? If we assume it was planted, how many people were involved in distributing fake plane debris (creating it, warehousing it, delivering it), and subsequently keeping it a secret for 15 years?

       You brought the passport up, and now avoid the practical implications of it being fake.  This is a perfect illustration of why the CD/no planes/mini nuke/scaler weapons theory's hold no water.  There is not even a sliver of a comprehensive framework of how they would be executed and covered up.  When proponents are pressed the focus is immediately shifted to some other loose change bullet point.

       you got me. i specifically cited the passport so you wouldnt think about it. you outsmarted me. never cited loose change nor did i bring up any of those "no planes/mininukes" so good job arguing against a strawman.

       I’m not arguing. I cited reasons why I don’t believe it was an inside job. You brought up the passport, so I ask what’s your hypothesis on it, it must be comprehensive, because it’s enough for you to ignore what my initial post was about.  You further ignored my question about other plane debris found all over NY, and if it was also planted.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe the passport surviving is impossible,and jet fuel soaked (a loose change reference), then it stands to reason that seat back literature, luggage plane parts and human remains are also impossible and therefore planted.

       I've heard people claim that every skyscraper is wired with explosives, just in case they need to be taken down to keep them from tipping over. But they can't disclose that to the public.
