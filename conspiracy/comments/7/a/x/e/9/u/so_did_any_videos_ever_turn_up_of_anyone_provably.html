       I remember a few weeks ago, there was only a handful of videos showing people injured at the event that could have easily been faked with basic dollar-store Halloween makeup. The video of the guy checking the pulses, and the video of the guy with the arm that was bleeding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the videos of those hospital-ridden victims came out where there wasn't any swelling or signs of actual injuries under their band-aid bandages.
      </p>
      <p>
       This led to a lot of hoax claims - not just false flag but that paid actors had been prepared beforehand to fake injuries/death.
      </p>
      <p>
       So did any videos surface of lets say a gored leg/body showing real damage that couldn't be faked?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Lots of downvotes - no videos. Hmm..

       I read something on here about FBI confiscating the phones of those present and when they received their phones back all of their videos and pictures of the night were deleted. Can't verify it, suprised they didnt just backdoor delete any video evidence on phones.
      </p>
      <p>
       May be why there arent many videos.

       There was a video where you can literally hear a cop confiscating someone's phone and them bitching about it. I'll see if I can find it again and post a link.

       What he's saying wouldn't even make sense that way. Why would he be yelling at someone that they have their phone? As someone else is walking by filming, with their phone? And this other person has no reply?

       It's definitely people who know each other.

       😂😂😂 paranoid much? You commented to be on a thread in another post about VEGAS....then you commented in ANOTHER post that I wasn't even in and tagged me calling me a shill referencing MY LOST HISTORY. This post here is about VEGAS as well...so yeah...here I am in a post about the topic I speak on the most...and I saw you talking shit about ME...so I replied to you...but yeah dude...I'm following you😂 bullshit. I have never looked at your post history because you matter not to me. Take your meds. But YOU stated you read mine. Politely fuck off. Stop tagging me and stop talking shit about me. You are extremely pissed off because I posted things that don't fit your Vegas theory. Sorry that you don't like facts crybaby. Shill that.

       Moulage is meant to be realistic. It’s so realistic that in some cases it is impossible for even a surgeon to tell the difference between a moulage application and a real injury.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then, a photo doesn’t tell the whole story about a supposed injury. Do you believe what you see in the movies? Why not? What’s the difference?

       How long was he in this shredded state?

      <p>
       Is that period of time compatible with survival?

      <p>
       Was he treated promptly?

      <p>
       What else happened immediately after the explosions but before this photo was taken?

       You should look into this chap and his “injuries” more closely. Boston Unbombing or Peekay Boston’s analysis put it together for you.

       There are a couple new videos on YouTube posted. One shows one girl take a shot to the leg and buckle. There’s another with dan blazarins crew runnin around.  Shows some girl really tagged up with wounds and people trying to help her. Just search vegas shooting I. YouTube and filters to recently posted. Should be some in there.  I believe people got killed forsure. But as for the one shooter theory......

       Do you think that video would stand up in court as evidence that a shooting took place?
      </p>

       Does it show a bullet striking her leg? How do you know that? If you saw that video without being told what was allegedly going on, would that be your first conclusion?

       Do we see the damage caused by this supposed bullet? Has this person been identified, and her wound verified?

       If you watch it on big screen n zoom in by frame you see entry. The guns used by the shooters won’t blow off someone’s arm. I just think for who ever organized the whole shooting that it’d be easier to kill all these people rather than fake it in this situation. Sandy hook I believe was faked. But like 9/11 you think no one died during that? Just my opinion not trying to fight. Working together is what helps us reach a organized truth

       I’ve also tried zooming in and going frame by frame. There’s a very indistinct and blurry shape in one frame that could be a projectile, but no telling if it’s a bullet or something else altogether. In low light at low shutter speeds, and on a phone camera it could be literally anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were told over 500 people were shot in total.  Where is the proof? If it wasn’t 500, how many was it? Again, where is the proof?
      </p>
      <p>
       The high velocity gunshot wounds we were told occurred cause grave damage to any body part. Why isn’t there any evidence of this kind of damage on anyone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are we now supposed to believe people were shot, but only with tiny calibre low velocity rounds? Is there any evidence for that?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only photos of victim wounds I’ve seen to date look to have been caused by BB gun pellets or similar. Would that type of weapon still count as a mass shooting event, if indeed that’s what it was?

       That spot you mention is probably the same thing we are looking at.  Was just an entry to me along with the buckle. As for the 500 shots that could be their story being falsified as well to make it more dramatic “ worst American mass shooting etc” it would makes sense for that area because then now guns and metal detectors etcs just money Like say they killed a handful of people and exaggerated the body count. I did not hear 500 shots even being fired off in videos at all. Probably more around 100 I would say. Also, did they say 500 gunshot wounds? Or just wounds related to the incident? I do get what you are saying though too. I mentioned before about the damage. I’ve shot deer with rifles and the damage wasn’t that crazy though. Just an entry with bleeding. Never shot a deer in the head or anything though as I’m sure a head would react different from a deers chest area.

       I could waste my time finding a video in addition to the countless images but that is a disservice to those who died that evening, so instead I copied the definition of gaslighting for victims family's who may stumble across this to understand why murderers would want to spread lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity.

       I would settle for any video at all at this point. Just because they are covering it up and destroying evidence doesn't mean that you have the right to gaslight people by making the claim that it never happened.. and why, because you don't get close up video of victims. GTFO

       You see the knee get impacted by the shot entry. The rounds the shooters used wouldn’t explode an arm or something. I used rifles for hunting and they are always clean wounds.

       Literally no sign of a bullet hitting her. She just flinched slightly then holds her knee. Also just happens to be completely center of the video as if the person recording knew that she was about to be 'hit'.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, nothing to prove anything, as I expected.

       Also she, and the person she was standing with were standing straight up while everyone around them had already hit the deck.

       Seems a little strange to just stand tall in the middle of a crowd of people lying flat while gunshots ring out.

       No videos, but there are people who died and one of them was one of my family members friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a shame that there are shills still willing to try and coverup how the FBI &amp; CIA are involved in these inside jobs. No question about the agencies involved, but a lot of questions for these agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       See how the theory is "Saudi Arabia" what a story huh? 9/11 over again and witnesses are still dying and shills are like "where's the victims? show us the videos of dead people." -- Jerks.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not fake. Its blanketed inside.
      </p>
      <p>
       And here we have a lawyer die in his bed because of a seizure. The lawyer is being suspected as murdered in the same way that Kym Suchomel is being suspected as murdered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Electronic weapons do exist and can cause flu-like symptoms, falling over, seizures, all the way to lethal shock.
      </p>
      <p>
       These weapons can be used through a wall and have different reactions. Shills are working for murderers who traffick children.

       I will not comment again because there is no defense any shill can say to defend murdering warlords who print money and profit from the death of others.

       That spot you mention is probably the same thing we are looking at.  Was just an entry to me along with the buckle. As for the 500 shots that could be their story being falsified as well. I did not hear 500 shots being fired off in videos at all. Probably more around 100 I would say. I do get what you are saying though too. I mentioned before about the damage. I’ve shot deer with rifles and the damage wasn’t that crazy. Just an entry with bleeding. Never shot a deer in the head or anything though as I’m sure a head would react different from a deers chest area

       And what? I’m just tryna spread what I’ve watched man. She takes a hit to the knee. Crazy to think ppl didn’t die especially the ones who were there and trying to expose multi shooter scenario. I believe that people died and were injured. I don’t believe there was only one shooter.
