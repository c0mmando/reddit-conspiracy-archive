<p>They do emp drills multiple times a year. A small amount of research would tell you that. Antifa civil war? Right...a relatively small group compared to the masses is going to alert the world 3 whole months of what they plan to do..better not stop them! Dude, no. Bad shit like that doesn&#39;t give notice. They call for Trump&#39;s removal...just like many other protest all over the place on any given day. Trump leaving the country? Yeah, he does that often..what&#39;s the big deal?</p>

<p>If this sub is simply to overreact to every little thing not based in fact...what good does it do? If it is to write pure fiction based on an event...what purpose does it serve? Grow the fuck up</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No no, it&#39;s way more important to go on every single detail on the JFK files that didn&#39;t say much and the Las Vegas shooting that had gaping holes in the official narrative. </p>

<p>Most people who claim to be &#39;open minded&#39; are simply transferred their &#39;title reading&#39; to the &quot;alternative&quot; media like InfoWars (which is just another scam). </p>

<p>Also the larger subreddits (probably this one even) are filled with paid shills and shilling mods. Also if you look through my latest posts, it&#39;s the clickbait titles that get a few upvotes. Post a slightly controversial title (which confronts people their beliefs) and you&#39;ll get downvoted within the first minute.</p>
