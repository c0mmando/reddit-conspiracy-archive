<p>Videos are free, yet generate ad revenue and partnership opportunities. I have a bit of a bias against most youtube content creators, so thats probably where the cynical mindset comes from. I am not trying to dissuade you from pursuing your goal. I think you just need to clarify what your goals are for yourself. You cannot just magically create a support network without giving the people something to support.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I apologize if I have offended you. I am not trying to depreciate the work that you have put in. Your dedication is a good way to build that rapport and support that you desire. However, You do need to put your work out there for anyone to support you. I understand you don&#39;t want someone else to pass off the research that you have dedicated a large amount of time to compile. The only way for someone to associate your work with you is to put it out there. The posting date/time stamps of your videos and other work should be enough to prove that you were the one responsible and deserving of the credit and support.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It really isn&#39;t quite that simple though. In my case it isn&#39;t the punchline that is important. The only reason it&#39;s important is because of the info I will provide to support it. But that info isn&#39;t just one piece of evidence that proves it or something. It&#39;s much more complex than that.</p>

<p>So this is why just coming out with the punchline may be counter productive... but I don&#39;t know what is the best way to do it. This part is like marketing. And marketing is a very strange thing. Like have you heard of the claim that if you offer something for a low price or free people don&#39;t want it? Many times they want something that is high priced because they equate price with quality. This is the kind of weirdness I have to figure out. And it doesn&#39;t come naturally to me.</p>

<p>There is a reason for this though. Look at it this way.. would you want others taking info you worked years and years on full time to discover? Especially when there was more work you wanted to accomplish?</p>

<p>I feel that would damage what I could do in the future. Others didn&#39;t come to these conclusions. If I have people supporting me I feel I can break things open even more. Also, I could be killed or silenced before doing this as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here’s the reality, if you go about this in a roundabout way and string people along, none of that matters because nobody will care.</p>

<p>Guess what? There are thousands of places on YouTube people can get this type of information from, and there are thousands of people out there desperate for attention and trying to get clicks and exposure, and 99% of them are total garbage and white noise. You need to do it right and set yourself apart.</p>

<p>If I stumble across something I want to learn about and I have 10 videos and time to only watch 2-3 of them, it’s certainly NOT going to be the one I fire up and it’s some guy jerking off the audience for the sake of building suspense or teasing shit out.</p>

<p>Lastly, someone gave me great advice as a writer a LONG time ago (and I experience it today with my own YouTube channel): if you aren’t willing to do it for 6 months without seeing any success or building an audience, don’t do it.</p>

<p>Make great content. Set yourself apart. Be respectful of your viewers. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t about aliens.. but let&#39;s say it was.</p>

<p>So with what you are saying then I would say &quot;Breaking news - Aliens are real&quot;</p>

<p>But for me to prove that to you requires lots of evidence. Not just one piece of evidence.</p>

<p>So regardless of whether i give the evidence or the punchline first it&#39;s still going to take a long time.</p>

<p>Does opening with &quot;aliens are real&quot; actually prevent me from getting people to look at all my evidence though?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perception is reality. You need to think less how it’s important to YOU to present the information and more about how your audience consumes the information. Even if you had 100% incontrovertible proof that aliens exist and visit earth, if you put that in a title, I’m probably not clicking the link.</p>

<p>My recommendation is this, start it off by stating your thesis, and explain what the audience can expect. In the alien example:</p>

<p>“Im here to prove that aliens are real, and each week I will upload a video of my findings based on a decade of research...”</p>

<p>Maybe you even preview what future videos will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Example 1: “Did you know that in 1964 blah blah blah</li>
<li>Example 2: “Did you know that ancient civilizations documented alien visits..”</li>
<li>Example 3: whatever whatever whatever...</li>
</ul>

<p>Let us know what you’re going to let us know. Tease the subjects if you want to build suspense, but don’t tease some big reveal....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what should I do if no one can relate to what I am doing? Should I just jump into something without considering as many possibilities as possible? When you spend years working on something and it is as important as this then you tend to be as cautious as possible. </p>

<p>According to your logic I might as well just not even bother because people just assume everyone is a larper. I could be a larper whether I reveal the punchline right away or not...</p>

<p>Honestly the way people knee jerk react like you have here is why this info hasn&#39;t gotten out already. You have made so many knee jerk reactions and people have upvoted your comments. It&#39;s very telling about society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.. you started the personal attacks because I was proposing doing something you didn&#39;t agree with.. regardless of my position. And because I can&#39;t explain my entire position to you I have no business asking vague questions. </p>

<p>You have made so many baseless assumptions it borders on pure insanity.. and it continues..</p>

<p>Your behavior seems more like a cry for help than anything else.</p>

<p>Others will take your info and present it themselves regardless of what you feel or worry about.   If you&#39;ve got something good, people will copy it.</p>

<p>You&#39;re making this about YOU, instead of the importance of the information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Total opposite. The information only conveys so much. It&#39;s what can be done with the information... this is why it is so important how it is handled. I am the one who pieced this info together.. believe it or not but that is more important than the info. Everyone has access to this info but they didn&#39;t do it. Much more can be done with this info if people really understand it.</p>

<p>I will have to make that known when I convey it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what should I do if no one can relate to what I am doing? Should I just jump into something without considering as many possibilities as possible? When you spend years working on something and it is as important as this then you tend to be as cautious as possible. </p>

<p>But what does it matter anyway? You have already determined that I am in the wrong and can&#39;t be in the right because I haven&#39;t taken the advice of people who don&#39;t know what i am doing with no questions asked...</p>

<p>According to your logic I might as well just not even bother because people just assume everyone is a larper. I could be a larper whether I reveal the punchline right away or not...</p>

<p>Honestly the way people knee jerk react like you have here is why this info hasn&#39;t gotten out already. You have made so many knee jerk reactions and people have upvoted your comments. It&#39;s very telling about society.</p>

<p>I could get killed just posting a thread like this by the people who keep these secrets... Yet you are worried about wasting minutes when I have spent years on this. Yet you act condescendingly to me as if I have damaged you somehow... it&#39;s pretty sad and comical really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, Stop dodging my question. If I can’t give you feedback because I don’t understand what you are doing, that means nobody can give you feedback, because they don’t understand what you’re doing, because you haven’t told anybody what you’re doing. </p>

<p>Therefore, making a post asking for feedback, where you agree with the people who agree with you, and you fight with the people you don’t, without recognizing that If the people who disagree with you are wrong because they don’t understand what you are doing then the people who agree with you can’t possibly be right because they don’t know what you were doing either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve kept the argument about how I felt best for you to release this information, which is what you asked for.  You’re the one that started with the personal attacks, which usually happens as a result of someone not being able to defend their position on its merits. I’m done posting, have a nice day.</p>
