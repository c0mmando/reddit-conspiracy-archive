    <div class="md"><p>I can understand that. I think he is trying to drain the swamp. The Awanie Brothers, the new info about the dossier, all the connections with Hillary, Comey, MÃ¼ller, and him actively using WikiLeaks for information.   </p>

<p>That being said, I don&#39;t think that its outside the realm of possibility that this is all a ruse. But let me share an idea with you. A true conspiracy theory I heard from a co worker back in the middle of last year. It has stuck with me.   </p>

<p>That the illuminati and Free masons were very real but separate organizations that worked together. The Illuminati handled the money and government and the Free Masons handled the jobs and infrastructure(buildings, roads, hard goods, etc). They worked in tandem for over 150 years. But the Illuminati wanted all the power and under Bush and Obama tried to push the Masons out. The Masons pushed back with Trump. Now there is a cold civil war going on between them.   </p>

<p>He had a lot to be said about the subject but that was the TLDR version of it. Not sure if I buy it but its interesting none the less. </p>
