        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><h1>Key difference to ALL previous satanic cults</h1>

<p><strong>What TRULY separates the illuminati religion from ALL previous satanic cults</strong><br/>
The separator is as simple as the seventh commandment of the illuminati religion, which &quot;coincidentally&quot; is also the ultimate perfect fulfillment for the third commandment, &quot;have human cattle repeat that Black is White&quot;.<br/>
In fact it also separates the illuminati religion from any other cult or religion in History.<br/>
Although the 7th commandment was revealed worldwide first 1998 by LAST PROPHET, nobody has ever explicitly stated it as THE separator:<br/>
<strong>Make the human cattle believe that there is NO [ &amp;#95; &amp;#95; &amp;#95; &amp;#95; &amp;#95; &amp;#95; &amp;#95; ].</strong></p>

<p><strong>One of the paths to solve the riddle:</strong><br/>
&quot;There is NO [ &amp;#95; &amp;#95; &amp;#95; &amp;#95; &amp;#95; &amp;#95; &amp;#95; ]&quot; is &quot;coincidentally&quot; the real first commandment of Evolution Theory, the only religion created by the illuminati for EVERYONE.<br/>

<p><strong>BASICS</strong><br/>
Protestantism, Mormons, Evolution, Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses, Scientology are religions created by the illuminati<br/>

<p>Illuminati puppets &quot;ruling&quot; countries with muslim majorities: Sharia is a must.<br/>
Sharia law is the main cover to package the terror state.<br/>
If not yet proclaimed then their orders are to do it as soon as possible.  </p>

<p>Agendas advanced by illuminati puppets proclaiming the sharia law:<br/>
- legalize the terror state, to suppress protest.<br/>
- divert from the role of the installed puppets, transferring national assets to illuminati safes.<br/>
- pedophilia, going as far as with legalizing &quot;marriage&quot; of 9 years old girls.<br/>
- genocide of Christians in countries with Christian minorities.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>For anyone who comes to this post out of curiosity, know that OP is full of it.     </p>

<p>OPs posts lack any coherence whatsoever, and when I asked specific questions like     </p>

<p>&quot;who is &quot;last Prophet&quot;&quot; and &quot;can you give me one clear example of a prophecy being fulfilled&quot;     OP gives me an internet username and garbled links from archived chat forums and self made websites.         </p>

<p>This false prophets prediction that was made on 3-24-2005 was that Terri Schiavo would be murdered by the Illuminati on 3-25-2005...of course she actually died on 3-31-2005 and was not murdered, but was taken off life support. For anyone who remembers this time, it was a pretty big story. I pointing this out to OP and explained who making an educated guess about a highly covered news story is not prophecy...especially when said guess misses its mark by 6 days....       </p>

<p>I realise most readers here already understand that OP is full of shit, but for those who don&#39;t...don&#39;t waste any time on this false prophets bs.</p>

<p>As explained, the main reason was the fact that, after the Prophet revealed that Terri Schindler’s satanic ritual murder would take place Good Friday 2005, the illuminati extended her torture, taken to the utter limits (denial of water), for several days - to prove End Times Prophet “wrong”. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK...lemme break this down for you and anyone who is actually reading....     </p>

<p>Your false prophet claimed to know when Teri would die. He claims that his prophecy was divine, which means that God told/inspired him.       </p>

<p>Your explanation that the Illuminati postponed her death to prove your false prophet, and subsequently God wrong is in itself proof that your false prophet is not a prophet of God, because it implies that the Illuminati had power over God. They don&#39;t. No one has power over God.       </p>

<p>With that being said, I am now blocking you. Congrats on being the first user ever hat I have blocked on Reddit.     </p>

<p>as for everyone else, steer clear of OP&#39;s bullshit. o/   </p>

<p>None of Last Prophet&#39;s prophecies was so far proven false.<br/>
Fulfillment of Last Prophet&#39;s prophecies is a process that in some cases unfold from years to almost two decades, ever since Last Prophet appeared in worldwide Internet forums 1998.</p>
