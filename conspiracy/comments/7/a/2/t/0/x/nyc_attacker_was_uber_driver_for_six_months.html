        <h3 class="title">NYC Attacker Was Uber Driver for Six Months - Uzbeki Islamist Immigrant Was Arrested in Multiple States - Had Active Arrest Warrant for Missouri - Passed Uber's 'Rigorous' Background Check</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">870</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-11-01 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/FinnagainsAwake.html">FinnagainsAwake</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Islamist attack on civilians in New York City on October 31, 2017 was carried out by a Muslim immigrant in the name of the Islamic State.  </p>

<p>The suspect was identified by two law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation as Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov. He&#39;s from Uzbekistan in Central Asia but had been living in the US since 2010, sources said.  Saipov is a legal immigrant.  </p>

<p>A senior law enforcement officer told CNN a note, written in English, was found in the truck that said the attack, which unfolded around 3 p.m. on Halloween, was done in the name of the Islamic State.</p>

<p>Law enforcement sources said Saipov most recently lived in New Jersey, in Paterson.  He also lived in Florida for a period, sources said.  </p>

<p>For the past six months, he was an Uber driver. The company said he passed a background check that the company claims is &#39;rigorous.&#39;  Uber has removed Saipov from the app.</p>

<p>Despite being able to pass Uber&#39;s background investigation a casual look through internet records reveals numerous problems with the law for Saipov.  He had multiple interactions with law enforcement in several states, online records show.  Uber does not seem to be looking very hard at drivers records.  </p>

<p>He had traffic citations issued in Missouri and Pennsylvania. He was arrested by the Missouri State Highway Patrol in October 2016 after a warrant was issued when he failed to show in court for a misdemeanor offense. He paid a $200 bond, which he forfeited when he didn&#39;t show up in court for his next hearing in November. A guilty plea was entered on his behalf.</p>

<p>There is an active Missouri state warrant out for the arrest of Saipov, but he passed the Uber background check.  </p>

<p>Uzbekistan ties</p>

<p>Saipov was a Muslim and a supporter of the hardline Islamic State.  Saipov came to the US under the Obama administrations lax rules that considered Muslims a top priority to help come to America.  </p>

<p>Authorities are sure to look at whether the suspect returned to Uzbekistan since he moved to the United States seven years ago, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said.  &quot;There has been a significant problem with jihadism in Uzbekistan,&quot; he said.  According to Cruickshank there are two large jihadi groups in the country. One of them is the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, which is affiliated with the Islamic State.</p>

<p>In April, an Uzbeki Muslim immigrant to Sweden, who claimed allegiance to the Islamic State,  was arrested after an Islamic truck attack killed five people in Stockholm.  </p>

<p>New York City’s annual Halloween parade Tuesday night was the scene of additional militarization, with the attack serving as a pretext for a massive police deployment. NYPD Chief of Department Carlos Gomez told a news conference: “We will proceed with the parade and certainly we’ve added more resources, more police officers, heavy weapons teams, blocker vehicles on the street leading to the route as well as more sand truck[s]. There’s also heavy weapons teams being deployed throughout the city at key, iconic locations.”</p>

<p>Eric Philips, de Blasio’s press secretary, tweeted, “The Halloween Parade will go on, with NYPD dramatically increasing presence (personnel, blocker trucks, long guns etc).”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s important to note that Uzbekistan is under Russia’s sphere of influence. It would not surprise me if they had a hand in this. Same with the Boston bombers. I don’t think it would be difficult for them to brainwash some gullible piece of shit into doing this type of attack and blaming it on islamic extremism. Just a thought.</p>

<p>What happened to make so called conspiracy theorists trust Russia so implicitly that someone can&#39;t even speculate that Russia may have some ulterior motives? </p>

<p>It&#39;s honestly insane and people like you, who will deflect from Russia every single time they&#39;re brought up, are part of this. Shill, bot, or just a regular poster who has been convinced of this, it&#39;s gross.</p>

<p>He came here under Obama&#39;s lax rule?  No he came under the lottery system - which was signed into bill 30 years ago by the first Bush.  He came to America when Obama was president.  </p>

<p>Unless you can show these people were trained over there, and came here to carry out an attack mentioning the attack in Sweden.</p>

<p>This is likely a lone wolf attack, by a guy who watches too much news etc and had no one sponsoring him.  Like most mass shootings and killings in this country, you can&#39;t stop crazy.  This guy prob did it under guise of supporting islamic state, but prob has never lived under them or had direct contact with them.</p>

significantly from those considered up to that point. The Schumer proposal would have set aside
75,000 visas each year for a new category of “diversity immigrants.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, that&#39;s and odd twist. The section was heavily lobbied for by the Irish, but Schumer wasn&#39;t playing along, so they had to go elsewhere (Rep Morrison) to lobby his version/part of the bill</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The full Committee passed H.R. 4300 in August 1990.120 Rep. Morrison’s Diversity
Transition Program remained intact. Rep. Schumer’s Diversity Immigrants program was
retained, as well, but with an important change: a state would only be categorized as high
admission if it had sent at least 50,000 (instead of the original 25,000) immigrants to the United
States within the most recent five-year period. This meant that the nationals of more countries
would be eligible for diversity visas. Northern Ireland, however, would still be treated as a
separate state under the program.</p>

I don&#39;t find an active warrant.  Having looked at the docket entry, it appears a plea of guilty was entered on behalf of the defendant in November 2016, and his cash bond was forfeited after he failed to appear for disposition of the traffic case.</p>

<p>This is not uncommon in areas of Missouri who see a lot of citations for over the road truck drivers.  </p>

<p>If this is the same NYC guy, Saipov received a citation in Platte County, Missouri for cracked brakes in December 2015.    The address listed for Saipov is a Tampa address  and he was operating an 80k pound 2016 Freightliner Diesel truck at the time.  (This is all public information)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to note that this is the first kind of these attacks that this sub wasn&#39;t all over calling a false flag and shit. Like ever. Not to mention that when a white guy did it- it was crickets. Now when a muslim does it the news is treating it like 9-11. I think 2 Americans died? Almost 60 died and fucking 500 shot a few weeks ago and the news has already forgot. Another thing, as far as I know ISIS did not claim responsibility for this, but they did for Vegas. The news claims the opposite is true in effect.
I&#39;m just noting everyone&#39;s hypocrisy because it exposes bias.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is happening here? You Republicans love trading the rights of the citizens for your bullshit security to protect you racist bastards from people of the opposite color. You motherfuckers are actually asking for more rigorous, unconstitutional background checks and security. This dude allegedly had a bullshit misdemeanor charge and all of a sudden it&#39;s the end of the world? Fuck outta here. </p>

<p>This sub needs to be purged. Around ten years here and this is what it has become. So sad. Actually, the real critical thinking people, like myself, should look elsewhere for another platform without being lumped together with you racist, Muslim hating, statists, assholes. And no, don&#39;t come at me with that left vs right delusion, my cock hangs slightly to the right, so I must be a libertarian then.</p>
