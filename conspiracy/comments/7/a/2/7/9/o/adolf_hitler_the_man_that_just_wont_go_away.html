        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just wanted to post this to try and get a conversation going regarding this man. The reason for this is that I see his name on this sub (and a few other places) with alarming regularity and it makes me think about WW2 and the story we have had set out for us. </p>

<p>Now, I am only just starting down this particular rabbit hole so my understanding is currently &#39;in development&#39; but I wondered if anyone else out there would care to share valuable sources of information. I have watched &#39;the greatest story never told&#39; and I&#39;m currently reading &#39;wall street and the rise of Adolf Hitler&#39; but I have also caught snippets of info along the way and am hoping some if the more &#39;knowledgeable&#39; members of this community could offer either stories or info or links for the rest if us.</p>

<p>The areas I&#39;m currently interested in are the reasoning for the war - to fight communism, to protect Europe from the zionist threat, to oust the plague of a central bank.</p>

<p>I think there is lot more to Hitler than we are being told and I&#39;d like to find out what and why.</p>

<p>Edit: I made it onto top minds of reddit - Wooooooo-hooooooo!! </p>

<p>And no, the best way isn&#39;t to provide people with facts, then you&#39;re just trading one mouthpiece for another. The best thing to do is put your viewpoint across and encourage people that are interested to look into it further. Kind of like the guy you&#39;re arguing with did, he provided a source so you can judge for yourself, and if interested, look further into it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t opinions. You are not trying to sway someone to your point of view. This is a conspiracy forum where one comes to say that others are either unaware of or have a mistaken understanding of a thing. You can&#39;t use the argument that it isn&#39;t the responsibility of the person stating the perceived conspiracy theory to provide documented evidence and that it&#39;s up to others to look into it and find out because you can&#39;t look up facts that don&#39;t exist. How would anyone be able to disprove any bullshit theory if an acceptable retort was to tell them to look into it themselves? It doesn&#39;t pass muster. You must provide evidence to support your claims. Facts are in no way just a mouthpiece. Facts are essential to any legitimate argument. </p>

I don&#39;t come here everyday to try make people believe what I believe. I understand your point but you must also understand just how long it takes to write up detailed posts that include sources. It&#39;s a lot of work and most of us have lives to live. Spending hours writing up an argument that is up to the standards of people like you, only for it to be largely ignored and ridiculed gets old very quickly.</p>

<p>Furthermore, what do you consider acceptable facts? Peer reviewed science papers? <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/">Which are shown more and more to be cherry-picked, corporate-funded bullshit.</a> Reports from mainstream media sources? Which are all <a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/48e.jpg">owned by the same companies</a>, and are in all likelihood CIA influenced? What can even said to be reliable &#39;proof&#39; anymore? I&#39;m not attacking you here man, just proposing alternative perspectives. </p>

1. Lots of the things Hitler said ( while true ) where just words ( like our politicians now a day,s )<br/>
2. He murdered a whole lot of people like disabled Jews polish and so on.<br/>
3. Both side,s did horrible things.       </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a weird comment mode:</p>

<p>Does anyone else ever think about what might have happened if there had been no Hitler? Or, if he had been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assassination_attempts_on_Adolf_Hitler">assassinated</a>?</p>

<p>Now here&#39;s where things get crazy. I know everyone will run and gun with counterfactual history on this - that the Soviets would have taken over Europe in the 1940&#39;s, or that the U.S. would have never become a military-industrial juggernaut, etc.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not it, however interesting those speculations are. I mean that morally, spiritually, empathetically, we live in a world created by Hitler&#39;s rise and fall. If you believe in the multiverse, we are in that specific universe where Hitler made it all the way to his Gotterdammerung moment - the last bullet in the bunker in Berlin, with proud Germany a wasted wreck.</p>

<p>I often wonder if we are so totally messed up as a society because of this man and the world he de-created.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All you really need to know is 9/11 is considered Adolf’s sacred number &amp; call sign. This was WELL understood when Reagan signed ‘911’ into national law, declaring September 11th a day of honor &amp; tragedy. During the Nazi occupation of Europe, Adolf held huge marches across Europe, on “Die Neunte Elfte” (the 9th of 11th).</p>

<p>This was a holiday Adolf created, in celebration of himself &amp; as a condemnation of Jews and ‘traitors’ of all sorts. During a celebration of 9/11 you had the Kristallnacht, when Jewish businesses were burned &amp; homes destroyed.</p>

<p>Mein Kampf is a spiritual book mixed with political theory. Effectively it is a retelling of the Bible, but instead of Jews being both the victims &amp; the choosen heroes, Aryans take on that role &amp; Jews become the Egyptians and oppressors. It really is little different than biblical teaching brought forth in modern day, with reversed roles.</p>

<p>On 9/11 in America you had the two largest banking centers bombed in NYC. NYC is said to be 25% Jewish, and I’d guess the banking towers close to 50%. Ever since then, 9/11 has been remembered as a day of honor &amp; tragedy, same as how Adolf celebrated in Germany.</p>

<p>In German, 9/11 means Nov 11th, which was banned from celebration post the end of WWII. Even when the Berlin Wall came down on 9/11, the celebration was moved to another day. The Soviets, for the record, believed Adolf to not have died and DNA tests have confirmed that the broken bits of skull attached to the body resembling Adolf’s belonged to a 40 year old girl.</p>

<p>However, shortly after the assassination of Kennedy, LBJ sought to establish a national emergency hotline, which Reagan put into practice with ‘911’, Adolf’s call sign. He declared Sept 11th a day holiday.</p>

<p>And now today, you have the world remembering the honor &amp; tragedy of ‘9/11’. Which for Adolf represented the Jewish treason against the Aryan race, and finally payback. And in America, a several hundred top NYC bankers burned, and forever shall we celebrate 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Title: World Defeated the Wrong Enemy
Description: The Greatest Story Never Told:- winner&#39;s write history, Adolf Hitler was actually a vegetarian, animal-lover, an author, an artist, a political activist, economic reformer and nominated for a Nobel Peace prize. He enacted the world&#39;s first anti-animal cruelty, anti-pollution, and anti-smoking laws. Unlike the demonic portrait that the &quot;allies&quot; painted of him, Hitler was beloved by his people, he wanted nothing but peace, and never ordered the extermination of a single Jew. The largely Jewish-controlled mainstream media has ever since painted an evil picture of Hitler and the Jew World Order has even enacted laws in 16 European countries prohibiting free-speech on the issues of Judaism, Hitler and the Holocaust.</p>

<p>Turns out Hitler was a real sweetheart. Have you ever heard of a genocidal vegetarian? DIDN&#39;T THINK SO!</p>

<p>Watch that one at the official site. That youtube link may be fine but there is a version out there where the narrators lines were altered some. It&#39;s very hard to tell the difference between the two till about 10-15 minutes in or so which is why I always recommend the original site.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>the jewish boycott on Germany </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, so I had a <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod write that to me. so I did a tiny bit of research and it turned out that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From 1931–32 SA &quot;brownshirt&quot; thugs physically prevented customers from entering Jewish shops, windows were systematically smashed and Jewish shop owners threatened. At Christmas 1932, the central office of the Nazi party organized a nationwide boycott. In addition, German businesses, particularly large organizations like banks, insurance companies, and industrial firms such as Siemens, increasingly refused to employ Jews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Nazi party leader became leader of Germany in 1933, at which point the Jews in America decided to boycott Germany. Germany was boycotting Jews before that.</p>

<p>I personally believe it takes an impressive amount of not knowing what you&#39;re talking about and actively avoiding learning about history to think that the Nazis were somehow retaliating against the Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your commentary on Six Million is somewhat questionable. For one, there&#39;s no prophesy that &quot;six million must vanish&quot;, that&#39;s just a misquote from the other two quotes you mentioned about the word Tashuvu. Speaking of which, it&#39;s not misspelled, it&#39;s merely spelled differently. In Hebrew vowels are finicky, and some letters can occasionally act as optional vowel stand-ins to change the tense of a word. Sometimes it&#39;s spelled תשבו, sometimes תשובו, first is pronounced &quot;teishvu&quot;, second &quot;tashuvu&quot;. First means &quot;shall return&quot; second means &quot;will return&quot;. </p>

<p>I&#39;m getting off track. Anyway, the Rabbi that wrote that whole thing about the missing &quot;vav&quot; wrote it in the 60&#39;s. He was attempting to retroactively show how the Holocaust was foretold via a contrived interpretation that involves multiplying a gematria by a million. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are 100% the reason I really believe this whole conspiracy is just a way to find gullible and easy to manipulate people. You had to have known that I would have googled child saints, sacrifice, blood libel and Jews only to get information disproving the false beliefs that Jews were sacrificing gentile children. Anointing them with sainthood in no way means they died in the falsely believed way that people claimed. Unless, you are suggesting that the catholic church is infallible and the canonization of these children serves as proof of this &quot;Jewish blood libel&quot;. There has to be a name for this type of work in psychology. You provide someone with easily debunkable claims to see if they willingly accept the claims without bothering to research as a way to know those who will easily be influenced and follow orders. It is so stupid that it is almost brilliant. For your sake, I hope you are a manipulator who knows what they are doing and not just some rube who is being easily manipulated. </p>
