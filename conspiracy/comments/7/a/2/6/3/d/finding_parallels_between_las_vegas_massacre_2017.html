        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Looking at the reports and statements coming from the Las Vegas shooting (2017), I am reminded of the Port Arthur Massacre (1996).</p>

<p>So many things stand out as similar, such as :</p>

<ul>
<li>Slow Police Response Time. </li>
</ul>

<p>It took around 70 minutes for police to breach the Las Vegas shooters room, despite LV being one of the most heavily policed placed in the US, if not the world.</p>

<p>And at Port Arthur, it took over 7 hours for Special Operation Group officers to arrive at the siege.
Also, just prior to the PAM, the only officers in the area at the time were called to the opposite end of the peninsula on an anonymous tip of a heroin bust, which turned out to be a jar of washing powder. Just when they were needed, they couldn&#39;t get there.</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple Weapons</li>
</ul>

<p>It is claimed the LV shooter had 23 firearms in his room, somehow snuck past hotel security.</p>

<p>It is claimed that the PA shooter had three weapon firearms, despite the claimed shooter, Martin Bryant having had his gun in the gun shop for repairs at the time. Later, after the siege, his guns were found outside the house, which is strange considering he was shooting from inside the house with them.
Also, one of the guns recovered by the police after the shooting, after being traced, turned out to have been handed in to a gun buyback scheme years earlier by someone, unrelated to the PA events, which then was sent overseas for destruction, but somehow found its way back to Australia to be found at Seascape Cottage, the site of the later siege.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lost/Confiscated/Cleaned Up Evidence</li>
</ul>

<p>Videos have emerged showing the FBI and whatnot apparently cleaning up the LV shooting site, with very little in the way of investigation. It is also claimed that the evidence, such as CCTV, is being covered up.</p>

<p>At PA, the cafe where the shooting happened  was bulldozed, before a proper forensic examination could take place, as it was considered too painful to the victims and their families, and also they claimed they had caught the suspect in the act, so no trial evidence would be needed. Also, other evidence from preliminary police investigation, such as the drink and meal tray the suspect had been claimed to use, as well as his bag, which was supposed to have been taken with the killer, but somehow shows up on a police video of the cafe, these pieces of evidence has vanished from police custody.</p>

<ul>
<li>Video Recording Equipment</li>
</ul>

<p>The LV shooter is said to have set up recording equipment inside and outside his hotel room. The footage of which is yet to surface.</p>

<p>The PA shooter is said to have had a video camera with him in the cafe, the kind held on the shoulder in the 90s. The whereabouts of this camera and the footage on it is unknown.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lack Of Evidence Linking Alleged Suspect To Crimes</li>
</ul>

<p>Police have yet to find a motive for the LV shooting, and have little to connect the alleged shooter with the shooting, apart from being found dead at the scene, under what have been called by some suspicious circumstances (ie, other than suicide, which is the official story)</p>

<p>There are many witnesses who place the alleged PA shooter at other places at the time of the shooting. For instance, when the shooting in the Broad Arrow Cafe was taking place, it is claimed that Martin Bryant was having coffee at a petrol station some 50km away.
Also, people involved in the shooting, who knew Martin Bryant, who were face to face with the killer, claim that the shooter that day was not Martin Bryant.
Also, in relation to the high ratio of kills to injuries during the cafe shooting, 2 kills for every 1 injury, so it is said, some special forces military personnel have noted the very high skills required, and that they themselves could probably not achieve that type of rating.
But then, later, at the Seascape siege, over 200 shots were fired from the cottage at police, none of them hitting anyone. What had happened to the shooting skills displayed before?</p>

<ul>
<li>Claims Of Multiple Shooters</li>
</ul>

<p>Many witnesses to the LV shooting have claimed that they saw or heard gunfire coming from multiple places, as well as videos surfacing from the night showing what appear to be muzzle blasts from other floors in the Mandalay Bay hotel, from other hotels, and even what appear to be shots coming from a helicopter.</p>

<p>At PA, multiple types of gunshot fragments were found in both the victims and in the walls of the cafe. Both semi-automatic rounds and casings, as well as shotgun pellets. While it is true that Martin Bryant owned a shotgun, he claimed prior to the massacre that he was scared to use it, that it was too powerful and unpredictable.
And though a shotgun was found in the back of his car, it was never claimed to be used in the cafe. So where did these shotgun pellets come from?
Also, during the later siege at the Seascape cottage, police were talking to who they claim the be Martin Bryant on the telephone, while gunshots can be heard coming from another room. If Bryant was the lone shooter, who was in the other room shooting?
Also, after the Seascape cottage burst into flames, from what some say was a police flare, it is claimed that Martin Bryant ran out, into the arms of waiting police, clothes on fire, screaming, &quot;don&#39;t shoot, I&#39;m the hostage!&quot;.</p>

<ul>
<li>conclusion</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally, I feel that these two events have a similar feel, and look orchestrated in the same way, for the same ends, disarmament of the population, more fear in society, and willingness for citizens to give up civil liberties for supposed security.</p>

<p>Both these events, I think, my have been conducted by someone else, other than who has been claimed, and the named suspect has been dropped in, as a patsy. 
In the case of Stephen Paddock, he was killed, so cannot speak on his own behalf, and in the case of Martin Bryant, he suffers intellectual disability, and is locked away for 36 life sentences, and no one is allowed to interview or meet with him.</p>

<p>It seems that both these people have somehow become involved in something, either willingly or unwillingly, and then been placed in a position to take the fall for these horrible crimes, whereas the actual perpetrators achieve their goals of taking weapons away from people, creating mass panic, and increasing the security we live under.</p>

<p>But like I said, it&#39;s just what stands out to me, just my opinion.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just for a bit of perspective, I grew up in Tasmania and know the area quite well. To get from Hobart to Port Arthur is about a 1.5 hour drive without traffic. I&#39;m not trying to disprove any of what you wrote, however I just wanted to point out that Tasmania is SLOW. Like, nothing ever happened there. I think the response time of the special operations group was a reflection of how unprepared they were and misunderstanding the severity of the event. This was a time before mobile phones were popular and such, so I&#39;m sure there was some communications issues which also caused delays in response. </p>

<p>Just as a fun fact : My teacher was actually friends with Martin Bryant&#39;s father and knew Martin quite well. He said the guy kept to himself and was quiet, never shown any signs of anger problems and was a nice kid. The whole situation dragged his parents through hell.</p>

<p>In my opinion: Massacre or not, I believe the move to remove weapons was the right one. I totally agree with the fact that there&#39;s no reason for civilians to have guns unless they are a farmer or in special circumstances.</p>
