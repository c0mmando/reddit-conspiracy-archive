       Most action and horror movies are about murdering people. What's your point? That movies shouldn't portray immoral behavior?

       I recall reading an article trying to break down horror and slasher films from the 80's specifically, pointing out that in general the people who engaged in what some would call morally reprehensible behavior, like premarital sex or drug use, would all die.  They tried claiming that the horror movies represented a puritanical view that those who sin will be punished horribly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think one of the directors of those kinds of movies commented on the same kind of thing and said it wasn't intentional at all, but I found it an interesting view.

       I love cinema, but I never clicked with Woody Allen's work.

      <p>
       I prefer Kubrick, John Carpenter, and Spielberg. What can I say, I'm just parading around my ignorance.

       I just prefer my movies to be gorgeously shot and meticulously edited and about a 1000 times less wordy than everything Allen puts out.

       There's no need to mock people who've seen Midnight in Paris either, it was quite popular in 2011/2012. Same with Blue Jasmine in 2013. I don't have to be a big fan of his to acknowledge some of his work, or try to generalize those who watch him. They are beautifully shot and I don't consider "too wordy" to be a criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just weird to see people who probably don't have a basis for his work act above it. He's made so many movies to the point where I don't even have that basis yet, and I'm certain almost everyone in these comment chains don't either. I know how some here love to vilify Hollywood and everyone in it, but there's a reason so many people love/respect him, and it undoubtedly complicates things.

       Apologies that you took offense at a joke I aimed towards my old college professor and the people who can't stop blowing smoke up Allen's ass any chance they get when there are more capable filmmakers out there.

       I'm not above it, it just doesn't fit my taste. Can I make fun of it again now, Mr. Cinema Police.

       I've seen his work, I actually enjoy cinema and movies greatly, I just don't give two shits for Woody Allen's movies. It isn't that I'm some uncultured swine attempting to destroy the very foundation of film here lol.

       Because he has a fuck ton of movies spanning back five decades. If you had a basis to critique him, I feel you'd talk about that instead of the type of people who watch his work. That in itself shows the disconnect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying you're an uncultured swine, but when he's admittedly not to your taste and you act authoritative about there being "more capable" filmmakers, it's nothing more than your biases, experience, and interest level talking. Step up the discussion if you want people like me to take you seriously.

       You basically just did homeboy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not acting authoritative about it, you are, which is obvious with your comment here. What is a fit basis to critique him on besides the fact that the majority of his fans that I know are in their 60's. I made a joke, you wanted to turn this into film school.
      </p>
      <p>
       Already stated that I preferred the slow beautiful methodical cinematography and Allen does not give me that, and then his stories are cliche and bore me to tears. Give me something interesting with the camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take Midnight in Paris for an example, a movie about a screenwriter connecting with the writers of old. That's just screenwriting jerk off material for intellectual spazzes who tend to think their work is a whole lot larger than what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Annie Hall is funny I guess, but still not the golden example of filmmaking. I guess if combining the aspects of a one man show with constant endless droning conversations is your cup of tea then sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't even know my experience with Allen films and attempt to use my comment to assume shit about me. Sorry I find Allen cliche and boring. You've assumed that I'm a Luddite with cinema based on your two comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       He isn't my taste, and this is the internet. So I'm going to rip on him for being boring whilst talking about how John Carpenter's The Thing is a triumph. So go fuck yourself for starters, and enjoy watching his new film with my grandfather.

       The only time I noticed you talking cinema within the last 6 months on here is saying that rewatching True Detective helped you see things you missed. You talk about Call of Duty, porn, and wresting, so I haven't see anything that give you some level of authority on films?

       Important  note, they didn't get on and she didn't spend anytime at all living in his house  or around him until after he and the mother split up, when they then ran into each other again. As creepy as it is, there's nothing illegal about that relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bigger issue is what reportedly happened with Dylan Farrow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mia Farrow, the mother, is also very suspect. It was determined she'd coached her children into thinking the ordeal was much worse than it was, and she openly went on stage and celebrated during Roman Polanski's Oscar win for The Pianist.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're both very odd and suspicious people.

       When you go watch Thor Ragnorok on Friday(and Star Wars in Dec), just know that you're probably putting money in more than a few sexual predators pockets. Sexual scum run Hollywood, no reason to think they're not attached to one of the most successful franchises right now.

        Add that to persistent allegations that Allen molested his and Farrow’s then-7-year-old adopted daughter, Dylan, in 1992, and the coupling of Allen and Previn takes on a disturbing connotation.

       Absolutely.  I have maybe watched 2 of his movies in my life.  Refused years ago to watch anymore.  My sister is constantly talking about his movies.  Knows his reputation, but says, 'I still like his movies'.

       He and his current Wife never got along, lived together, or spent time together whilst he was with her adopted mother (who he never married)
      </p>
      <p>
       There's accusations of him molesting Dylan Farrow in 1992. The result of the trial was that Mia Farrow coached the child in such a way to given very specific answers and may have traumatised her in doing so. There's been trials since, and he's gone to adopt like 8 more children, passing the background checks every time. Mia Farrow also got in stage and openly celebrated her friend Roman Polanski's Oscar win for The Pianist. It's all very odd and nothing certain can be concluded. There's is, however, reason to be suspicious.

       Did anyone else see the movie "Una"? Not a woody allen movie, but the most brazenly pedophilic mainstream-hollywood movie you'll ever see. How did they even get away with making it...

       His fan base is all NY and LA liberals who have never given a shit when people they like get caught raping kids, his movies make like $600,000, no one sees them anyway, he just sounds big time because coastal elitists sing his praises nonstop.

       He and his current Wife never got along, lived together, or spent time together whilst he was with her adopted mother (who he never married)
      </p>
      <p>
       There's accusations of him molesting Dylan Farrow in 1992. The result of the trial was that Mia Farrow coached the child in such a way to given very specific answers and may have traumatised her in doing so. There's been trials since, and he's gone to adopt like 8 more children, passing the background checks every time. Mia Farrow also got in stage and openly celebrated her friend Roman Polanski's Oscar win for The Pianist. It's all very odd and nothing certain can be concluded. There's is, however, reason to be suspicious.
