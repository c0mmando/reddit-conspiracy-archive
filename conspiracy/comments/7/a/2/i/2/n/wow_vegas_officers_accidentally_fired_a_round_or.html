       So remember that CBS interview of the "officers who stormed room 135" - which one of those was lying? The answer - ALL of them, they were the ones in the room and they all would have known if shots were fired or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why has no outside recordings picked up these shots? or were these 2 shots at the end of audio recorded MUCH earlier than the reported breach of the room.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is that not on the news? This is a massive fuckery and no one cares?

       the LVMPD state it was not the room where the body was found, from those 'leaked' photos with the body, we see the suite rooms pillars (due to panoramic suite windows) and the large bathroom.
      </p>
      <p>
       the other room is just a normal sized room with presumably no pillars. the room with the no reason smashed window. mayeb that room was the initial trial room but too small to stage. so they switched to the suite.

       If it was not fired in the same room as Paddocks body that means it must have been fired in 32-134 the 2nd room officers had to breach..
      </p>
      <p>
       And that just leads to a whole lot more questions, it's amazing how little we know of what went on in that room and how many times they can change their story or add to it at will

       Not necessarily.  Paddock's body was found in the living room of suite 32-135.  The shot could have been in the bedroom of the suite.

      <p>
       You can see that the bedroom and bathroom with the tub has doors that can close it off from the living area.  It's technically a separate room from the living/bar/powder room.

      <p>
       I don't think the adjoining room (32-134) counts as being "inside the suite," so I assumed bedroom as well. But I suppose this could just be semantics and investigators are referring to the entire hotel crime scene as "the suite."
      </p>
      <p>
       And we still have no evidence that 32-134 was rented out under Paddock's name, which I find odd.

       Maybe he had tactical gear hanging up in there somewhere and the officer thought it was a person. I'm just imagining the wetsuit my father had hanging up in the basement when I was a kid, and how it nearby gave me a heart attack every time I went down there to do laundry.

       Speaking of the other room (32-134) did anyone else find it odd that there was crime scene tape over the door to the suite (32-135) but no crime scene tape over the other door at all.  I would think there would at least be crime scene tape around the room service cart which is supposedly where Paddock had the cameras.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone put thiose plates on the arts and then wheeled the cart in front of the door of 32-134.  Wouldn't you want to try and get fingerprints on the plates to figure out whose room they had come from?  If they came from Paddock's suite, there seemed to be a lot of dishes for just one person's meal.

       It looked like there was food left on one of the plates - something black. I always wondered - did Paddock just see a room service cart further down the hallway, decided it would be a good way to set up his cameras and pull it down to his area?  Or had he previously ordered food and kept the service cart in his room until he was ready to use it?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like the hotel could run a check and see what rooms on that wing got room service that day and figure out whose food that was based on the number of plates and the food remains.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did they fingerprint the cart or the dishes?  If it came from Paddock's suite, were there any other fingerprints found that can't be attributed to hotel staff?

      <p>
       I see at least two dinner plates, four salad sized plates and a fifth one holding jelly or butter, and two water bottles. If it came from Paddock's suite, it seems like a lot for one meal.

       Why did SWAT breach into 135 and did they do it from the hallway or via 134 ?  SWAT first breached into 135. Officers entered the room and found Paddock dead (per LVPD). Door connecting the 2 rooms was locked from the 134 side, is my understanding. So SWAT breached in an abundance of caution vs using the room key and hallway door ? Just asking since FBI/PD hasn’t explained the rationale, I don’t think.

       Yeah they said it was done from the hallway side, officers camped out in stairwell right next to suspects door then breached from the hallway even though they could all see a camera on the room service cart aimed at the stairwell they just all decided to hang around in the stairwell and stand in the hallway setting breach charges.
Apparently they breached the door even though it had a hole in it large enough for officers to clearly see the rifle laying on the floor behind the door. I would have imagined if a door had 200 rounds fired through it as per the official story that you wouldnt need to breach it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And did they really stand in front of the door and breach it knowing that it had just had massive amounts of automatic fire come through the door moments earlier?

       Not to mention officers arrived on 32nd floor at 10:17. Breached door w explosives at 11:20. They couldn't have gotten the suite key in that time? Why did they even need to blow door?

       The second smaller room was where all of the auto/bumpfire shooting into the crowd took place. It is the only window broken in the videos while the shooting is going on. There aren't 800+ rounds near the broken window in the suite where we have leaked photos.

       They talk about bringing up snipers in the police scanner.  My guess is that they smashed the suite window in case a sniper was needed to take out an active shooter actually down on the fairgrounds.

       I remember them saying they had a sniper team but the people breaching into the room were callout out that they were going in so they don't get shot.

       I don't think they setup a team in the room.

       They said it was

       though. Does the adjoining room (32-134) count as "in the suite"? I figured it had to be one of the bedrooms.

       I can see that there is a scenario where someone was in one of the rooms first before swat got there and gunfire was exchanged.  The individual engaged could have been an agent which would explain why no one is talking.

       Yes, several scenarios. Most plausible to me is an anti-gun laundering sting operation going on there for several days. Would explain the video/tech in the room (which explains Sheriffs statement that “SWAT breach wasn’t delayed, we were methodical since we knew the shooter had stopped - cops had audio/video on the room via ATF tech).
      </p>
      <p>
       Cartel responded to the operation with force. Afterward, It may have been necessary to get CI’s off the floor, Fed agents off the floor if CIA was involved, before LVPD occupied 32.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, ISIS / AQ hijacked the op and turned weapons on agents and then citizens. In addition to CI’s, CIA, there may be dead terrorist bodies wearing stolen LVPD / FBI / MB uniforms.

       If it was an accident, I wouldn’t even be surprised. These guys entered a high stress situation with
       <em>
        probably
       </em>
       little to no combat training. They’re cops, not soldiers. They know how to shoot, not survive a firefight. I’d be scared shitless.
      </p>
      <p>
       They just witnessed the largest shooting in American history and now they’re going after the person(s) responsible. Sounded like automatic gunfire - what else could they have in that room? I’d be out of my fuckin mind with stress and a little panic.

       It can happen negligent discharges happen all the time, even military has them. As much training as you go through one moron with his finger on the trigger can easily do it. But with all the fishiness surrounding this event its a little weird to say the least.

       Umm.. he didn't report his I jury "really early on" he never mentioned his I jury over the radio. it wasn't until after paddock was killed that he was treated according to his Ellen interview.

       By “actual”, Do I have direct evidence? Sure don’t.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s my interpretation of the evidence presented vs actual facts freelance journalists have recorded. Look up intellihub’s articles this week.

       I think Jesus Campos is a distraction. They’re creating ambiguity to dun interference for a true cover up.

      <p>
       That’s my take.

       Audio was released on Oct 2 where you can hear Zebra20 saying:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We don't need anybody else up on this floor, break. This floor is clear, it has cleared by swat team with two breaches, WE DID HAVE ONE SWAT OFFICER THAT DID FIRE, we have negative injuries on anybody else. We have multiple firearms up here, from where they were shooting out of, but we just have one suspect down at this time.

       Watch the CBS interview again, who can pick out the body language of the guy who fired the gun,,?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or was it Levi  Mr Zebra-20 who was the "solo SWAT" officer on scene (strange for just one swat guy to be there if you ask me, id say he was CIA dressed in SWAT attire)
Remember how Zebra-20 didn't attend the CBS interview, it was only the regular officers.

       Yes it was his room – or rather, his suite. Just not the room (within that suite) where Paddock was found dead).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The police firearm went off inside the suite sometime after officers made entry, the sheriff said. But the round or rounds were not fired in the same room where gunman Stephen Paddock was found dead with what has been described as a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So presumably, in one of the bedrooms (whereas Paddock was found in the main living area).

       Right before the 2 single shots in the "bus stop vid", the police scanner has a voice saying they have snipers in position asking if 32nd floor is evacuated (which seemed like an odd question, as the shooting is only 10 minutes in).  Next thing you hear on scanner is "negative, nothing is evacuated," followed by 2 shots, the first of which caused glass to fall from the building (according to the blonde girl at the bus stop). Seems to me like a sniper could've ended this but for some reason the public can't handle the truth, so they give us lies.

       Did they specifically say snipers were in position?  I only remember hearing the guy say we are bringing "CI - snipers" (where he strangely stops saying either CIA or confidential informant) up the floor.

       I only assumed that snipers were "in position" based on the context of the question about evacuation. It sounded like they had snipers, likely with Paddock in their sights and wanted to pull the trigger. It seems like if snipers were to have killed Paddock, they can't just come out and admit it for whatever reason. Kinda like how they couldn't admit they shot that plane down over PA on 9/11. The suicide story is easier for the public to stomach.

       I think the sniper story is actually much easier to stomach. The suicide story doesn't make much sense within the broader context. The sniper story would make it much less confusing.

       The problem with the theory, is why wouldn't they just tell the public? It takes mental gymnastics to come up with a reason they wouldn't. There's no reason I can come up with why "we took out the killer" makes them look bad.. it looks more suspicious that he killed himself, and since that's the story they went with, that makes them look worse.. it's believable.

       Your correct, they never said snipers in position, they said they were bringing  C - I   uhhh snipers   UP to the 32nd floor , not sure why you would bring snipers up to the location of the shooter, thats for close quarter combat roles not sniper..

       I am absolutely convinced the guy on the radio was referring to a C.I    or the C,I,A

       That's the million dollar question - was CI supposed to be confidential informant or CIA.  He seems to immediately pause after the first two letters which makes it more bizarre.  Why couldn't he have just said FB...?

       Yet the other guy said they didn't actually say snipers.. why don't you dig up the audio backing up your words, before you start a new rumor of something the other guy said isn't true.

       Good explanation, although doesn't explain why they wanted to send a sniper UP to floor 32, the floor of the shooting....That's the last place you want to have a sniper.
And why was it essential that ONLY the suspect be on the floor for the  " C-I uh sniper "  to go up? Why did civilians HAVE to be cleared ?  So civilians couldn't report the truth imo

       That would be interesting to find out, i gave it a quick google didn't come up with much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if filmed days in advance every single one of those officers in that Interview knew shot or shots were fired from one of them but yet they ALL neglected to mention it.

       They are not helping to eliminate 'conspiracy theories' if anything they perpetuate them themselves from the lack of/inconsistency in information provided.

       Look how transparent and open and forthcoming they are with the NYC truck plow guy, we will know his life story and what he had for breakfast that morning by Friday, but practically nothing on Vegas. So frustrating ! - I'll try to find out when that interview was filmed

       This whole thing is so frustrating.  We have about 2% of the facts, and the fucking goddam FBI won't release shit. Here's another article from Oct 2016 where the FBI agent in charge, Aaron Rouse - is assuring Las Vegas that the Election wasn't a fraud.  Kind of makes you wonder. Is there anyone on the planet that is a bigger piece of shit than this guy?

       Are they trying to fix up the error in how Paddock got into room 32-143 (reserved to Brian Hodges)??  Let me guess - we will find out that this officer broke out the window during his accidental discharge??

       Very interesting!  I haven’t had a chance to look yet ( other than the tweet). Did LL claim how she got her hands on this document?  Brian sure seemed adamant he was in that other room. I’ve heard him on several radio show interviews and in several articles quoting him saying that was his room. I’m not doubting the doc - I just wanna know how she got it (“inside source”, or from Brian himself).
