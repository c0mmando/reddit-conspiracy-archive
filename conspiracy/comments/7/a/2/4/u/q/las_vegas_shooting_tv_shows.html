       A while ago, I watched a video of a lecture an ex-CIA agent gave.  One of the things he said was that the CIA foreshadows events that they are planning to do in real life in TV shows and movies.  I thought it was interesting and since then, try to keep that in mind when mass tragedies occur.

       <strong>
        EDIT: MAJOR CRIMES TV SHOW SPOILER ALERT
       </strong>
       Because I hate it when people spoil my TV shows for me
      </p>
      <p>
       Last night, I watched an episode of the TV show "Major Crimes" that aired in August 2016 called "Moral Hazard".  The plot was a guy who was taking out his grievances by killing people who had harmed him.  At first, he was tracking them down and killing them one by one.  The climax of the story was at the end when he went a hotel and checked in with a duffle bag full of automatic weapons.  There was a convention at the hotel and he had a room that overlooked the courtyard.  So his plan was to wait until the lectures were done and everyone went out into the courtyard and then he was going to shoot at the crowd with his automatic weapons from his hotel room window.  The police stopped him at the last minute before he could shoot anyone but there was a scene where he was shooting at cops in the hall from his room.  Then he committed suicide.  I thought the similarities were interesting.
