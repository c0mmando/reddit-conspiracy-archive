        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I hope no one here is buying the new iphone x or any iphone for that matter. I work in a restaurant with a bunch of people who all have iphones and 9 out of 10 have cracked screens. The other one just got a new phone because the last one had a cracked screen.</p>

<p>I have a bottom of the line android smart phone that cost 100$ I can do everything people do with 1000$ smart phones just a little bit slower. Plus my phone is solid I have never had a broken screen in almost 10 years of having a smart phone. I have dropped my cheap android phones many times. even off a moving vehicle and many times getting out of my car. The sides get dinged up but the screen is still fine. </p>

<p>The whole a need a glass screen on my smart phone thing is a scam so people will buy new phones. please ridicule everyone you know who bought a iphone. We need to put apple out of business. </p>

<p>Side note, not to be sexist but i have noticed the majority of people who buy iphones are women. I feel the women are being taken advantage off because they are historically not involved in the technology industry. Up until 10 years ago, I think many women never even wanted a computer, now nearly all of them own a handheld one. Obviously this is because men aren&#39;t informing the women of the scam taking place and the evidence is there that women are more easily taken advantage of.  (see waco texas seige, heavens gate, etc.) People need to study psychology and not have the knee jerk reaction of sexism. Differences between the genders do exist. It&#39;s not really just the genders it&#39;s the hormone levels in a persons body, this is why the feed us estrogen in all our food in america. look into BPA plastics, our meats are all from female animals, many more proofs etc. Estrogen makes a person emotional which will reduce the ability for logical thinking. Since logical has less to do with feelings and more to do with examining facts. The powers that be have every reason to want us to be emotional. </p>

<p>The reason I think apple was able to brainwash our females into needing smart phones and staring at them all day is a combination of the pictures you can take with the phones. all women like pictures. Because they elicit an emotional response to the images. This is why certain religions ban photography. The psychology is there. It&#39;s just whether you want to learn about it or not. 
The second part of why everyone is hooked on smart phones is the social media. Since all the women want to be on social media it only makes sense that the men will follow. This is also basic psychology. 
The only real threat to anyone&#39;s power or control is other people with the desire to make a difference. No one is making a difference when they are getting their feelings hurt on social media. Being emotional is in the best interest of the modern control system of the world. not in the best interest of the people. Since all the men have been feed excess levels of estrogen they are all basically women as well. 
It goes without saying but I will remind you, it&#39;s not  men(with healthy levels of testostorone) who get forced into prostitution or convinced  to commit suicide. </p>

<p>Men are the ones accomplishing things. When is the last time a crew of women built a house? a skyscraper? engineered a piece of software? these things don&#39;t happen. sure women help, but they don&#39;t make the whole project work alone. 
Men need to take charge again. Tell your woman to get rid of her iphone. If she argues, dump her, who cares. You are a man you can get a new woman. Your women will respect you for having ideals and morals. Even if they argue at first. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to let everyone in on a little secret.</p>

<p>Every I phone is built with a special back door into it which allows Iphone tech support to activate a code built into the phone.  This code, called in tech support, is a &quot;chip cracker&quot; which does effectively just that.  It causes the phone&#39;s main chip to fracture or break, there by bricking the phone.  Truth be known, all phones have this back door, at least smart phones.  It&#39;s <strong>supposed</strong> to be used in case the phone is stolen, to render it useless.  However, there are reports that the phones themselves have a kind of timer where once the phone reaches a certain age...it automatically does that, in order to force you to rebuy the phone.</p>

My iPhone has a case and protector and when I have dropped it, it&#39;s fine. And I use it primarily for music production, because yes, you can do that on a phone now and iOS has the best music apps because developers have few devices to test for and android was plagued with latency issues for too long.
