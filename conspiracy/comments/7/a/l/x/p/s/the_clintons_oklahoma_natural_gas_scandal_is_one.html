        <h3 class="title">The Clinton's Oklahoma natural gas scandal is one of the most overlooked conspiracies of all time. It also might've caused Clinton cabinet member Ron Brown's death in 1996.</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">43</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-11-03 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/murderalaska.html">murderalaska</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I first started looking into the Oklahoma natural gas scandal after reading it about in Jack Cashill&#39;s book <a href="http://a.co/bPhBZrp">&quot;Ron Brown&#39;s Body: How One Man&#39;s Death Saved the Clinton Presidency and Hillary&#39;s Future&quot;</a> which is an enthralling read. The Oklahoma scandal is detailed in one chapter in the book because Ron Brown, who died along with <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/ron-brown-dies-in-plane-crash-april-3-1996-236759">34 other people</a> on April 3rd, 1996 in a very fishy plane crash, was involved in setting up the natural gas deal that is the focus of the Oklahoma misdeeds.</p>

<p>The Oklahoma Corporation Commission and other government entities investigated a company called Dynamic Energy Resources which was started by <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/04/14/american-guanxi">Nora and Gene Lum</a>, two figures who would later <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-05-22/news/9705220318_1_justice-department-federal-campaign-law-gene-lum">plead guilty</a> to making illegal campaign contributions to Democrats. The Lums were also up to their eyeballs in the <a href="https://spectator.org/chinagate-and-the-clintons/">Chinagate</a> scandal which involved foreign nationals, mostly from China, funneling tens of millions of dollars into the 1996 Clinton / Gore campaign. </p>

<p>Dynamic Energy Resources or DER was able to secure a contract to supply Oklahoma customers natural gas through an entity known as Oklahoma Natural Gas or ONG. By inflating costs and the price of the natural gas it sold to ONG, DER <a href="http://www.oklahomaconstitution.com/ns.php?nid=113&amp;amp;pastissue=8">was able to overcharge customers to the tune of $35-65 million</a>. This deal was tied to the Clinton White House in a couple of ways in that Ron Brown, Secretary of Commerce, and his son Michael Brown were involved in brokering the deal for DER and Michael Brown was given a 5% shared of DER and a seat on the board for his trouble. Also Thomas &quot;Mack&quot; McLarty, who was Bill Clinton&#39;s chief of staff during Clinton&#39;s first term and an oilman himself and executive of ARKLA (Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company ) had been leaning on ONG to shut down its investigation into DER&#39;s overcharging.</p>

<p>One of the key witnesses for this scandal was a guy named <a href="http://www.oklahomaconstitution.com/ns.php?nid=113&amp;amp;pastissue=8">Ron Miller</a> who was part-owner of yet another gas company called GAGE Corporation (Golden Arrow Gas Energy) that had been purchased by DER and the Lums. Miller and GAGE were shafted by the Lums in the purchase agreement as the Lums stopped paying the agreed upon installments for purchase of the company and so GAGE was involved by proxy in the investigations by ONG and other government entities and so Ron Miller started taping his conversations and he was perhaps the best situated person to expose the truth. He died shortly before he was to testify before a congressional committee about the scandal and his death, which has never been fully investigated or explained, appeared to have been caused by inhalation anthrax. Ron Miller&#39;s death is eerily similar to the story of <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/fr/555472/posts">Russell Welch</a>, an Arkansas State Police Investigator who was looking into the Mena drug running stuff when he too was poisoned with what appeared to be anthrax.</p>

<p>All of this stuff has only been covered in a few places, most of them I have linked. Outfits like <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2001/05/9363/">WND</a> and other alternative media have done great work on this Oklahoma gas stuff but the MSM of course hasn&#39;t plumbed these depths. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem and I&#39;m in the same boat. I grew up in the 80s and 90s admiring Bill Clinton and in a very liberal family. I started looking into the <a href="https://youtu.be/EKQ59Cq_Mhc">Vince Foster</a> stuff after watching the linked James Corbett video and it just blew my mind. The more I read and learn about the Clinton era, the more I&#39;ve come to realize that both parties are totally infected with the virus of corruption. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh.. Interesting, as an Okie. Never heard about any of this, but i was a kid back then.</p>

<p>The Aubrey McClendon (ex-CEO of Chesapeake) death last year never passed the smell test to me. Single vehicle crash, the day after a Federal Grand Jury indictment alleging conspiracy to suppress prices of oil &amp; lng leases via a no-bid agreement with a competitor.</p>

<p>Methinks someone higher up the food chain was afraid he&#39;d turn state&#39;s witness. Dead men tell no tales.</p>
