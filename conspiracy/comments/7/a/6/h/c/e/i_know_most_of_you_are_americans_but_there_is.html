    <div class="md"><p>Your language to me indicates the conspiracy. I posted earlier about the difference between the reaction to Spacey et al, and what we know about the likes of Bowie, Page, Stewart etc.</p>

<p>We drag Spacey out over something that happened 30 years ago, where he came on a bit strong but ultimately let the guy go. And yet something like this you treat as &#39;randy old men being raked over the coals&#39; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No that is not what I said so far. If we find out women or men are being sexually assaulted/abused then the police should be involved and arrested etc made. I meant so far a lot of what has been said has been exactly that. One of the women mentioned even went as far to say it was nothing, a come on at a party and that was it. I am no way writing this off as a nothing and excusable behaviour but we are as yet to of been presented with anything worse. I think the worst thing I have seen is some intern being sent to buy sex toys. I just think it should be kept in perspective until more comes to light. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I apologise for coming off a bit strong. There&#39;s a lot of things I&#39;m annoyed about in terms of papering over things that shouldn&#39;t be.</p>

<p>I recognise this was not your intention.</p>

<p>I would, however, be very careful about minimising this stuff. I am a male, and suffered from inappropriate comments, the like of which would probably be brushed off as &#39;nothing&#39;. Yet I was deeply impacted and still now, many years later, I find myself deeply upset and shaken by these actions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I 100% agree and I assure you this is not what I meant. I do not believe in the &quot;old way of doing things&quot; and I don&#39;t think a person generation entitles them to get away with shit. But I also don&#39;t like when these sorts of scandals run away from themselves. Today in the news I&#39;m hearing reports of someone touching someone else&#39;s knee, once, while chatting in a pub??? This sort of bullshit takes away from any serious abuse that may or may not be happening in our government. I HATE our current government here in the UK and a lot of these toffs need to stop acting like we are still an empire, this does not mean however that I would like to see a man or woman&#39;s life and career ruined over an innocent chat up line that fell flat or a one-off drunken come on (where no1 was harmed ofc) that has happend to almost every single one of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. And tbh I&#39;m probably coming at this with my own agenda. I see how we react these days and can&#39;t help but compare this to the way we treat the likes of Bowie, Jagger, Steward, people that we have ample evidence that they abused their positions in regards under aged people.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen a real odd stream in the media in regards those they vilify and those they&#39;re content to leave alone. And i conflated this with your response for which I apologise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically for some reason some conservative staffers decided to make a spreadsheet listiing the mps that were pushy, free with their hands etc etc. Surprise surprise it got leaked and now people are coming forward. So far it has all been pretty minor stuff and a lot of denials ec etc. I think a fairly high up polition (damien green) is supposed to of used some website that caters to people that want affairs. It has the potential to blow up I guess, but atm it&#39;s mostly stuff like &quot;he put his hand on my knee at a party&quot; 
Some dude got fired for sending sexts to an intern. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, so far... we shall see if more comes to light. I don&#39;t particularly want to see lives ruined for a come-on line at a party that felt flat or a drunken pass at a co-worker ( that shit can happen without it having to be insidious in natures) obv if laws have been broken or people have been left feeling for their safety then something needs to be done and hopefully it will. </p>
