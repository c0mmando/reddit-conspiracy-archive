       Ongoing investigation? Property of MGM? I can't find an answer to this on Google and I would imagine releasing this would make a lot of people feel better about the official story that he acted alone.

       Thats not an ELI5 answer. I want to know what the official reason for us not seeing this guys making multiple one way trips through the lobby with luggage. Some reporter has to have asked this question by now, no? Or is this standard procedure to keep that footage as evidence and not released?

       I don’t think we’re going to see many “official” answers on this one. It just went away way too fast. Less details about a mass shooting I’ve ever seen. Super sketchy.

       Exactly. You have no idea if there was anyone else involved. And for that matter they may not yet either.
So to keep repeating "wheres duh video footage of the worst mass killing in us history??? Was it fake??"
is ignorant.

       The most suspicious part of the post spectacle events is, given the prevalence of cameras in vegas, how they kept changing the story. We know they probably had eyes on the whole thing, so the only reason they'd be changing their story so much is that they are fabricating it.  Hence people are asking for the footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the fbi's recent history of cultivating terrorists (many stories on this if you duck duck go it), the most plausible theory is that they are involved and covering things up.  Simple logic.

       The best and most reasonable explanation of the changing timeline is that from the moment the last bullet was fired everyone here and news cameras and reporters were nonstop "what happened what happened what happened what happened excuse me what happened".
They gave updates as best they could while processing an enormous amount of evidence, witnesses, audio, and video. While at the same time having the swarm of bees that is the constant questions from the media.
All they can do is give the answers they think are correct at that moment because people wont accept "we dont know".
So if later they find out more info they have a different perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cant demand immediate answers and correct answers at the same time following an incident like this

       If you take your reasoning on the non video release i.e., "it's an active investigation...they don't need to" why do they give "updates and answers" to questioning media and public. If we took your stance we'd never know anything about anything. I mean give me a fking break...they just released SOME of the JFK documents 25 years later, and if it were Obama/Clinton/Bush sitting in White House, you can bet your ass they'd be sealed for another 25 years.

       Releasing the footage would result in every person that Paddock casually interacted with being bombarded with questions, threats, etc.    Alternately, they could blur out the faces of all the people and then get accused of "hiding" something.

       MGM is at a major loss here and the video(s) will only cost more for them in terms of letting the shooters have open training on 20k people for over an hr... think about that.. if there were video evidence of that... its not stepehen paddock or the local pd... again its the fbi to allow this to have happened... or did they want this to happen? Thats the bigger question on my mind.

       The MGM doesn’t want to highlight a blatant security weakness inherent at all hotels.  They could show the footage of Paddock rolling a luggage cart to the elevators, but why would they?  What service does that provide?  What realm of sanity does it make sense to show the public evidence that your publicly traded company has security risks?

       why are you skeptical? he was there for multiple days checked in as two people in multiple rooms he could easily have had 5 suitcases brought up with him during check-in which could contain 6 or 7 weapons or more for that matter. he could then bring in more during successive days either on his own or using a bell hop and no one single event would seem odd and there would more than likely be different people handling it each time. this all seems very plausible to me. I've stayed in hotels, brought in my own luggage and used a luggage cart and no on bats an eye at this it's pretty common actually.

       Let's be honest, he's not giving bags containing weapons to the bell hop. I say I'm skeptical because there is absolutely no reason for one single shooter to bring 23 guns to his room to carry out this attack. To me, this one fact is the most tangible piece of evidence that there's more to the story.  I'm skeptical not only because he brought more guns than his two arms could ever shoot, but on top of that each time he made a trip to bring more weapons up he took an unnecessary risk of getting caught.

       there were multiple jammed weapons in his room afterwards, my thought is he brought so many because of the add-ons (bump stock/other mods) have a tendency to jam, he knew this, and he was coming prepared. He had years of experience with guns and we can guess that he had experience with the guns he recently purchased too so he would have expected the jamming issues and accounted for them by bringing backups.

       How is a bell hop going to know that there’s weapons in a guest luggage, and there is no risk in making multiple trips even if he came and went every hour to get a new bag Throughout the entirety of his stay no one would bat an eye

       Weapons and ammo tend to be alot heavier than luggage containing only clothing. Do you not think the bell hop would pickup a bag and think, gee this is fucking heavy as shit.

       I would assume a bell hop wouldn’t bat an eye to a heavy bag, when I travel I can easily get my large suitcase up to 100 lbs if not more and that’s with no weapons. If he took the guns apart and wrapped them in some clothes and put them in a large suitcase it wouldn’t weigh as much as your thinking, maybe 65-75 lbs no bell hop would ever notice. Especially the fact that he was a high roller no one was going to question anything he did, mgm would fire any bell hop almost immediately if they came to them about some heavy bags before they bother a high roller that’s already staying in Complementary rooms

       The problem with this theory is it assumes that ANYONE before that day gave a fucking shit what people brought up to their hotel rooms. ESPECIALLY someone that is considered a "high roller" by any stretch of the word.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this whole thing is pretty crazy but seriously this is the least hard to imagine part of the whole thing possibly.

      <p>
       No one had brought a shit ton of weapons upstairs to a vegas hotel room in order to shoot people out of the window of it before. conspiracy or not this is just a fact.

       I don't have much of a problem with him getting the guns to his room. A luggage cart and 4 bags could do it no problem. I do agree with you on the number of guns being strange though. Gun jams happen but gun people know how to clear them. Barrels do overheat when fired at that rate though, maybe that's part of the reason he brought so many. Either way, everything is a little more suspicious than the public is being made to believe I think.

       No, give me a source of evidence that makes this statement true. Otherwise its a personal opinion to fit your own narrative. You can't dismiss something because you dont want to believe it.

       Assuming Paddock did this, he is crazy, but not stupid. A lot of planning and thought went into this. The guy was rich, he held a pilots license, he understands the concept of eliminating unnecessary risk. If you think for a second that someone like Paddock would have risked giving a bell hop his weapons you're naive.

       you REALLY don't sound like an r/conspiracy guy. you are backing up MGM and the authorities. Not a single frame from a video places Paddock at the Mandalay.

       The American people who allegedly lost 58 of their own deserve proof.

       Im the idiot yet you want a hotel to release security footage to in fact prove a guy shot 58 people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Newsflash, the release of CCTV will not be a smoking gun. It will not confirm fuck all. Other than how he moved about leading up to the event, and potentially how he got everything to his rooms.

       Based on your over the top reaction I also think you missed my point. I look forward to you calling me stupid and/or a shill. Its a common defense mechanism for people here without a leg to standon.

       No.  Because the only feasible solution is security checkpoints/metal detectors before you get to your hotel room.  No Las Vegas Hotel will ever implement this, so there’s no point in highlighting the problem.

       Right, agreed, but I was specifically responding to the part of OC's comment that said "he was there for almost a week. Incredibly easy--and inconspicuous--to walk in and out a few times per day with luggage over the course of his stay." The new intel shared in the 20/20 special implied that he brought his
       <em>
        entire
       </em>
       arsenal into the hotel
       <em>
        on the day of the shooting.
       </em>
       Which is just absurd. It's more believable that he gradually brought everything in over the course of his stay, like OC said. But for him to have driven 700 miles (~10 hours of driving) + single-handedly moved 23 guns, 10,000 rounds of ammo, several drills, cameras, laptops, monitors, gas masks, bulletproof vest and other survivalist gear, etc., from his house to his car AND from his car to his suite, is simply too ridiculous for me to believe.

       Why do you think a private company that worries about their legal liability would want to bury this footage? They are covering their ass.

       A company's legal team will always argue your right to see such footage is negated by the possible risk to them.

       If you go down the list of who has the footage it's pretty easy to see why nothing has been released. I'm not sure I agree with that decision but I can see why it's happening. 
You figure local PD had the case taken away from them right away by the feds, that removed a whole lot of local leaks. MGM is in full PR damage control mode. They don't want any more news cycles of MGM + Vegas shootings. News networks have moved on to other stories, so there doesn't seem to be a lot of pressure to release info or even push for more info.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soooo that only leaves the feds as a source of footage. Why would they release footage in an active investigation if they don't think it would help their investigation? Pressure from the press? What pressure? Public outcry? I don't even see any, not really. I've mentioned this in past threads any info released can negatively impact a case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Show a video of Paddock on a given day and you have now removed being able to use that day when asking suspects or anyone questions about that day. Where you work in say asking what he was wearing when a person saw them etc, looking to catch someone in an inconsistency. Granted at this point that's sounds foolish but feds being feds, if they don't have to do something they just don't do it. In the end the real ball drop here is our media just moving on to the next story and focusing too much on some lame hollywood sex scandal over a mass shooting. Same for the public just sort of giving a shrug that 50+ where shot and killed, but hey now that hollywood sex scandal.

       ELI5: MGM Mommy doesn't want to share the footage being it makes mommy look bad. Federal Daddy doesn't want to share the footage being no one makes daddy do anything he doesn't want to do. The kids, Gen Pop and Press Core are not screaming about any of this enough to make Daddy do something he doesn't want to do.

       This. They will only release footage and more information when it is of interest in helping them solve the case (i.e. ran out of leads, hit dead end, etc.). Releasing footage or other information to the public too early can actually hinder the solving of the case for various reasons (alibi's can be prepared by suspects, can no longer use it to determine credible key witnesses / suspects, the list goes on..). This is what any smart investigator would do. It's common sense, really.

       So, this tells me one of two things.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        How is this still an open investigation.  according to the lvmpd/fbi Paddock was a lone gunman with no accomplices.  there is no one left to charge with the actual shooting as Paddock killed himself.  Case closed right?  Yet no videos released, so prob. not option 1.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       option 2. there were others involved. case still open.

       It's not 'case-closed'.  There is also litigation ongoing, and that will require strong findings from the criminal investigation, which will take time.  There are a hell of a leads to follow up on in a case like this.

       I'd like to think this is an ongoing investigation type deal but I honestly don't think we'll ever hear about this case again in any sort of mainstream format. Maybe a FOIA doc or something declassified in 20 years...

       On top of all of that, there's no hallway or elevator footage. Period. They don't have cameras in the hotel hallways or elevators in the Mandalay Bay hotel. So it just doesn't exist.

       The elevator you're referring to has a camera in it. There are no cameras upstairs, but there are in all elevators and all over the lobby. Unless the guns were magically teleported into the room, there would be surveillance footage of the guns being transported in.

       Here are a couple of reasons.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         They aren't going to release footage in an open case.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Lawsuits have been filed. The footage will be sealed til those are settled.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         MGM has the right to refuse that they be made public and likely will file and injunction to make sure they are never released.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         FOIA request won't be granted for an open case or in the reasons I stated above.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       It is super easy to walk in with 10 pieces of luggage all at once or even separate. It isn't odd, out of the norm or even noticeable in those hotels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope that helped.

       Why do we know 10,000x more information about someone who just did something yesterday?
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes no sense. This guy has worked for several government agencies and was in a place with 100,000 cameras and has decades worth history in the US vs. 7 years. Most of which would have been investigated having worked for the DOD and defense contractors...
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is killing 2 Americans with a car becoming the equivalent to 911 when a white guy just did the exact same thing a few months ago was no big deal at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is this a bigger deal than someone shooting over 500 fucking people? That's WAY closer to 911. Five. Hundred. Fucking. People. and the news has just moved on...
      </p>
      <p>
       These differences also highlight how the establishment treats NY and CA completely differently than all the flyover states. The people don't matter even half as much unless they live in these two places. Then there is the race and religious bias issues... No one on cable news is talking about any of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       How different do you think things would be if a muslim guy shot over 500 people in New York. You think we'd stop talking about it after 4 or 5 days and accept that we know absolutely nothing about what happened? Come on...

       It is bizarre, but it seems that people generally are not interested.  Even here in the "conspiracy" sub, people just seem to have moved on from 1 Oct.  Perhaps too much hype about multiple gunmen, and when that didn't pan out so well people sort of lost interest in exactly how/why one guy shot 500 people.

       It just confirms that he took them up to the room himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, have you ever considered the possibility that they are not releasing footage because it DOES show others present, but they don't want to tip those people off that they are under investigation?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a possible scenario here. The police aren't required to instantly dump all of their evidence for the public to sift through when the investigation is just one month old.

       Demanding this sort of information just makes us all look foolish, frankly. Of all the things to hang our collective hats on, it's this.

       Why don’t we have footage of flight 77 going into the Pentagon low and level at over 500mph knocking down 5 40-foot lamp poles, the damage path of which doesn’t match the data provided by NTSB or eyewitnesses?

       This was an intelligence operation. It has all the hallmarks. If you study clandestine ops, you know this. You will never know who is actually behind it. Those in power use events like this to advance their agendas. They instill fear in us whether it’s to carry us into war, or clamp down on our rights.

       There are many reasons for their operations.

       This one fell apart. Got too messy. So the press shut up about it. Tucker Carlson and AJ served as the controlled opposition while big Hollywood scandals hit the news. Down the memory hole it goes.

       If that’s the way you’d like to look at it, that’s fine. I make a clear distinction between the government of the Rothschild-created State of Israel and its agents who have infiltrated our government and institutions and good Jews who have had their identities stolen by evil people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone has their stance on this. I’ve spent a lot of time studying this, I’ve gone there (Gaza is an open-air prison I don’t care what anyone says)
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, there are a lot of religious Jews who believe that there should be no Jewish state until the return of the Messiah.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is, Rothschild-Zionism is evil, but being Jewish does not make a person evil.

       Oh no. I was just trying to make the case that intelligence agencies include criminal factions that operate outside the law. Including the Mossad probably did just muddy things up.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had to place any speculative blame on the Vegas event, it would be a criminal faction of an intelligence agency working on behalf of whomever stands to gain from increased scanning of people and luggage at hotels.

       This is one of the main reasons why I think they aren’t telling us everything. I mean, I understand it’s an ongoing investigation so they might not be able to release the footage.

      <p>
       But I don’t know why they wouldn’t be able to just release some short footage of him going up to the room with the weapons. What harm would that do?

       op come on you know very well why we never saw that footage
      </p>
      <p>
       Because he definitely got help from someone at some point. My guess is a co-conspirator that law enforcement doesn't want to reveal publicly, but I suppose it's also possible that hotel staff assisted him without realizing and law enforcement doesn't want the Internet going insane investigating a hotel employee who wasn't actually involved.

       1,  How is this still an open investigation. according to the lvmpd/fbi Paddock was a lone gunman with no accomplices. there is no one left to charge with the actual shooting as Paddock killed himself. Case closed right? Yet no videos released,
      </p>

       In addition to this being an ongoing case, there's a good chance he didn't bring them up to his room because hotel staff often does that for you. If this is how it went down, then the hotel may not want the tapes to be released, but I don't know if they will have a say in the matter.

       Guy who used to do this sort of thing except it was bags here, guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frequently guests will have bellhops bring bags up to their rooms. Do you think it looks good to release footage of their own employees lugging up bags, which mind you they NEVER look inside of, that are full of the guns used to kill all those people? Nope, it's sketchy as fuck. No way Paddock would've carried all 23 at one time, likely a few at a time or had bellhops bring them up from whatever vehicle he had.

       Someone as rich and successful as Paddock isn't dumb. I have to imagine the man fully understood the concept of eliminating unnecessary risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Handing your bags of weapons to a bell hop is an unnecessary risk. Bringing 23 guns in 5 trips vs 4 guns in 1 trip is an unnecessary risk.

       I don't know - We know that Paddock was in the service elevators with a bellhop - that's probably how he got the guns up there. The hotel bellhop helped him. Rich people/High rollers get very special treatment here in Vegas. We were sometimes told not to speak to some guests and to get them whatever they ask for - even use of the service elevator. I do know there are security cameras in those service elevators.

       Because evidence usually isn't released until after the case is closed, and seeing that they would have needed a warrant and/or affidavit to acquire the tapes the investigators are not letting it leak out to the public out fear of ruining any case they may have if there was an accomplice.

       Because right now the official story is that this one guy took 23 weapons up to his room yet acted alone. I know I'm not the only one who is very skeptical of that.
