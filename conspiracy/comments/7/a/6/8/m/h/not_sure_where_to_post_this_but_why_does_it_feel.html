But what I see right now is multiple posts on reddits front page about HoC being cancelled by Netflix because of an accusation that Spacey may well have been inappropriate with a 14 year old male.

<p>Nobody gave a shit how long ago it was when Sandusky did shit. They fired Paterno over it over an event that happened 25 years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah ok. Myself I don&#39;t know what plays apart, that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking. My feeling is when Bowie or any other of the older stats get brought up in regards under age sex, the media&#39;s response is a &#39;oh well boys will be boys, twas a different era&#39; type thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because if the pitchfork crowd goes to far into the past conflating pedophilia with men  attracted to woman under the age of 18 the pitchfork crowd is gonna find out that there probably isn&#39;t a single person alive who doesn&#39;t have some male ancestor that did the nasty with a younger woman and all that that implies.  Humans grow up slower now, we have learned it takes us into our mid to late 20&#39;s for our brain to fully develop. We didn&#39;t know that decades ago and society is more complicated, education takes longer. When men and woman&#39;s roles were more &quot;traditional&quot; (for lack of a better word) it was perfectly normal for a younger woman to hook up with an older man. Older men generally offered more financial stability, younger woman offered a better chance at successfully birthing offspring. </p>

<p>Under 18 is not considered adult these days and rightly so, but this wasn&#39;t the case in the past. Back then it was more a bench mark of when you get to exercise rights as an adult, not necessarily a great indicator of ones mental acuity. Remember also, it was not uncommon for young men to lie about their age to enlist and for recruiters to look the other way. I might be wrong, but I&#39;m pretty sure you can still enlist at 17 with parental consent.</p>

<p>Regarding the rock stars you named, I don&#39;t know their particular stories, but underage girls lying about there age and literally throwing themselves at a famous musician is not the same thing as what Weinstein has been accused of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im just throwing this out there but there is a difference between predatory and violent child abuse and two consenting partners. The age that constitutes adulthood for sexual interaction is globally pretty low according to our cultural standards. Im pretty sure you can legally marry at 15 in US. In many countries 12 and 13 year olds start families. As far as the past is concerned, go back more than one hundred years and life spans were dramatically lower. Basically when a female is ready to reproduce and seeks a sexual relationship she is in fact old enough and has the right to choose any partner despite the age difference. Social taboos and cultural framework still have an enormous baring on what is acceptable or preferable but none of that has anything to do with rape or systematic child abuse which are easily heinous and reprehensible </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s yet another example of how things back then weren&#39;t as great as they&#39;re remembered, and that things now aren&#39;t as bad as people say.</p>

<p>As it&#39;s been posted and pointed out on this subreddit a couple times in the past couple week, Playboy featured a fully nude, full frontal pictorial of Brooke Shields when she was 10 or 11 years old (I&#39;ve read both ages, not sure which it is). </p>

<p>They were pushing the pedophile agenda just as hard back then, but having much better luck. Maybe because people were still a lot more naive and trusting than they are now. And Hefner is dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say the opposite though. It almost feels like faux outrage. A 26 year old dude picks up a 14 year old guy, at a party, and is a bit forthright but at the end of the day respects the guys wishes to leave, and we&#39;re absolutely up in arms cancelling the dudes show with literally zero evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure I agree with myself either, but I remember when a girl in my high school slept with a famous rapper and she was nothing but proud. Not even saying it was illegal or anything (don&#39;t want to look up laws), and she had a car and I think was a junior, but anyway I don&#39;t know how she feels about it now. But the cases where someone has to sleep with a director to get a job, that&#39;s gotta feel so humiliating and destroy your confidence in your art. Not surprising these cases are coming out first.

In it the heroine Penny Lane announces she&#39;s retiring as &#39;Queen of the Band Aids (&quot;Don&#39;t call us groupies!&quot;)&#39; at the age of sixteen (or fifteen, it&#39;s not clear) because she&#39;s past her prime. In Alice&#39;s Restaurant there&#39;s a fifteen year old who brags to Arlo about the bands and musicians she&#39;s had sex with. These were not rocks gods ensnaring and abusing young girls; they were fighting them off.

    <div class="md"><p>To begin with, many of those rock stars were underage themselves when they first started to perform and gain some notoriety. Moreover, their sudden and youthful fame was a big draw and they had to fight off rather than seduce or pay any young girls for a roll in the hay. Some high profile performers and bands even had &quot;groupies&quot; who followed them around on tour looking expressly for some chance to sleep with one of them.</p>

<p>And lest we forget, that was the &quot;free-love&quot; generation that was freed to make-out wherever, whenever, and with whomever they liked mainly because of the arrival of an effective and almost fool proof birth control pill.  </p>
