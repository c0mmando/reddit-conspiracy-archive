       To find the obfuscation expert, look for the people who uses the word "I" and "you," turning all arguments into "me vs you"
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't let them control your narratives. They generally ignore requests to answer why they are so adamantly arguing the status quo on a conspiracy message board.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look for "argumentative, repeating questions" from these same posters. They'll generally ask 1-3 questions to put you on the defensive while ignoring anything you ask of them. They Think They are entitled and act as such. Their entitled attitude is easy to spot (just wait for the comment sections)!
      </p>
      <p>
       They can't hide their aggressive attitudes. They will call you a shill, stalker, troll, shill for posting original content they disagree with!
      </p>
      <p>
       And they will push narratives in tandem. Once again it's very easy to spot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope you have an easy time sharing whatever conspiratorial information you choose to highlight!  Happy days and pleasant nights

       The “ignore what you say and ask questions” shit is so spot on. I find it’s easiest to respond to them in an absurdist manner and try to sneakily call them a shill at the same time (can’t do it outright or they’ll get you banned because that’s how they roll). A rational person with a real point will ignore you and continue trying to make it, shills just get stumped when you don’t give them anything to work with other than “damn dude nice hat, your friends get you that for posting?”

       Indeed, obfuscation experts use a formulaic approach. It usually involves insults/attacks geared at provoking an emotional response that will derail the conversation, if you let it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay focused. Don't react emotionally. Force the comments to stay on topic. They want control over how you respond. Don't give them that control. Just do the opposite, and beat that horse until it's dead. Eventually, they move along.

       You presume to understand what another person thinks? That is as bizarre as your attempts at an insult.

       For the record, I don't think anyone is on the forefront of a mass-awakening. People are steadfast in their belief systems. The indoctrination amongst the population is strong. Nothing's going to change that.

       No its because I've been embroiled in a bullshit conversation elsewhere with you, and seeing you type that above post out made me question my eyesight.

       You come off like Kyrie Irving. An undereducated

       asshole who laces every word he writes/says/thinks with extra-perceptual bullshit. Only what you dont understand is that is a tool for people who are uneducated and insecure. So congratulations.

       I speak from personal experience and observations. You don't have to like it, but it is based on a handful of university degrees, including terminal degree; it's also based on a decade+ of university teaching experience.

       No, there is a difference between
       <em>
        believing
       </em>
       you have the experience, and actually having done the work to attain. A ''decade+" to me means "I worked at a university, and can't recall how long my exactly teaching career was, because it doesn't exist" All that I see when I see your posts is someone who
       <em>

       If you haven't noticed yet, I don't really care what you think. You've been wrong this entire time. That is not likely to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw the video, I thought the guy was funny in his approach, and I shared it. The topic was more-or-less irrelevant to me. It is a conspiracy topic, so it was appropriate for this sub. You assume way too much about people whom you think you know. That's kinda dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       A decade+ means means it has been over a decade, and I continue to teach. If you don't understand, then you may ask; when you assume, you just seem like an ass. I have a resume, but I have nothing to prove, so it's not like I would even consider publishing it here. What you believe is irrelevant. It doesn't change anything.

       What I do in my posts is none of your concern. What you believe is your own business. If you make wild accusations and assumptions, you should expect to be refuted. If you don't like that, then tough shit. If you want to stay here and act a fool, I can accommodate your stupidity until you are blue in the face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, what you believe about me is irrelevant. No one gives a shit what you believe about me. You may believe I am the lock ness monster, for all I care. Yet, you somehow feel the need to state your opinion.

       Kinda like this one guy I ran into yesterday who, instead of engaging in conversation, decided to dig through my post history and find some bit of conversation to "discredit" me with.  While the conversation quickly devolved into nonsensical gibberish, he dug further into my post history, trying to glean personal data from it, and got pretty creepy.

       You sure do love those waaaaay late edits.  Just answer one question, then.  How far back did you have to dig into my comments, to try to fit together personal family info?  Or did you already have it "on file"?  I can't even remember the last time I mentioned any family stuff.  It must've been way back in there.  I'm sure you know, though.

       <em>

       Yeah the second example for sure theres alot of rich powerful people who have everything to loose from people exposing the truth, thats why suppression tactics are so wide spread, divide and conquer.
