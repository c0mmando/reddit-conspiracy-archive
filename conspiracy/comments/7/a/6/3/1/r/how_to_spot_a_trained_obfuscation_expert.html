<p>Don&#39;t let them control your narratives. They generally ignore requests to answer why they are so adamantly arguing the status quo on a conspiracy message board. </p>

<p>Look for &quot;argumentative, repeating questions&quot; from these same posters. They&#39;ll generally ask 1-3 questions to put you on the defensive while ignoring anything you ask of them. They Think They are entitled and act as such. Their entitled attitude is easy to spot (just wait for the comment sections)!</p>

<p>They can&#39;t hide their aggressive attitudes. They will call you a shill, stalker, troll, shill for posting original content they disagree with! </p>

<p>And they will push narratives in tandem. Once again it&#39;s very easy to spot. </p>

<p>Hope you have an easy time sharing whatever conspiratorial information you choose to highlight!  Happy days and pleasant nights</p>

<p>Edit - thank you <a href="/u/awesomo3082">/u/awesomo3082</a> for proving every point succinctly. You&#39;re the real MVP of this post. Peace and love fellow theorists</p>

<p>You learn quick young grasshopper. </p>

<p>And baiting me into calling out users? I prefer to inform users about the tricks of the trade rather than get banned for calling out specific users. This is an epidemic, if you can&#39;t spot the points I&#39;ve made you are being willfully ignorant. </p>

I find it’s easiest to respond to them in an absurdist manner and try to sneakily call them a shill at the same time (can’t do it outright or they’ll get you banned because that’s how they roll). A rational person with a real point will ignore you and continue trying to make it, shills just get stumped when you don’t give them anything to work with other than “damn dude nice hat, your friends get you that for posting?” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, obfuscation experts use a formulaic approach. It usually involves insults/attacks geared at provoking an emotional response that will derail the conversation, if you let it.</p>

<p>Stay focused. Don&#39;t react emotionally. Force the comments to stay on topic. They want control over how you respond. Don&#39;t give them that control. Just do the opposite, and beat that horse until it&#39;s dead. Eventually, they move along. </p>

Not <em>is</em>. </p>

<p>How many times have you gone to the other side?</p>

<p>How many times have you thought you were dead?</p>

<p>How many times have you projected your consciousness?</p>

<p>How many times have you prayed to God and/or the Universe and been given verifiable guidance?</p>

<p>How many hours of biblical study have you endured?</p>

<p>How many hours of other texts have you feasted on?</p>

<p>How many FOIA files have you read?</p>

<p>How many times have you spoken to someone close to the veil?</p>

<p>Do you even know what the veil is?</p>

<p>How many times have you tripped acid, amanita mascaria, or psylocibin?</p>

<p>I saw the video, I thought the guy was funny in his approach, and I shared it. The topic was more-or-less irrelevant to me. It is a conspiracy topic, so it was appropriate for this sub. You assume way too much about people whom you think you know. That&#39;s kinda dumb. </p>

<p>A decade+ means means it has been over a decade, and I continue to teach. If you don&#39;t understand, then you may ask; when you assume, you just seem like an ass.

I&#39;m baffled, that after two comments to you, you went through <em>weeks or months</em> of my comment history, to find some personal info to use on me, while completely sidestepping the conversation.  You don&#39;t even have my info right, because I don&#39;t spill all the beans, but I see what you did.  It&#39;s full on, 100% creeper action.  And your &quot;obfuscation&quot; is the least of your issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the second example for sure theres alot of rich powerful people who have everything to loose from people exposing the truth, thats why suppression tactics are so wide spread, divide and conquer.
