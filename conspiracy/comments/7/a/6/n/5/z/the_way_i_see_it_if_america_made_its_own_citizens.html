    <div class="md"><p>You are not wrong. America has indeed made us dumb through knee-capped education and blatant consumerism. Though, I&#39;d contend the notion that the FB ads seriously influenced anyone. I could be very wrong about that, maybe a lot of facebookers were influenced by the ads, but if that is the bar we&#39;re setting for untoward interference, I think we have to pursue more organizations than just Russia.</p>

<p>And yes, the US has interfered in <em>countless</em> elections and has funded and supported more coups than probably any other country in modern history. So yeah, it is a huge double standard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ACTUALLY USA is listed as a tax haven on Wikipedia. Consider Sweden and Denmark, countries with very high taxes compared to America, yet they have far more billionaires per capital than America does. Why? They can make sure the best minds from innovation and businesses get the education they need in order to become successful. Not to mention the health care aspect. Get sick in America as middle class and your family&#39;s economy is ruined for years, in Scandinavia they are back as productive and BNP producing citizens in no time with minimal financial set back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, doesnt change the act that everyone else is also in this cyber war, china, iran, etc. Technology is no longer exclusive to US supremacy you know...</p>

<p>But it has to be russia, because US thought the won the cold war, post ussr collapse into russia. and now the new russia, not ussr is a big econoic competitor is now a threat. This has nothing to do with election meddling, the fact that hillary lost is a sentiment of how much actual americans did not want anther huge war effort, more stupid clintons or bushes, more crap put on them whilst their own country is crumbling. Maybe the threat of russia is hugely overblown by the media and after a year people are believing this crap. Make he lie big enough and repeat it long enough and eventually people will believe it. We are literally seeing this, after more tha year of this, US citizens and real people are believing russia hacked the election. By witch hunting and making up connections, by propaganda etc. </p>

We are fucked we need a reset and it&#39;ll never happen from within. The government is too big to fail, they employ more of the population than you feeble mind could wrap it&#39;s self around. It&#39;s like getting served the same thing to eat every meal every day, sure you have multiple choices, varying consistencies of feces, from solid to the runs.
