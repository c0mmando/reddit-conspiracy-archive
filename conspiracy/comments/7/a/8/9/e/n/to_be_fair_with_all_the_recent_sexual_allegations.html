<blockquote>
<p>Testimony in a prior court case indicated that Trump flew at least once on one of the planes Epstein owned and Trump’s phone numbers were in Epstein’s personal phone directory.</p>

<p>Trump has also indicated publicly he knew of Epstein’s interest in “younger” women, although he never suggested the financier crossed any legal lines. “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,’’ Trump told New York Magazine back in 2002. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why they didn&#39;t bring this up during the election. Epstein implicates both Clinton and trump. That would be a shit show that exposes candidates as puppets and sex offenders. Bad idea if you&#39;re TPTB trying to manage a phony election between two preselected puppets...so they kept it hush hush.</p>

<p>Now the only mention of Epstein in this sub is in relation to Bill Clinton. Trumps connection is ignored entirely, and it comes off as sort of hypocritical to me, even if Bill Clinton supposedly went to the island a few more times than trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nailed it. But trump is the one currently in power, right? </p>

<p>If we exposed the sitting president as having a close relationship with a convicted pedophile, that takes all the air out of the sails of the trump distraction, and it unifies us ALL against him because he&#39;s a pedo and a puppet. </p>

<p>Now, I know the dude is just a puppet, but this is an opportunity to get everyone on the same page. Pedophiilia and sexual abuse knows no party boundaries and everybody finds it equally fucked up. We all agree on that. </p>

<p>I think TPTB know this is their Achilles heel, and they are trying to stifle anybody pointing out the trump/Epstein connection. They exploit our weaknesses, why can&#39;t we exploit theirs? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree it may unify all of us on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  However, as much as I dislike Trump, I&#39;ve never seen an election cycle and media coverage like this last one.  The media was out to get him from day one.  It&#39;s terrifying.  The PC reminds me of the Bush years.</p>

<p>I was in Texas at the time when we invaded Iraq.  It was the first time in my life I was afraid to speak out politically (was in college at the time).  Now it&#39;s like it has swung the complete opposite.  I&#39;m very glad people are speaking out, however at the same time it seems like a lot of it is for an agenda, not the truth, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>When I saw he picked Pence, I knew someone got to him.  I personally believe the plan is to impeach Trump and get Pence in there.  Because no one would ever elect Pence.  He&#39;s like Dick Cheney.</p>

<p>All these people thinking Hillary would have been better either are forgetting the Clinton years or were not around then.  We got handed two evils of lessors as usual.  I personally think we&#39;d be at WW3 if Hillary won, but I don&#39;t like the direction Drumph is going with Korea.  It&#39;s a lose - lose for the American people as usual.  They divide us so we fight among ourselves, then rob us blind as we bicker over their created &quot;issue&quot;.</p>

<p>Sorry for the long post....I think you mean well in wanting to keep checks and balances on whoever is in power no matter the party, which I completely agree with.  We need to point out all the issues no matter the party.  I can&#39;t think of a President since I&#39;ve been alive that wasn&#39;t a POS.  Maybe Jimmy Carter, but he was slightly before my time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been through a lot of political cycles and never have seen anything like it.  I&#39;m not saying I agree with the guy at all, it&#39;s just the coverage was very skewed towards Hillary.  It was very different from the last 30 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying he isn&#39;t hand picked.  What I&#39;m saying is they changed  how it&#39;s covered.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree completely.  They are getting more and more sophisticated with their methods. I&#39;ll admit they had me fooled for a bit, but now it&#39;s quite obvious Trump was compromised, if not totally a plant from the beginning.  He reminds me a lot of W.  </p>

<p>Regarding their social engineers, it&#39;s scary how much they&#39;ve progressed, especially in the video methods.  Have you seen that video with the man talking and it translating to the video with the president talking, saying the words as the man?  It&#39;s very creepy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Former President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender’s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the “Lolita Express” -- even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com.</p>

<p>Clinton’s presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein’s Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including “Tatiana.” The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.</p>

<p>“Bill Clinton … associated with a man like Jeffrey Epstein, who everyone in New York, certainly within his inner circles, knew was a pedophile,” said Conchita Sarnoff, of the Washington, D.C. based non-profit Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking, and author of a book on the Epstein case called &quot;TrafficKing.&quot; “Why would a former president associate with a man like that?”</p>

<p>epsteinislandExpand / Contract
Epstein owns the entire 72-acre island. (Google Earth)
Epstein, who counts among his pals royal figures, heads of state, celebrities and fellow billionaires, spent 13 months in prison and home detention for solicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution. He allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on “Orgy Island,” an estate on Epstein&#39;s 72-acre island, called Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>

<p>Virginia Roberts, 32, who claims she was pimped out by Epstein at age 15, has previously claimed she saw Clinton at Epstein’s getaway in 2002, but logs do not show Clinton aboard any flights to St. Thomas, the nearest airport capable of accommodating Epstein&#39;s plane. They do show Clinton flying aboard Epstein’s plane to such destinations as Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, China, Brunei, London, New York, the Azores, Belgium, Norway, Russia and Africa.</p>

<p>Among those regularly traveling with Clinton were Epstein’s associates, New York socialite Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein’s assistant, Sarah Kellen, both of whom were investigated by the FBI and Palm Beach Police for recruiting girls for Epstein and his friends.</p>

<p>flightlogpic1Expand / Contract
The flight logs are required to be filed with the Federal Aviation Administration.
Official flight logs filed with the Federal Aviation Administration show Clinton traveled on some of the trips with as many as 10 U.S. Secret Service agents. However, on a five-leg Asia trip between May 22 and May 25, 2002, not a single Secret Service agent is listed. The U.S. Secret Service has declined to answer multiple Freedom of Information Act requests filed by FoxNews.com seeking information on these trips. Clinton would have been required to file a form to dismiss the agent detail, a former Secret Service agent told FoxNews.com.</p>

<p>In response to a separate FOIA request from FoxNews.com, the U.S. Secret Service said it has no records showing agents were ever on the island with Clinton.</p>

<p>A Clinton spokesperson did not return emails requesting comment about the former president’s relationship and travels with Epstein. The Clinton Library said it had no relevant information and does not keep track of Clinton’s travel records.</p>

<p>Martin Weinberg, Epstein’s current attorney, did not respond to multiple inquiries. Epstein said in a court filing said that he and his associates “have been the subject of the most outlandish and offensive attacks, allegations, and plain inventions.”</p>

Epstein&#39;s Boeing 727 was known as the &quot;Lolita Express.&quot; (John Coates, airport-data.com)
However, hundreds of pages of court records, including reports from police and FBI agents, reviewed by FoxNews.com, show Epstein was under law enforcement scrutiny for more than a year.</p>

<p>Police in Palm Beach, Fla., launched a year-long investigation in 2005 into Epstein after parents of a 14-year-old girl said their daughter was sexually abused by him. Police interviewed dozens of witnesses, confiscated his trash, performed surveillance and searched his Palm Beach mansion, ultimately identifying 20 girls between the ages of 14 and 17 who they said were sexually abused by Epstein.</p>

<p>In 2006, at the request of Palm Beach Police, the FBI launched a federal probe into allegations that Epstein and his personal assistants had “used facilities of interstate commerce to induce girls between the ages of 14 and 17 to engage in illegal sexual activities.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you found my post hostile, then I apologize, I didn’t write it with that intention. I’m not attacking you. Like I said, all of these posts implying this sub is hivemind is rather annoying. </p>

<p>Your question implied everyone on this sub thinks the same way, which is not true. </p>

<p>Lately there have been a lot of posts. </p>

<p>If you can’t put your emotions aside and have a conversation, that’s not my problem. </p>

<p>I don’t any deal, I’m telling you why wording you question the way you did is wrong. </p>

<p>And you should keep this thread clean, but I don’t understand how me wanting to discuss the topic you literally posted about is not keeping it clean. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump&#39;s not in Epstein&#39;s flight logs, is he? I&#39;ve never found any records of that, and I have looked. Can you:</p>

<p>1- Show me a link to Trump in the Epstein plane flight log?</p>

<p>2- Link to the &#39;testimony in a prior court case&#39; ?</p>

<p>Trump was in Epstein&#39;s &quot;Little Black Book,&quot; but so were a ton of people not on the flight logs. </p>

<p>In the spirit of fairness, I&#39;ll note that a boat trip from Mar-A-Lago to Orgy Island would not be difficult. But that&#39;s only speculation, which is all you&#39;ve got here, too.</p>

<p>As for that oft-cited Trump quote from New York magazine, well, it reads to me like sly praise with faint damning. And, a few years later, according to James Patterson&#39;s book about Epstein, Trump threw him out of Mar-A-Lago and told him to never come back after Epstein put the moves on a 15 year old girl who worked there.</p>

<p>If you read the book--which isn&#39;t very good and super cheesy--you&#39;ll at least learn Epstein&#39;s got a tiny, freaky cock. So even if he&#39;s got all the money in the world, he&#39;s still got a tiny, freaky cock.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nailed it. But trump is the one currently in power, right? </p>

<p>If we exposed the sitting president as having a close relationship with a convicted pedophile, that takes all the air out of the sails of the trump distraction, and it unifies us ALL against him because he&#39;s a pedo and a puppet. </p>

<p>Now, I know the dude is just a puppet, but this is an opportunity to get everyone on the same page. Pedophiilia and sexual abuse knows no party boundaries and everybody finds it equally fucked up. We all agree on that. </p>

<p>I think TPTB know this is their Achilles heel, and they are trying to stifle anybody pointing out the trump/Epstein connection. They exploit our weaknesses, why can&#39;t we exploit theirs? </p>
