       I think that nothing will happen. Don't give your conscious thought to this bullshit, in my opinion. There will be no civil war, worst case scenario some Antifa try-hards will attempt to start a riot, and likely fail. It is seriously not worth the energy to worry about, that's exactly what they want.

       i'm prepped for a long term grid down scenario.  i'm in a large city, btw.  if it were to happen i'd likely discuss the situation with my crew, come up with a rough plan of action should it last for a bit.  if it was a permanent kinda deal i'd relocate to a place where the human movement could be more controlled and channeled, get as much good soil as i could, scavenge bike parts and dc motors to generate electricity, setup as many gardens as i could, and wait it out.

       What do you mean by long term if you don't mind me asking?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would think the first thing to do would be to leave a well populated area immediately. I don't mean this as an insult, I'm genuinely curious. I think big cities would go to shit pretty much right away. City people will not be prepared at all, even if you are prepared the majority of your neighbors aren't.

       i think you're in the majority - most people think this.  i am a contrarian.

       cities offer these advantages over everywhere else:  vertical space.  the ability to funnel human (or otherwise) traffic, by blocking roads, etc.  same thing exists within buildings themselves.  access to goods for scavenging.  existing infrastructure particularly water supply and sewage.  access to people to aid you.  ability to hide.  ability to not be seen from air.
      </p>
      <p>
       no other environment even comes close.  if you're confident in your ability to feed yourself (i am - i could grow what i needed, and i have expertise around me in terms of foraging, plant identification, etc.) then cities are a better choice.

       There are definitely pros and cons to both I just personally think you would need more luck on your side in a city. With that being said, having people you can trust would play a huge part in terms of success but "other people" is also my biggest fear. We are pretty much opposite sides of the spectrum here. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       I am confident in my ability to feed myself and my family as we already have a huge garden, keep our seeds and I do some canning so we at least have experience in that. We are already the type of people who fix things (for the most part) ourselves. I think if you could survive the initial first few months in a rural area a person would be more in the clear than if they were in the city.

       Have you read the story of the man who was trapped in a smallish (under 10,000 I think it was) town for a year in Bosnia during the war? Pretty interesting, about what you think it would be but is good to read it from someone who lived it.

       yeah i hear you.  if you have a link to that Bosnian story i'd be appreciative.
      </p>
      <p>
       in general i'd agree with you, but here's my concern about the rural areas.  i'm in Canada so i can only speak to that.  from my research, driving across the country, it's become evident to me that there's a defensive plan that's been constructed to support people in rural areas should an event take place.  the road routes, how they are built, how few routes lead to other places, locations of military facilities, etc. - this has been designed to shut off traffic and human movement to certain rural areas.  North Bay Ontario, in particular, has these designs all around it.  i reckon this is where the COG plans are supposed to be manifested (much like Denver is a COG center in the US mainland).  that means should something happen and people all migrate out to the rural places that they'll be under the thumb of whomever is managing those military resources.  from the frying pan into the fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       there will likely be loads of people trying to leave the city after an event.  this will just ratchet up the COG plans/levers.  options will be limited.
      </p>
      <p>
       personally, i can only go with what i trust and know.  going into someone else's terrain, where they have formed it for particular uses, is a hometown advantage i won't have, with limited support, limited means and limited knowledge.

       The government/military is right up there with "other people" for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And oh yeah, I don't particularly want a bunch of people from the cities flooding out into rural areas. I have wondered where they think they will go. It's not like farmers/county folks/mountain men are just going to let them settle on their land. Really I don't think there is a great answer for any scenario.

       Just sayin. I only recently moved to Dallas and everyone here is fucked if they get EMPd. But they're also equally fucked if it's raining so I guess I'm just against big cities and their inability to exist even barely outside the realm of their normal lives.

       I live in the woods away from people anyways and would love for the devices I use to distract myself to be powerless over me.

       There are definitely pros and cons to both I just personally think you would need more luck on your side in a city. With that being said, having people you can trust would play a huge part in terms of success but "other people" is also my biggest fear. We are pretty much opposite sides of the spectrum here. :)

       I am confident in my ability to feed myself and my family as we already have a huge garden, keep our seeds and I do some canning so we at least have experience in that. We are already the type of people who fix things (for the most part) ourselves. I think if you could survive the initial first few months in a rural area a person would be more in the clear than if they were in the city.

       Have you read the story of the man who was trapped in a smallish (under 10,000 I think it was) town for a year in Bosnia during the war? Pretty interesting, about what you think it would be but is good to read it from someone who lived it.
