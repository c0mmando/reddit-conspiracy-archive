       As the title states, Georgo Soros donated 80% of his wealth to  Open Society Foundations.  The news broke 15 days ago. There has been an explosion of 14-day-old (and newer) accounts on this sub.  Is this a coincidence, or is there a correlation?

       I have spoken to People who think they are doing God's work by defending the DNC on this Sub. I questioned one about it and they said that Russia infiltrated Reddit and this was one of Reddit's biggest subreddit so it was important that they "Stop the flow of Misinformation". I tried to reason with them and tell them that this Sub was irrelevant and had no impact on the election and that they should do something more productive but they wouldn't listen.

       "Psychopathy has been associated with amorality—an absence of, indifference towards, or disregard for moral beliefs. There are few firm data on patterns of moral judgment. Studies of developmental level (sophistication) of moral reasoning found all possible results—lower, higher or the same as non-psychopaths. Studies that compared judgments of personal moral transgressions versus judgments of breaking conventional rules or laws found that psychopaths rated them as equally severe, whereas non-psychopaths rated the rule-breaking as less severe."

       It does go both ways, it's funny people who support Trump but can't fathom the idea a guy born with a silver spoon in his mouth, who's spoken highly of Epstein (even visited his island), was accused by his ex wife of rape, and admits he grabs women by the pussy, might be a sexual predator.

       Stopping the flow of misinformation IS something I try to do, I don't feel it's a calling, I'm much more drawn to read the opinions I disagree with than the ones I agree with. Also I just feel bad for the people that get tricked and misled. Like that post earlier about Podesta's email about "pizza for an hour". All most people see is that quote, they don't bother with the context that shows two people trying to negotiate a time they can get together while one of them is in town.

       Probably for 5 million / year you could have a staff of 75 people posting your agenda wherever you want. Probably only need about 25 from various outfits of them posting a few hours of the day on this sub - seems like someone did make a bunch Q4 hires. Soros billions not required, though a few mil here and there probably helps.

       I think this sub's focus on Soros is retarded (he's not the only oligarch dumping money into influencing politics...), but let's not pretend it costs billions of dollars and thousands of people to astroturf when tools exist that allow individual agents to control and coordinate multiple sock puppets simultaneously and efficiently. The Intercept
       <a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/">
        has talked about
       </a>
       the astroturfing capability of the UK's GCHQ, and there's no reason to think our own intelligence agencies are uninvolved in similar programs.

       George Soros has been conclusively proven to fund
       <a href="http://www.larouchepub.com/pr/2017/Xproof%20Nazis%20in%20Ukraine.pdf">
        Nazis
       </a>
       in Ukraine (he's Jewish by the way, if it's possible to make that
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       morally reprehensible).
      </p>
      <p>
       Three years ago this week, a Molotov-cocktail-throwing mob on the streets of Kiev occupied government  buildings,  perpetrating  violence  and  driving  the duly elected president of the nation out of office and out of the country. The leading groups in the mob were waving portraits of Stepan Bandera, Adolf Hitler’s col-
laborator in Ukraine during World War II...
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama’s direct agent for the coup, Assistant Secretary of State 
for  European  and  Eurasian  Affairs,  Victoria  Nuland, visited the rioters several times, handing out cookies on the Maidan, while refusing to acknowledge that in addition to peaceful demonstrators concerned about corruption and economic hardships, there were also openly neo-fascist  gangs  conducting  an  armed  insurrection
       <br/>
       against the elected government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nuland was also caught by a phone tap instructing the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine on precisely who was to be made Prime Minister in the new government, after the President was toppled."
      </p>
      <p>
       Soros is an extension of the US State Department, and a long-proven deep state actor, subverting elected governments and installing tyrants. I'm not sure why you think he's incapable of paying internet shills when we know he donated money to groups that paid internet shills during the last election.

       Redditor for 21 days. I just glanced at your post history and noticed your 2 most recent posts are within 3 minutes of each other, the latter post being a literal wall of text regarding political correctnes and culutral marxism.

       He exists. But so do the Koch brothers and other billiaonire political donors. But Soros is liberal, and as we all know, liberalism is the source of all evil on the planet. So he's like a wizard of evil. On top of that, his name is Soros. It's gotta move evil ring to it.  Like a dark wizard from Lord of the rings.

       Funnily enough you don’t seem to suffer that here. It’s almost as if one sub encourages users with different opinions, whilst the other is a teeny bit biased.

       Sure there’s a lot of shilling for Hillary (bizarrely)/ Soros/ big corps/ MSM/ etc, but at least everyone gets to have their say. The questionable “users” stick out like a sore thumb to the regulars, who tend to find the outrage amusing.

       Oh youre a jesus guy? That's weird. Jesus wasn't really cool with grabbing people by the pussy. He also thinks cutting programs for poor people in order to give tax cuts to the flight rich is pretty super lame. Might want to reconsider your relationship with Jesus, the loving liberal hippie.

       Nope...I believe in one God and pantheism below.  You wouldn't believe what life can be like when you open yourself to God.  Humans don't realize what they ARE, and it's pretty funny to watch.  Hope you learn to have a sense of humor about yourself.  People think the final judgment will be harrowing...but I'm siding more on the embarrassing side.  Nothing beats a good laugh.  Toodles.

       You make a good point about the Koch brothers, who have a [private intelligence agency](
       <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/the-koch-brothers-intelligence-agency-215943):">
        www.politico.com/story/2015/11/the-koch-brothers-intelligence-agency-215943):
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "The operation, which is little-known even within the Koch network, gathers what Koch insiders refer to as “competitive intelligence” that is used to try to thwart liberal groups and activists, and to identify potential threats to the expansive network.
      </p>
      <p>
       The competitive intelligence team has a staff of 25, including one former CIA analyst, and operates from one of the non-descript Koch network offices clustered near the Courthouse metro stop in suburban Arlington, Va. It has provided network officials with documents detailing confidential voter-mobilization plans by major Democrat-aligned groups. It also sends regular “intelligence briefing” emails tracking the canvassing, phone-banking and voter-registration efforts of labor unions, environmental groups and their allies, according to documents reviewed by POLITICO and interviews with a half-dozen sources with knowledge of the group."

       People pay attention to Soros because he does things like
       <a href="http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/2017/eirv44n08-20170224/04-21_4408.pdf">
        overthrow
       </a>
       elected governments and replace them with Nazis, and he's been doing it for several decades. He is quite literally an extension of the US State Department, which works heavily with the CIA to pull off coups.

       I don't get why people get shit for having relatively new accounts, especially on this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been around here for years, but delete/change accounts often so I don't accidentally dox myself or have an extensive profile built on me. There are lots of paranoid people here.

       Yeah it's incredibly useful you point that out, because you can even see "
       <a href="https://snoopsnoo.com/u/shassamyak">
        activity by time of day

       <em>

       , so some (like myself) enjoy not having a huge profile with tons of personal info (although I do have a 5+ yo account to post with when I need "credibility").

       I don't think the issue is new members.  The point I am trying to highlight is when there is an abnormal amount of new members added at once, or within a few days of one another.

       Furthermore, I simply posed a question.  I thought it was interesting because this has been something I started noticing yesterday,  and I wanted to see if anyone else has noticed the same phenomenon.

       It's because the less sophisticated shilling outfits would hire a bunch of college students at minimum wage and wouldn't even bother spending the money to buy up old reddit accounts, so they were forced to create brand new accounts en masse, leading to noticeable "batches" of accounts all saying the same things.

       That doesn't mean shit because I've seen posts from T_D compiling massive amounts of evidence from other subreddits clearly showcasing the breaking of reddit rules, showcasing the call for violence and murder as well as other things, JUST as other subreddits have documented them doing.

       It's not a one way street. Reddit is fucking retarded with their "REEEEE why isn't T_D banned!".

       Hello, I’m actually the user who compiled that evidence and i didn’t start out meaning to target one side. In fact I found one instance of copying behavior and followed a trail of interconnected users doing the same thing. I suspect similar behavior in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       but think it’s too late for them and it would be too hard to track using the methods I used here, which were admittedly pretty simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       My methods were first to notice low effort political (more and more screenshots) posts. OP usually comments just once and does not greatly engage with other users. Go to otherdiscussions tab and notice that they are cross posting from t-d (it was always t-d) and that they copied the title almost word for word, and furthermore, copied a high level comment from one of the users. Then go to find that every post in their history is like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s possible that the other side is doing something similar here but I think they’re mostly already banned or downvotes and they don’t have such sensationalist headlines as the Donald so it’s harder to spot. I was ALWAYS able to find that the OPs I listed had copied a comment. I kept finding them because they almost solely engaged with one another. At this point they’ve all gone silent. Only one is banned from here and almost no regular users of the sub had any substantial comment about the behaviors. Strange.

       You all just act like children saying, "Look at what they did! See, I have evidence!" and then they just turn around and say, "Oh yea? Well look at what YOU did.".

      <p>
       It's just pointing fingers and blame.

      <p>
       Your "evidence" is just as b.s as theirs is. You're on the same playing field.

       I have to agree and disagree here. Trump is a Republican, but the Koch brothers refused to endorse him or contribute to his campaign. 
This is one source, but there are many more easy to find.

       There was just a post made yesterday which exposed a few bots that were posting stuff straight from T_D. We have evidence of that. What we have here is conjecture based off a dubious at best premise. It's interesting that one side was able to back up their assertion with proof while the other relies on "well everyone knows" type of rhetoric

       I'm not disagreeing with you at all. I agree that a binary isn't ideal, but this sub is overrun with people spreading the alt-right talking points du jour and it seems disingenuous to pretend that isn't happening. I'm just comparing the rhetoric, use of evidence, and arguments of people claiming this place is overrun by "Bannonbots or Sorosbots" if you will. It seems as if one has a more provable argument than the other, and yet only one argument relies on things like claiming proof that they totally have but just can't show you and using statements like "everyone knows this happens" as proof that it does

       Why don't you make a post in r/shills and start finding evidence of the shills OP is claiming exist for the left. I had a long discussion recently with a mod, he says they exist and I did find one and helped get them banned.

       Well, if you're so inclined you're browsing the very subreddit he got his data from. You too could look for new accounts pushing a narrative together and come to your own conclusions. It's easy, mouse over a user name. Look at the join date, look at the post content. Consider the facts you gathered from there. No one ought to hold your hand. Used to be people would dig around for themselves to confirm, not just wait around for another flapping mouth to give them an opinion.

       This post was made yesterday, it's solid proof that content from T_D is being reposted here by bots. Do you have equivalent data for the assertion this post is making about Soros?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's incredible how the tactic of "make an assertion, pretend it's common knowledge, and then placed the burden of proof on whoever asks you to prove it" has become so common here

       So, a while back I had this weird binge of going all for the "right." It's fucking batty, but looking at it now I don't even feel like that was "me" and the memories are skewed I was just getting clean from a cocaine and LSD addiction. My comments were made by me and politically I was leaning towards the "right" and much less the "left." I now hate them both. Fuck all the "parties" that exist. Maybe I'm just crawling down the hole a bit more.

       The best conversations I've had are in the brigaded posts that never leave new/rising. They seem like actual people having a discussion.. it's actually the reason I'm only in/looking at rising right now.. mostly honest discourse, that won't get shilled until it gets enough upvotes.

       I think the "shill" pointing out is grossly over exaggerated.  Big shit happened lately, and people probably don't want to use their main accounts for it.  I've been called a shill a million times with a 6 year old 130k karma account that I shit post on all the time, just because I lean a certain way politically.

       How is linking to comments in this same sub considered doxxing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's one hell of a claim to make with no evidence. I mean if OP wanted to provide evidence, you could take screenshots and markout the usernames, still showing age of account. I mean I could claim that all sorts of things are happening with that money and provide 0 evidence and my statement be every bit as qualified as this claim.

       But all that leads to using sources like WordPress websites as an authority. My personal opinion, I don't treat mainstream media or Wikipedia as sources, unless they cite a source.. and that's what I usually link to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like there's a popular post about Twitter censoring stuff, and they linked to the source, and when I read what the source actually says.. they were targeting actual bots, but the news article was claiming it was simply targeting users based on the hash tag.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, the fact that the website cited a source is what's important, it allowed me to see for myself that they intensionally twisted the facts, and they are as much fake news as all the left leaning ones that do the same thing.

       It's not doxxing, it's a Rule 10 violation for attacking users in the community. Similar to the shill accusation rule in

       Not exactly 15 days but discussion in the thread has more sourcing of recent trends supporting OP.

      <p>
       As far as my account is concerned, I switched over from my 8+ year old main because of hostility of parties observing and brigading this sub directly targeting me.

      <p>
       *Just to add, some of the accounts attacking OP and getting disproportionate upvotes I've had previously tagged for similar activity. Similarly, accounts trying to nonpartisanly discuss the points at hand are being downvoted barely below 0, along with upvoted character attacks as responses. This was not r/conspiracy before these people started spamming this sub with fallacies and an apparent disdain for civil discourse.

       I said some pretty harsh stuff about Soros in this sub not too long ago. Most if what I said was based on his infamous 60 minutes intetview, but this subs opinion of him had some influence on what I said also. Thay being said, I gotta ask, do you honestly think anyone in this sub actually knows "the truth" about George Soros?

        That being said, I gotta ask, do you honestly think anyone in this sub actually knows "the truth" about George Soros?

       Besides the people that are being paid to hang out here, almost everyone at least knows Soros is a billionaire and a bad guy, and most will know that he funds political agitators.

       I only joined a few dats or so after the Vegas shooting, it immediately seemed strange to me and after googling Vegas conspiracy I was delighted to see others felt the same... That said, about 2-3 weeks after I noticed the content on the conspiracy page had changed, posts were more negative towards the op or anyone who joined to add information.. people were no longer working together and being constructive with the facts. something has changed for sure... seems like Reddit has been compromised.. what a shame!

       Reddit was compromised way before LV. You just didn't notice because more real people flooded Conspiracy following a huge, relevant event like that. Weeks later, and there aren't enough real users to dilute the shills.

       I have a 2 week old account but that’s because I don’t want to comment in this subreddit with my main 4 year old account. I’m sure this holds true for others (maybe not all) and the increase may coincide with the Vegas shooting. I’ve been lurking since election time last year but haven’t really had much to say.. I still have little to say but if the opportunity arises, I have an alt.

       No, I am not “scared”. I only comment in small subs on my main account though and people on reddit are weird about checking other people’s histories so I’d just rather keep them separate.

       Soros/liberal/SJW shills are the worst to argue with on Reddit. Totally transparent.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you encounter a redditor who keeps saying “OK comrade” and “10 rubles have been deposited into your account”, or accuses you of being from stormfront simply because you didn’t agree with them, mark them as a Soros shill.

       For me, it's sad but true that young conservatives seem to have taken the mantle of good, edgy satire from liberals, who seem content to spend their time congratulating each other or repeating the same tired jokes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberals still have some funny shit, but I find myself much more delighted by conservative humor these days, even though I frequently find the actual message somewhere in between cringeworthy and anger-inducing. But then, that's the goal, right?

        bankrolling
       </a>
       the whole debacle:
      </p>
      <p>
       George Soros told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria over the weekend he is responsible for establishing a foundation in Ukraine that ultimately contributed to the overthrow of the country’s elected leader and the installation of a junta handpicked by the State Department.
      </p>
      <p>
       “First on Ukraine, one of the things that many people recognized about you was that you during the revolutions of 1989 funded a lot of dissident activities, civil society groups in eastern Europe and Poland, the Czech Republic. Are you doing similar things in Ukraine?” Zakaria asked Soros.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Well, I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent of Russia. And the foundation has been functioning ever since and played an important part in events now,” Soros responded
      </p>
      <p>
       It is well-known, although forbidden for the establishment media to mention, that Soros worked closely with USAID, the National Endowment for Democracy (now doing work formerly assigned to the CIA), the International Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the Freedom House, and the Albert Einstein Institute to initiate a series of color revolutions in Eastern Europe and Central Asia following the engineered collapse of the Soviet Union.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Many of the participants in Kiev’s ‘EuroMaidan’ demonstrations were members of Soros-funded NGOs and/or were trained by the same NGOs in the many workshops and conferences sponsored by Soros’ International Renaissance Foundation (IRF), and his various Open Society institutes and foundations. The IRF, founded and funded by Soros, boasts that it has given ‘more than any other donor organization’ to ‘democratic transformation’ of Ukraine,” writes William F. Jasper."

       That's fine though. They astroturfed the living fuck out of reddit in Hillary's favor and Trump still won. If they want to waste their miserable lives and his money on downvoting and shilling, that's fine. I hope they bleed the beast of everything he has. It doesn't work anyway.

       It's laundering it and hiding it from any potential lawsuits or criminal confiscations. You still have full access to your money but it's no longer under your name per sae.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is such a goddamn scam and it's done as a tax shelter to skirt laws and investigations as well.

       I have noticed within the past couple of days that I have been having very strange arguments with users in the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Arguments about partisan politics where it seems they are trying to spin me around and waste my time or frustrate me. Conversations where it seems like they have no point to make.

       This account isn't that old but it just had a birthday! I have always lurked around r/conspiracy though, mainly for alien related stuff. I pretty much only lurk around now even with an account lol. Most of the time I feel people already have said what I am thinking or I just don't have much to contribute. I miss the ufo stuff and all the paranormal X-Files stuff. I miss being able to go to a subreddit that didn't have anything going on related to the main stream media. I posted once about Mel's hole sorta recently. That's the shit I miss. I wonder how much new paranormal news this sub has missed because of the constant other bullshit.
