       "Mr. Christensen, 65, noted that despite assurances by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that uranium could not leave the country without Uranium One or ARMZ obtaining an export license — which they do not have — yellowcake from his property was routinely packed into drums and trucked off to a processing plant in Canada."

       Thanks for the link. I wasn't aware that the US and Russia had been trading enriched fuel for raw uranium for years. It seems to me like the story would probably gain more traction if you didn't hyperbolically frame it as a national security risk.

       I didn't frame anything, it's a direct quote from the article as a response to your question.
       <br/>
       Uranium was illegally exported to Canada. There was an incident related to it, several barrels were opened too fast and they exploded, contaminating the workers. About a quarter of the refined yellowcake was exported overseas.

       You just nailed why the whole 'scandal' is largely fake news. Even the Canadian mines aren't allowed to export without US permission. It's heavy right-wing propaganda mostly coming from Fox as a distraction. The entire government signed off on the deal.

       These mining companies are global its more about controlling the contracts to mine in other countries. It doesn't have to be about actual mines on US soil its about control of the majority of production globally.

       Then this is the argument you should be making. The uranium itself isn't the problem, it's the potential influence in a global market. Do you agree?

       I agree but the media frames how its all portrayed. Here is a

        NYT

       article on it. Notice how it talks about Clinton in the headline that instantly frames the whole story instantly making up people mind for them. Take the Kevin Spacey thing as an example of the same thing many initial headlines were along the lines of "Kevin Spacey decides to live life as a gay man" that wasn't even the story to begin with.

       Dude what? The guy you're talking to isn't in charge of any of the newspapers spinning these narratives, so wtf do you want from him? Regardless, Russia attempting to increase its global share of the uranium industry is
       <em>
        part
       </em>
       of why people are upset. There was a global conspiracy of blackmail and kickbacks and shit on the part of the Russians, which the FBI knew about, but the key informant was prevented from speaking to Congress by Obama's DOJ. With this as the back drop, Bill Clinton sought meetings with two officials associated with Rosatom (his aide asked the State Dept if it was okay, no response), only to then meet with Vladimir Putin
       <em>
        personally
       </em>
       at his
       <em>
        home
       </em>
       . On the same trip, he was coincidentally paid 500k for a speech by Renaissance Capital, a Russian bank directly invested in the U1 deal. That's on top of all the Clinton Foundation donations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who isn't blinded by partisanship should see how this smells, but alas. Trump is talking about it, so to liberal media and its followers it's all fake news. Trump might be capitalizing on it politically, but it's ridiculous to pretend these things didn't happen, and it makes me all the angrier watching news outlets ask things like "Well who got the money for the deal? Uranium One? No problem then!" while ignoring stuff like Bill's speech and attempt to meet with Rosatom officials. Especially when allegedly the Russians were throwing around bribes and kickbacks like candy specifically to make deals like this happen!
      </p>
      <p>
       The media also focuses on the State Dept being only one entity in control of the decision, but they ignore how it looks in context with Obama's DOJ gagging that informant. Like, why are we to believe these other agencies are totally and completely politically independent from the rest of his administration when his DOJ is acting in that way? It's ridiculous that these handwaving explanations are sufficient for the
       <a href="/r/politics">

        Anyone who isn't blinded by partisanship should see how this smells, but alas. Trump is talking about it, so to liberal media and its followers it's all fake news. Trump might be capitalizing on it politically, but it's ridiculous to pretend these things didn't happen, and it makes me all the angrier watching news outlets ask things like "Well who got the money for the deal? Uranium One? No problem then!" while ignoring stuff like Bill's speech and attempt to meet with Rosatom officials. Especially when allegedly the Russians were throwing around bribes and kickbacks like candy specifically to make deals like this happen!
       </p>
       <p>
        The media also focuses on the State Dept being only one entity in control of the decision, but they ignore how it looks in context with Obama's DOJ gagging that informant. Like, why are we to believe these other agencies are totally and completely politically independent from the rest of his administration when his DOJ is acting in that way? It's ridiculous that these handwaving explanations are sufficient for the

       Bill met with people? Russians gave money to the Clinton Foundation? I know many of you think the CF is nothing more than a slush fund for the Clintons, but it actually does a tremendous amount of good around the world. You're connecting dots between the donations and U1, but is there any hard evidence? With the Trump/Russia investigation, for example, we literally have emails between Don Jr. and Russia about a desire to collude. Is there anything like that in this case?
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, like you said, Hillary was only one vote out of nine who approved the deal along with additional regulators who signed off on it. And Obama, not a huge fan of Putin, could have vetoed the whole thing. To say that Hillary somehow convinced every single one of them to sign off on it, isn't even attempting to connect dots, it's just heading straight towards Clinton murder list territory.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also doesn't help when many of it's high profile supporters say stuff like "20% of our Uranium (lie) was sold by Hillary Clinton (also lie)."

       Your reduction of Bill's activities here is a gross misrepresentation of what actually happened. It's not "Bill met with people," it's "Bill sought a meeting with two Rosatom officials and, failing that, met with Putin personally." Keep in mind Jill Stein faced accusations of treason from liberal media for sitting at a table with him, briefly.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not "Russians gave money to the Clinton Foundation," (well, they did) it's "Bill Clinton, after seeking to meet Rosatom officials and after his meeting with Putin, on the same trip, received a 500k payment for a speech from a bank invested in the U1 deal." You're glossing over that and focusing on the "debunkable" data point of the CF donations (honestly tho you're pretty much just saying "there's no explicit statement indicating these are quid quo pro so they must not be"), just like the liberal media has been doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and it's not all of this happening in a vacuum, these things happened while this global bribery/kickback scheme went on. It doesn't take a stretch to connect these dots.

       Trump's sloppy criminality is not evidence that Hillary et al didn't break the law, dude. One of these groups is smart enough not to state "Hey thanks for the kickback money! &lt;3 xoxo PutiePie" in an email (...or is smart enough to have an underling delete all evidence...) and the other isn't.

       Anyway, I'm not going to keep arguing with you if you've already chosen what you want to believe, but ignoring/misrepresenting the things I've mentioned is just as bad as ignoring the Don Jr/Papodopolous emails.

       You didn't address the most significant problem with the whole story - Hillary through bribes, or threats, or sheer willpower somehow managing to get numerous people, including the POTUS, to go along with a terrible deal.

       1) I've never claimed that Hillary was somehow The Mastermind behind this entire plan, stop using shitty strawmen to deflect
      </p>
      <p>
       2) I've never said "this was a terrible deal," I've only
       <em>
        stated
       </em>
       <strong>
        <em>
         factual information

       </strong>
       regarding Bill Clinton and his interest in relevant parties and his
       <em>
        financial gain
       </em>
       from relevant parties. I guess you could
       <em>
        infer on your own
       </em>
       that it's a "terrible deal" given the context of "Russia is trying to expand their global share of the uranium industry and is doing so via bribes, kickbacks and extortion."
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Speaking of defying logic and common sense, Russia can't simultaneously be a good trading partner (concerning strategic resources) as well as our mortal geopolitical foe. Not that I think it's the latter, but again it smells awfully bad to be told "There's nothing here, ignore the bribery/kickbacks and the fact that the aforementioned was kept secret..."

      <p>
       I really don't understand what is wrong with you that prevents you from going "You know what, that is suspicious, particularly in light of this FBI informant who claims to have been barred from speaking to Congress about this." All I can think of is partisan blindness. Money in politics knows no political boundary...

       What would be the point of squashing the deal. The Wyoming mines are so low quality they aren't even active right now. The US gets it's sweet green from Canada mostly. Though Wyoming does have some useful uranium processing, but that was Canadian owned anyways. At the end of the day if they rejected the deal Uranium One would have just divested the Wyoming mines since they were after that sweet Kazahk green.

       This "question" an example of someone providing strawmen/biased information/disinfo/actual fake news.

       The real question is why are they getting kickbacks and nobody is talking about it? Russia couldve bought a bag of carrots--- its about the corruption.
