    <div class="md"><p>Lol this says &quot;when you&#39;re a star&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;d suppose that trump doesn&#39;t treat normal people like this and we&#39;re starting to see what &quot;being a star&quot; entails.  </p>

<p>This is hardly admitting to rape.  It&#39;s true that it&#39;s not appropriate behavior but who is deciding?  </p>

<p>You&#39;re twisting a definition and aren&#39;t taking into consideration perspective.  </p>

<p>Only the person being groped can decide if they are raped.  You don&#39;t get to hear a crude comment and assume, for one, that it&#39;s rape , and two, that it&#39;s even true and not just boisterous chit chat about stars.  </p>

<p>Got anything else?</p>

<p>&quot;I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know I&#39;m automatically attracted to beautifulâ€”I just start kissing them. It&#39;s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don&#39;t even wait. And when you&#39;re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really understand your point here. The front page is not and has never been full of Epstein Trump connection posts. And it never will be. But it is full of Kevin Spacey and Weinstein posts. That&#39;s kind of the whole point of this post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just searched the sub and found a couple from 8-9 months ago that got a couple hundred upvotes. There&#39;s one recent one about Trumps secretary of labor. But nothing about Trump and Epstein has sniffed the front page since he became president. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do see the irony of trump literally being a hollywood star who was connected to a lot of sexual abuse cases. If the amount of people that have come out against Trump over the years would come out against (insert random hollywood star that is not Trump) today, this sub would probably hang said person from the highest tree imaginable.</p>

<p>Also a case of we don&#39;t really care about the actions just that it&#39;s the perceived &quot;enemy&quot; who is being accused so it&#39;s celebrated by the opposing side instead of having any critical thought to why it&#39;s deemed acceptable for one party over another. </p>
