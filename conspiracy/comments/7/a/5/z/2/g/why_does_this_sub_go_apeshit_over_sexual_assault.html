       Lol this says "when you're a star"
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd suppose that trump doesn't treat normal people like this and we're starting to see what "being a star" entails.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is hardly admitting to rape.  It's true that it's not appropriate behavior but who is deciding?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're twisting a definition and aren't taking into consideration perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only the person being groped can decide if they are raped.  You don't get to hear a crude comment and assume, for one, that it's rape , and two, that it's even true and not just boisterous chit chat about stars.

       Well we can all sit around looking at pieces of broken glass and claim that it's a window and then turn around and use the exact reverse logic on things that we don't want to be true.

       These aren't admission of rape you silly adolescent. You're wanting it and so you're seeing it.  The world will always work that way.

       There is no evidence of him actually doing that. For all we know he was just being douche and bragging about something he never did or wouldn't do. Lots of guys talk this way. 99% of the time they are not serious and would never do it.

       I can confirm. I've grabbed a lot of women by the pussy and they let me do it.  I'm not a star, just good looking.  For an ugly fat piece of shit like you it would be assault, that's the red pill, you're welcome.

       Haha your a fuckin loser if your feelings just got hurt over that, and thus you are likely a fat piece of shit. Woman let me grab them a lot, it's how I met my wife. Need to be good looking, rich and in shape and life opens doors brah. Red pills come first in suppositories, then it gets easier with a daily aspirin size pill.

       Why do people come in here and make these claims when there's plenty of posts just like yours? If people are submitting content on Trump's lolita express trip with Epstein and such it appears your claims are invalid.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet the whole front page could be filled with submissions linking Trump to Epstein and users like you would still be in here claiming that absolutely NO ONE in this sub somehow looks at the sexual assault allegations against him.

       Apparently that is the start and stop.  Op just wanted to ree.  The cry wolf scenario will soon be completed for Hollywood as Corey and Grace are found to be liars and wienstien a victim.  We can then laugh at sucking some dick for a part.

       Maybe if you didn't spend so much time being "concerned" you could submit actual valuable content to "balance" the place out.

       Or maybe you could just focus on actual conspiracy content instead of trying to push the political divide even further.

       I don't really understand your point here. The front page is not and has never been full of Epstein Trump connection posts. And it never will be. But it is full of Kevin Spacey and Weinstein posts. That's kind of the whole point of this post.

       I just searched the sub and found a couple from 8-9 months ago that got a couple hundred upvotes. There's one recent one about Trumps secretary of labor. But nothing about Trump and Epstein has sniffed the front page since he became president. Correct me if I'm wrong here.

       I do see the irony of trump literally being a hollywood star who was connected to a lot of sexual abuse cases. If the amount of people that have come out against Trump over the years would come out against (insert random hollywood star that is not Trump) today, this sub would probably hang said person from the highest tree imaginable.

       I think he could actually use the excuse: i abused all these women to become an expert on women abuse, and his supporters would still give him a pass. In fact it's more or less the same as he did with his tax dodging.
