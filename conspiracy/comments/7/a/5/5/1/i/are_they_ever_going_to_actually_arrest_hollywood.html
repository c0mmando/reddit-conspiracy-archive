    <div class="md"><p>There is never evidence for these accusations. Many recent accusations were supposedly done years and years prior to the accusation. It is pure he-said he-said.</p>

<p>You have to understand, that accusations have degrees of seriousness. A woman gossiping with her friend about how she got raped at a party last night and laughing about it is almost always false.</p>

<p>The woman who waits 20 years to say something, almost always false.</p>

<p>Now, the woman who actually makes a claim in a reasonable time because there is actually some trauma and pursues that claim well we do have data on that because that is about the only type of claim that data can be gathered. </p>

<p>And, that has been listed as high as 41%: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8135653">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8135653</a></p>

<p>The FBIs own stats list it as 8%. Keep in mind, many false accusations actually go to trial and the rape occurred but there is just no &quot;smoking gun&quot; like she texting her friends later talking about how she just cheated on her bf and now claims it as rape to get off.</p>

<p>So, maybe YOU need to analyze yourself and quit being so ignorant because your comment made you sound like an idiot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I for the most part agree with you, but I don&#39;t think you need to be defensive. An accusation is not a conviction, nor does it necessarily reflect the truth. We have rights to avoid being convicted in the court of public opinion. As you point out much of the evidence in these cases are &quot;he said/she said&quot; claims. I&#39;ll take the rights of the accused (and right to free speech) with both it&#39;s good and bad (though I doubt Stalin would agree). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still with having all the evidence of false accusations,  you need to treat each and every case without taking that into account.  If the facts present themselves that this is a false rape claim then great, the system did its job.  If the facts present themselves that this is in fact a true sexual assault claim, then the system did its job.  </p>

<p>Society needs to move away from this idea where we just remember what they were accused for, not if they were innocent or guilty.  That will curb false claims if the process truly works because the accuser wont feel like they can game a settlement out of the system and the person they are accusing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your statement that sexual assaults are a lot of times false but that does not mean each complaint should not be taken seriously until deemed not true.  Also when fairly prominent actors and actresses speak out, not some poor boy or girl who could benefit from a settlement, there is probably some truth to it.  Coupled with the fact that all of Hollywood new of Weinsteins behavior, I would say this is not blackmail/weapon.  </p>

<p>&quot;Sexual assault accusations are almost always false. It has turned into a balckmail / weapon used by women.&quot;</p>

<p>Although there have been many instances of this, you go down a slippery slope assuming its almost always false. Maybe in Hollywood, Pro sports and politics it can be a little skewed but what about the every day normal men and women.  Just think if this was your mother, sister or wife.  Would you want the people investigating her sexual assault to have the mindset that she is probably doing this for revenge?  So who are you to cast that doubt on anyone else.  Everyone deserves a right to equal justice and its not a true victims fault that society cannot distinguish a false claim from a true claim once a case has been presented.  </p>

<p>The women claiming the where actually assaulted have, for the most part, never gone to the police- hence no investigation or charges </p>

<p>Also, if you are a creep to a woman not connected to you through work then your only recourse is a criminal complaint- many of the women Weinstein assaulted where not employees, so they would need to make a police report- and some did and they actually got pretty close to getting an indictment</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Key section:
&quot;
What remains is a 10 year statute of limitations for child molestation.  HOWEVER,  the crime can also be prosecuted within one year of WHENEVER a victim tells the police (even past the 10 year mark).  This sounds rather contradictory, because this means that the 10 year limitation is essentially pointless, but it is the current law of the land.  The California legislature is constantly debating about this, so the law may change in the near future.   You should talk to a California attorney familiar with these cases for the most up to date information.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly the charges are not going to be pursued unless they are made far away from LA or NY where the judges/DAs are not so lenient (paid off) on celebrities.  For example Bruce Jenner undoubtedly committed vehicular manslaughter and received nothing in punishment or even real charges.  That&#39;s just one example.  Also, these harassment claims are almost always hearsay and are hard to prove in court.  Unless they were 1: filmed, 2: witnesses come forward (unlikely), or 3: they showed up that night with bruises and cum stains a criminal case is probably not possible. </p>

<p>Also, I suspect I know who the Canadian actress is. If so, it&#39;s a fairly big name. Her career is not as big now as it was in the 1990s maybe, but if I am right, it happened when she got her big start. Damn.</p>
