        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">40</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-11-01 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/MsKim.html">MsKim</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On this one month anniversary of the Vegas shooting and given the conflicting details released by the police which don&#39;t make any sense at all, I decided to put my own story together of what happened based on the details that have been released.</p>

<p>This was a gun buy set up that went bad.  The parties involved weren&#39;t some street thugs trying to sell to LA gangsters but high level government/foreign government agency people. They choose the Mandalay like most presidents/vice presidents/dignitaries do because of its ease of access to the airport (plus the secret service has every nook and cranny of the place memorized).</p>

<p>The parties didn&#39;t know/trust each other thus the need for a large number of guns for show and tell. A lone sniper would have had many fewer guns and wouldn&#39;t have had the magazines stacked in a suitcase instead of right next to the rifles he was going to use.</p>

<p>Paddock was either a really unfortunate patsy or a member of one of the parties involved. The numbers found on the note were either prices or quantities as people who make deals sometimes like to write their offers down instead of saying anything out loud. To say the numbers were sniper calculations makes no sense when said sniper uses a bumpstock.</p>

<p>The deal went sideways a little before 10pm. Whoever was in the room did the spray and pray at an armed threat standing between him and the door or at the potential threat of armed people standing outside the door as lookouts. If the problem had been one unarmed security guard he could have easily (and quietly) been taken out without anyone even knowing/hearing.</p>

<p>Realizing they just woke up the entire hotel they needed a distraction. One not so knowledgeable guy saw in a movie that if you shoot at aviation fuel tanks you will get a nice big explosion so he busted out a window and took some shots and realized you can&#39;t believe everything you see in the movies. Another guy saw that there just happened to be 20000 people across the street at an outdoor concert and what better way to draw the attention of every first responder in a 30 mile radius than automatic gun fire into a large crowd.  He fired just long enough to allow a bit of clean up (where the hard drive was popped from the laptop and the staging of a body was done) and they escaped.</p>

<p>The security guy shows up after the fact as do the police. One of the cops shoots Campos before realizing he wasn&#39;t a threat. Within a few hours the cops realized they stepped into the middle of a shit show that is orders of magnitude above their pay grade.</p>

<p>The politicians--from mayor to council people to state politicians--know that their power/income/positions come from not gutting the tourist industry so they pull together as a united front to put the public spotlight on the lone gunman theory/safety of Vegas/way the people of Vegas pulled together after the incident.</p>

<p>The narrative needs to be spun away from what really happened so the public is given a villain (Paddock) who wasn&#39;t a very good villain as everyone who knew him plus his background shows him to be an upstanding guy with no motive to be a mass shooter. He probably planned to do the deal (or in a more unfortunate circumstance just be at the hotel for some other reason) then head to the Philippines where he had previously wired money to his girlfriend to buy them a house there (a not uncommon thing to do) and chill out for a while.</p>

<p>So they give the public a hero (Campos) who wasn&#39;t a very good hero so what better way to boost his likeability/believability than put him on Ellen (everyone likes Ellen) and have Ellen basically read a provided narrative, finishing off with an announcement that Campos will never again in his life do another interview about what happened.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the police chief who is a pretty upstanding guy is probably going to take an early retirement/have a nervous breakdown since he was dragged into a bullshit cover up but what else could he do?</p>

<p>The part about someone setting up cameras on a room service cart makes zero sense since hotel staff would have come and picked up the cart at any time.</p>

<p>The part about Campos or the maintenance guy calling 911 to report shoots fired didn&#39;t happen as several of the 911 dispatchers said in public interviews they had to determine where the shots were coming from based on the many calls they received and try to estimate where the shots were coming from based on if their callers heard them near or far from their location.</p>

<p>The people who actually did this are long gone and someone staged Paddock&#39;s body (or someone&#39;s body) to take the fall for what happened (seriously if you stage a body for a suicide would you put both a hand gun next to him and a rifle on a tripod OVER his body??). Or the moulage folks did a great job for his photo op and he is actually chilling in some remote island somewhere.</p>

<p>Anyway, today is the first day of NaNoWriMo and there may be a good fiction novel in all of this since the non fiction version seems to be wholly unbelievable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Supposition. If this was a high level operation it makes sense that there would be a back up team. I am guessing that Paddock&#39;s suite was comped, and in his name, since the 25th, then the connecting room was reserved in his girlfriend&#39;s name a few days later when it came time for the operation to go down so if anyone checked, the connecting room wouldn&#39;t be linked to Paddock&#39;s name. </p>

<p>Otherwise you can believe the official story which is a super sniper old guy broke both windows for two separate shooting positions which gave him no real tactical advantage then played hopscotch over all of the rifles strewn about the floor as he shot out of both windows then for some reason decided to lock the door to the adjoining room and kill himself in the suite.</p>
