<p>There is an old 9/11 theory that came out years ago that claims the media faked the planes hitting the Towers and that digital manipulation/Holograms/CGI was used in every single video/photo there is. Crazy? I know. The Truth Movement often labels this theory as the “No Plane Theory (NPT)”. These “No-Planers” claim that CGI and/or holograms were used and that there were no planes at all that hit the Towers.</p>

<p>One of the first documentaries to promote the “No Plane Theory” is called “September Clues” and it was created by Simon Shack. Simon is not alone on his crazy beliefs. Other so called 9/11 “Truthers” that promote the No Plane Theory (NPT) are James Fetzer, Morgan Reynolds, Killtown, Ace Baker and many of their “useful idiots” on social media. </p>

<p><strong>The “No Plane Theory” is an old disinformation theory that has been used by “agents” in order to discredit the 9/11 Truth Movement. Anyone that believes in such nonsense is not for the 9/11 Truth Movement.</strong></p>

<p>I did notice the steel near the ground floor was oddly shaped, like it was cut at a 45 degree angle. Very strange, and I haven&#39;t heard a legitimate explanation as to why it happened that way.</p>
