       Sources: "They are known for purchasing "awkward" works, such as video installations, that many other private collectors will not consider. "It's easy to store them, but difficult to display them," says Podesta. To get round the problem, he and his wife have excavated a huge subterranean vault beneath their house outside Washington - a white space 5m square and 4m high in which it will be possible to show "very complicated video pieces" on all four walls."

       Makes perfect sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Breitbart accused Podesta of covering up sex slaves and then mysteriously died over a year later. Clearly Podesta had him killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta knows Alefantis who owns a pizza shop and posted a picture of a kid restrained to a table. Meanwhile a different pizza shop uses a spiral in their logo and spirals are a symbol that pedophiles used on jewelry and hand-written notes, so obviously that means Alefantis is a pedophile sex trafficker and Podesta is covering for him.

       Both Tony Podesta and James Alefantis were working on underground projects. Funny how Alefantis uses #killroom and Podesta mentions torture chamber. Funny how they're both into weird art featuring kids. Way too many coincidences for a group of regular guys.

       I know right, it's like when you take someone's comment of "#killroom" on Alefantis' photograph and say that Alefantis said it himself and then take the phrase "torture chamber" from an unrelated e-mail from John Podesta and put them in the same sentence then the whole thing really becomes clear. Plus they like weird artwork, that proves it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coincidences prove it, too, because coincidences are impossible. The more coincidences you have, the more proven it becomes. That's just math.

       No sarcasm, John Podesta sacrifices kids for the devil and is the most dangerous man in politics. He is literally Public Enemy Number One and it is very important that we stop at nothing to bring him down to save the country.

       Hey man can you answer me this in a edgy sarcastic way as well? Why is it that you cant find a Podesta defender on here who deosnt write 200 comments a day? Comments that never deviate from defending establishment democrat talking points?

       One day I wanna see an organic account with comments about sport or movies in the first 10 pages of their history pop up and say, 'Hey, paintings of toddlers in diapers being groped is ok by me!'

       George Soros bankrolls an army of Internet commenters to defend John Podesta from conspiracy theories by using blatant lies like "the pizza code was made up by 4chan" when it doesn't matter where the code came from the only thing that matters is that it's 100% undeniably true!

       I was vehemently against spirituality for most of my life, to me, it was magic, aka impossible. But the more ive learnt over the years, the more ive come to the realisation(of theory) that actual magic exists, as stupid as that may sound. Dont make the mistake of thinking purely in terms of greed...and acquisitions. Your 'soul' most definitely will be judged in one way or another. Be a source of good

       Covered up? ACORN was put out of business.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you know that Breitbart was criticizing Podesta because Podesta was defending Planned Parenthood and ACORN from another smear job. You know there were no actual child prostitutes, right? It was actors pretending they were pimps. And Breitbart knew this. Everybody knew it by the time the tweet was sent.

       I can't believe people are still talking about that.  That fucker came in dressed like what he thinks a pimp looks like and was talking about underage girls, and the worker rightfully called the police because he was scared.  If I remember right O'Keefe paid him after a lawsuit.

       Yes actually I do. This is the same guy that spirit cooks. The same guy who has portraits of infants in diapers in his house. The same guy that gets "wired" around kids. The same guy who literally has an underground chamber in his house.

       In other words, he has a basement movie theater, albeit one with four screens. One that he showed to more than one journalist and invited photographers in because it was such a secret. And when people read about it in these articles, they marched on Washington and wrote letters to the editors, demanding ... Oh, no wait, they didn't do anything. Because there's nothing at all suspicious about having a movie theater.

       And it's actually a picture of a little kid being groped around the groin with a diaper or a number of panties on. I don't know about your household are preferences, but if a friend of mine had that hung up in his house I'd get major creeper vibes. Here's the pic.

       Well, back in 1996 and 1997, there was
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/mqcK1">
        Spirit Cooking — etchings collected in a limited edition book
       </a>
       (from

       . Originally in Ghent, Belgium, but the video is from Italy.

       Obviously she named the Spirit Cooking dinner after that work. But if people paid $10,000 expecting dinner and they show up only to be handed buckets of blood to paint on the walls, they're going to want their money back.

       Question: why would businessmen and politicians go to a dinner hosted by this hippy weird nude artist? Whats so special about her that they went?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because usually when a politician hangs out with naked girls its a scandal
      </p>
      <p>
       So whats her deal? Eho tf is she that leaders of the democrat party go and eat (probably aweful) food?

       Marina Abramovic is an artist. I studied her work in school, as did many others. She's not a spooky occultist, she's a highly respected performance artist. Satanic Panic is not a good look for you in the 21st century my man.

       You studied her work in school. Many of us studied her work on our own and came to the conclusion that what she does indicates a deeply disturbed mindset hiding under the veil of harmless nihilism. Not that she's proven to be guilty of anything, but with all the apparent shadiness these people are involved in...there should absolutely be some sort of investigation.

       So were you. I heard about her from a friend who was in art school a few years ago and thought it was interesting, but didn't get the hype. I didn't think there was anything necessarily wrong with it. Until I read the Podesta emails last year and took a second look.

       It's such nonsense to base the value of one's studies on a subject on whether or not they were in school when they did their research.

       What specifically do you have a problem with in the video aside from the fact that some (likely fake) bodily fluids are depicted? Do you know what symbolism is? Do you know what performance art is? You have a very simple-minded view of the art world. Hint: sometimes people are intentionally shocking. That doesn't make the devil real. Sorcery isn't an actual thing. Harry Potter is fiction.

       Right, I mean I have been to the Metropolitan Museum of Art maybr 30-40 times and I have to say, the oil/acrylic ratio to jizz/blood is shockingly out of place.

       Nowadays literally shit and urine on a canvas can be called art. Forgive me for failing to appreciate such fine art but somethings you just gotta call out for what they are.

       Some art is meant to provoke and push boundaries. Back  when I first moved to New York there was a show called Shock (or something similar) that featured a photo of a crucifix soaking in the artist's urine. A lot of people were outraged. But we are lucky to live in a free society where people can express themselves in outrageous ways. And you're free to ignore it if you don't like it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marina is an interesting artist with a long career; she once did a show at MoMa where she sat in a chair and visitors sat in another chair opposite her. They simply looked at each other. There's a photo book of this piece; it's interesting to see the range of reactions produced by this simple concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I don't respond to this Spirit Cooking piece so much, but if she wants to paint with blood and jizz, what's the big deal?

       He has a massive art collection containing hundreds of different pieces of all different sorts, a few of which people like you like to single out and put in albums without any context of how large the collection is. You make it seem like his whole collection is weird creepy shit, when in really it's a very small percentage. His collection is publicly viewable and has been featured in magazine articles. But you probably didn't know that, and have never bothered to look at how whole collection.

       That email is nonsense. People refer to their work as torture every single day. If that's the extent of your evidence, that's pretty pathetic.

       The Washington Post has removed an article in which Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s “art” collection was revealed to contain pictures of naked teenagers. The 2004 article, archived online, includes comments from former Clinton administration official Sally Katzen in which she discusses the “awkwardness” of being at the Podesta’s home. “At political events, there’s an inevitable awkwardness,” Katzen said. The article’s author goes on to mention the disturbing specifics of the Podestas’ taste in “art.” “Folks attending a house tour in the Lake Barcroft neighborhood in Falls Church earlier this year got an eyeful when they walked into a bedroom at the Podesta residence hung with multiple color pictures by Katy Grannan, a photographer known for documentary-style pictures of naked teenagers in their parents’ suburban homes.”

       So by the way, if he does have a IRL torture chamber, it would not be this room.  What he'd do is make this "art room" and then never ever use it for real crime.  It becomes an alibi of sorts.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, that doesn't mean his joking language and the room aren't part of cover for more nefarious events.  Because, if he was engaging in them, they would be.

       To be honest, Podesta isn't very intelligent. Especially when it comes to computer technology. The guy is almost 70. His gmail was hacked by a simple phishing link. I wouldn't be surprised if they were cocky enough to email about this kind of shit.

       The man is computer illiterate, like most old people, for sure. But I bet they have been doing nearly as many toddler gang-rapes and blood sacrifices since Pizzagate dropped about a year ago. Like I said, they're probably laying low.

       Seems that plenty of journalists want to go down in history as the one who broke the story on how many scoops of ice cream the President takes.  I think asking these questions would only hurt their career because of who they would be asking them of, not the content of the question...

       So, just to be clear, Podesta uses a complex system of food based code words with his pedophile peers to describe how he molests kids. But "Still in torture chamber. Another question. Do you two wanna have feb 14 valentines day dinner", literally means he is in a torture chamber, but he's thinking about Valentine's dinner?

       Just playing devil's advocate here: could it not be that "torture chamber" was just slang for a place they'd rather not be? 
most likely not the case tho hah

       I don't understand why people feel so entitled to know everything and/or indignant when they're not informed? We complain about the MSM doling out bullshit stories yet complain when we're not reading shit on the frontpage or hearing it on the 6 o'clock news.

       GUYS, SOME PEOPLE CALL WORK TORTURE!  DID YOU KNOW?  BECAUSE LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE IN THIS THREAD ARE SAYING IT ALSO, NO BIG, COMPLETELY NORMAL HUMAN TALK.

       On a completely unrelated normal human talk matter, anybody seen a pizza-related map handkerchief laying around?  That is also a phrase practically everyone has used in everyday correspondence, by the way.  You know what, nevermind.

       Torture Chamber in English can mean being at or doing work that is unpleasant, having to deal with a very unpleasant/terrible person, or doing repetitive boring tasks.

       The Washington Post has removed an article in which Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s “art” collection was revealed to contain pictures of naked teenagers. The 2004 article, archived online, includes comments from former Clinton administration official Sally Katzen in which she discusses the “awkwardness” of being at the Podesta’s home. “At political events, there’s an inevitable awkwardness,” Katzen said. The article’s author goes on to mention the disturbing specifics of the Podestas’ taste in “art.” “Folks attending a house tour in the Lake Barcroft neighborhood in Falls Church earlier this year got an eyeful when they walked into a bedroom at the Podesta residence hung with multiple color pictures by Katy Grannan, a photographer known for documentary-style pictures of naked teenagers in their parents’ suburban homes.”

       There are bigger fish to fry. All this stuff about pizzagate, etc simply obfuscates the real story which is Uranium 1, the Clinton Foundation, and Obama’s State Department. What the fuck is the story there? Plenty!! And I want to know more.
      </p>

       So if the people concentrating on making this stupid story the next “big deal” would exercise the same amount of energy on exploring the nuances of the Uranium 1 story that’d be more worthwhile.

       Damn bro. Are you really that stupid that you’re going to default to blindly accusing people that theorize conspiracies of being trump supporters? I’m far from that and it’s actually pretty funny that’s your go to accusation when you can’t win an exchange of comments. How about bringing some logical thought put to these posts ... I think people would actually take you seriously.

       George Soros bankrolls an army of Internet commenters to defend John Podesta from conspiracy theories by using blatant lies like "the pizza code was made up by 4chan" when it doesn't matter where the code came from the only thing that matters is that it's 100% undeniably true!

       I was vehemently against spirituality for most of my life, to me, it was magic, aka impossible. But the more ive learnt over the years, the more ive come to the realisation(of theory) that actual magic exists, as stupid as that may sound. Dont make the mistake of thinking purely in terms of greed...and acquisitions. Your 'soul' most definitely will be judged in one way or another. Be a source of good
