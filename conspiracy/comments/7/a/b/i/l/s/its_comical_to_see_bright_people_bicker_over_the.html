       The Democratic and Republican parties exist only to keep the nation divided. These politicians all work in unison for the same exact people and these "intellectuals" who think they know politics are simply morons in a shell who will never see the world for what it actually is. Political parties serve one purpose in this world and that is simply to

       And sorry to break it to some of you folks, but if you believe Trump is not a pawn you're sadly mistaken. The fact he's President of the United States should alone ring bells. You don't believe he got to his position because "the people" voted him there, do you?

       It's really hard to feel sorry for them but it's the only thing we can be at this point. Could you imagine even beginning to explain how the world actually functions to people from these new far Left and Right parties that have emerged? The one word that comes to mind whenever I'm scrolling through their posts is "vile." The hatred amongst these people is so prevalent you almost have to tip your hat to the Elite for being so good at what they do......

       I find it ironic that you see don't reality that woke vs. not woke is really just more of the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's us vs. them thinking that's the problem but it's deeper, it's dihcotomic approach to any issue and it's all too present in our society.  Every problem, issue, thing devolve into us vs. them, our team vs. your team, our position vs. your position, or party vs. your party, black vs. white, right vs. wrong, good vs. evil and on and on it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so common it's just silly that most people don't even realize they're doing this because it just feels correct.  I'm right and they're wrong and let me tell you why.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way out is to realize that all sides have points of view and vary rarely are things all one way and not the other.  But most people are too lazy in their thinking to do this.

       While I admit my post was rather hostile and may have seemed very "I'm right, they're wrong," I think one of the comments above better describes how I feel about the current situation. Another user brought up feeling sorry for the people mentioned and whether he was sarcastic or not it's the truth. It's almost heartbreaking to see what this society has boiled down to and the skewed thinking that's become so normalized.

       That's a continuation of the same theme tho.  Let me explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, since you didn't link to the comment you referenced, I have to guess.  I'm assuming you're referring to
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7abils/its_comical_to_see_bright_people_bicker_over_the/dp8lgrb/">
        this comment
       </a>
       because it's the other one to which you responded.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this is a particularly subtle form of this us vs. them mentality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Because feeling sorry for someone who gets emotional about national politics ignores the very real, very valid triggers for those emotions.  Elections have very real consequences for people's lives and sometimes these consequences can be quite severe.  Getting emotional isn't a bad thing, it's an indication that people care and that's actually a good thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's patronizing to feel sorry for people.  It's a way to look down on "THEM" and say or think things like "Aww that poor, fragile person getting so caught up in stuff they can't possibly control. It's really too bad. They should be more like me....above it all, woke and not affected by any of it."
      </p>
      <p>
       But all that is is more us vs. them thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       We as a species have to break out of this approach.

       So how should I perceive the emotional Antifa members when they're throwing a brick through my car window? If you were to take 50 people from r/fuckthealtright and 50 from r/altright and stuck them in a room together they would literally kill each other in ways Hollywood has never depicted. Discussion? Out of the question. "These" people are poor saps who are 100% duped by the government they would kill for.

       What you just did with that reply is a logical fallacy known as
       <a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/30/Appeal_to_Extremes">
        Appealing to Extremes
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So if one is in a situation where they're threatened with imminent and unavoidable physical harm, you deal with that in an appropriate manner.  I'm not going to sit here and list them all because they're situational....besides it's a distraction from the previous discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, saying that you can't reach a person with discussion or that discussion is pointless because the other person is so radicalized is simply not true.  There are plenty of examples throughout history of people talking people down from very radicalized positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps some of the best know are Ghandi, Martin Luther King and others who sought reform through peaceful means.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there are others like priests, teachers, administrators of schools, etc who work with inner city, poor children to help them achieve more than their environments support.  Or the guy (who just happens to be a Jew) who reached out to the grand daughter of the founder of the Westborough Baptist Church on Twitter and started a conversation which eventually lead to her and her sister leaving the church and speaking out on how it all happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       And on and on it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's so different about these people that are actually able to reach out and compel radicalized people to change their ways?  Well I think the traits are many and one of them is compassion and a lack of us vs. them dogma.

       It's not even right vs left.  It's many things in life that they were told was truth.  They think just because it's in a book makes it true.  Or now in the age of social media, if there's not an online article or video, it didn't happen.  It is psuedo-intellectualism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about all of the debates that have occurred at least in the last 20-30+ years.  We are usually presented with two options.  And if your idea doesn't fall within those two options, there's something "wrong" with you.  It plays on our pack mentality.

       Its literally called the left or the right. That tells you everything. If there is a doorway and you walk a little to the left of it you are going to walk into a wall, and if you are to the right you are going to walk right into the same wall and miss the open doorway.

       I feel like this is Conspiracy 101. If you think either side is your side then you don't belong here. I'm not in favor of excluding people, but for fuck's sake, this should be the most basic of issues when it comes to conspiracies.

       Trump is a rich man with links to those “Hollywood liberals” and millionaires/billionaires his supporters despise. They were conned. There are rumors of his deviancy just as there are for people in Hollywood. But because of loyalty they will slam everyone in Hollywood while railing against every conspiracy against Trump.
