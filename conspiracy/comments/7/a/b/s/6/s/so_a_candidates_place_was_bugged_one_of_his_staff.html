       Or you could actually read what has come out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump tower wasn't wiretapped, Manafort the person was and it was restarted after he resigned from campaign manager.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know if his staff was wearing a wire. The claim is from a former attorney that said the indictment wording "could mean he wore a wire". This is speculation that even says could, not that he did.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government didn't pay, the DNC and HC campaign did which are private entities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media isn't 95% negative. You do realize Fox News is the most popular TV news, Breitbart has practically never criticized him, The Hill released the Uranium One news, Politico, WaPo, and even CNN has been front page on this resdit last week with news debilitating to Clinton. The news is biased and divided and Trump does plenty that warrants negative coverage and that's on him.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, open your eyes.

       since you seem to trust CNN, i will use them exclusively for this first rebuttal.
      </p>
      <p>
       CNN, Sunday, March 5, 2017: "Trump's baseless wiretap claim"
      </p>
      <p>
       September 5, 2017: "Donald Trump just flat-out lied about Trump Tower wiretapping"
      </p>
      <p>
       September 18, 2017: "Exclusive: US government wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman"
      </p>
      <p>
       That about says it all. And on that last headline, it's important to note that not only was Manafort working out of Trump Tower, he was living there. So the claim, again if true, means Trump was 100% correct about being wiretapped.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is more than just "I told you so." The entire investigation into alleged Trump campaign ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election appears to center on the wiretaps of Manafort, whose consulting work included some foreign political groups, including in Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
       If CNN's report proves true, those who lied will no doubt say, "We didn't wiretap Trump; we wiretapped Manafort." But that cutesy, specious logic comes up short, both legally and ethically. In tapping Manafort, they knew they were getting Trump's many intimate conversations with him. That's how they could go to FISA and say it wasn't about Trump, but about Manafort. It was in fact a roundabout way of getting Trump in trouble, possibly even impeached.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the CNN report said, "The government snooping continued into early this year, including a period when Manafort was known to talk to President Trump."
      </p>
      <p>
       And the wiretaps were used to feed the ongoing investigation of Robert Mueller of the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russian interference in the 2016 election.
      </p>
      <p>
       This, by the way, puts a new gloss on why President Obama did nothing at all when first presented with evidence in the summer of 2016 that the Russians might be hacking our election. It was a way to take down the Democrats' biggest threat, the unpredictable Donald Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       As has been noted previously, President Obama didn't have authority on his own to request a wiretap of a U.S. citizen. That requires the Justice Department. But that doesn't mean he didn't make it happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Justice Department was then headed by Loretta Lynch — one of the most politicized Attorneys-General in U.S. history, known for repeatedly bending the truth in her public comments. So it's not a stretch to think that, with a nod and a wink, Obama encouraged Lynch to go after Trump. He had every reason to do so, given that Hillary Clinton at the time seemed to be the only hope for Obama's progressive legacy to live on.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It was the Comey-led FBI in the Lynch-led DOJ, in the Obama presidency, that reportedly used the FISA Court to obtain a warrant, quite possibly based on the phony (Russian) dossier, that has provided material to get Manafort and pressure him to find something to squeal about and catch a higher-up," wrote Thomas Lifson at the American Thinker. "The legitimacy of that warrant now is in question."
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll take that a step further. The entire Russia investigation, which was manipulated into being by Obama administration holdovers working with congressional Democrats, now appears to be a fraud. More than a year after the government began looking into the charges, no proof of any wrongdoing or crime has been produced.
      </p>

       Did you even read the articles. They had talks and arrangements were being crafted. They ended up not happening.

      <p>
       I never claimed CNN was pro trump, and I even say news has bias. The thing is all news has a bias some way. That also dosen't detract that CNN has published stories negative to Clinton. You can list all the anti-trump CNN news you want, I never accerntain re they are not biased.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also listed more than Fox News, and you can find plenty more sources posted here in this sub like New York Post and Washington Examiner that are pro-Trump. Again open your eyes instead if nitpicking something I never said and than spreading lies about the FBI paying Steele.

        Are you seriously saying the FBI shouldn't have wiretapped him because Donald kept talking to him after he left the campaign? Should any criminal be immune to wiretapping because he talks to a presidential campaign? Manafort resigned due to corruption, Trump knew he was shady.

       No one is saying that it all. It's interesting how the goalpost shifted from "There was no wiretap in Trump Tower." to "Are you seriously saying the FBI shouldn't have wiretapped him because Donald kept talking to him after he left the campaign?" tho.

       It's not different at all. Wiretapping Manafort while he was in the campaign is different than wiretapping him when he has no business connection to Trump. Just like wiretapping someone not in a business relation that lives in Trump Tower is not wiretapping Trump. Same with all his other properties. That's just Trump being dumb talking to someone who resigned over connections to a foreign government.

       Wasn't Trump's claim that Obama had him wiretapped? And isn't there still 0 proof to that and tons of things contrary to that?

       "But look at these roundabout ways Trump might've been right maybe well it's a possibility" ok lol
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you also remember the democrats not feeling threatened by Trump? They saw him as the easiest win. Why would they bother conspiring against him? If members of his campaign are under investigation why would it involve anyone other than the investigators and why would they stop investigating him?

All news is supposed to be objective not just one whole the other what is ten to twenty other major outlets use their platform for political manipulation.

       Do you know

       this is, though? It's not for the reason you think. Fox is the most watched news because it's the only right-leaning news network on TV (outside of the brand new OANN, which is only carried about one carrier I believe). Anything with a conservative slant has only
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       option for listening to people like them: Fox. The opposite is true for people with a left slant; they have almost TOO MANY options.
      </p>
      <p>
       Said differently, the viewership of the left is split among 3 or 4 major networks. There's only one on the right, so the viewership isn't split. Simple math, really.

       This is not a statement you can make. Just like I can't (and I did not) make the statement that they

       pay for it.

       We don't know what those fees were for. "Legal fees" is very very broad, and very well could have been in relation to the Dossier. Chances are they weren't, but we
       <em>
        don't know

       Though if Obama would make it so easy for his involvement to be traced back to him then he was a far more incompetent person than anyone realized. In fact, it's probably easier for the government to be involved and hide it then it is to make it so the public could actually find out.

       No I'm saying Obama's connection to Perkins Cole seems to have no connection to Fusion GPS. The point I used was how the payments were earmarked differently. My second point was how Obama has ben paying legal fees for almost a decade and no change around the dossier period.If you want another point the DNC and HC campaign paid around $12 million together to Perkins Cole for opposition research and only $1.02 million was paid to Fusion GPS for the dossier. The payment is already more then covered by those two.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's simple, besides being a client of the firm nothing else seems to imply Obama helped fund the research. In addition Perkins Cole and Fusion GPS cited the DNC and HC campaign as the funders after they took over the contract from Republicans. They did not mention Obama. With all this information I conclude while possible it is unlikely Obama played a role in the funding.

       Oh I never read that he funded it, I believe I read before that HRC Campaign did. But to me it's all the same, he had her back hard, I'm pretty sure if a Democrat had something going on in this timeframe, both of them knew about it.

       I think this is a problem many make. They group all democrats together. They try to take the SJW, antifa, Clinton and think this represents all democrats. This is not the case, just like White supremacists and the right. White Supremacists associate with the right, prominent figures calling Trump the best thing to happen to White Supremacy since Swiss cheese. But all right folk are not White Supremacists, it's just a faction. Another example to help would be. Manafort's crimes do not represent the criminology for all Republicans even with his deep dies with Roger Stone, being Trumps campaign manager, and having Trump be a client for Manaforts lobbying firm for years way back in the 1990s. Do deep connections exist? Sure, but grouping them all together is still incorrect.

       I speak this way in part because of his position, not simply because he was a Dem. But I agree no one should be lumped. But you can't say they weren't working hand in hand near the end of his presidency.

       Every president not up for election endorses their parties nominee and works to campaign for them. Bernie Sanders even endorsed Hillary and campaigned for them. Again I bring up Manafort. Decades of contact with Trump, his lobby firm was hired for years by Trump in the 1990s, owned a place in Trump Tower since 2006 and gloated to the press of being friendly with Trump. Was campaign manager(think John Podesta equivelent) to Trump for 4 months and part of the campaign almost since the start, and talked to Trump after he resigned. Does this mean Trump knew about the intricacies of Manafort?
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, the Dossier cost slightly over $1 million of the $12 million the DNC and HC campaign paid for opposition research. That would mean Obama somehow would have known that specific adventure would yield results unlike the rest.

       Manafort was bugged. Manafort is also facing 12 charges and had his attorney-client privilege busted. Trump should stop hanging with criminals if he doesn't want to get caught up in investigations against them.

       I never claimed they

        don't

       report on Trump. Though reading back, I can see how you read it that way. Bad phrasing by me. They report on what Trump does, yes.

      <p>
       What I meant by this ..
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        The media reports on some of what he does.

      <p>
       is that
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       of the media's reporting on Trump is about what he does. A large swatch of it is not, though. A lot of it is reporting on the mundane (scoops of ice cream, typos, shoes, etc), and a lot of it is talking heads giving opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though, to answer your question directly, there is a lot of stuff that goes underreported by the media. Two quick examples:
      </p>
      <p>
       The economy typically gets a small article here and there but otherwise sees very little front page or on air coverage. They instead chose to focus on ice cream (I'm being facetious, but you get the idea). Another is we still see very little coverage of the positive effect of his "for every new regulation, they must get rid of two" executive order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are two very important issues, both which have been rather positive, that see very little coverage when compared to the other issues.

       A.
You named one positive example. Not two. The economy is on the same course as it was under Obama and still largely under the same policies, so there's not really anything to report on besides "Economy under Trump still doing well due to Obama era policy".
      </p>
      <p>
       B.
The """"positive""" effect of his executive order is just speculation (i.e. wall street thinking they'll have less regulation, so stocks going up). There is no evidence whatsoever that it will have a positive effect on the 'real' economy. Frankly, it is more likely that a lot of deregulation will result in a crash similar to that caused by deregulation before the 2008 crash. Moreover, such an executive order is
       <em>
        literally doing nothing
       </em>
       . Until regulation is actually cut, one can safely characterise such an executive order as "talk big, do nothing". The volatility of the stock market means that it does react to the president doing nothing with a lot of fuss, but actual policy needs to be made in order to legitimately improve the economy.

       Regulations have been cut, because there's been new regulations. So it's done stuff. And that's a positive, at least from where I sit.

       I mean, this sort of coverage didn't start with Trump. Things like that have been covered by the media for a long time. Remember when Obama had that mustard?

        I mean, this sort of coverage didn't start with Trump. Things like that have been covered by the media for a long time. Remember when Obama had that mustard?

       Scale matters. CNN spent a day, a whole fucking day, talking almost only about the number of scoops of ice cream Trump ate. My facebook feed was that for days.

      <p>
       Content also matters. The media made the ice cream thing about Trump's character. They used it to say "See, Trump is bad!". That's a lot different than most of the coverage (though you do have a point with Quayle).

       No, I don't think that's interesting. The Trumps live in a different world than most of us. YOU might not be able to understand wearing those shoes to that area, but that's all Melania knows. It was very disingenuous reporting.

       Can you provide proof that CNN dedicated an entire day to round-the-clock exclusive coverage of Trump's ice cream habits? I find that hard to believe, and feel that it's more likely that the ice cream story was given a few minutes per hour as a report in their 24 hour news cycle.

       I never said "round-the-clock" coverage. Of course they talked about other things. But nearly every single program that day dedicated time to the story. To me, that's spending a whole fucking day on the story.

       You can argue semantics all you want, but it doesn't change the fact that the MSM made "two scoops" a major national story. It doesn't change the fact that CNN, and others, dedicated a large amount of time covering "two scoops". And you can't change the fact that it's a completely pointless story.

       Then that's just as fucking stupid. The point? As I said, scale and content matters. If Fox did it, that's fucking stupid and terrible. I don't condone that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we're not talking about one network here. Every major network covered two scoops, and nearly of them with the negative twist. Same with the shoes.

       The scale here is VASTLY different. That doesn't make what Fox did okay (it's not). That doesn't mean I'm forgiving Fox (I don't, and I don't watch Fox). But we should still be able to recognize that the scale is all out of whack, when you compare the two.

       You're right that the scale has increased (that doesn't seem like the right word, but I'll go with it). It has been increasing steadily for more than 20 years and will likely to continue to do so. We saw it with Bush (pretzel incident and him dancing) and have seen an increase. Trump has seen such a drastic increase because he fans the flames. Any negative criticism of him, no matter if it is valid or not, is met with him shooting back. That results in increased coverage over and over. Some of it is unrelated to him. Some of it he causes.

       No doubt. But that doesn't change the fact that the scale is greatly increased under Trump. Whether he fans the flames or not is sort of irrelevant. The media doesn't
       <em>
        have

       to push shit like shoes, or ice cream. If they ignored Trump, we'd be better of. Just like we'd be better of if he kept his mouth shut.

       It's just conjecture though. It may very well be that he doesn't let his staff have two scoops of ice cream. That seems rather stupid, but it could be true.

       The simple truth is that Trump lives his life in a far more public way than any other president in history. When he was a private citizen, he had no problem with tweeting out any thought or opinion that he had without second thought. This attitude didn't change when he became president, but now everything he says carries with it weight and authority of the president of the united states.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, when we hear about Trump demanding that he gets two scoops of ice cream while everyone else gets one, that's something that reflects on his character. If the two scoops shit was an isolated incident, it wouldn't matter. But from his actions as both a private citizen and as president, there are a lot of people that are worried that a guy who can order nuclear annihilation is petty, impulsive and vindictive.

       Once again, this is pure conjecture. There is no evidence to suggest that he was the only one allowed to have two scoops of ice cream. This is only a story, though a very weak one, if there's proof he told everybody else they were not allowed to have 2 scoops. I've seen nothing beyond pure conjecture to suggest this is the case.

       This is unfair though, as Trump is the only president to enter office with the social media tools being a part of normal, every day, life. Obama was elected in 2008, Twitter became a thing only in 2006. It wasn't what it is now. Same with Facebook.

       That's all true, but that doesn't mean that he's being treated unfairly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump tweets like an angsty teen. Whenever he feels slighted by someone or something, he tweets about it. He tweets about how unfairly people are treating him. When someone famous says they don't like him, he calls them a loser. For god's sake, he literally bitches about "haters". He tweets without concern or care of the consequences (like how the guy who did the New York van attack needs to be executed before he was even charged with the crimes).
      </p>
      <p>
       He chooses to do all of this. Just because it's the way that he's always been doesn't mean the media has obligation to go easy on him.

       I never suggested the media go "easy" on him, I suggested they don't 1) waste our time with stupid stories, and 2) embolden him by giving airtime to his dumb ass tweets. I want our media to criticize our president honestly. I want them to hold him to a high standard. I want them to do that for
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       presidents. My problem with the media is that's just not how it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putting aside the two scoops story.. They gave a lot of air time to covfefe. They also spent a lot of time talking about Melania's shoes. Or how he stays up late. And so many other irrelevant stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, Trump feeds them and they feed Trump. I don't expect Trump to not feed them. He obviously enjoys it. I do (or at least, would like to) expect better of the 4th estate. That's especially true when much of the criticism surrounding these mundane stories is disingenuous, at best.

       We should hold our media to a high standard, just like we should hold our president. Part of the media's job is keeping the president in check. Feeding into his ego is anything but keeping him in check.

       Also, and I feel like a broken record, scale matters. Of course Obama was unfairly criticized for petty shit. It was no where near the scale that it is for Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you going to argue degrees. You can love the dude without having to bend reality. Reality is these presidents are ratings pushers and Obama wasn't given room to breath. Trump naturally is going to keep getting the same treatment if not worse because he has more holes in his character, behavior, leadership and the scandals he participated in willingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its amazing to me how people want to make victim a power house. I don't like him but you got to respect his strengths. You would think that people who love him, would appreciate his power and everything that comes with political power, which is absolutely without doubt a criminal mind.

       Who do you mean when you say MSM? If you mean just CNN please say that unless you can find literally any front page stories that WaPo or NYTimes or many others wrote about it. These are in fact different entities.

       I pay very close attention to Trump and this stuff and I only ever saw the "two-scoops" thing on reddit bashing the media. Your post is literally the first time I'm hearing about anything to do with Milania's(?) shoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was frankly a very scantily covered thing in the actual media and the fact that CNN used it to fill time is a ridiculous way to measure how the mainstream, at large are covering this administration.

       I don't. Just because CNN may have been the only one to push one specific story doesn't mean they're all innocent. The MSM, as a whole, all act roughly the same.

       This is your justification that the MSM are 'lol fake news' so you better 1. Have other justification 2. have evidence that others made it major coverage, or  3. you shouldn't be using that term.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, no wonder you think the evil MSM is fake news- you've apparently been looking for all your hard hitting political coverage from
       <strong>
        PEOPLE MAGAZINE

       and the
       <strong>

       You clearly weren't alive when those stories were a thing. They were on the front page of all. They littered my Facebook feed. CNN literally spent that whole Friday talking about two scoops of ice cream means Trump is a bad person.

       So go look at twitter. Or go watch how every program on CNN that day devoted time to the story. Or go read the countless stories about his ice cream habits.

       To claim "nobody cared" is a bold face lie. A LOT of fucking people cared. If they didn't, it wouldn't have been a major news story that day.

       Pretty certain I explained that's not possible. I can't go back in time. I don't really care if you want to believe me or not. CNNs two scoop antics was reported on, and it was such common knowledge that it actually became a meme.

       You used the term MSM, yes? What does that mean to you? Do you honestly believe the mainstream political coverage of this administration is fairly characterized by the Fashion/Style Section of the New York Times and People Magazine for gods sakes?

       The MSM did make two scoops a national story. Do you dispute that claim? It started with TIMES, and then CNN, and then it was on a bunch of other sites. Some had articles criticizing it, others with statements from Trump, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter how you slice it, the MSM made a days worth of reporting out of how much ice cream Trump ate.
      </p>
      <p>
       And "front page of all" should be pretty clear. I'm on Reddit talking about "all". You know, the all subreddit?

       That's actually not true. TIME and CNN definitely ran the story. But so did a bunch of others. Maybe not specifically talking about Trump's two scoops, but reporting on the reporting.. or reporting on Trump's comments about, etc.

       When it's water cooler talk at work, people take it seriously. I will grant you that there were more people mocking it than taking it seriously.. but it served it's purpose: It just rallied up the most ardent of anti-Trump people.

       Those two are hard, because they don't have a very big readership (compared to big 3: CNN, MSNBC, FOX), and I view the MSM as any outlet that has a large audience.

       But why isn't it good enough to actually state the outlets you're referring to? It's needlessly obfuscating to corral them all together. You so far have named a single actual major mainstream outlet (with 24 hours to fill) as having ran it at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, actually take a look at the Time article:
       <a href="http://time.com/donald-trump-after-hours/">

       </a>

      <p>
       This is not a "two scoops" article this is a full write up of spending some time with the president.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, that included the simple fact that our President at desert gets two scoops of ice cream while everyone else gets one. Some may think that's an unbelievable coincidence, that for first time in human history everyone at a table except for one person chose to get one scoop of ice cream. Others may spread it around FB or Twitter as the most ridiculous example of this idiots unquenchable ego.

       Compared to 24 hour news networks, they don't. Compare them to Breitbart, and sure their readership is huge. But do they have CNN, or Fox's audience? Not at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when I say MSM, I'm talking about a specific group of the media. There's no point in me name them by their individual names. Just a waste of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, it seems you don't understand my point even though I've spelled it out a few times. The TIME piece, and then the CNN follow up, spurred a near day long news cycle for the MSM (and others who were hurting for clicks). That doesn't mean every outlet spent all day and night on it. That doesn't mean everyone was critical.
      </p>
      <p>
       It only means that (some) media found a way to give themselves a day worth of news out of something so beyond stupid.

       Really? Because I would say it's extremely unclear what you mean by MSM. It seems to mean whatever you want it to to paint with very broad strokes. The sins of what CNN shows at 2:44pm on a slow news day means every mainstream outlet under the sun pushed some bullshit. If that's not what you mean then don't use vague confusing terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I would take another look at the ratings- From what I can gather from a quick google search NY Times has a 500,000 daily paper circulation and 2.5 million digital.
      </p>
      <p>
       CNN on the other hand appears to top out at about 1.5 million all day viewers.
      </p>
      <p>
       And please admit that Time did not write a story about "two scoops"- they wrote a very involved piece about the President and that little bit was taken from it, largely due to the public's reaction to that idiotic bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I can tell CNN mentioned it ever is what you meant by "the MSM made it a major national story".

       Fair enough although I haven't found a particularly good measure of how many hits CNN.com gets. You're the one who claimed they were light years ahead so feel free to provide the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've explained it but not particularly well and not particularly convincingly. You make a blanket statement about what the "MSM" does, never explain what that means, and your justification is that CNN ran an accurate though relatively unimportant story at some point ever which was such a 'massive' story I have to be told about it by people like yourself.

       That's because I can't. For me, "MSM" is a feel thing. I'm sure there are official definitions, but I don't go by those. I would consider CNN and Fox news to be Main Stream Media.. I find it harder to classify NYTimes and WaPo as MSM, though I can certainly see an argument for it. I wouldn't consider Salon or Breitbart to be part of the MSM.

        and your justification is that CNN ran an accurate though relatively unimportant story at some point ever which was such a 'massive' story I have to be told about it by people like yourself.

       Let me try this again. I said TIME reported on a flurry of topics. One of those topics was ice cream. CNN spent time, all throughout the day, talking about this story. Because of this, other media outlets also reported on it.. usually including responses from Trump, the campaign, to mock CNN, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I said was the MSM made an all day story out of something that was so beyond stupid. I don't understand how that claim is false.

       Clearly they just report on any and everything about him just like during the primaries, because it brings them clicks views and ratings.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you deny they shoved him out front during the primaries for ratings then you are lost, it's not farfetched to think they are still doing just that.

       I didn't deny that. I denied that people actually give a shit about that stuff. Obama had people talk about the color of his suit and the type of mustard he ate. Those weren't hard-hitting news pieces. They're jokes. Not meant to be take as real criticism. The same goes for the examples the guy gave about Trump.

       The people who write it really believe this stuff though. The point the other poster was making, and I'll use your example as an example, is that, sure, they talked about mundane Obama stories. But no one drew comparisons to his as a person through what color suit he wore. They were actually analyzing Trump as a person from a story about ice cream. That's ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as a response to your other point, the people who cared were the exact people the story was intended for, people who are inclined to not like him already. I was one of those people! It's like confirmation "Yeah he's this type of person" but from a story about how many scoops of ice cream he had smh.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said that to say that when something is in line with your thinking already, it will take you to a new height. Prime example is the satire news shows, I used to love them until I realized that they are just biased as all hell, I only truly enjoyed them because I fully agreed with the views. Laughed at all the silly jokes and cheap shots just because I didn't like certain people. This is the same type of thing, no matter how silly the story was.

       Uh, yea, I knew it was gonna be Manafort and I knew that the indictment would be related to stuff regarding Ukraine, before he ever joined the Trump campaign. As for Papadopoulous, I have never heard of the guy and it looks like he was most likely a plant anyway. You guys thought it would be related to Trump-Russia lmao.

       Not that I trust Mueller, but if he has an ounce of justice in him then Tony Podesta is likely next. I don't know who predicted DWS, but it certainly wasn't me.

       I don't think he ever said to kill anyone (though "lock them up" has a nice ring to it, no?) and it's not that he talked to a Russian, it's that he talked to a Russian linked to the Russian government to try to influence an election.

       Hey, you're the smartguy. You like slinging your opinions around as facts. You got all the answers, so why do you even ask questions at all? I'm surprised you're not running the fucking government all by yourself. Why not let people figure shit out for themselves instead of running your ShareBlue narrative. It's called r/conspiracy...not r/DemocratPolitics.

       Total BS. Manafort was working for a foreign government. Look at his work history. Dude plays ball with some of the worst of the worst, and gets paid handsomely for it. Pretty sure he thought he'd be out of US by time this investigation gained steam.

       Here's the original link on buzzfeed, where they have the whole dossier published. The only thing I can find is Steele suggested that on one of his business trips to St. Petersburg there were rumors that he participated in sexual events, but witnesses are hard to find due to being paid off/coerced. Nothing about hookers urinating on him.

      <p>
       If you can find it though, I'll happily admit I was wrong

       <p>
        Former top Russian intelligence officer claims FSB has compromised TRUMP through his activities in Moscow sufficiently to be able to blackmail him. According to several knowledgeable sources, his conduct in Moscow has included perverted acts which have been arranged/monitored by the FSB

       Page 2 Bullet 3:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        However, there were other aspects of TRUMP's engagement with the Russian authorities. One which had borne fruit for them was to exploit TRUMP's personal obsessions and sexual perversion in order to obtain suitable 'kompromat' (compromising material) on him. According to Source D, where s/he had been present, TRUMP's (perverted) conduct in Moscow included hiring the presidential suite of the Ritz Carlton Hotel, where he knew President and Mrs OBAMA (whom he hated) had stayed on one of their official trips to Russia, and defiling the bed where they had slept by employing a number of prostitutes to perform 'golden showers' (urination) show in front of him. The hotel was known to be under FSB control with microphones and concealed cameras in all the main rooms to record anything they wanted to.

       I would also like to thank you for providing a link to the dossier as it has become increasingly harder to find lately.

       I never liked Hillary, but after spending time in this sub it seems like she might be a genius, an evil one but still. She's able to control almost the entire country, have people killed, play incredible 8d Korean StarCraft with things like planting Manafort in the Trump campaign. It's weird she couldn't win the election.

       Honestly, it seems like Trump isn't smart enough to realize what's going on around him. He's being manipulated by super intelligent, super talented criminals and spooks. He's a puppet for the Russians, and has no idea.

       Or not hired him. That would have been cool. It's not like people didn't know he was a scumbag then. Sorry if I don't give him piles of credit for firing him after the MSM said he should.

       So Trump has better investigators than the FBI, CIA, etc?  Wait I know, you can't trust those orgs when they say they are investigating someone?  If you are innocent you'd distance yourself, not let them hang around until the media reports it then fire him.

       Trump has the best investigators.  Remember his team of investigators he sent to Hawaii to dig up proof that Obama was actually born in Kenya.  They found amazing things.  He was gonna release the evidence that they were bringing back to him but then something came up because he ended up not releasing the evidence... but still... those were some pretty fantastic investigators.

       This is what I hate about people. Show them evidence that they are wrong, and they double down. It's ok to be wrong. It's not the end of the world. I'm wrong or uninformed all the time. The correct answer is "thanks. I wasn't aware of that. I'll have to keep looking into it."

       I have seen that before though. I was aware. Cummings is a partisan stooge. Just cause he sent a letter doesn't mean I would believe it. Why is it hard to believe that they didn't have proof until the month he fired him. The media, dems, did really turn up pressure about it until that month aswell

       Ok, but you do remember how he acted during the Clinton hearings. Even shown emails that prove intent and lies, he was a partisan stooge. He's not someone whose word you can take as truth without looking into it.

       Proper vetting. Hire one future criminal, could be a mistake. Hire two future criminals, might be time to adjust your vetting procedures. Hire three future criminals, seems kind of suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first two, in this analogy, weren't even yet-to-be criminals. They were already criminals, they just hadn't been caught yet.

       So a candidate hires an insanely corrupt campaign manager who's last job was laundering money for Viktor Yanukovych and Oleg Deripaska, the candidate then hires foreign policy advisers that were recruited by FSB agents in 2013, then that candidate hires a National Security Advisor that is under federal investigation for his work a foreign agent of Turkey during the transition....
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you start to look into the candidate's past business, that candidate consistently was in company with people associated with the Russian mafia, like Tefvik Arif and Felix Sater.

       I get it. You don't see the big picture. It's okay. In a very short time you'll see how wrong this timeline you paint is. But you're too deep in the MSM bullshit storyline. Most people are. Very soon it will be obvious, and Donna Brazile's revelation today is a huge step in the right direction

        Michael T. Flynn told President Trump’s transition team weeks before the inauguration that he was under federal investigation for secretly working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey during the campaign, according to two people familiar with the case.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr. Flynn’s disclosure, on Jan. 4, was first made to the transition team’s chief lawyer, Donald F. McGahn II, who is now the White House counsel. That conversation, and another one two days later between Mr. Flynn’s lawyer and transition lawyers, shows that the Trump team knew about the investigation of Mr. Flynn far earlier than has been previously reported.

       Have you heard the interviews with James Woolsey and how he describes a plot that Flynn and the Turks came up with to kidnap Gulen to extradite him to Turkey? It's really fucked up.

      <p>
       Flynn was also giving kickbacks to Inovo to conceal the source of his payments.

       Yes. We have absolutely no proof of such things except the word of a former director of the CIA under which Fethulla Gulen was groomed and eventually brought aboard as an asset.

       Why the fuck would they? Do you want to police to knock on your door to tell you you're being investigated for being a naughty boy? Come off it, of course they aren't going to potentially fuck up an investigation like that.

       In the real world Trump isn't this god emperor you pathetic sacks of shit make him out to be. He was a private citizen who was in contact with someone breaking the law while on his premises.

       Trump has no right to being informed of this.

       I mean, like we have the official government records on one of Trumps campaign advisers working with the russian government and wherein Trump knew about this.

       "No one cares" about pizzagate because it's quite transparently an attack on "liberals" by Trump supporters. It's thinly veiled and lacks evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that's not the case, then can you point me to all the times you've complained on reddit that Trump was good buddies with Jeffrey Epstein, or that a 13 year old accused Trump of rape? I'm going to guess that you can't, because for you this isn't about protecting children, it's about attacking "the other side".

       I can't recall which episode, but The Intercepted podcast touched on this, and justified the US's interference as necessary to maintain their status as world power, with the implied reasoning that the strongest country in the world is going to have this sort of influence and power and it's better for Americans if it's the US, not the Russians or Chinese doing this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take that for what it's worth. It's more or less the line of reasoning that "everyone is going to try and do this" and it's better to be the country actually succeeding at it versus being the country that has it happening to them. I don't know if I necessarily agree, but it does seem like the most pragmatic approach to it given reality versus idealism.

       I used to agree with this line of reasoning, but seeing the abuses of power coming from our Gov. I don't tend to anymore. One perfect example is the mass
       <em>
        intentional
       </em>
       poisoning of US food and water. When you dig far enough you realize that it is 100% intentional to drive up profits across all industries which profit on chaos and destruction - mainly the military industrial complex and the healthcare system.

       this argument holds no water, and frankly, it doesnt really make any sense from the perspective of an american citizen

       I agree they're both shit, it's just a hypothetical. I hated Hillary more than Trump, but voting for the lesser of two evils I still found myself aligning with Russian interests, regardless of whether I wanted to or not (I did not).

       So a candidate runs for a major Party, and that major party pairs him with an insanely corrupt campaign manager, already under federal watch - and you think it was Trump and his decision alone, and not the responsibility of the Party and advisors? Also not the goverment job to give Trump any heads up about it??.. Interesting..

       Yes - it was the goverments job to tell him not to hire someone under invesitgation during his campaign. Instead they used it as a reason to begin wiretapping him, and found nothing. The russian mafia members have all been ousted. So once it was exposed, they were rid of, like they should have been. You might be holding on to a couple guys like "Kushner", but you're reaching...so far, things had been a bit different though, looking like they cant pin anything on Trump and have been hiding alot of dirt on the former administration side

       The Russian mafia members were never ousted. Sater was still organizing Trump Tower Moscow deals with Cohen during the primaries and met with Trump in late 2016. Sater has been constantly involved with Trump Org operations since 2005.

       Flynn gone no? So as he learns, things get fixed.. I am just saying... that it sounds a lil fucked, that a guy who didnt know if he was going to even run for president at the beginning of the primary, ends up going further than he or anyone else expected - but holds personal accountability over every decision that seems to have been made, meanwhile the party that backs him escapes? I mean, it sounds like the party was not doing their best job with surrounding him with good people - and then you have the wiretapping as it relates to manafort - and manafort being known and investigated by the FBI prior to this... like, you think that at some point the government is supposed to do their jobs? But instead they are too busy I guess..

       But it's during 2012-2016 when he was in Ukraine-Russia brokering on behalf of that Uranium Enrichment deal while Democrats were in charge/involved - which was with the Podesta group,( key advisor to Obama and future Clinton campaign)  is the reason for being investigated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Trump shit seems like a set up pretty much. Apparently he has something to do with the piss documents, that in turn end up being used to wire tap Trump during the election instead - and meanwhile is under investigation during the whole time and the Republicans still help put him through.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aren't these guys being slowly thrown out though? Basically nothing bad seems to be getting done and so far you would think if there was evidence or real reason to believe that he (the President) is working as a Russian agent, they would have it out by now given the mountain of evidence they should have from having wiretapped him during the whole run up?

       That's not "globalism".  That is capitalism.  Globalists support open borders, mass immigration, deference to the UN and ICC, etc.  Trump  buys good from overseas because they are cheap and he makes more profit.  He didn't create that system.  It's just the nature of modern commerce.
      </p>
      <p>
       The GOP absolutely does not want protectionism or nationalism.  Look at Jeb or Rubio.  They were the GOP's preferred candidates.  Look at McCain's recent speech in which he slammed nationalism and protectionism.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as NAFTA and NATO, I think that you don't actually know what Trump has said about them, you just know what your media outlet of choice said he said.  Trump has always said that he wants to renegotiate NAFTA, but he'll walk if they won't renegotiate.  That is what's going on now.  We'll see what happens.  Similar thing with NATO.  Trump's beef with NATO is that many member states don't put in the agreed upon contributions and the US is left footing the bill.  So Trump floats the idea that, in light of that, maybe NATO is no longer necessary.  Europe panics, the left freaks the fuck out (like always) and Europe says, "Ok, we'll pay."  Trump got what he wanted.

       Globalism involves more than just mass immigration and open borders, for example your borders can be open to goods, people or capital. Trump is a globalist since he enjoys the open borders of capital. You're making excuses for him but he's a wealthy man who wants to have it one way while dictating another so he gets elected.

       But if he supports nationalism and protectionism, how is he a globalist?  One can support free flow of capital and still not be a globalist.  Look at Ron Paul.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, he's a capitalist.  He didn't create the system, and even if he isn't happy with it, he's not going to leave money on the table just because someone might call him a hypocrite.  Just like how the Democrats complain about money in politics and then turn around and take money from anyone who will give it to them, including banks and corporations.  No one who wants to be successful is going to willingly give a competitor an advantage.

       A candidate's criminal campaign manager was bugged. Rightfully so, he was guilty as fuck. Another one wears a wire. Guess why? Because he's also guilty as fuck and didn't want a full jail sentence, so he wanted to supply dirt on other campaign cronies that were guilty as fuck.

       That is an interesting question. If you were profiting from illegal activity that was happening in your name, you would certainly be on the hook for the money. It's not a perfect analogy though- this wasn't a business venture, campaign finance laws and foreign agent registration laws are very serious. Trump was personally warned on multiple occasions and did nothing to rectify the problems.

       I would agree about him being warned but I would also say that he rarely seems to listen to anyone, and that's not even anything positive in his defense but it sure helps him here. How many times have you heard someones words were lost on him? Or that he didn't take a briefing early on? Or even by the fact he tweets so much instead of giving official statements and addresses. He clearly doesn't want to listen to people majority of the time so I can see him ignoring some of this stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying that is the only possibility but just that I can see it.

       I come off taking up for him a lot here (I think) but I'm just underdogging because he gets railed on hard. I see it as too much sometimes and I wonder why, even though I don't necessarily like him as a person either. And I thought HRC would be much more qualified even though I didn't want to vote for her either. But I really don't try to take up for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       But regardless I DO want to see the resolve of all these happenings, whatever that is, because this whole past year has been very interesting to me. I'm not hoping I'm right or wrong, just attempting to analyze without so much bias involved.

       I had a nice rational back and forth with you and I appreciate that. I get tired of people calling me a t_d poster and shit like that without actually having a conversation about the topics at hand.

       Because the FBI/CIA can't interfere in an election. It is not their fault/problem if the people elect someone who is also a criminal. Remember that investigations can take years. The Watergate Investigation took 2 years after the men were arrested before indictments were actually issued.

       I understand that point but still, are we ignoring last year when they spoke with so much conviction about his wrongdoings? I haven't seen anything HE has done come out yet but they claimed to have dirt on HIM, not his associates. Where is the certain Trump dirt they claimed to have already in hand? Why are other people getting picked off and he's no closer to imprisonment or impeachment? And by that I mean cuffs on or paperwork filled, motions... Motioned.

       Because it takes a long time. There's also the issue that Trump is, literally, computer illiterate. All reports indicate he does not own a computer and does not use them. He has no understanding of email. So direct emails from him are not a thing. That means most of his communications are verbal. Getting people close to him to turn is the best bet on getting a conviction.

       Every description I've ever read of him has indicated he does not use computers and does not own one. The pictures of his office in Trump Tower all show he has no computer in there. He's learned how to tweet from his phone, and that's it.
       <br/>
       You'd have to be more specific about what they claim they already have. I never saw anyone claiming they had proof he'd done something. Everything I saw was circumstantial evidence that points to collusion.

       I'm not saying he doesn't know how to do anything else on his phone. I'm sure he texts (he has claimed, under oath, that he doesn't text) and calls. I'm sure he may games on his phone (he doesn't seem like a Candy Crush guy to me). I'm saying that he doesn't tweet from a computer.
       <br/>
       I take some of it back. In a 2007 deposition he reported that he did not own a computer. Apparently, by 2013 he "rarely" (his word) would send an email. Aides have stated that they generally sent emails for him and read them to him though. He has internet articles printed out for him to read.

       I mean I can see what you are saying and I could agree, mainly just generally. But I also know that we just don't know so I can't say that as fact and agree, just as a possibility. But no, you aren't wrong and sorry if it seemed I was saying that doesn't have a chance of being true.

       Haven't you ever met someone who knows how to do certain things on a computer or smart phone but doesn't actually know how to use it? Like the older people in my job that can run a report from Excel, but don't actually know what they're doing. They're just clicking on buttons in a certain order and getting the result they know they need to get.
      </p>

       But that's a big maybe. He also has a teenage son. I've taught my mother how to use technology over the years because I have always been good with it.

      <p>
       My mother wouldn't understand Twitter if I explained it to her right now though. But she knows how to do plenty on a phone and computer, mainly because of me. I believe that to be the direct opposite of what you just said so I still believe he could pull up an email app and find his way around.

       That could be true. But also consider this: Trump has been a top C-level guy for 50+ years. It's really possible that when email started being used in the business world, he didn't actually need to use it because of the position he was in. He might do his personal business over the phone and dictate all other correspondence through an EA.

       I agree it doesn't seem he uses it much, but I can't go so far as to agree he just flat out doesn't know how or doesn't occasionally use it. Really I'm hinging off of him tweeting, I don't know many 70+ year olds doing even that. I'm not saying he's on Snapchat or anything but... Twitter was confusing even for me at first. I would be more inclined to think he just doesn't like using it if he's not emailing, so I can agree he may pass that stuff off to associates or employees or staffers, but I can't agree that he flat out doesn't know how to do it himself.

       Wait for the investigation to complete. The prosecutors go up the ladder. Most likely the next indictment target will be flynn. The last target is always the highest on the chain.

       Let him become President, show him how much dirt you have on him, blackmail him into going along with whatever agenda you like.  He's one of the most powerful men on the planet, but you have him by the balls if you've got something incriminating on him.  I'm not saying he's fully under their control, but they could certainly be leaning on him in regard to some issues.  If he doesn't play along, they start releasing information, which is what we're seeing now.  I would say they
       <em>
        prefer
       </em>
       a crooked President like Trump over someone with more integrity, much easier to control.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ask me, the whole NSA spying thing has always been more about blackmailing powerful people than it ever was about national security or spying on regular folks. I think they watch pretty much anyone who wields any kind of influence, silently gathering information about them until the day that information can be used.  Someone like Trump, a billionaire who has always alluded to political aspirations, would be a prime target for something like this.  Even if the politician in question wasn't a crook like Trump, there would still be plenty of dirt that could be thrown at them.  Everyone has had
       <strong>
        <em>
         something
        </em>
       </strong>
       in their private lives they wouldn't want the public to see.  Just imagine yourself as a presidential candidate and someone steps to you with a video of you jacking off to internet porn or audio of a private conversation where you said some things you wouldn't want repeated.  You can either a) drop out and lose the election b) be disgraced and lose the election c) play along with whatever handful of freedom crushing bullshit maneuvers they are trying to pull d) make yourself look crazy trying to expose this plot, lose the election.  A lot of honest people would cave in that situation, a crook wouldn't even have to think about it beforehand.

       I hope if this ever happens to anyone, from a presidential candidate on down to some gullible high schooler who got suckered into a scam, that whoever does get caught up in something like this just tells the blackmailer to go right the fuck ahead and release that shit. Nobody with any sense these days is gonna bat an eyelash at the victims involuntary jerk-off vid, but everyone is gonna wonder what kind of creepy, cowardly, sack of shit, hides like a little fucking parasite and secretly films people hoping to catch someone jerking off, let alone apporiates trillions of dollars worth of tax payer funded technology to do some bullshit like that.

       Money laundering is a vague enough term for a certain campaign manager to get indicted over. Especially if the money that you are laundering comes from the Russian and Kazak mafia.

         Manafort is paid for work for Yanukovych and Deripaska and routes payments into Cyprus bank accounts that he is registered to. Keep in mind that his money comes from work he does as an unregistered foreign agent (the crime).

       Im not defending it. I'm saying if he did something illegal, specify what the illegality was. "Money laundering" is vague. What did he do? Move money through offshore companies like everyone fucking does? Hide money in client accounts? Stuff cash in his sock drawer?

       If all Hillary did was illegally sell art I wouldn't give a fucking god damn. No, she tried to steal an election and has a trail of dead bodies going back decades and has gotten away with so much shit it's hard to even fathom how corrupt she is.

       A simple Google search would have given plenty of indications of Manafort being dirty, even before the recent stuff was known. Surely the guy who talks about "extreme vetting" should have vetted his campaign manager better than a child could with Google.

       This right here.  I'm not a Trump fan, but I've been saying this since 'grab her by the pussy' and the memes about golden showers.  The NSA doesn't want to spy on us regular folks, they want to catch powerful people doing embarrassing or incriminating things.  They aren't interested in who wins the election, because they have dirt on every candidate.

       People don’t seem to grasp that with this^ no election is a real election our democracy is even more of a faux go through the motions and pretend like your vote kind of matters. They get to pick and choose who they want, while most dems are screaming about trump for collusion. Big difference in people’s perspective. Either you want to see what’s behind the curtain or you don’t.

       Spying on everyone for years in a manner that constitutes a major crime against everyone's right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law under due process and secure in their person and in their personal and private affairs no matter who they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alphabet agencies now have just about everything there is on you that's in any electronic databases anywhere... all your bank and transaction records, employment and employer's files, your insurance policies, your medical files, any and every email you ever sent or received, any and every website you ever visited, and all of your credit card purchases just for openers. It also includes any information that's supposed to be secure and private between you and any government agencies, the military, IRS, Social Security, etc. who aren't authorized to share that with anyone else without your express request and permission or without being served with a warrant to surrender it for a legal proceeding and anyone inside those agencies can now tap into, access and compile all of that private information about you for whatever reasons or purposes they happen to want despite the fact that you're not suspected of or have ever been charged with any crime and with no need to get a warrant to authorize them to have or know any of that private information about you at all.

       <em>
        any form

       of unreasonable search and seizure that includes that kind of personal information just as much as any of your personal possessions.

       You might want to give this investigation a bit more time. It's been 6 days since anything was made public, and there are 4 more currently sealed grand jury indictments.

       We know they would like to have a special counsel going on a fishing expedition for Trump's entire 8 years, but now that these indictments are out, this shit will need to end. And I'd be willing to bet that it does end soon, and Trump will remain clean.

       So if I know someone to sell things a lot. And I go to him for something and it ends up being stolen. Let's say a tv. Am I at fault because someone else sold me something stolen? Let's really assume I was naive to the fact this guy was a booster. Is that not possible?

It's laughably pathetic that anyone with more than half a brain could fall for a billionaire con man convincing them he's on their side as opposed to the side of the corporate cronies that truly run the show. Wake up.

       I have not choice but to watch about 1 hr of Fox "News" a day. Compared to actual news like WSJ and Bloomberg that I use for my investments, Fox news is clearly Pro-Trump propaganda. They no journalistic integrity at all. They want us all scared of Muslim and immigrant. They do their best to shelter us for any news that reflects negatively on Trump. It's propaganda.

       NO ONE should ever question that Trump is a SCUMMY snake oil salesman opportunist, and a shit ass businessman who's biggest accomplishment was inheriting his racist daddy's money.

       That the left-wing elite apparatus is against him is one thing... that the right-wing elite apparatus (including Russians) is toying with him because he is such a MORON, is another thing.

       Yeah most of these are bullshit.  The only one I do t have a problem with is the media thing.  Honestly it just doesn't surprise me.  Look at how he acts.  The god awful angry 11 year old tweets.  Calling gold star widows and families widows.  I mean, do you really expect people to be nice to  a person that behaves this way?  Imho, he's getting off light.

       The FBI could have made payments or was going to make payments for the Steele Dossier when they were still using it for fisa warrants and surveillance against Trump people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI has yet to tell congress if they used the dossier in any of their surveillance warrants.

       The government didn’t spend any time or resources on the fake Dossier? That’s kind of hard to believe at this point..

       What should have been learned by the American people from the last election is that our corrupt leaders can AND DO lie with a straight face. Did anyone think that trump was going to walk into a den of corrupt self serving sociopaths and make big changes to an absolutely UNDENIABLE corrupt system. Did anyone think our criminal government would allow their countless shady practices to altered without putting up one hell of a barrage of misinformation and lies. That corrupt politicians would allow their plundered booty to be exposed without attacking Trump and spinning every breath he takes as racist, evil, corrupt, insensitive to storm victims, arrogant entitled narcissist  that golfs every day ......Question: If you were hired as a CEO to come in and make changes to a company that should be making huge profits but literally every department from the head down to individual employees all had their own scam going that lined their pockets. Wouldn't you expect to hear a huge amount of resistance in every imaginal form? Wouldn't you expect a huge backlash of resistance from employees (elected officials) that like things just the way they are as they profit from their individual backroom scams/wink wink deals? A room full of criminals that know their scam could be exposed or affected because someone from outside the "The way we do things around here" Bullshit Factory. Well does it take a genius to realize that's the real motivation for the resistance of the new CEO???  Of course the Establishment was going to resist his every breath and throw so much mud that its literally impossible to know the truth. Now That was a long walk to get to the real point and truth of whats happening with our government. THE CRIMINALS ARE THROWING SO MUCH MUD ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW THE TRUTH!!!!!.....I can assure you the ones protesting the loudest are the ones we should be the most concerned with and tearing apart every breath of their existence and you will find real evil, deceit, scandal, shameful pocket lining abuse of the trusted elected position they hold!!!!!

       Obama for America had paid Perkins Cole since at least 2009(You might remember them for the role of acquiring Obama's birth certificate in Hawaii). They paid earmarked "legal fees" during and before the dossier. Perkins Cole is a prominant law firm used by many democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       DNC and HC campaign paid normal "legal fees" and "opposition research" earmarked. That is no where close to stating government paid for the dossier.

       I never said "round-the-clock" coverage. Of course they talked about other things. But nearly every single program that day dedicated time to the story. To me, that's spending a whole fucking day on the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can argue semantics all you want, but it doesn't change the fact that the MSM made "two scoops" a major national story. It doesn't change the fact that CNN, and others, dedicated a large amount of time covering "two scoops". And you can't change the fact that it's a completely pointless story.

       A.
You named one positive example. Not two. The economy is on the same course as it was under Obama and still largely under the same policies, so there's not really anything to report on besides "Economy under Trump still doing well due to Obama era policy".
      </p>
      <p>
       B.
The """"positive""" effect of his executive order is just speculation (i.e. wall street thinking they'll have less regulation, so stocks going up). There is no evidence whatsoever that it will have a positive effect on the 'real' economy. Frankly, it is more likely that a lot of deregulation will result in a crash similar to that caused by deregulation before the 2008 crash. Moreover, such an executive order is
       <em>
        literally doing nothing
       </em>
       . Until regulation is actually cut, one can safely characterise such an executive order as "talk big, do nothing". The volatility of the stock market means that it does react to the president doing nothing with a lot of fuss, but actual policy needs to be made in order to legitimately improve the economy.

       I can see what you're saying, and I definitely don't rule out that he personally is an unwitting patsy. That would make it even more important that we get fully to the bottom of whatever happened

       I'm not saying he doesn't know how to do anything else on his phone. I'm sure he texts (he has claimed, under oath, that he doesn't text) and calls. I'm sure he may games on his phone (he doesn't seem like a Candy Crush guy to me). I'm saying that he doesn't tweet from a computer.
       <br/>
       I take some of it back. In a 2007 deposition he reported that he did not own a computer. Apparently, by 2013 he "rarely" (his word) would send an email. Aides have stated that they generally sent emails for him and read them to him though. He has internet articles printed out for him to read.

       But that's a big maybe. He also has a teenage son. I've taught my mother how to use technology over the years because I have always been good with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My mother wouldn't understand Twitter if I explained it to her right now though. But she knows how to do plenty on a phone and computer, mainly because of me. I believe that to be the direct opposite of what you just said so I still believe he could pull up an email app and find his way around.

       Most of the day, yes. Sometimes you don't have a choice but what someone else puts on the TV. I know that's hard to believe.

       You used the term MSM, yes? What does that mean to you? Do you honestly believe the mainstream political coverage of this administration is fairly characterized by the Fashion/Style Section of the New York Times and People Magazine for gods sakes?
      </p>
      <p>
       If not then stop using that term. Or show me evidence of the broad mainstream media coverage mischaracterizing things or obsessing over an insignificant thing.

       This is what I hate about people. Show them evidence that they are wrong, and they double down. It's ok to be wrong. It's not the end of the world. I'm wrong or uninformed all the time. The correct answer is "thanks. I wasn't aware of that. I'll have to keep looking into it."

       But why isn't it good enough to actually state the outlets you're referring to? It's needlessly obfuscating to corral them all together. You so far have named a single actual major mainstream outlet (with 24 hours to fill) as having ran it at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, actually take a look at the Time article:
       <a href="http://time.com/donald-trump-after-hours/">

       This is not a "two scoops" article this is a full write up of spending some time with the president.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, that included the simple fact that our President at desert gets two scoops of ice cream while everyone else gets one. Some may think that's an unbelievable coincidence, that for first time in human history everyone at a table except for one person chose to get one scoop of ice cream. Others may spread it around FB or Twitter as the most ridiculous example of this idiots unquenchable ego.

       A simple Google search would have given plenty of indications of Manafort being dirty, even before the recent stuff was known. Surely the guy who talks about "extreme vetting" should have vetted his campaign manager better than a child could with Google.
