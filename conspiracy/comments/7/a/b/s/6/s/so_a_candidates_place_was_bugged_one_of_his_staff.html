    <div class="md"><p>Or you could actually read what has come out. </p>

<p>Trump tower wasn&#39;t wiretapped, Manafort the person was and it was restarted after he resigned from campaign manager.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know if his staff was wearing a wire. The claim is from a former attorney that said the indictment wording &quot;could mean he wore a wire&quot;. This is speculation that even says could, not that he did.</p>

<p>The government didn&#39;t pay, the DNC and HC campaign did which are private entities.</p>

<p>The media isn&#39;t 95% negative. You do realize Fox News is the most popular TV news, Breitbart has practically never criticized him, The Hill released the Uranium One news, Politico, WaPo, and even CNN has been front page on this resdit last week with news debilitating to Clinton. The news is biased and divided and Trump does plenty that warrants negative coverage and that&#39;s on him.</p>

<p>In short, open your eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>since you seem to trust CNN, i will use them exclusively for this first rebuttal.</p>

<p>CNN, Sunday, March 5, 2017: &quot;Trump&#39;s baseless wiretap claim&quot;</p>

<p>September 5, 2017: &quot;Donald Trump just flat-out lied about Trump Tower wiretapping&quot;</p>

<p>September 18, 2017: &quot;Exclusive: US government wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman&quot;</p>

<p>That about says it all. And on that last headline, it&#39;s important to note that not only was Manafort working out of Trump Tower, he was living there. So the claim, again if true, means Trump was 100% correct about being wiretapped.</p>

<p>This is more than just &quot;I told you so.&quot; The entire investigation into alleged Trump campaign ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election appears to center on the wiretaps of Manafort, whose consulting work included some foreign political groups, including in Ukraine.</p>

<p>If CNN&#39;s report proves true, those who lied will no doubt say, &quot;We didn&#39;t wiretap Trump; we wiretapped Manafort.&quot; But that cutesy, specious logic comes up short, both legally and ethically. In tapping Manafort, they knew they were getting Trump&#39;s many intimate conversations with him. That&#39;s how they could go to FISA and say it wasn&#39;t about Trump, but about Manafort. It was in fact a roundabout way of getting Trump in trouble, possibly even impeached.</p>

<p>As the CNN report said, &quot;The government snooping continued into early this year, including a period when Manafort was known to talk to President Trump.&quot;</p>

<p>And the wiretaps were used to feed the ongoing investigation of Robert Mueller of the Trump campaign&#39;s alleged ties to Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>

<p>This, by the way, puts a new gloss on why President Obama did nothing at all when first presented with evidence in the summer of 2016 that the Russians might be hacking our election. It was a way to take down the Democrats&#39; biggest threat, the unpredictable Donald Trump.</p>

<p>As has been noted previously, President Obama didn&#39;t have authority on his own to request a wiretap of a U.S. citizen. That requires the Justice Department. But that doesn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t make it happen.</p>

<p>The Justice Department was then headed by Loretta Lynch — one of the most politicized Attorneys-General in U.S. history, known for repeatedly bending the truth in her public comments. So it&#39;s not a stretch to think that, with a nod and a wink, Obama encouraged Lynch to go after Trump. He had every reason to do so, given that Hillary Clinton at the time seemed to be the only hope for Obama&#39;s progressive legacy to live on.</p>

<p>&quot;It was the Comey-led FBI in the Lynch-led DOJ, in the Obama presidency, that reportedly used the FISA Court to obtain a warrant, quite possibly based on the phony (Russian) dossier, that has provided material to get Manafort and pressure him to find something to squeal about and catch a higher-up,&quot; wrote Thomas Lifson at the American Thinker. &quot;The legitimacy of that warrant now is in question.&quot;</p>

<p>We&#39;ll take that a step further. The entire Russia investigation, which was manipulated into being by Obama administration holdovers working with congressional Democrats, now appears to be a fraud. More than a year after the government began looking into the charges, no proof of any wrongdoing or crime has been produced.</p>

<p>As for payment from the Government.  Steele was paid by the FBI

<p>Did you even read the articles. They had talks and arrangements were being crafted. They ended up not happening.</p>

<p>I never claimed CNN was pro trump, and I even say news has bias. The thing is all news has a bias some way. That also dosen&#39;t detract that CNN has published stories negative to Clinton. You can list all the anti-trump CNN news you want, I never accerntain re they are not biased.</p>

<p>I also listed more than Fox News, and you can find plenty more sources posted here in this sub like New York Post and Washington Examiner that are pro-Trump. Again open your eyes instead if nitpicking something I never said and than spreading lies about the FBI paying Steele.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the FBI did not pay Steele.

<p>The arrangement fell through. Steele also said he stopped working on the dossier around the election. The arrangement was days before the election.</p>

<p>No one is saying that it all. It&#39;s interesting how the goalpost shifted from &quot;There was no wiretap in Trump Tower.&quot; to &quot;Are you seriously saying the FBI shouldn&#39;t have wiretapped him because Donald kept talking to him after he left the campaign?&quot; tho.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not different at all. Wiretapping Manafort while he was in the campaign is different than wiretapping him when he has no business connection to Trump. Just like wiretapping someone not in a business relation that lives in Trump Tower is not wiretapping Trump. Same with all his other properties. That&#39;s just Trump being dumb talking to someone who resigned over connections to a foreign government.</p>

<p>Do you also remember the democrats not feeling threatened by Trump? They saw him as the easiest win. Why would they bother conspiring against him? If members of his campaign are under investigation why would it involve anyone other than the investigators and why would they stop investigating him?</p>

<p>Obama for America gave almost a million dollars to the law firm that helped orchestrate the Steele dossier, and they paid that money during the time the Steele dossier was collected. We don&#39;t have evidence it was for the Steele dossier, but if it was then Obama was involved in this and that would mean the government <em>did</em> pay for some of it. Well, maybe not like through and congress and shit, but I think you know what I mean. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Do you know <em>why</em> this is, though? It&#39;s not for the reason you think. Fox is the most watched news because it&#39;s the only right-leaning news network on TV (outside of the brand new OANN, which is only carried about one carrier I believe). Anything with a conservative slant has only <em>one</em> option for listening to people like them: Fox. The opposite is true for people with a left slant; they have almost TOO MANY options. </p>

<p>Said differently, the viewership of the left is split among 3 or 4 major networks. There&#39;s only one on the right, so the viewership isn&#39;t split. Simple math, really. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t know what those fees were for. &quot;Legal fees&quot; is very very broad, and very well could have been in relation to the Dossier. Chances are they weren&#39;t, but we <em>don&#39;t know</em>. That was my point. </p>

<p>Though if Obama would make it so easy for his involvement to be traced back to him then he was a far more incompetent person than anyone realized. In fact, it&#39;s probably easier for the government to be involved and hide it then it is to make it so the public could actually find out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I&#39;m saying Obama&#39;s connection to Perkins Cole seems to have no connection to Fusion GPS. The point I used was how the payments were earmarked differently. My second point was how Obama has ben paying legal fees for almost a decade and no change around the dossier period.If you want another point the DNC and HC campaign paid around $12 million together to Perkins Cole for opposition research and only $1.02 million was paid to Fusion GPS for the dossier. The payment is already more then covered by those two.</p>

<p>It&#39;s simple, besides being a client of the firm nothing else seems to imply Obama helped fund the research. In addition Perkins Cole and Fusion GPS cited the DNC and HC campaign as the funders after they took over the contract from Republicans. They did not mention Obama. With all this information I conclude while possible it is unlikely Obama played a role in the funding.</p>

But all right folk are not White Supremacists, it&#39;s just a faction. Another example to help would be. Manafort&#39;s crimes do not represent the criminology for all Republicans even with his deep dies with Roger Stone, being Trumps campaign manager, and having Trump be a client for Manaforts lobbying firm for years way back in the 1990s.

    <div class="md"><p>Every president not up for election endorses their parties nominee and works to campaign for them. Bernie Sanders even endorsed Hillary and campaigned for them. Again I bring up Manafort. Decades of contact with Trump, his lobby firm was hired for years by Trump in the 1990s, owned a place in Trump Tower since 2006 and gloated to the press of being friendly with Trump. Was campaign manager(think John Podesta equivelent) to Trump for 4 months and part of the campaign almost since the start, and talked to Trump after he resigned. Does this mean Trump knew about the intricacies of Manafort?</p>

<p>In addition, the Dossier cost slightly over $1 million of the $12 million the DNC and HC campaign paid for opposition research. That would mean Obama somehow would have known that specific adventure would yield results unlike the rest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never claimed they <em>don&#39;t</em> report on Trump. Though reading back, I can see how you read it that way. Bad phrasing by me. They report on what Trump does, yes. </p>

<p>What I meant by this .. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The media reports on some of what he does.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is that <em>some</em> of the media&#39;s reporting on Trump is about what he does. A large swatch of it is not, though. A lot of it is reporting on the mundane (scoops of ice cream, typos, shoes, etc), and a lot of it is talking heads giving opinions. </p>

<p>Though, to answer your question directly, there is a lot of stuff that goes underreported by the media. Two quick examples: </p>

<p>The economy typically gets a small article here and there but otherwise sees very little front page or on air coverage. They instead chose to focus on ice cream (I&#39;m being facetious, but you get the idea). Another is we still see very little coverage of the positive effect of his &quot;for every new regulation, they must get rid of two&quot; executive order. </p>

<p>Those are two very important issues, both which have been rather positive, that see very little coverage when compared to the other issues. </p>

You named one positive example. Not two. The economy is on the same course as it was under Obama and still largely under the same policies, so there&#39;s not really anything to report on besides &quot;Economy under Trump still doing well due to Obama era policy&quot;.</p>

<p>B.
The &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;positive&quot;&quot;&quot; effect of his executive order is just speculation (i.e. wall street thinking they&#39;ll have less regulation, so stocks going up). There is no evidence whatsoever that it will have a positive effect on the &#39;real&#39; economy. Frankly, it is more likely that a lot of deregulation will result in a crash similar to that caused by deregulation before the 2008 crash. Moreover, such an executive order is <em>literally doing nothing</em>. Until regulation is actually cut, one can safely characterise such an executive order as &quot;talk big, do nothing&quot;. The volatility of the stock market means that it does react to the president doing nothing with a lot of fuss, but actual policy needs to be made in order to legitimately improve the economy.</p>

<p>Scale matters. CNN spent a day, a whole fucking day, talking almost only about the number of scoops of ice cream Trump ate. My facebook feed was that for days. </p>

<p>Content also matters. The media made the ice cream thing about Trump&#39;s character. They used it to say &quot;See, Trump is bad!&quot;. That&#39;s a lot different than most of the coverage (though you do have a point with Quayle). </p>

<p>No, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s interesting. The Trumps live in a different world than most of us. YOU might not be able to understand wearing those shoes to that area, but that&#39;s all Melania knows. It was very disingenuous reporting. </p>

<p>Can you provide proof that CNN dedicated an entire day to round-the-clock exclusive coverage of Trump&#39;s ice cream habits? I find that hard to believe, and feel that it&#39;s more likely that the ice cream story was given a few minutes per hour as a report in their 24 hour news cycle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said &quot;round-the-clock&quot; coverage. Of course they talked about other things. But nearly every single program that day dedicated time to the story. To me, that&#39;s spending a whole fucking day on the story. </p>

<p>You can argue semantics all you want, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that the MSM made &quot;two scoops&quot; a major national story. It doesn&#39;t change the fact that CNN, and others, dedicated a large amount of time covering &quot;two scoops&quot;. And you can&#39;t change the fact that it&#39;s a completely pointless story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right that the scale has increased (that doesn&#39;t seem like the right word, but I&#39;ll go with it). It has been increasing steadily for more than 20 years and will likely to continue to do so. We saw it with Bush (pretzel incident and him dancing) and have seen an increase. Trump has seen such a drastic increase because he fans the flames. Any negative criticism of him, no matter if it is valid or not, is met with him shooting back. That results in increased coverage over and over. Some of it is unrelated to him. Some of it he causes.<br/>

<p>No doubt. But that doesn&#39;t change the fact that the scale is greatly increased under Trump. Whether he fans the flames or not is sort of irrelevant. The media doesn&#39;t <em>have</em> to push shit like shoes, or ice cream. If they ignored Trump, we&#39;d be better of. Just like we&#39;d be better of if he kept his mouth shut. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just conjecture though. It may very well be that he doesn&#39;t let his staff have two scoops of ice cream. That seems rather stupid, but it could be true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The simple truth is that Trump lives his life in a far more public way than any other president in history. When he was a private citizen, he had no problem with tweeting out any thought or opinion that he had without second thought. This attitude didn&#39;t change when he became president, but now everything he says carries with it weight and authority of the president of the united states.</p>

<p>So, when we hear about Trump demanding that he gets two scoops of ice cream while everyone else gets one, that&#39;s something that reflects on his character. If the two scoops shit was an isolated incident, it wouldn&#39;t matter. But from his actions as both a private citizen and as president, there are a lot of people that are worried that a guy who can order nuclear annihilation is petty, impulsive and vindictive. </p>

<p>Once again, this is pure conjecture. There is no evidence to suggest that he was the only one allowed to have two scoops of ice cream. This is only a story, though a very weak one, if there&#39;s proof he told everybody else they were not allowed to have 2 scoops. I&#39;ve seen nothing beyond pure conjecture to suggest this is the case. </p>

<p>This is unfair though, as Trump is the only president to enter office with the social media tools being a part of normal, every day, life. Obama was elected in 2008, Twitter became a thing only in 2006. It wasn&#39;t what it is now. Same with Facebook. </p>

<p>So while yes, Trump runs his mouth.. it&#39;s also the life he&#39;s been accustomed to. No other president has had that when they entered office. Hell, not even Reagan and he was a fucking actor. </p>

<p>That&#39;s all true, but that doesn&#39;t mean that he&#39;s being treated unfairly.</p>

<p>Trump tweets like an angsty teen. Whenever he feels slighted by someone or something, he tweets about it. He tweets about how unfairly people are treating him. When someone famous says they don&#39;t like him, he calls them a loser. For god&#39;s sake, he literally bitches about &quot;haters&quot;. He tweets without concern or care of the consequences (like how the guy who did the New York van attack needs to be executed before he was even charged with the crimes). </p>

<p>He chooses to do all of this. Just because it&#39;s the way that he&#39;s always been doesn&#39;t mean the media has obligation to go easy on him.</p>

<p>I never suggested the media go &quot;easy&quot; on him, I suggested they don&#39;t 1) waste our time with stupid stories, and 2) embolden him by giving airtime to his dumb ass tweets. I want our media to criticize our president honestly. I want them to hold him to a high standard. I want them to do that for <em>all</em> presidents. My problem with the media is that&#39;s just not how it goes. </p>

<p>Putting aside the two scoops story.. They gave a lot of air time to covfefe. They also spent a lot of time talking about Melania&#39;s shoes. Or how he stays up late. And so many other irrelevant stories. </p>

<p>Yes, Trump feeds them and they feed Trump. I don&#39;t expect Trump to not feed them. He obviously enjoys it. I do (or at least, would like to) expect better of the 4th estate. That&#39;s especially true when much of the criticism surrounding these mundane stories is disingenuous, at best. </p>

<p>We should hold our media to a high standard, just like we should hold our president. Part of the media&#39;s job is keeping the president in check. Feeding into his ego is anything but keeping him in check. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, and I feel like a broken record, scale matters. Of course Obama was unfairly criticized for petty shit. It was no where near the scale that it is for Trump.</p>

<p>Now you going to argue degrees. You can love the dude without having to bend reality. Reality is these presidents are ratings pushers and Obama wasn&#39;t given room to breath. Trump naturally is going to keep getting the same treatment if not worse because he has more holes in his character, behavior, leadership and the scandals he participated in willingly.</p>

<p>Its amazing to me how people want to make victim a power house. I don&#39;t like him but you got to respect his strengths. You would think that people who love him, would appreciate his power and everything that comes with political power, which is absolutely without doubt a criminal mind.</p>

<p>Maybe <em>you</em> didn&#39;t take it seriously, but many many people did. </p>

<p>That&#39;s actually not true. TIME and CNN definitely ran the story. But so did a bunch of others. Maybe not specifically talking about Trump&#39;s two scoops, but reporting on the reporting.. or reporting on Trump&#39;s comments about, etc. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>When it&#39;s water cooler talk at work, people take it seriously. I will grant you that there were more people mocking it than taking it seriously.. but it served it&#39;s purpose: It just rallied up the most ardent of anti-Trump people. </p>

<p>Those two are hard, because they don&#39;t have a very big readership (compared to big 3: CNN, MSNBC, FOX), and I view the MSM as any outlet that has a large audience. </p>

<p>This is not a &quot;two scoops&quot; article this is a full write up of spending some time with the president. </p>

<p>And yes, that included the simple fact that our President at desert gets two scoops of ice cream while everyone else gets one.

<p>Lastly, it seems you don&#39;t understand my point even though I&#39;ve spelled it out a few times. The TIME piece, and then the CNN follow up, spurred a near day long news cycle for the MSM (and others who were hurting for clicks). That doesn&#39;t mean every outlet spent all day and night on it.

    <div class="md"><p>Really? Because I would say it&#39;s extremely unclear what you mean by MSM. It seems to mean whatever you want it to to paint with very broad strokes. The sins of what CNN shows at 2:44pm on a slow news day means every mainstream outlet under the sun pushed some bullshit. If that&#39;s not what you mean then don&#39;t use vague confusing terms. </p>

<p>Also I would take another look at the ratings- From what I can gather from a quick google search NY Times has a 500,000 daily paper circulation and 2.5 million digital. </p>

<p>CNN on the other hand appears to top out at about 1.5 million all day viewers. </p>

<p>And please admit that Time did not write a story about &quot;two scoops&quot;- they wrote a very involved piece about the President and that little bit was taken from it, largely due to the public&#39;s reaction to that idiotic bit. </p>

<p>That&#39;s because I can&#39;t. For me, &quot;MSM&quot; is a feel thing. I&#39;m sure there are official definitions, but I don&#39;t go by those. I would consider CNN and Fox news to be Main Stream Media.. I find it harder to classify NYTimes and WaPo as MSM, though I can certainly see an argument for it. I wouldn&#39;t consider Salon or Breitbart to be part of the MSM.</p>

<p>Let me try this again. I said TIME reported on a flurry of topics. One of those topics was ice cream. CNN spent time, all throughout the day, talking about this story. Because of this, other media outlets also reported on it.. usually including responses from Trump, the campaign, to mock CNN, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people who write it really believe this stuff though. The point the other poster was making, and I&#39;ll use your example as an example, is that, sure, they talked about mundane Obama stories. But no one drew comparisons to his as a person through what color suit he wore. They were actually analyzing Trump as a person from a story about ice cream. That&#39;s ridiculous. </p>

<p>And as a response to your other point, the people who cared were the exact people the story was intended for, people who are inclined to not like him already. I was one of those people! It&#39;s like confirmation &quot;Yeah he&#39;s this type of person&quot; but from a story about how many scoops of ice cream he had smh.</p>

<p>I said that to say that when something is in line with your thinking already, it will take you to a new height. Prime example is the satire news shows, I used to love them until I realized that they are just biased as all hell, I only truly enjoyed them because I fully agreed with the views.

<p>Not that I trust Mueller, but if he has an ounce of justice in him then Tony Podesta is likely next. I don&#39;t know who predicted DWS, but it certainly wasn&#39;t me.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the original link on buzzfeed, where they have the whole dossier published. The only thing I can find is Steele suggested that on one of his business trips to St. Petersburg there were rumors that he participated in sexual events, but witnesses are hard to find due to being paid off/coerced. Nothing about hookers urinating on him. </p>

<p>If you can find it though, I&#39;ll happily admit I was wrong</p>

<p>Former top Russian intelligence officer claims FSB has compromised TRUMP through his activities in Moscow sufficiently to be able to blackmail him. According to several knowledgeable sources, his conduct in Moscow has included perverted acts which have been arranged/monitored by the FSB  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Page 2 Bullet 3:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, there were other aspects of TRUMP&#39;s engagement with the Russian authorities. One which had borne fruit for them was to exploit TRUMP&#39;s personal obsessions and sexual perversion in order to obtain suitable &#39;kompromat&#39; (compromising material) on him. According to Source D, where s/he had been present, TRUMP&#39;s (perverted) conduct in Moscow included hiring the presidential suite of the Ritz Carlton Hotel, where he knew President and Mrs OBAMA (whom he hated) had stayed on one of their official trips to Russia, and defiling the bed where they had slept by employing a number of prostitutes to perform &#39;golden showers&#39; (urination) show in front of him. The hotel was known to be under FSB control with microphones and concealed cameras in all the main rooms to record anything they wanted to.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Michael T. Flynn told President Trump’s transition team weeks before the inauguration that he was under federal investigation for secretly working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey during the campaign, according to two people familiar with the case.</p>

<p>Mr. Flynn’s disclosure, on Jan. 4, was first made to the transition team’s chief lawyer, Donald F. McGahn II, who is now the White House counsel. That conversation, and another one two days later between Mr. Flynn’s lawyer and transition lawyers, shows that the Trump team knew about the investigation of Mr. Flynn far earlier than has been previously reported.</p>

<p>In the real world Trump isn&#39;t this god emperor you pathetic sacks of shit make him out to be. He was a private citizen who was in contact with someone breaking the law while on his premises.</p>

<p>This is funny because the one uniting character trait between you conspiracy folk is your completely and utter unwillingness to ever actually follow the news unless it makes you feel good.</p>

<p>I mean, like we have the official government records on one of Trumps campaign advisers working with the russian government and wherein Trump knew about this.</p>

<p>You have to actively try to avoid the news to not know this.</p>

<p>Take that for what it&#39;s worth.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes - it was the goverments job to tell him not to hire someone under invesitgation during his campaign. Instead they used it as a reason to begin wiretapping him, and found nothing. The russian mafia members have all been ousted. So once it was exposed, they were rid of, like they should have been. You might be holding on to a couple guys like &quot;Kushner&quot;, but you&#39;re reaching...so far, things had been a bit different though, looking like they cant pin anything on Trump and have been hiding alot of dirt on the former administration side</p>

<p>The Russian mafia members were never ousted. Sater was still organizing Trump Tower Moscow deals with Cohen during the primaries and met with Trump in late 2016. Sater has been constantly involved with Trump Org operations since 2005. </p>

I am just saying... that it sounds a lil fucked, that a guy who didnt know if he was going to even run for president at the beginning of the primary, ends up going further than he or anyone else expected - but holds personal accountability over every decision that seems to have been made, meanwhile the party that backs him escapes? I mean, it sounds like the party was not doing their best job with surrounding him with good people - and then you have the wiretapping as it relates to manafort - and manafort being known and investigated by the FBI prior to this... like, you think that at some point the government is supposed to do their jobs?

    <div class="md"><p>But it&#39;s during 2012-2016 when he was in Ukraine-Russia brokering on behalf of that Uranium Enrichment deal while Democrats were in charge/involved - which was with the Podesta group,( key advisor to Obama and future Clinton campaign)  is the reason for being investigated.</p>

<p>The Trump shit seems like a set up pretty much. Apparently he has something to do with the piss documents, that in turn end up being used to wire tap Trump during the election instead - and meanwhile is under investigation during the whole time and the Republicans still help put him through. </p>

<p>Aren&#39;t these guys being slowly thrown out though? Basically nothing bad seems to be getting done and so far you would think if there was evidence or real reason to believe that he (the President) is working as a Russian agent, they would have it out by now given the mountain of evidence they should have from having wiretapped him during the whole run up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not &quot;globalism&quot;.  That is capitalism.  Globalists support open borders, mass immigration, deference to the UN and ICC, etc.  Trump  buys good from overseas because they are cheap and he makes more profit.  He didn&#39;t create that system.  It&#39;s just the nature of modern commerce.</p>

<p>The GOP absolutely does not want protectionism or nationalism.  Look at Jeb or Rubio.  They were the GOP&#39;s preferred candidates.  Look at McCain&#39;s recent speech in which he slammed nationalism and protectionism.</p>

<p>As far as NAFTA and NATO, I think that you don&#39;t actually know what Trump has said about them, you just know what your media outlet of choice said he said.  Trump has always said that he wants to renegotiate NAFTA, but he&#39;ll walk if they won&#39;t renegotiate.  That is what&#39;s going on now.  We&#39;ll see what happens.  Similar thing with NATO.  Trump&#39;s beef with NATO is that many member states don&#39;t put in the agreed upon contributions and the US is left footing the bill.  So Trump floats the idea that, in light of that, maybe NATO is no longer necessary.  Europe panics, the left freaks the fuck out (like always) and Europe says, &quot;Ok, we&#39;ll pay.&quot;  Trump got what he wanted. </p>

<p>Again, he&#39;s a capitalist.  He didn&#39;t create the system, and even if he isn&#39;t happy with it, he&#39;s not going to leave money on the table just because someone might call him a hypocrite.  Just like how the Democrats complain about money in politics and then turn around and take money from anyone who will give it to them, including banks and corporations.

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree about him being warned but I would also say that he rarely seems to listen to anyone, and that&#39;s not even anything positive in his defense but it sure helps him here. How many times have you heard someones words were lost on him? Or that he didn&#39;t take a briefing early on? Or even by the fact he tweets so much instead of giving official statements and addresses. He clearly doesn&#39;t want to listen to people majority of the time so I can see him ignoring some of this stuff.</p>

And I thought HRC would be much more qualified even though I didn&#39;t want to vote for her either. But I really don&#39;t try to take up for him.</p>

I take some of it back. In a 2007 deposition he reported that he did not own a computer. Apparently, by 2013 he &quot;rarely&quot; (his word) would send an email. Aides have stated that they generally sent emails for him and read them to him though. He has internet articles printed out for him to read.  </p>

He might do his personal business over the phone and dictate all other correspondence through an EA.</p>

Really I&#39;m hinging off of him tweeting, I don&#39;t know many 70+ year olds doing even that. I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s on Snapchat or anything but... Twitter was confusing even for me at first. I would be more inclined to think he just doesn&#39;t like using it if he&#39;s not emailing, so I can agree he may pass that stuff off to associates or employees or staffers, but I can&#39;t agree that he flat out doesn&#39;t know how to do it himself.</p>

<p>Why Mueller met with Trump 1 day before being named SC?

    <div class="md"><p>Let him become President, show him how much dirt you have on him, blackmail him into going along with whatever agenda you like.  He&#39;s one of the most powerful men on the planet, but you have him by the balls if you&#39;ve got something incriminating on him.  I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s fully under their control, but they could certainly be leaning on him in regard to some issues.  If he doesn&#39;t play along, they start releasing information, which is what we&#39;re seeing now.  I would say they <em>prefer</em> a crooked President like Trump over someone with more integrity, much easier to control.</p>

<p>If you ask me, the whole NSA spying thing has always been more about blackmailing powerful people than it ever was about national security or spying on regular folks. I think they watch pretty much anyone who wields any kind of influence, silently gathering information about them until the day that information can be used.  Someone like Trump, a billionaire who has always alluded to political aspirations, would be a prime target for something like this.  Even if the politician in question wasn&#39;t a crook like Trump, there would still be plenty of dirt that could be thrown at them.  Everyone has had <strong><em>something</em></strong> in their private lives they wouldn&#39;t want the public to see.  Just imagine yourself as a presidential candidate and someone steps to you with a video of you jacking off to internet porn or audio of a private conversation where you said some things you wouldn&#39;t want repeated.  You can either a) drop out and lose the election b) be disgraced and lose the election c) play along with whatever handful of freedom crushing bullshit maneuvers they are trying to pull d) make yourself look crazy trying to expose this plot, lose the election.  A lot of honest people would cave in that situation, a crook wouldn&#39;t even have to think about it beforehand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What should have been learned by the American people from the last election is that our corrupt leaders can AND DO lie with a straight face. Did anyone think that trump was going to walk into a den of corrupt self serving sociopaths and make big changes to an absolutely UNDENIABLE corrupt system. Did anyone think our criminal government would allow their countless shady practices to altered without putting up one hell of a barrage of misinformation and lies. That corrupt politicians would allow their plundered booty to be exposed without attacking Trump and spinning every breath he takes as racist, evil, corrupt, insensitive to storm victims, arrogant entitled narcissist  that golfs every day ......Question: If you were hired as a CEO to come in and make changes to a company that should be making huge profits but literally every department from the head down to individual employees all had their own scam going that lined their pockets. Wouldn&#39;t you expect to hear a huge amount of resistance in every imaginal form? Wouldn&#39;t you expect a huge backlash of resistance from employees (elected officials) that like things just the way they are as they profit from their individual backroom scams/wink wink deals? A room full of criminals that know their scam could be exposed or affected because someone from outside the &quot;The way we do things around here&quot; Bullshit Factory. Well does it take a genius to realize that&#39;s the real motivation for the resistance of the new CEO???  Of course the Establishment was going to resist his every breath and throw so much mud that its literally impossible to know the truth. Now That was a long walk to get to the real point and truth of whats happening with our government. THE CRIMINALS ARE THROWING SO MUCH MUD ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW THE TRUTH!!!!!.....I can assure you the ones protesting the loudest are the ones we should be the most concerned with and tearing apart every breath of their existence and you will find real evil, deceit, scandal, shameful pocket lining abuse of the trusted elected position they hold!!!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A.
You named one positive example. Not two. The economy is on the same course as it was under Obama and still largely under the same policies, so there&#39;s not really anything to report on besides &quot;Economy under Trump still doing well due to Obama era policy&quot;.</p>

<p>B.
The &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;positive&quot;&quot;&quot; effect of his executive order is just speculation (i.e. wall street thinking they&#39;ll have less regulation, so stocks going up). There is no evidence whatsoever that it will have a positive effect on the &#39;real&#39; economy. Frankly, it is more likely that a lot of deregulation will result in a crash similar to that caused by deregulation before the 2008 crash. Moreover, such an executive order is <em>literally doing nothing</em>. Until regulation is actually cut, one can safely characterise such an executive order as &quot;talk big, do nothing&quot;. The volatility of the stock market means that it does react to the president doing nothing with a lot of fuss, but actual policy needs to be made in order to legitimately improve the economy.</p>

I take some of it back. In a 2007 deposition he reported that he did not own a computer. Apparently, by 2013 he &quot;rarely&quot; (his word) would send an email.
