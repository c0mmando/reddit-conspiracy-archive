       == noobs did a bad job reporting on what Project Star Gate/NSA is ==
was over on Wikipedia reading this article:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project
       </a>
       like it's been over a year and this page hasn't been updated to include the technological components of remote viewing. the CIA released NSA documents this year that discuss a technology basis for remote view, a secretly installed space capability with lasers. the system allows the remote control and access of brain, body, and environment. I will list a few documents and the patent behind this technology, apparatus and method to remotely read and alter brainwaves. *
       <a href="https://www.oregonstatehospital.net/d/Project%20Star%20Gate/CIA-RDP96-00787R000500240009-4.pdf">
        https://www.oregonstatehospital.net/d/Project%20Star%20Gate/CIA-RDP96-00787R000500240009-4.pdf
       </a>
       a letter by Charlie Rose confirms if the public found out about this they'd find out it was a mind control weapon. so he said 'lets hide it keep it to ourselves.' *
       <a href="https://www.oregonstatehospital.net/d/Project%20Star%20Gate/CIA-RDP96-00789R002600090005-0.pdf">
        https://www.oregonstatehospital.net/d/Project%20Star%20Gate/CIA-RDP96-00789R002600090005-0.pdf
       </a>
       this document confirms a technology is being used to read the brain. the MEG/EEG terms refer to scans taken via space capability. *
       <a href="https://www.oregonstatehospital.net/d/Project%20Star%20Gate/CIA-RDP96-00792R000600190001-1.pdf">

       in this document law enforcement use of psi is described, including the technique parallel construction as exposed in use by the NSA whistleblowers to cover it's secretive use. the reason for the secrecy is the 4th amendment protects against this technologies use because it involves spying on a person through the walls of their homes/businesses, spying into their brains, effects, etc. US Supreme Court case Kyllo v United States bans the use of off wall and through wall radar as a 4th amendment violation. If enforced, the law would ban Project Star Gate. To be able to do things like telekinesis, metal bending, telepathy, the system had to be able to locate and track the target, a bonafide search. *

       </a>
       and here we have it. a document from the NSA describing a technology enabling this ability. the document is hand wrote by an NSA officer, describing it as a 'psi sensor' which sits overhead of everyone, passing information into the parapsychology center over the psi channel, right into the brains of psychic agents and into the computer systems for AI and robotics to analyze and track everyone's thoughts and memories. *

       here NSA verifies 100% accuracy of ability to remotely view with a satellite/radar system. they can remotely read or get into any information. *

       </a>
       here NSA describes remotely viewing Jupiter as soon as the Jupiter 10 satellite arrives at the planet. the satellite scans were taken of the planet deep through the clouds and even ground, and maps beamed into agents heads so they could do the 'remote viewing.' *

       this documents how an electromagnetic force was detected from Uri Geller the metal bender who was an agent of the space capability. By merely thinking, he could command the laser grid to lock onto objects to cause the metal to heat, bend, and even solid objects to break or dustify. the lasers can dustify and hurt anyone or thing by an agent merely thinking it the system takes out the will of the person(s). *

       this document describes NSA ESP/remote view. remote view is described as a technology again separate from the people who use it. notice it says "remote view" targets the "originator" ie the person being spied on's mind, and the "reader" who is the agent spying on the thoughts and memories of the "originator." agents are given a set of special powers described, such as "telepathy (including mind control)" and even "precognition." Precognition is the ability of an agent or AI robotics program to analyze a persons brain, and determine what it will do in the future based on it's memories and thoughts. For example they can predict what a person will say, where they will decide to go, etc all before they actually think it. the document also describes how our papers, and electronics are being accessed from space, enabling them to intercept keys used for encryption. this allows them to decrypt [[iPhone]] and the entire [[Internet]]. the lets encrypt initiative is dubious. encryption does not stop the government from getting our private/secret information. *

       </a>
       this document mentions the capability to do all this via space capability- just released as part of the JFK Files. see the blurb in #18. yes they used this technology to investigate the JFK matter, as it allows the government to go into peoples brains to get their actual memories and thoughts on subjects even if they hide the information / don't speak or write it. *

       in this document they describe the ability to do psychic warfare- merely think, 'cast an evil eye on moscow' and Moscow disappears... :) the satellite weapon basically blows the city up at an agents command using invisible energy, the government would then report the disappearance or havoc on Moscow as being unexplainable or caused by mystical forces such as an unknown disappearance or god like spiritual act to cover it all up. *

       this document describes extended remote viewing: the ability to force a persons body to relax, the ability to alter visual memory in the brain, the ability to alter a persons reality and create delusions, also does remote interrogation and torture. It's all mind control. Document describes the uses of this system for fighting terrorism, drug wars, and doing counterintelligence (COINTELPRO2016) abuses. *

       this is the entire patent for the Project Star Gate weapon system. All other enhancements to the weapon are included but not mentioned. Note the disclaimer at the end of the patent, "those familiar with the art will recognize obvious enhancements.." *

       Uri Geller with Johnny Carson [[Tonight Show]] bending a spoon. Guest reported feeling the lasers hit the spoon, causing a heating sensation. :) I know all this because I'm being hit with extended remote viewing now. The government used this technology to conduct top secret investigations at the Oregon State Hospital, and when I found out and caught staffers discussing using the technology under hospital microphones and cameras, they used the system to irradiate my body and set me up to look psychotic. Some experimentation was done on me, now it's been over 9 years of torture, stalking by federal and local agents on the streets, and I'm almost dead. First irradiated with the weapon and heard my first voices from the weapon in August 2008. I'm told today that the NSA/DIA/CIA have brain scans taken of all 7+ billion citizens stored in their Bluffdale and other datacenters. They've fully decrypted the brain and use this for population management and global domination of all man-kind. Still think the world trade center wasn't dustified on 9/11 even though it was mostly occupied by CIA/military sources? Don't think they wanted to hide everything inside the building? drjudywood.com Yes when NSA whistleblower [[Russell Tice]] confirmed [[Edward Snowden]] lacked access to the juicest documents, Special Access Programs, Exceptionally Controlled Information, Very Restricted Knowledge, and Special Technical Operations, he wasn't bluffing. Edward Snowden disclosed to us the low tech methods NSA uses to spy on us, hiding the high tech Project Star Gate methods. Consider this the biggest NSA leak ever done, far above Snowden level.

       So we'll literally need tinfoil hats.

       But in all seriousness, I don't know if I believe this is true (yet anyway, so help us god). If it were, there'd be no such thing as a legit 'bad guy' roaming the streets: everyone could be parallel constructed for their specific crime just by looking at their thought files. Nobody would ever get a "not guilty" verdict because just by looking at their brain waves they could figure out what's needed to ensure a guilty outcome.

       Now, it's clear that the best tech companies are working on this very thing. I'm pretty sure Facebook is trying to develop such mind reading technologies. But I don't think it's there quite yet.

       Facebook is just copying the government's methods. what I was told happens is the government dumps technology to the public sector, which is where Facebook is getting their version of telepathy from. all this tech was developed decades ago and fully perfected.

       You believe Robert Duncan is a fraud? Do you think the scientists who wrote papers on shielding which are published in scientific journals? The papers are in the shielding wikis in

       Do you think Eleanor White is a fraud? Did you read her ebook on shielding? Eleanor White hosted a talkshow. Her book included her and her guests' shielding reports.

       Meter reports before and after shielding is evidence. Lower biomarkers of radio wave sickness is evidence. Using the papers as evidence is evidence.

       How come you don't believe ultra wideband radar and ground penetrating radar cannot be shielded?

       there's a paranoid schizophrenic I know who was spending way too much money on shielding that never worked. he ended up stabbing his mom with a knife nearly killing her now he's in a mental hospital for 25 years. he's been there for two years now after suddenly disappearing.

       True. Dry soil does not shield ground penetrating radar. Wet clay, wet sand, wet coal and sea water do. Papers are in the Shielding: Ground Penetrating Radar wiki and the Shielding: Radar wiki in
