        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve narrowed down Corey Haim&#39;s rapist down to 2 people based on Feldman&#39;s statements and interviews. </p>

<p>After tons of reading over the last hour, I am strongly leaning toward David Geffen. He is a producer and studio executive and has a net worth of 8 BILLION dollars.</p>

<p>The guy is clearly a perv and likes much younger men, check out this article from 2012 when he split up with his boytoy that was 41 years younger than him: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2104346/Billionaire-David-Geffen-69-splits-toyboy-lover-41-years-junior-years.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2104346/Billionaire-David-Geffen-69-splits-toyboy-lover-41-years-junior-years.html</a> . </p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing his lover got &quot;too old for him&quot; because he then at 71 years old went on to date &amp; break up with a 20 year old:
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2890020/David-Geffen-takes-restraining-order-against-ex-lover-college-football-player-boytoy.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2890020/David-Geffen-takes-restraining-order-against-ex-lover-college-football-player-boytoy.html</a> . </p>

<p>The guy has political buddies (Bill Clinton &amp; Obama): 
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/xHtpP">https://imgur.com/a/xHtpP</a></p>

<p>Here the Obama&#39;s vacation on his yacht:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPB4xq4Fj0Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPB4xq4Fj0Y</a></p>

<p>If Haim&#39;s abuser was 42 &amp; he was 14 at the time as stated, that would make his abuser 74 years old today. Oh guess what David Geffen is 74!</p>

<p>For additional reading (warning, it&#39;s long)- check out this article, mentions some shady stuff on Geffen. It&#39;s possible he was part of the pedo ring and tried to destroy someone&#39;s career with it: <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ellievhall/found-the-elusive-man-at-the-heart-of-the-hollywood-sex-abus?utm_term=.ddaRvJpl9#.mvYgvWDb7">https://www.buzzfeed.com/ellievhall/found-the-elusive-man-at-the-heart-of-the-hollywood-sex-abus?utm_term=.ddaRvJpl9#.mvYgvWDb7</a></p>

<p>If David Geffen is behind this, I do not blame him for not coming forward. The guy is rich af and I&#39;m sure has a huge legal team. For the article listed above, buzzfeed and anyone ASSOCIATED with the article were threatened with legal action by Geffen.</p>

<p>This Geffen guy has his hands in too many jars, there is no way he could be brought down. </p>

<p>I think this is why Feldman wants 10 mil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Were you around when all of the pizzagate stuff first went down and there was speculation that elite pedos might be using art as a way to launder money made from child trafficking and such?</p>

<p>Guess who owns the largest, most highly valued private art collection in the world?</p>

<p>&quot;Geffen has the most expensive collection at $1.1 billion, which is 20 percent of his $5.5 billion fortune. Geffen collects American artists. He reportedly sold four pieces of his contemporary art collection in 2006 for $421 million. The sale included a drip painting, Number 5, 1948 by Jackson Pollock, that sold for $140 million and Woman III by Willem De Kooning that brought $137.5 million.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By the time I discovered reddit the pizzagate sub was banned, but I did read some things on another forum regarding it. I never heard about them using art to launder money- that&#39;s interesting, I&#39;ll have to look more into that.</p>

<p>Yeah I read on a wiki that Geffen is an art collector, as soon as I started reading that, all I could think of were those damn Podesta&#39;s and their sick child &quot;art&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IIRC, they don&#39;t just use art to launder money. There was a hypothesis floating around here that they literally traffic human beings disguised as art (in big &#39;ol crates with holes) due to the ability to ship &quot;valuable&quot; through ports without security checks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, so I did some digging on his art collection. He allegedly has the best post WWII art collection in the world, but I went through 10 pages of search results and could find absolutely nothing on what is in his collection other than the big names (Pollack, Jasper Johns, Kooning, etc). Whatever constitutes his collection, he&#39;s apparently not public about it.</p>

<p>BUT, I did find this juicy tidbit on a gay gossip website - an email from 1999 alleging Geffen is the head of the &quot;Velvet Mafia&quot; (aka Gay Mafia) in Hollywood (this is acknowledged by many more mainstream articles)</p>

<p>AND</p>

<p>alleging that Geffen is involved in satanic pedophilia. Not sure who the author of the email is...still researching and could use help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a really <em>interesting</em> email, thanks for posting that. Funny how that was sent 18 years ago in &#39;99 and Geffen was already on the radar. The author of the email is listed at the bottom- it has his name and phone number (although I&#39;m sure he has a new # by now).</p>

<p>Now here&#39;s a really strange thing...if you google the author&#39;s name + David Geffen, you get a profile for him and &quot;David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA&quot;. </p>

<p>Geffen donated $200 million in 2001 which got the school of medicine at UCLA named after him.</p>

<p>But I think you&#39;re right, he&#39;s going up against wealthy people, wealthy beyond anyone here could even believe. 10 million to a lot of these people is likely pocket change. Especially to their law firms </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back in April when obama was photographed on David geffens yacth i researched David geffen. This some info that I found dated from April 22, 1999 that I found it&#39;s a fascinating read, especially because I know Corey mentioned the soda pop club, and Michael Jackson was known as the king of pop. I cut and paste part of the letter but I encourage everyone to read it especially given what we know today it is very relevant.

&quot;Reputedly, Geffen doesn&#39;t just dabble in black magic: he&#39;s been identified by
victims of Satanic pedophilia as being involved in this shit.  Of course, a
lot of celebrities are identified, and much of it is the usage of masks to
confuse the children.  However, unlike some celebrity names that crop up,
David Geffen is no cultural icon, so there&#39;d be no reason to include him in
it.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the darkest of conspiracies, and in the L.A. area, no name is
better tied to this shit than Geffen.  I wouldn&#39;t be repeating this if I
wasn&#39;t fairly convinced it was true, though I still feel uncomfortable about
publishing it myself.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also:</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps the most pervasive and heavily debated lore in Hollywood revolves around Geffen Records founder/billionaire David Geffen. He’s also known as the “G” in Dreamworks SKG. Geffen is an eccentric homosexual who lives in an LA compound often referred to in Hollywood as Gay Mafia Xanadu.
Geffen reportedly has a staffer whose job is to populate Geffen’s abode with a revolving door of nubile gay men known as ‘Geffen Babies’. The perspective Babies are asked to come to Geffen’s house as paid models. The Babies are well compensated for services rendered. Geffen has been know to lavish his Babies with cars, jewelry, and even career favors. Such career compensation has lured otherwise hetero men into becoming temporary Babies themselves.
Some of Hollywood’s top leading men are whispered to have been Babies most notably, Keanu Reeves. Many say his casting as the lead in My Own Private Idaho was a favor from Geffen. Some went as far as to say they were secretly wed, a rumor which has since been debunked. Recently, Sean William Scott has been spotted about town with the mogul. The NY Daily News even went so far as to say he was seen with Geffen at a local gay bar. Personally don’t believe a man who will be forever known as ‘Stiffler’ could ever be gay but one thing is certain, the Geffen Baby does exist. Exactly whom of the Hollywood illuminati are baby alum, we may never know.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed! But, what surprises me is how very little there is out there about him from others in the industry. You and I have found these little gossipy tidbits, but overall, people just don&#39;t seem to talk about him. I get the idea, from the things I&#39;ve read, that because he is one of the richest and most powerful people in Hollywood (and vindictive to boot, by most accounts) he is one name that people will not name. People do not dare cross him. </p>

<p>If he, indeed, is one of Haim&#39;s and/or Feldman&#39;s abusers, I can understand why Feldman is hesitant to name him.</p>
