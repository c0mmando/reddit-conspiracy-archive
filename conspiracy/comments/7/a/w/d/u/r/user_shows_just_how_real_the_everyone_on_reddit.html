<p>Why did I find a reddit post from 2013 with this same question with exactly the same responses but from different users? <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1l1u8d/what_is_an_extremely_darkcreepy_true_story_that/">Hereâ€™s the post</a>   </p>

<p>The top comment on the current thread was deleted, but was word for word the same as from 2013. Still a bunch of other top comments which are word for word.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>u/EmperorWorm <strong>2013</strong><br/>
<em>William Melchert-Dinkel. He would make suicide pacts with young teens and watch them die on web camera, backing out of the pact at the last minute so he could get his jollies over and over.</em>   </p>

<p>u/cristi126  <strong>2017</strong><br/>
<em>William Melchert-Dinkel. He would make suicide pacts with young teens and watch them die on web camera, backing out of the pact at the last minute so he could get his jollies over and over.</em>    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>u/cristi126 also only has one comment on reddit.  </p>

<p>Most likely a bot farm getting karma. Would be interesting to tag all these accounts and see what they end up posting in future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Btw the u/EmperorWorm Person has been on reddit for 4 years and has a lot of different comments.
The u/cristi126 Person has only one comment.</p>

<p>So i think the u/cristi126 person only saw the comment that u/EmperorWorm made and saw the amount of upvotes it had and decides to copy it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>u/EmperorWorm hasn&#39;t been used for 3 years so the account is either abandoned or it could be a sleeper bot account waiting to be purged and used. I don&#39;t think u/cristi126 is a real person at all. I think it&#39;s an automated bot that was simply made to retrieve the top comment from the other thread.   </p>

<p>The real question is whether u/daquan_from_the_hood had their account hijacked or was linked to this event, or is a real person who purposefully looked back into askreddit&#39;s posts and copy/pasted the title.<br/>
If it&#39;s the later, then I imagine there are a bunch of bots setup to traw r/askreddit looking for new threads that have the same title as threads in the past, and then each bot in the farm is simply scripted to retrieve top post #1 or #2 etc and repost it to the new thread.</p>

<p>These are spam accounts. They make thousands of accounts per day and r/AskReddit is where the vast majority of them start out.</p>

<p>They&#39;re generally easy to spot and there are scripts that check the most popular threads, but there are millions of comments per month and an endless stream of spam accounts, so a lot still get through.</p>

<p>If you look, this site is packed with spam. In fact, they hit this sub daily too. I just commented on one this morning: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7axea3/til_in_1995_joe_biden_basically_wrote_the_patriot/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7axea3/til_in_1995_joe_biden_basically_wrote_the_patriot/</a></p>

<p>All the news/political subs have them (including this sub and TD). WorldNews and worldpolitics are the worst by far. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Here&#39;s some from r/all/hot right now:</p>

<ul>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/7aw32c/probably_one_of_the_most_wtf_catch_phrases_ive/dpdb34c/">copied gaming comment</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/4jc5y1/probably_one_of_the_most_wtf_catch_phrases_ive/d35fzhz/">here</a> (BTW the OP of the submission repostis a spam account too.)</p>

<p>Rest are image reposts</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Notingham36">https://www.reddit.com/user/Notingham36</a> - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/7aw2bp/yo_dawg_i_heard_you_pimped_rides/">front page post</a> - copied from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/4b581r/yo_dawg_i_heard_you_pimped_rides/">march 2016</a></p>

<p>Note: the BPT comment repost from AndyCarey was on this submission. The spam accounts like to make a post so they can repost comments with other spam accounts.</p>

<p>They coped <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iamverysmart/comments/7aw0kf/short_attention_span_much/dpdamvz/">this iamverysmart comment</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iamverysmart/comments/574fp4/short_attention_span_much/d8ouwap/">here</a></p>

<p>Note: the OP of THAT submission is also a spam account and has comments in the BPT thread above.</p></li>

<p>I&#39;ll digress here, but like I said: this site is packed with spam accounts.</p>
