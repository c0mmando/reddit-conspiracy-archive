      <p>
       I try to be as objective as possible whenever I look at weird situations. I'm not much of a conspiracy theorist (though I do think some conspiracies exist) and I'm apolitcal, I don't care who's president and I don't have a party. That being said, I do want to comment on something I've seen a few times on here that I think we're getting wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       One person put on here that if Russia wanted a left-leaning revolution in this country, it would have backed Clinton over Trump and funded left-leaning or far-left groups. I don't know about that. I don't think that follows. Let me explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people in the United States are staunchly far-wing (i.e. Nazis, Communists, Alt-right, ANTIFA, etc.), I believe it sits at about 20% total (10% on each side, 20% of total populous). Love it or limp it, though, a good size number of the American people are progressive liberal or moderate liberal or moderate swing (6% are swing I believe).
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump was the upset to the election. He was the dark horse. Clinton was the safe bet. If I had a nickel for every time I heard from the media that Clinton had it in the bag, I wouldn't need to work anymore. People hit the roof when Trump took the election by the college and lost the popular by nearly 2% (insert whatever conspiracy theory you'd like here, but the fact still remains).
      </p>
      <p>
       Revolutions happen because people are discontent with their current situation. That's why all revolutions happen. The American Revolution, the Communist Revolutions, the Scottish War of Independence, even Fascism in the 1930s partly happened because people were discontent with the status quo. Revolution is rooted in frustrated anger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       were engineering a revolution of some sort to throw a country into chaos, I wouldn't back the candidate with the high approval rating or the one who people were somewhat but shiftlessly discontent with.  I would back the guy who would toss the country into a riotous rage. I would back the guy who has a plateau of disapproval, somebody that nearly everybody, even those in his own party, couldn't stand. That'd be my guy. That's who I'd want in office. Moreover, I would make sure that, even if he wasn't loyal to me, everyone around him was to a degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the while, I'd be pressing my agenda to the people. I'd tell them about injustices done to them and prejudices against them. I'd tell them that they're poor and underappreciated
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       of him and those like him. After a while, they'll engineer it in their own heads and then I just have to sit back and watch the fireworks. They'll tear themselves apart and eat each other alive based on nonsense. Not long after, that guy and all his lackeys will be "hung," so to speak, as traitors, and then I can move in with open arms. That's how you engineer a revolution to your benefit. Hell, the US did nearly exactly that in Panama in the early 20th century.
      </p>
      <p>
       President Trump's current standing is 35% approval (as of 10/29/17 Gallup) and has remained consistently low. I'm not concerned with why, I'm just saying the numbers as a point of fact. He has been admonished several times in the press and in social media. He's been caught lying several times which has caused a lot of outrage and protests from the public, even riots and murders have happened. He's acted blatantly vulgar and acts unlike what many consider to be presidential. Moreover, 18 people in either the President's campaign or current cabinet, including his own son and son-in-law (who both confessed) have had shown connections to Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Public figures have come out and have plainly stated that, in no minced words, because of this they would like to see him assassinated or, at the very least, him and his cronies no longer in office. And they're doing it all under the banner of redistribution of wealth and "ÉGALITÉ!" and whatever else. Both sides are forsaking science for ideology and reason for emotion, and it all stems from anger and frustration.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole situation that we're in just
       <em>
        reeks
       </em>
       of engineered chaos. The only way to change it is to change our minds toward mutual benefit. Instead of allowing our hatreds or prejudices, whether real or manufactured, to effect our logic, let's look at what would be the optimal way to do something. But I'm aware that this might be just wishful thinking. Even so, I have to shake my staves at the heavens and say what I know is right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love to hear your guys' view on this.

       Sure it makes sense, ultimately though I think the false assumption is that it's Russia and not just Trump's actual camp.

       Once again it doesn't really follow. If it is the military, why all the Russia stuff? What about General Flynn? There's nothing in apparent connection to say military. I've heard the military thing but it just seems like conjecture on the unknown to me. Plus I think there's a lot of conflicts

       I don't know, still seems a lot like conjecture. If that did happen it would be top secret right? And if it's top secret how do you know? Plus there's a lot of lines in there like "likely" or "could have" and then builds upon that as if it were absolute. It feels like a house built on sand.

       All I'm going to say is wait until Monday, my friend. My guess, there's going to be a lot of indictments unsealed that relate to:
      </p>
      <p>
       illegal arms trades
      </p>
      <p>
       US election rigging

       <em>
        potentially
       </em>
       sex trafficking. This one I'm very doubtful for but I'm hoping in the nearest future pedos &amp; their enablers burn.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of the accused will be surnamed Trump but that's what I'm guessing.

       There already is someone with the surname Trump who was connected because
       <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-trump-russia-testimony-20170907-story.html">
        he admitted it.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       He admitted that he spoke with a Russian attorney to receive damaging information on Clinton and this was right after the Russians had hacked the DNC server. Not to mention Natalia Veselnitskaya, the attorney, worked for Russian intelligence from 2005 to 2013 (it's on her Wikipedia page). It's not a stretch to think they still had her in the Rolodex. I'm sure they found out about her meeting and sent her with some information.

       So nowhere on there does it describe any tangible evidence linking Russians to the hacking other than a screenshot of that google email notification saying the hacker originated in Ukraine. Furthermore, it even said the only known hackers were parts/partners of WikiLeaks, DCLeaks, &amp; Guccifer who's Romanian by self-admission. So where Russia at?

       Well International politics are complicated. You can't just prosecute someone from another country, there's diplomacy involved. The foreign Nation would have to allow you to prosecute and to allow you to extradite one of their citizens for a crime that they committed on a on that foreign nation's soil. It's complicated.

      <p>
       But that's neither here nor there, what I'm saying is, isn't it possible that it is, in fact, true and you just don't want it to be? Just humor me and entertain that thought for a second.

       I've tried to humor it, I truly have. I just can't see what the Russians would gain from rigging an election that was going to result in the same ending, 9/10 times.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, I feel like Russians are being blamed cuz they've been blamed for shit since McCarthyism was raging harder than viagra supported boners. Kind of like how the military industrial complex likes to blame brown guys in other countries for stuff then take over the brown guy's oil afterwards. Just the way I see it.

       That's fine. If that's your opinion that's fine. My only goal is to make people see what is and forget about what they want to see. Look at what is. Russia hacked the DNC, they've influenced our media (including Independent News sources), and their government has several known connections with key people in our own government, many of which are personally close to the president. That doesn't make you sweat even a little? That doesn't make you question what might be going on?

       You should check out Coriolanus' analysis of Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://sofrep.com/author/coriolanus/">
        https://sofrep.com/author/coriolanus/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a former Military Intelligence Solider in the Army, currently working private sector and writing for SOFREP (ran by former US Spec Ops guys). He used to work South America in the past but had become interested in Russia over the past few years.
      </p>
      <p>
       His theory from the get go was that Russia's sole goal was to cause unrest in the US and not get a specific candidate in the White House. The evidence he's used is pretty convincing. He predicted Russia's involvement in left and right wing views before it ever got leaked through recent Facebook news.
      </p>
      <p>
       His theory is basically that Russia did not care who won the election. They did extensive opposition investigations on both candidates and used propaganda to rile up opposing sides. His theory is that their goal is to create turmoil within the US and in essence, destabilize the country politically. This dates back to Russia's involvement with promoting the Furgeson riots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting reads if you can find his articles. If not, just try to google.

       Idk maybe people voted for him because of Russian relations it was a big selling point for me I didnt want the Clinton cold war 2 it was a wasteful inhumane mess that cold war . Now people are being propaganderd with the Russia bad thing and they ashamed of their complacency. Or maybe not idk but I seemed like everyone knew about it maybe I talked to to many trolls and not enough shills.

       You're kind of looking at it the wrong way. It's not a direct thing. It's not somebody running up to you and saying "you're going to vote this direction." It's more or less whispered influence. You notice no one actually talked to Donald Trump as far as We Know, but they talked to everyone around him and gave those people detailed inside information, which was given to the president which he used.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that Russia has at times influenced our media. They know what our media finds interesting so they release of story of some magnitude of some sort and our media runs with it. That goes for all major news networks. There was even a reporter who left RT because of all the lies. When the media runs with these stories and the people here then they accept them as being true whether or not they consciously do it and then create a public opinion that can be separate from the political powers
      </p>
      <p>
       They do it to create division conflict and turmoil. A country that is in turmoil is a country that is easily dominated. Kaiser Wilhelm did the same thing with Lenin, he gave him safe passage into Russia when he was exiled so that he could start the Revolution and pull Russia out of the war. It's one of the oldest tricks in the book. You absolutely can fool all the people all the time as long as the media is cooperative.

       All very true but I don't think they influenced a great deal america is very partisan and most people had already given up on democracy . Trump did tap into some existing feelings like draining swamps and ending militarism etc (then did the opposite) , he's a good sales man and that is what politics is about, making people believe your bullshit. They may have influenced Nazi's and antifa then played them against each other  but that's a tiny segment of the population everybody knows trump would have had zero chance against Bernie so was Clinton a Lennon aswell ,she has for years had personal contact with russians .

       Clinton rigged probably both parts. Herself, that we saw with common sense, then DNC emails and now people coming out. Also, in DNC was the pied piper bits where they might've considered Trump as an easy bad opponent.

       I don't know that doesn't really compute. Too many open options and things left to chance and things that she would have to control that would be Beyond her scope of influence. Sure she could rig the DNC, I don't see any trouble with that and I think she did based on what I've seen, but to rig the
       <em>
        entire
       </em>
       election and then at the end leave it up to chance for no reason? Doesn't really work. It's bad chess.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say you're right. If there was even an inkling of a chance that she could lose and she was the one orchestrating all of it, you really think she would leave that stone unturned? She would have covered her bases. She would have ensured that even if she lost the person in power would have listened to her. That's what I would have done. That's why I don't think she did. I think it's giving her too much credit.

        She thought she'd win.
Expected her rigging to carry through. 
Polls were rigged so might've done a too good job on that?
Guaranteed that she'd win. She couldn't rig the DNC alone, now could she??? ;)

       Necessary to counteract rigging done for her, since she wasn't even supposed to be in the game (maybe). I mean, she poses a good 'villain' character and a better one than Bernie. Bernie might've been retarded, but not evil enough to be a villain.

       This is basically my own theory too. And also, even if Clinton
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       would've won not only the popular vote but also won the electoral vote and become president, it would still be a win for Russia because of the deep divide and distrust in the president.

       That's true, but they needed someone who would piss off a lot of people, an outsider that would really cinch the Divide. Notice that moderate 6% is getting smaller and smaller everyday. Ideally it would be best for them if the entire country were partisan. That way the country is divided and hates itself

       The US corporate media started allowing one presidential candidate UNPRECEDENTED 247 access to the airwaves when a certain old socialist was found to be having(in mid to late 2015) massive rallies with people from all walks of life waiting in multiple mile lines in the heat, rain &amp; snow.
      </p>
      <p>
       The old socialist could only get on the early morning shows (Mostly early Sunday mornings to get airtime.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile the US corporate media starting broadcasting Trump rallies for an hour ahead of schedule &amp; a for quite awhile after to just talk about whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many massively huge Bernie rallies did you see on corporate television.
I saw zero &amp; I watched his rallies online all of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy was killing it &amp; Trump had way smaller crowds BUT THE CORPORATE MEDIA kept giving him all this airtime.
      </p>
      <p>
       He would basically speak at the 9th grade level about nothing for hours &amp; ALL of the stations would carry it. Not only that.....TRUMP stole Bernie's stump speech almost verbatim except for "THE WALL".
      </p>
      <p>
       US Corporate media got Trump elected. They are trying to cover that up with Russia hysteria propaganda.

       I think my greatest points of departure from your theory is 1) that $100,000 in facebook ads is nothing in an election that ran over $2B, and 2) China.

       /4. Election was rigged to favor Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Necessary to counteract rigging done for her, since she wasn't even supposed to be in the game (maybe). I mean, she poses a good 'villain' character and a better one than Bernie. Bernie might've been retarded, but not evil enough to be a villain.
