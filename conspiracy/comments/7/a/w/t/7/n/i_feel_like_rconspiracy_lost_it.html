But now I feel like this sub is filled with shills and is only filled with irrelevant posts.</p>

<p>Now I go to T_D where they talk about pizzagate, podesta, corruption, anti mainstream media, pro nationalism, immigration, anti globalism. Why are you not talking about it?</p>

<p>Left &amp; right two sides of the same coin? These things stay unless people start believing the &quot;mainstream&quot; stuff less and think for themselves,value their nation, start rejecting globalism, seek happiness, emotional freedom and promote individualism. </p>

<p>I have been in various conspiracy, truther, mark passio, david icke FB groups for the last 7 years. Same shit different story.</p>

<p>Only popular threads in this sub recently are anti Trump stuff and flat earth distraction bullshit. </p>

<p>I know might get attacked now but who cares. Status quo will continue, unless people get smarter and start support all the things I mentioned above. Turampu has his flaws but at least he is making people think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not about shape, it&#39;s about what it would take to convince so many people otherwise. When you understand that, then you understand why everything on terra firma is the way that it is (i.e. things are F&#39;d up for a reason). FE, then, tells us exactly how to deal with the &quot;other&quot; things that are actually important. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. FE is the stupidest conspiracy theory because it makes no sense whatsoever. Why would anyone bother lying about the shape of the Earth, let alone pour enormous resources and effort into maintaining such a lie. FE is the result of people realising how much they w been lied to by the media and TPTB and finding it difficult to know what&#39;s real, and those who seek to discredit conspiracy theories use this and useFE to tar all of them with the same brush and cause others to dismiss all theories as just as insane. I was open toFE when I first realised literally everything I thought I knew had probably been lied about in the media etc and I looked into it, and not only is there no evidence for it, there&#39;s tons of evidence of a round Earth, a round Earthmakes scientific sense, mathematical sense, philosophical sense and the FE lie makes no sense at all, particularly the fact that no one has ever provided a single good or rational reason for why anyone would lie about it. People try to claim that the reason is something to do with God as though telling people the earth is round disproves god&#39;s existence and flat earth proves god does exist, completely ignoring the fact that most religious people are quite happy believing in God and a round earth or that a sudden revelation that the earth was flat wouldn&#39;t turn atheists towards god but would instead just cause people to want to investigate the processes by which the earth was formed in such  a way (as well as presumably being confused about why so many had been mistaken about such a thing or why anyone would bother lying about such a thing).</p>

<p>People who believe in FE have completely thrown the baby out with the bathwater and are basically either  acting out their traumatisation after having been red-pulled or are deliberately trying to sabotage and discredit the truth movement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, first of all, science says that you have to be at least twice as high as planes fly to even possibly notice a curve that you think exists. You should know better than to argue with science.</p>

<p>Second, I&#39;ve been to the beach, watched ships go &quot;over&quot; the horizon. I pull out this magic device know as a camera with a telephoto lens, and you know what, that SOB comes right back to sea level! Aint that some shit right there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Science says that? Or the first source you get when you Google it says that? At cruising altitude, you can see the curvature.

    <div class="md"><p>Next time you&#39;re on a private jet, sit up with the pilots in the middle jump seat. That way, you get to see 180+ degrees in the direction of your travel. There is no curve anywhere to be seen. Also, you&#39;ll notice that the gyroscope remains LEVEL in flight. Planes never fly in a curve.</p>

<p>Fuck me in the ear, but you don&#39;t seriously google, do you? That alone would invalidate ANYTHING that you have to say.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be daft. Coming over the horizon is coming into view. Now, I know you can&#39;t be that dumb, cause that was a brilliant deflection. You get an A for effort. But, hey, you are fucking with humanity with that shit. Shame on you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Coming into view from small to large. Watch a ship go away from you, and constantly zoom in to notice that it hasn&#39;t gone over a curve.</p>

<p>A gyroscope is a gyroscope. It&#39;s a mechanical device. It does not compensate for curve.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if we ever understand the why. But if our terra firma is flat, then everything we have been taught by the authorities is a lie. It would mean we have no idea what this place is, or how it works. Whatever it is, it is a successful means of control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There has been a decline on Reddit in general over the last three years. It&#39;s just overrun by Shills and trolls. The only subreddit I regularly enjoy that I have seen be able to get larger while also maintaining the convivial culture of the subreddit is one that does not let new comers and new accounts post. In order to post on the sub you have to have a certain amount of karma and have to been there a certain amount of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, first of all, science says that you have to be at least twice as high as planes fly to even possibly notice a curve that you think exists. You should know better than to argue with science.</p>

<p>Second, I&#39;ve been to the beach, watched ships go &quot;over&quot; the horizon. I pull out this magic device know as a camera with a telephoto lens, and you know what, that SOB comes right back to sea level! Aint that some shit right there.</p>

<p>You know when someone had been fuck in the head when they believe &quot;sea level&quot; has a curve to it. LOL...I laugh at that shit every time. </p>
