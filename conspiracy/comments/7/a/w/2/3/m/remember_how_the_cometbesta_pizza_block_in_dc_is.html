        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In regards to what is going on in Saudi Arabia I think we may need to take another look at the Saudi/Pizzagate connections. I think the post copied below from Voat may be more relevant now. Please share thoughts and if we can tie an association with the ownership of the real estate in DC to the the arrests today:</p>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Dhs.CON.N.E.B appears to be Saudi Arabian owned, this means the entire block both sides the street was bought by SAUDIA ARABIA and given to Friend&#39;s Andrew Kline for FREE in 2003</p>

<p>Con-NEB is National Engineering Bureau of Dubai/Saudi/Arab-Emigrate, owned by Saudi it is the largest construction company in the middle east and just so happens to own most of WASH-DC including all the property&#39;s associated with Pizzagate Now we&#39;re finding out that almost all of these are tied to andrew kline and not 5021 can do corpse-disposal with caustics and drainage, and 5029 is besta-pizza Conneb II LLC, H Gill &amp; Son - sold all on 2003, for $0 ( zero dollars )</p>

<p>[ Gill &amp; Son is WASH-DC realtor, CONNEB is Saudi Owner of entire block most likely all the way to DC Whitehouse ]</p>

<p>5013 = CVS Pharmacy and Moneygram</p>

<p>5015 = Politics &amp; Prose and The Den Coffeehouse and Wine Bar</p>

<p>5019 = Sheffields Wine &amp; Liquors</p>

<p>5020 = Exxon Gas Station</p>

<p>5021 = Regal Custom Wet Cleaners</p>

<p>5029 = Besta Pizza</p>

<p>5031 = Bucks Camping &amp; Fishing</p>

<p>5035 = Little Red Fox</p>

<p>5037 = Comet Ping Pong</p>

<p>الإمارات العربية المتحدة - ‎CON - National Engineering Bureau Dhs.CON.N.E.B ...</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Once U head over to Saudi Arabia &amp; Dubai ( Where Hillary Keeps $1.5 Billion USD in her personal account ) you can find a lot of stuff on CON. N.E.B. Ii LLC, it appears that SAUDI BOUGHT the BLOCK a long time ago, and handed it over for Zero Dollars to Andrew Kline, ... it would be interesting if CLINTON FOUNDATION had built a recreational SEX center early on 2003, well before OBAMA election, perhaps CLINTONS were were actually running sex entertainment with SAUDIS going back even pre 911 (2001); This could be reason big bucks from Norway, and SAUDI and everywhere else.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>IMHO this is not just about CLINTONS, but its what FBIanon said all along that SAUDI was deeply involved the child sex slavery at all levels of GOV in WASH-DC.</p>

<p>Lastly, what was brilliant about your post Is I never could find a VET who could incinerate corpses, but once I saw you had found a WET-CLEANER then everything fell together as a wet-cleaner has caustics and tubs that can turn a corpse to liquid and flush down the drain with no evidence VERY EASY. GOOD FIND.</p>

<p>Did you see this ..?</p>

<p>The SAUDI connection is really coming together this guy goes back to CLINTONS first term, could be that Clinton Foundation has been running CHILD FUCK STREET for the Saudi&#39;s since 1990&#39;s.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t blame CLINTONS 100% for this shit BUSH was always into boys coming to him via these tunnels, and TRUMP got rich by turning 12 year old girls into whores for the Jewish MOB ( Sheldon Adelson ) &amp; EPSTEIN/Trumps Teenage-Models NYC ( 1980-1999 ). BUSH Family is tied to CON-Bin-Laden, which used to be pre 911 the biggest construction firm, it appears they have shifted front to CON-NEB.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve searched the DC Data base, and here are my findings:</p>

<p>Best Pizza is the Doing Business As Name for Uptown Pizza LLC - owner is Abdel Rahman Hammad - who has been the owner for 22 years. The registered agent is Anthony Kline (DOJ)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not my research, which should be clear if you read the post. It was an old post I copied over from Voat in regards to Saudi. Upon some further research, I found that some of the information in this post is not correct and misleading. A Voat comment copied over helps clarify some of it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Real Estate Developer (Conneb II) based in DC buys strip mall. Their Brokerage firm, HA-Gill handles brokerage and rental properties in their name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>HA GIll executes lease agreements with the business. They must file occupancy and use permits with DC Gov, and by law must have a registered agent that has an active law degree.</p>

<p>Andrew Kline, of the veritas group on 19th ST is a specialist in the hospitality management, and is the registered agent for over 100 DC based restaurants, cafes, and coffee shops.</p>

<p>To properly discern the owners, you have to search for the CEO, Governing Agent, or owner depending on if the business is licensed as a Corp, LLC, or S-Corp.</p>

<p>The owner of Besta Pizza is Abdel Rahman Hammad according to the DC official filing. A cross-reference with MD where Besta has a second location shows he&#39;s an inactive owner, and the current managing member is Mohamed Zahow - Who shows as owning A Pizza Boli&#39;s in this location for 23 years. Pizza Boli&#39;s is a franchise all over MD and DC. I&#39;m betting he bought out Abdel Hammad and changed the name they do business as to Besta Pizza recently (within the last 5 years.)</p>

<p>Of course we know that Comet is &quot;Big Cheese LLC&quot; with James Alefantis as the CEO of the Corporation.</p>

<p>Andrew Kline didn&#39;t get &quot;gifted&quot; property, he&#39;s the registrar and attorney on retainer. Check out his website about hospitality registration: <a href="http://www.theveritaslawfirm.com/ras.htm">http://www.theveritaslawfirm.com/ras.htm</a></p>

<p>and many of his clients: <a href="http://theveritaslawfirm.com/hospitality-clients/">http://theveritaslawfirm.com/hospitality-clients/</a></p>

<p>When you are searching property rentals, especially if there was a recent sale, the registrar would have to resubmit documents to DC Gov. That&#39;s why the dates all match, even if a sale didn&#39;t occur on that date, just a renewal/replacement of the filing. It would show $0 as the corp/llc/s-corp doesn&#39;t purchase the property, they are on a lease to rent.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a youngin&#39; and I lived in the NYC suburbs for more than 2 decades. I&#39;ve been aware of Donald Trump&#39;s presence on earth for a while and he has always been a joke and a low life. Everyone knows this. The narrative that has been drummed into people&#39;s heads is that Donald Trump is on their side.</p>

<p>The prince of Providence buddy cianci also was called a low life and a con by the corrupt democrats but won and won and turned providence from a shithole into a fairly great city before they got him imprisoned for other people taking bribes a practice only democrats working with the mob are allowed to do.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not being fair at all. The reason people stick up for Trump is due to the reaction of the establishment to him winning.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like asking your girlfriend if she cheats on you and then she overreacts to the question. You might have been slightly curious before, but after her overreaction, it&#39;s hard to ignore and let slide.</p>

<p>The way that the establishment has reacted to Trump winning shows they are scared as all hell and have everything to hide. That&#39;s why people give Trump a chance - look at the people they&#39;d have to trust otherwise.

<p>I am not willing to accept that the narrative of the establishment is anything but scripted. They are fanning everyone&#39;s flames. Why is that idea lost on all those who fall in-line with Trump? Because they have chosen a side and therefore narrowed their perspective while opening themselves up to emotional manipulation.</p>

<p>I am sitting here saying the things I type - Trump is playing his part, nothing he does is beyond what the script allows. He is doing his job in the state of chaos that has been long-planned and implemented by factions that have patience.</p>

<p>Are you sitting where you are saying that we should forget the entirety of human history, American history, and the last two decades, and trust in Donald Trump to illuminate truths and drain swamps? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never understood Trump&#39;s impetus to go for the Presidency - that&#39;s part of why I am willing to give him a chance. There has to be more to it - he has more than enough money and becoming a president tightens security around your finances more than anything else.</p>

<p>I do not feel helpless in terms of &#39;draining the swamp&#39;. As mentioned, the way that everyone is acting makes me think there is already something happening behind the scenes. Regardless, even if i&#39;m of similar mind as you, the alternative is as corrupt if not more. Trump brings a lot of attention on himself, and I think that&#39;s a good thing - we should be vigilant with people in power, right? </p>

<p>So i&#39;m not giving Trump any advantage over who might be there instead. I don&#39;t trust politicians, nor do I trust Trump. With that said, if I drown out the bitching and moaning from the establishment, what has Trump really done? The president is only so powerful - he can&#39;t do much on his own. It&#39;s been more of the same over the last year. So what are we all so afraid of? and why is the establishment still freaking out?</p>

<p>I go off what I can see, and what I see is the entrenched powers fighting for their lives. I like that view. I hope Trump is legit. Luckily, I don&#39;t think we need to wait much longer to see how this plays out. If Trump is who you say he is, that would suck, but its no worse than what we&#39;ve been dealing with since JFK. More of the same, even in the worst case scenario. I still find him more palatable than Clinton, but I &#39;like&#39; none of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. So let&#39;s explore this idea of Trump being &quot;legit.&quot; Let&#39;s say he is and that he drains the swamp in his way, exactly as things are now and not how we wish them to be. What will that encompass?</p>

<p>Edward Snowden blew some doors pretty wide open and was rightfully treated as a potential limited hangout. People are very familiar with the term now, but what almost none of them really know about those ops is that the asset may or may not be aware they are a part of the hangout. They are played by the agents, or officers, but because of their world view and the people around them, they never know they are being mastered.</p>

<p>That&#39;s really where I&#39;m willing to put some money when it comes to Trump. He&#39;s talked about a presidential run since the 80&#39;s. His public paralinguistics and behavior have changed dramatically. He is an opportunist, a narcissist, and has daddy issues. He is literally one of the easiest and most predictable personality types to con and manipulate. Imagine you have the resources of the black budget and then you just pander and grin-fuck a person like Trump for a few years, grease him up and get him ready for the show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you know who exactly Donald Trump is? His perception has been skewed through the lens of the media since the 80s... he has been scrutinized and used as fodder for years before politics came into it.</p>

<p>Additionally, if we want to talk about his politics, we&#39;d acknowledge that he was a life-long democrat and tried to help found 3rd party options when he was younger (which ultimately failed). Is his interest in politics as narcissistic as you say? or is he interested in reform? Even your narcissistic claims are derived from him placing himself in the spotlight - but yet any marketing major would recommend the same, no?</p>

<p>You are entitled to believe that Trump is being manipulated like a little boy - that&#39;s your prerogative. From my perspective, he seems insulated by the military leadership, and I think we&#39;re watching a war play out between them and the people you think are directing Trump. Do you really believe that Trump is in line with the &#39;deep state&#39;? Have you not been watching the shadow war play out all through 2017 thus far? I guess we all just see different things...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right fine, but sea changes do happen, and arrests here and in SA are a sign of a major tectonic shift in the geopolitical landscape. Something big is clearly happening, and Trump is clearly part of it. Whether he is behind it, or was merely used to help further it is another question. My feeling is he saw an opportunity and did a good job seizing it at the right moment. What makes me truly believe this is Donna Brazille&#39;s stark shift in posture.

    <div class="md"><p>And once again, I think the point of all of this, is why on the green fucking earth is there any reason to believe that this coup will work out to the plebs benefit, why trust in Trump to drain swamps that dont directly effect the elite first, and why believe that any of the things the public is allowed to know about state politics isn&#39;t a part fof the show?</p>

<p>&quot;Because muh Trump, that&#39;s why,&quot; is ALWAYS the underlying reason given.</p>
