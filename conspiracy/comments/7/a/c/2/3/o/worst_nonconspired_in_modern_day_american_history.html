    <div class="md"><p>TPTB want people to think that humans are dangerous, murderous, psychos. They need people to live in fear. Fear is an excellent method of control. People that don&#39;t live in fear, have no need for overlords that &quot;protect&quot; them. Fear is the system--it is predictable that it will always be used as it is what justifies TPTB and the incessant need for war.</p>

<p>I am sure there are non-government tragedies that have happened...I just can&#39;t think of any off the top of my head. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that makes sense regarding TPTB, but it is also true that a proportion (despite it being small) of people are dangerous, murderous, psychos.

Serial killers are a sign that something isn&#39;t right with society--it is an ongoing drama based response to their experience.  There is a lot that is not right with our modern society.

    <div class="md"><p>no, I am wanting a bad massacre or awful event that was orchestrated without government cooperation / by the government. to re-summarize my question: Has anyone ever been able to really fuck up America without TPTB signing off on it.

<p>But then that would be a conspiracy, you understand what a conspiracy means, right? It means more than one person being involved in a crime.</p>

<p>Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy both murdered 30+ people each.</p>

<p>The FBI are trying to claim the LV shooting wasn&#39;t a conspiracy, but there is so many holes in the story for it not to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>Most big events have to have been planned/carried out/covered up by more than one person, by there very nature.</p>

<p>There was literally two of them, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, of course they conspired and so it was a conspiracy.</p>
