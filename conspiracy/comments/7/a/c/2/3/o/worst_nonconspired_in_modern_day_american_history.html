       Most on here think that JFK assassination, 9-11, LV massacre and most other awful events in modern American history have been conspiracies / government has been involved. In your opinion, what has been the worst event in modern American history where the government was NOT involved? Does Uncle Sam know about every catastrophe before it happens? Please exclude natural catastrophes such as hurricanes and floods from this discussion.

       Why exclude hurricanes and floods? They are involved in that too. Houston had a hurricane and flood not too long ago. It flooded because the government opened the reservoirs. It's not a secret. Had they not done that, it would not have flood.

       Don't you find that incredulous that nothing has ever been orchestrated and carried out without the government's knowledge, that every bad thing that has happened the Gov were involved in, and no bad thing that they didn't want to happen, happened

       TPTB want people to think that humans are dangerous, murderous, psychos. They need people to live in fear. Fear is an excellent method of control. People that don't live in fear, have no need for overlords that "protect" them. Fear is the system--it is predictable that it will always be used as it is what justifies TPTB and the incessant need for war.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sure there are non-government tragedies that have happened...I just can't think of any off the top of my head.

       that makes sense regarding TPTB, but it is also true that a proportion (despite it being small) of people are dangerous, murderous, psychos. Therefore, I find it pretty crazy to believe that no one of those people have even been able to pull something off on a somewhat large scale without TPTB

       Because society is so messed up, it has been producing serial killers at higher rates. Serial killers are a sign that something isn't right with society--it is an ongoing drama based response to their experience.  There is a lot that is not right with our modern society. While TPTB may not be directly involved in that, they do know what is likely to create an environment for such a thing to be more prevalent. Even psychos have reasons for what they do. Much of the time it is about regaining control that society has in some way taken from them.

       So to be clear, you are wanting a crime that has taken place by a single individual, that involved no one else.

       I would probably say Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy.

       no, I am wanting a bad massacre or awful event that was orchestrated without government cooperation / by the government. to re-summarize my question: Has anyone ever been able to really fuck up America without TPTB signing off on it. If the worst thing that you can think of is Ted Bundy then it seems like terrorist groups and other groups that want to destroy America kinda suck

       But then that would be a conspiracy, you understand what a conspiracy means, right? It means more than one person being involved in a crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy both murdered 30+ people each.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI are trying to claim the LV shooting wasn't a conspiracy, but there is so many holes in the story for it not to be taken seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most big events have to have been planned/carried out/covered up by more than one person, by there very nature.

       Honestly, I'm not sure the government was involved in planning 9/11.  Almost certainly knew something was up and were ready to use it to their advantage. Probably expected something on a smaller scale though.  That would be the worst, I reckon.

       Yeah I'm willing to concede that the government probably had some level of intelligence on most massacres/terrorist events, whether low level unconfirmed rumors or more, but its hard for me to think that no one in modern day history has been able to mess with TPTB

       I've not heard anyone claim Columbine was an inside job or conspiracy. Not in the mainstream conspiracy community, anyway (if such a thing exists).

      <p>
       I don't know if this is the "worst" thing but I do know it's an example of a bad event happening that I don't believe was a controlled op of sorts.

       I really don't think so. JFK is big, moon landing is big... both conspiracies predate places like this sub.

       There was literally two of them, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, of course they conspired and so it was a conspiracy.

      <p>
       Otherwise you have to try and claim it was just a coincidence they both turned up with guns at the same school to kill people, impossible

       Because society is so messed up, it has been producing serial killers at higher rates. Serial killers are a sign that something isn't right with society--it is an ongoing drama based response to their experience.  There is a lot that is not right with our modern society. While TPTB may not be directly involved in that, they do know what is likely to create an environment for such a thing to be more prevalent. Even psychos have reasons for what they do. Much of the time it is about regaining control that society has in some way taken from them.
