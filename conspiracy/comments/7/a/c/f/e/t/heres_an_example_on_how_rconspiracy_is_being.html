        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This post was made about an email for a job ad by the DNC that excludes white males:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/79wsrb/dnc_is_hiring_but_not_if_youre_a_straight_white">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/79wsrb/dnc_is_hiring_but_not_if_youre_a_straight_white</a></p>

<p>After it was made, a comment from the <a href="/u/totesmessenger">/u/totesmessenger</a> bot(which was somehow [removed]) alerted that it was cross posted to <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a>, where they ridiculed the users here and tried to discredit the email as fake or a larp.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/79ykgh/top_minds_fall_for_another_larp_this_time/">https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/79ykgh/top_minds_fall_for_another_larp_this_time/</a></p>

<p>Not long after that, comments calling it fake were made and upvoted to the top of the thread while other comments were downvoted, most likely from vote bots to fit their narrative.</p>

<p>The DNC is now doing damage control for the email. It was not fake or a larp but how many reading the original thread believe it is due to the blatant manipulation and brigade by <a href="/r/TopMindsofReddit">/r/TopMindsofReddit</a>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>topminds has a habit of using reddits user notification feature when they are mocking users. ie <a href="/u/monkey-see-doggy-do">/u/monkey-see-doggy-do</a>. This results in that user going onto tmor sub where the rest of them gang up on the user.</p>

<p>I was speaking with an admin the other day and they wanted examples of that behavior. I have not had time to wade through that cesspool but if anyone wants to dig up examples of bigbowl whatever the fuck his name is along with any others doing it I think we could successfully stop them from abusing our users in that way. Just send me a link or pm me and I can give you the mods name who is looking for examples.</p>

<p>A topic with 450 votes, but if you click on the link has absolutely nothing to do with Clinton or what the title claims. I was there when it was till newish and no comment mentioned the email wasn&#39;t related. Even now you will mostly see circle jerking about Hillary going to jail and counter jerking why doesn&#39;t do something. I posted questioning it and got initially downvoted. Only later when people saw my and another users comment did we get upvoted and got replied &quot;I agree and feel dumb now&quot;.</p>

<p>The point I&#39;m making is most users don&#39;t look at the link. They vote and bicker. Only later when someone points it out do they check. It&#39;s a delayed reaction. Nothing special in your case, standard for. posts here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re aware that &#39;brigading&#39; requires the people visiting the page to discuss the action in some respect or make a concerted effort to perform the action together, right?</p>

<p>Because that doesn&#39;t happen. Someone posts a thread on TMOR. We think it&#39;s funny. Some of us comment just on TMOR, some of comment on both the original thread (going through the forum link, typically, to avoid breaking the &#39;np&#39; rule). </p>

<p>Usually, when the comment is in TMOR, it&#39;s pretty nasty. When it&#39;s on the original thread, it&#39;s about the thread.</p>

<p>So, this doesn&#39;t qualify as brigading despite the ongoing irritation it seems to cause people who post really, really stupid things without checking their sources.</p>

<p>It also pisses of people on t_d, politics, iamverysmart, and all sorts of other forums. </p>

<p>Why do we do it? Because it irritates us that people are too dim to even understand what critical thinking is (hint: it takes challenging your own beliefs) are attempting to influence public opinion, and it eases our irritation to mock them for it. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to wind up on TMOR, don&#39;t post something really stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But a lot of those, almost every one I&#39;ve seen come from the Donald, turned out to simply not be true. An article about Twitter censoring based on hash tags, when if you read the statement by Twitter to Congress, every single thing they &quot;hid&quot; was actually posted by bots. That&#39;s means that 75%(or whatever percent they claimed) of the &quot;people&quot; using the hashtag, weren&#39;t actually people.</p>

<p>I pointed it out, no idea if it was upvoted.. but isn&#39;t the idea of this sub supposed to be about finding out the real truth? Catching the media on both sides when they lie like that article did?</p>

<p>I keep seeing people criticize the idea of their beliefs/posts being criticized or debunked.. but isn&#39;t that the entire point? I&#39;d much rather have an opinion that&#39;s actually been challenged regardless of the outcome, and either stands on its merits than one I just blindly believe.</p>

No where does it state that the dnc isn&#39;t hiring that specific segment of people.

<p>Can&#39;t feed into that bollocks.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t bother me too much but that there is definitely a concerted effort to shame/embarrass users into silence.</p>

<p>Should I be sharing the name of the user who attempted to shame me?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even sure I can at this point as I blocked them but yeah something is up.</p>
