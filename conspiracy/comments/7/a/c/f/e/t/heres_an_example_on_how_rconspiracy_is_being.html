       This post was made about an email for a job ad by the DNC that excludes white males:
      </p>

       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/79wsrb/dnc_is_hiring_but_not_if_youre_a_straight_white">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       After it was made, a comment from the
       <a href="/u/totesmessenger">
        /u/totesmessenger
       </a>
       bot(which was somehow [removed]) alerted that it was cross posted to
       <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">
        /r/TopMindsOfReddit
       </a>
       , where they ridiculed the users here and tried to discredit the email as fake or a larp.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Not long after that, comments calling it fake were made and upvoted to the top of the thread while other comments were downvoted, most likely from vote bots to fit their narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC is now doing damage control for the email. It was not fake or a larp but how many reading the original thread believe it is due to the blatant manipulation and brigade by

       topminds has a habit of using reddits user notification feature when they are mocking users. ie
       <a href="/u/monkey-see-doggy-do">
        /u/monkey-see-doggy-do
       </a>
       . This results in that user going onto tmor sub where the rest of them gang up on the user.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was speaking with an admin the other day and they wanted examples of that behavior. I have not had time to wade through that cesspool but if anyone wants to dig up examples of bigbowl whatever the fuck his name is along with any others doing it I think we could successfully stop them from abusing our users in that way. Just send me a link or pm me and I can give you the mods name who is looking for examples.

       they monitor the rest of reddit, identify posts they don't like, and then make fun of the people who posted.

       like I said, not particularly... endearing

       They make fun of people leaning Trump quite a lot. It such a bad way of winning people over that I almost wonder if some Trump supporters run the sub, as some sort of false flag.

       Finds people making stupid arguments and makes fun of them. You get a lot of posts/comments from this sub and t_d for one of two reasons:  those subs are being targeted, or people in those subs occasionally say some fairly stupid things.

       They attempted to do this to me the other day with a post I made in regards to the post about the Facebook App monitoring conversations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just blocked the poster and carried on.

      <p>
       Can't feed into that bollocks.

       It didn't bother me too much but that there is definitely a concerted effort to shame/embarrass users into silence.

       Should I be sharing the name of the user who attempted to shame me?

       Frankly that email did look a bit suspect. No one outside 4chan uses cisgender besides the other oddities in what is suppose to be a professional email. Not to mention the only source is the twitter of the articles writer. No offense but if that post didn't make you question the authenticity you might have been blinded by bias.

       And TMOR can fuck of for that. I looked at them once(I frankly never even heard of them until here in conspiracy) and it all seemed like a big circle jerk over specific users who post dumb shit and try to translate it onto the entire sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this is a really poor example as many including myself upvoted the questioning authenticity comments without looking at TMOR or ever being a part of their community.

       Thirdly, I'm left leaning and I had to look up cisgender(which is where I found its a 4chan thing since almost every link in the Serch was 4chan. I've also never heard my left leaning or my best friends wife's transgender than father now mother use those terms.

       When a conspiracy sub even mostly considers it fake you might want to take a look objectively instead of the few comments by a brigade. I mean seriously can you look at the email and the circumstances of how it came to be and not think it might have authenticity issues.

       A topic with 450 votes, but if you click on the link has absolutely nothing to do with Clinton or what the title claims. I was there when it was till newish and no comment mentioned the email wasn't related. Even now you will mostly see circle jerking about Hillary going to jail and counter jerking why doesn't do something. I posted questioning it and got initially downvoted. Only later when people saw my and another users comment did we get upvoted and got replied "I agree and feel dumb now".
      </p>
      <p>
       The point I'm making is most users don't look at the link. They vote and bicker. Only later when someone points it out do they check. It's a delayed reaction. Nothing special in your case, standard for. posts here.

       You're aware that 'brigading' requires the people visiting the page to discuss the action in some respect or make a concerted effort to perform the action together, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because that doesn't happen. Someone posts a thread on TMOR. We think it's funny. Some of us comment just on TMOR, some of comment on both the original thread (going through the forum link, typically, to avoid breaking the 'np' rule).
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually, when the comment is in TMOR, it's pretty nasty. When it's on the original thread, it's about the thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, this doesn't qualify as brigading despite the ongoing irritation it seems to cause people who post really, really stupid things without checking their sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also pisses of people on t_d, politics, iamverysmart, and all sorts of other forums.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do we do it? Because it irritates us that people are too dim to even understand what critical thinking is (hint: it takes challenging your own beliefs) are attempting to influence public opinion, and it eases our irritation to mock them for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't want to wind up on TMOR, don't post something really stupid.

       Cisgender is a left wing term. I’m from a very liberal part of the country and I hear it fairly often.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of my right wing leaning associates use the term, “normal” which some might call offensive, but that’s basically what cisgender means (cis = close/trans = far.)

       It seems to me that r/conspiracy is now almost universally a battleground for manipulation and brigading by other subs and interest groups. It really isn't just TMOR, or politics, or TD, or any other side-choosing, low critical-thinking community.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result, the sub has become an echo chamber of whataboutisms, shill-accusations, and baldly parroted talking points from liberal and conservative media.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's so little critical thinking regarding political posts here that I hardly ever look at comment sections anymore. And when I do, I usually just feel my blood pressure spike and wonder why the hell I do it to myself. But that may just be me.

       Yea but still the good posts about weird rabbit hole websites and creepy internet shit still make it up to my front page so I'm still happy with this site. Can't do much about people exercising their right to be political or anti semitic here too though, especially as this board continues to grow.

       But a lot of those, almost every one I've seen come from the Donald, turned out to simply not be true. An article about Twitter censoring based on hash tags, when if you read the statement by Twitter to Congress, every single thing they "hid" was actually posted by bots. That's means that 75%(or whatever percent they claimed) of the "people" using the hashtag, weren't actually people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I pointed it out, no idea if it was upvoted.. but isn't the idea of this sub supposed to be about finding out the real truth? Catching the media on both sides when they lie like that article did?
      </p>
      <p>
       I keep seeing people criticize the idea of their beliefs/posts being criticized or debunked.. but isn't that the entire point? I'd much rather have an opinion that's actually been challenged regardless of the outcome, and either stands on its merits than one I just blindly believe.

       The article didn't mention the bots, you wouldn't have known that's the actual reason without the Congressional document..

       And I've been temporarily suspended on Twitter, it has always given some sort of captcha or something to verify that I'm human. If 75% of the Tweets we're never seen, and they say they could have validated if they were human.. and they weren't.

       If they weren't bots, then why didn't they verify they're human? Seems more likely that 75% of them were bots, 25% of them were human..

       I think it has nothing to do with verification.  I think Twitter simply set a filter that said to remove a certain percent of tweets with such and such hashtag in an attempt to control the narrative.

       And it's become increasingly click-baity and low effort. When people are filling and sliding the queue with duplicates, sensationalist headlines, etc it encourages an echochamber.

       I found the other day who were copying comments from t_d is that they rarely engaged. They were just generating content and filling the queue basically. They would, however, defend each other's posts.

       Darkspookian, oishilover75, and nekky-chan are all accounts i found (11 total) copying and pasting (sometimes slightly editing) posts and comments from multiple users of the Donald. Each one I found because I saw that they almost always only commented on their own posts, usually just once with a copied comment,  and on each other's posts

       What is the conspiracy here? Assuming the email is real, the author states that they personally wouldn't like the jobs going to cis gender white hetero males. No where does it state that the dnc isn't hiring that specific segment of people. Shitty attitude and even shittier foresight to not realize putting that in a work email would come back to bite you in the ass, but I don't see any sort of "conspiracy" at play here.

       is pretty annoying. I don't know how they think their behavior is going to persuade anybody to their ways of thinking.... very counterproductive.

       If they weren't bots, then why didn't they verify they're human? Seems more likely that 75% of them were bots, 25% of them were human..
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you denying that there's a fuck ton of obvious bots on Twitter?

       This needs a prominent space on the sidebar. Basically, make it easy for people to report and they will. I've a feeling it'd get a lot of action given the current state of the sub.

       They attempted to do this to me the other day with a post I made in regards to the post about the Facebook App monitoring conversations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just blocked the poster and carried on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't feed into that bollocks.
      </p>
      <p>
       It didn't bother me too much but that there is definitely a concerted effort to shame/embarrass users into silence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should I be sharing the name of the user who attempted to shame me?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not even sure I can at this point as I blocked them but yeah something is up.

       Critical thought is starting to be turned on us by a growing mass of ignorant fools with ego flaws.
