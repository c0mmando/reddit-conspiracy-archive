       The ending of Alice in Wonderland:
      </h1>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Chapter Twelve –
        <strong>
         Alice's Evidence: Alice is then called up as a witness.
        </strong>
        She accidentally knocks over the jury box with the animals inside, and the King orders the animals to be placed back into their seats before the trial continues. The King and Queen order Alice to be gone, citing Rule 42 ("All persons more than a mile high must leave the court"), but
        <strong>
         Alice disputes their judgment and refuses to leave. She argues with the King and Queen of Hearts over the ridiculous proceedings, eventually refusing to hold her tongue.
        </strong>
        The Queen shouts her familiar "Off with her head!" but
        <strong>
         Alice is unafraid, calling them out as just a pack of cards, just as they start to swarm over her.
        </strong>
        Alice's sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be some leaves, and not a shower of playing cards, from Alice's face. Alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself.
       </li>

       Senator McCain and others roundly criticized Rep. Michele Bachmann in 2012 when she and four members of the House Permanent Select Committee Intelligence and the House Judiciary Committee cited Ms. Abedin in letters sent to the Inspectors General of the Department of Defense, Department of State, Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, warning about Muslim Brotherhood infiltration of the United States government.

       Combine all posts and analyze.
      </p>
      <p>
       The questions provide answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, information is everything, the flow of information is no longer controlled by the MSM but by you/others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence, why we are dedicating 'critical' time to distribute crumbs which can be followed in greater detail to paint the entire picture once more information is released.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why has POTUS dedicated so much time into labeling the MSM as fake news?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is this relevant?
      </p>
      <p>
       We are fully prepared that all social media will be shut down to prevent the spread of this information (i.e. POTUS' Twitter etc. and/or mass censoring).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sealed Federal orders pre-submitted as prevention and masked as 'in general' (though that does not account for rogue agents/programmers within).

       Dates (impending actions) are deliberately provided for authenticity.

       You can count the people who have the full picture on two hands.

       Of those (less than 10 people) only three are non-military.

       Why is this relevant?

       Game theory.

      <p>
       Outside of a potential operator who has been dialed-in w/ orders (specific to his/her mission) nobody else has this information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Operators never divulge.

       Highly recommend someone take all my crumbs and put into a massive dump (a single shot). This will be considered the biggest 'inside' 'approved' dump in American history.

      <p>
       They are beginning to understand as Podesta's attorney was just notified.

       To those watching (you know who you are):
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a choice to make.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can stand up and do what you know to be right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or you can suffer the consequences of your previous actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make no mistake, you are on the losing side.
      </p>
      <p>
       The choice is yours.

       Good post.  The Mayo Clinic Board of Directors is very interesting.  Have you seen the list? Freaking Dick Cheney and Barbara Bush.  Its like the Illuminati Alumni.

       That's OK, because even people who do have some idea what is happening have almost no idea what is happening.

       LARP from 4chan. A really good LARP. So good that some people think it may be legit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it just a LARP, it an interesting and educating read.

       It's not a larp, nor have you proven it's a larp. You're just an insecure guy who is afraid of being fooled because if you get fooled you'll feel stupid. Stop lying to the people.

       No it's definitely Alice in Wonderland, I assumed it wasn't a mistake and the small change was made to make some sort of subtle point. Assange and Wikileaks makes a bit of sense.

       I could NOT figure that out, I think that's a very good guess.  Their latest drop was Russian Intelligence in Russian, and I don't think that's it anyway.
       <br/>
       Probably suggesting that we look at the original drops from last summer?

       I heard Chicago, Jury Duty, but all the data I have on that is "November", so who knows?  I wouldn't reveal the date either - that will be a real circus.
As far as Huma news, this is on a couple of right-leaning sites:

      </p>
      <p>
       There's basically no excuse for any State Dept emails to be on her husband's laptop.  If I were the feds, I'd be worried that thing is riddled with malware based on what we all can reasonably suspect of Weiner's online habits.

       Yeah, I found another article that made it sound like Obama is in Chicago right now to help launch the Obama Center or something like that. I made a comment yesterday wondering if there could be any connection to all of the Chicago terror concerns going around right now. It’s probably a stretch, but worth considering nonetheless

       Perhaps it's fake...perhaps not...but it is the most amazing overview with explanations of so many things for which there have been no other explanation. So many pieces start falling in place...all weaving together and making such a clear and solid big picture.  I felt a little dumb that I hadn't picked up on the 4 10 20 = DJT until today.  Most  shocking is the sheer mountain of corruption and deception. Most worrying though was the state secret privilege. I had no idea about that or how it worked. I don't see how there can be any justice over Uranium One or any of the bribery accusations in a court of law of its not allowed to go to trial because this privilege is invoked?

       The TSA head is a Navy and Coast Guard veteran David Pekoske, and the FEC has zero record of any political contributions.
