       One interesting thing about the cameras in 1984 are that there are more cameras in homes today, and the government didn't put them there.  We did.

       Brave new world, 1984, and Fahrenheit 451 were required reading in my public school over 20 years ago. Parallels have been made with these books and society since the day they were written.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you go to the books subreddit multiple threads are written every single day about 1984 by some young high schooler who just started reading the book for the first time.

       News stations playing content specifically designed to create outrage, without any productive reasoning on the viewer or station. Why do you think CNN blasts Trump stories? Why your local news station has to put up mugshots, crime scene footage, and talk about what people have been arrested or charged with? Why do you think American media refers to Russia's largest missile as "Satan II"? It's to fearmonger. Build hate. Separate us apart. Distract us from the issues beyond what's on our dinner plates and inside our homes.

       People have been drawing drawn parallels b/t the book &amp; reality as long as it's been around. I've noticed over the past few years, though, it being cited in the "liberal agenda" arguments of a whole lot more Republican/Conservative leaning folks.  This strikes me as so odd, doublethink odd, since the story takes place in a sexually repressed, constantly at war, dystopia, that constantly questions/demands the patriotism of its citizenry.

       The core concept in
       <em>
        1984
       </em>
       is the control of language. That's why Orwell included an appendix containing the principles of Newspeak. Every other totalitarian concept in
       <em>
        1984
       </em>
       is built upon and supports the foundation of the control of language, and the indoctrination of younger generations is the method through which total control is achieved.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can see this today with the various -phobias and -isms that are constructed and decried by academia, media, politicians, and activists. You can be arrested for thoughtcrime in the UK.

       I can see that. Isn't Canada and California both now punishing people who don't use other people's "correct pronouns"?

       Perfect example. It's one thing to argue that certain speech should be restricted ("yelling fire in a crowded theater" argument), but forcing people to use specific speech is the beginning of totalitarianism.

       After reading 1984 in the 80's I could see most of it slowly coming into place. The one part I couldn't see people believing was that one day they are your enemy but the next day they are your closest alli. O how wrong O was.

       As mentioned we have loads of doublespeak, 2 minute hate is all the MSM. If I recall properly the main character rewrites the news similar to what Google is doing. We've also given Google (not only but they seem like the biggest player) the ability to scan all the books and "adjust" as they desire. Are they adjusting? I don't know but they certainly could rewrite history whenever they feel like it, not to mention their ability to push search results up or down as they desire as well. Google et al is big brother and they are watching you.

       Google has already adjusted things to fit their agenda such as suppressing the Las Vegas conspiracy theory search results. As I continue to think about it and read all of everyone's points, the idea of a 1984 type society seems more and more possible.

        Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now you begin to understand me.

       Basically one trillion. 1984 is a children's book...children read it in high school. It's the most vague basic conceptions of political reality, there's no grand magic behind it.
