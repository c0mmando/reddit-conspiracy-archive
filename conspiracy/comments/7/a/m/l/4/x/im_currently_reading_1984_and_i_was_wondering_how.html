    <div class="md"><p>People have been drawing drawn parallels b/t the book &amp; reality as long as it&#39;s been around. I&#39;ve noticed over the past few years, though, it being cited in the &quot;liberal agenda&quot; arguments of a whole lot more Republican/Conservative leaning folks.  This strikes me as so odd, doublethink odd, since the story takes place in a sexually repressed, constantly at war, dystopia, that constantly questions/demands the patriotism of its citizenry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The core concept in <em>1984</em> is the control of language. That&#39;s why Orwell included an appendix containing the principles of Newspeak. Every other totalitarian concept in <em>1984</em> is built upon and supports the foundation of the control of language, and the indoctrination of younger generations is the method through which total control is achieved.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now you begin to understand me.</p>
