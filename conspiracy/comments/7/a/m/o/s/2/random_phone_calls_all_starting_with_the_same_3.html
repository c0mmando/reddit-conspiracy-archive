When I call back they say I called them first but in fact they called me first. This never fails. The person on the other end is always different. It has happened to everyone I know. </p>

<p>What is going on here? Is it an issue with the cellular network and something to do with phones sharing some kind of relationship because of the 123. Is it a virus in EVERYONES phone? What could it be? Interesting to note it is always iPhone - iPhone. Also interesting is that the last call was a “wireless call”.</p>

<p>Anyone have a similar experience. Any thoughts? </p>

<p>I find this to be really weird and unnerving that my phone and other is cold calling each other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What could the motive be? To telemarketera and credit card scammers.?</p>

<p>People ignore calls from unfamiliar phone numbers, which means less people answering your scam call.
People are likely to answer calls in their same exchange (999) xxx-9999 because they are familiar and likely to be a friend or family.
So telemarketers set their system to make up a source phone number in the same exchange as the destination phone number (you). Its all very easy, source number spoofing has been around for a long time - they could literally call you and appear to be calling from your own  number, but in most cases that would just direct them to your voicemail login (cuz that&#39;s how you check your vm, call yourself).
It&#39;s not even illegal - it&#39;s used legitimately all the time to show a main number when dialing from an extension, for example.</p>

<p>Tldr; money, technology</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes a lot of sense. But the calls never stay long enough to be answered it is always a call just long enough for my phone to show that I’m getting called. Then it auto ends. I never get to answer. I only get to call back. Which I assume calls who ever number that is attached to. But then to further the weirdness. That number when I call back claims that I actually called them. So are the telemarketers doing these calls in pairs? </p>

<p>It also has only recently started happening, like I said the last year. But I have as a phone for longer why all of a sudden?</p>

<p>You answered a lot of the technical questions and made a good argument on what the motive could be. But I feel like one lineage of evidence is missing. The actual scam. Never has this number ever asked me for information, or tried to sell me on something. Like I said I have never been able to answer the live phone call. Only call it back.</p>

Most recently, someone got a text from my number, but they were mid conversation with a friend and responded to me as if their friend had sent the text. Confusion ensued, and they sent me a screenshot showing that I contacted them first. 
We figured out that their friend <em>did</em> send the text--it just happened to come from my number.

    <div class="md"><p>People often block entire ranges of numbers, like 555-*<strong><em>, when they get multiple calls from them. But, it&#39;s harder to block your own exchange, because you likely know people within that range.  I can&#39;t block 236-</em></strong>* because my family all has numbers within that range. I get oneor two calls which are spoofing that exchange every day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really interesting stuff. So somehow they have our numbers, then use a similar service to spoof call us as something similar. But to what gain? This option cost money, and just natural the caller has to get some benefit. What do the gain from this. Someone further up mentioned phishing and being gullible. But I haven’t heard of anything negative coming from these all’s minus the annoyance. </p>
