They wanted you to believe he shot people but after they had the &quot;witnesses&quot; say they seen him shooting, videos of him walking around not shooting people surfaced.

    <div class="md"><p>Because that&#39;s what they&#39;re getting paid to do. Did you ever see a movie or tv show? Actors often pretend to treat gunshot victims because they are acting and that&#39;s what their job is. </p>

<p>... not... actors.... </p>

<p>also, there&#39;s red wet spots visible in this video. im not dumb enough to say with certainty they are blood, but for you-- that&#39;s the level of evidence needed to say there isnt blood. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s right. I didn&#39;t see any blood. It should be everywhere. 58 dead and over 500 injured. You shouldn&#39;t have to convince yourself that a little wet spot you see in blood. If it were real you would certainly see blood everywhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>im not convincing myself there is blood, i dont need blood to know this happened.</p>

<p>i just told you why you cant see it. </p>

<p>of course, i also said there is visible blood. in at least 2 camera angles. </p>

<p>and visible gunshots<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>So you don&#39;t need evidence. That&#39;s fine. I on the other hand need evidence. They have a track record of doing thing like this. I see nothing in that video that would have me believe it wasn&#39;t a staged event. I find it odd how people like you have to try so hard to find the smallest bit of what you would consider evidence that it wasn&#39;t a staged event. If it were real we wouldn&#39;t be having this conversation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>cute rant, &quot;i dont need evidence&quot;</p>

<p>just gave you even more. </p>

<p>i seriously think you have to be a troll at this point. the lack of self awareness is so troubling. </p>

<p>there is so much evidence that it happened, and none that it didnt (literally - none! find me a video that shows it DIDNT happen) on the other hand we have hundreds of victims speak on camera, dozens of dead people in the grass, videos of the aftermath of dead and dying up close with people tending to their GUNSHOT WOUNDS, people driving victims around with their trucks, videos of ricochet</p>

<p>but you... apparently determine there isnt enough blood, and that.. is proof nothing happened. sickening </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea. It was a huge production. Did well in the box office. Definitely a better production than the fake show put on in October. And if you consider that a kindergarten level question then you got my point in asking it. That&#39;s what it&#39;s like when you post links to a video and claim it as proof it&#39;s not fake</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is an absurd question and shows how disconnected you are from reality. </p>

<p>the video there is CLEARLY fake. 
the videos of vegas are on a totally different level.</p>

<p>i just gave examples of how you could tell it was fake. as usual, you just don&#39;t understand anything </p>

<p>pretty much what youre saying at this point is that every video of vegas is fake. no, not the event- the videos themselves. like the people who claim CGI planes on 911. </p>

<p>i will not waste another moment replying to this idiocy </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vegas was a staged event. You have shown no evidence of it not being a fake staged event. The videos are real. They just lack any evidence of blood or people being shot. You try to make it seem impossible for such a thing to occur but history is full of false flags and hoaxes. I understand your very frustrated because you don&#39;t have any unreputable evidence to back up your claim. As for the video I posted a link to, it was a joke to express how ridiculous I think it is to claim what you posted as proof. </p>
