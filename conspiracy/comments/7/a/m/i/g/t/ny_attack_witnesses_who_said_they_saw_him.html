       I saw a couple of videos right after the event of witnesses adamant they saw the attacker shooting, a car on fire with 3 different things happening and one guy saying he saw the attacker shoot someone in the head 4 times. Has this all been debunked or cleared as a mix up?

       It was fake. They wanted you to believe he shot people but after they had the "witnesses" say they seen him shooting, videos of him walking around not shooting people surfaced. Now they have to change their story to fit the terrorist narrative. How else would you explain multiple witnesses saying they seen him shooting?

       I would explain it by eyewitness accounts that saw him shooting and someone hearing a commotion followed by gun shots and starts filming after the fact.

       The guy said he wanted to check on his family. He didn't ask if his family was shot. The officer said injured. Not shot.  Supposedly, a lot of people were "injured" but not according to this officer.

       Of course logic won't convince you; your ideals are based on fairy tales and a feeling of superiority.

       The guys tone of voice and speech is clearly conveying, "I don't want to deal with you, go away, I'm going to say something that comforts you"

       So throwing chairs in to a pool - by a news station,  presumably, is the same as faking the deaths of 8 people as well as all the physical damage, records, and countless other things. TIL.

       So I have to believe people because they said they were there? Mind you, the same people I wouldn't trust because the MSM is compromised do to operation mockingbird. Am I supposed to forget about that? (Or should I use logic and realize that someone has motive to promote a certain agenda?) Is it possible that the MSM would lie? Wake up.

       That's right. I didn't see any blood. It should be everywhere. 58 dead and over 500 injured. You shouldn't have to convince yourself that a little wet spot you see in blood. If it were real you would certainly see blood everywhere.

       So you don't need evidence. That's fine. I on the other hand need evidence. They have a track record of doing thing like this. I see nothing in that video that would have me believe it wasn't a staged event. I find it odd how people like you have to try so hard to find the smallest bit of what you would consider evidence that it wasn't a staged event. If it were real we wouldn't be having this conversation.

       cute rant, "i dont need evidence"
      </p>
      <p>
       just gave you even more.
      </p>
      <p>
       i seriously think you have to be a troll at this point. the lack of self awareness is so troubling.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is so much evidence that it happened, and none that it didnt (literally - none! find me a video that shows it DIDNT happen) on the other hand we have hundreds of victims speak on camera, dozens of dead people in the grass, videos of the aftermath of dead and dying up close with people tending to their GUNSHOT WOUNDS, people driving victims around with their trucks, videos of ricochet
      </p>
      <p>
       but you... apparently determine there isnt enough blood, and that.. is proof nothing happened. sickening

       Yea. It was a huge production. Did well in the box office. Definitely a better production than the fake show put on in October. And if you consider that a kindergarten level question then you got my point in asking it. That's what it's like when you post links to a video and claim it as proof it's not fake

       it is an absurd question and shows how disconnected you are from reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       the video there is CLEARLY fake. 
the videos of vegas are on a totally different level.
      </p>
      <p>
       i just gave examples of how you could tell it was fake. as usual, you just don't understand anything
      </p>
      <p>
       pretty much what youre saying at this point is that every video of vegas is fake. no, not the event- the videos themselves. like the people who claim CGI planes on 911.

       Vegas was a staged event. You have shown no evidence of it not being a fake staged event. The videos are real. They just lack any evidence of blood or people being shot. You try to make it seem impossible for such a thing to occur but history is full of false flags and hoaxes. I understand your very frustrated because you don't have any unreputable evidence to back up your claim. As for the video I posted a link to, it was a joke to express how ridiculous I think it is to claim what you posted as proof.
