       If the right wasn't so actively hostile to non whites, they wouldn't have such a problem getting their votes. You're mixing up cause and effect, friend. Stop treating and talking about non whites like a cancer and maybe they'll stop voting for your opponents.

       Yeah, I say "bad" words but then, I'm not a child. Please realize that I can express myself w/out swearing, but sometimes it seems to be more appropriate. That may not make sense to you; live in my world (walk in my shoes).

       Blue fin tuna is pretty rad. Bought 2.5 lbs of it and hired a chef to treat a bunch of vet assistants and vets. Cost 1000 bucks (tip was added by me to round up.)

       Forcing different cultures together knowingly causes civil unrest. That is the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've lived and worked in completely different cultures, and in doing so, I had to modify my approach to fit-in and be successful. Normal people don't do that. The result is chaos. That is what TPTB want. It is not for votes, or stupid shit like that. It is for chaos. That's the problem, people will react, and the solution will be greater government control. That is exactly how this game is played.

       Intolerance has nothing to do with it. People naturally notice that which is different. When I walk around town in a kimono, hakama, and sporting my katana, people look at me like WTF! When I'm in Japan, most don't even notice.

       My point it that it is natural for humans to congregate with culturally like-minded individuals, and shun others that don't fit their mold. This is how the world works, and there is nothing wrong with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people consume their dead. That doesn't work in other places. Mixing those groups of peoples would cause civil unrest. Some cultures marry and fuck little kids. Most of our society frowns on that cultural practice. Mix the two together and the shit will hit the fan.

       The opposite is true. Humans are naturally drawn to the novel and exotic. Exposure to difference nurtures innovation and versatility. Even on the biological level, genetic diversity increases survivability, homogeneous populations are vulnerable to being wiped out by disease or environmental changes. A collection of segregates, homogeneous subpopulations are inferior to a population with as many varied combinations and permutations mixture-ratios as possible.

       Novel and exotic does mean you want it in your neighborhood 24/7. People fear change, and that is what you are suggesting is normal. It doesn't work. People have been programed to fear other cultures. Historically, most people tend to only intermingle for economic reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       My other and I come from different ethnicities and cultures that speak different languages. I understand first-hand how this genetic mixing creates better proportioned and more attractive features. I enjoy different cultures, but I know that most people do not feel this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Multiculturalism is not normal. People will always dislike aspects of other cultures. And, that is OK. If you try and force them together, shit will go down. People should be allowed to intermingle on their own terms.

       You say things over and over again, but that doesn't make them true. History is full of the eager mingling and cross-pollination of not just cultures but the people that make them up. Hell, ancient homo sapiens couldn't even keep to their own subspecies, that's why many Europeans and Asians have Neanderthal DNA. That's why there are smooth transitions between ethnic traits as you travel from Europe through the middle east into Africa. There isn't a line in the sand somewhere in Turkey where European features stop and Asian ones begin, nor is there one in Egypt where Arabs stop and Africans start. The entire history of humanity is one of people running off and shacking up with someone from the tribe next door. When humans have access to diversity, they take advantage of it. It's only because the capacity to travel was so limited until the recent present that there was some
       <em>
        relative
       </em>
       homogeneity in any subregion. The only places we see somewhat clear cultural or ethnic boundaries  are in ones with geographical barriers to intermingling like islands or valleys enclosed by mountains.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've been
       <em>
        taught
       </em>
       to fear difference, then taught an ideology which rationalizes that fear as natural with ahistorical pseudo-anthropology, and now you're erroneously projecting on to all people and all history.

       I live among difference and like it. I purposefully change what I do on a daily basis for the contrast and to keep mentally sharp. This culture is what rationalizes and promotes fear. I have nothing to do with that. It is not part of my reality. I am, however, not blind to the reality of others.

       If you force the mixing of cultures, people will fight. History tells us that. Your idealism doesn't fit with how people have been brought up. Maybe one day. But, that is not today. Germany is being torn apart from the inside because people are being forced to intermingle with a different culture that is ideologically worlds apart.

       The road to "eager mingling and cross-pollination of not just cultures" is littered with genocided peoples and a truly staggering amount of dead bodies.

       The entire history of humanity is one of people running off and shacking up with someone from the tribe next door... because if they didn't, they'd be murdered by the conquering horde.

       Some of us would like to avoid more genocide and suffering. Once we have peace among nations, then we can think about trying for an honest form of "globalism". Until then, what you're inviting will lead to the opposite of what you desire!

       People shunning each other is okay??? to an extent. Privacy doesn't stop multicuturalism. What you're doing is saying it while being dismissive of why multiculturalism doesn't work and that's racism and intolerance which doesn't = shunned.

       As though a fucking top-cop knows jack shit about sociology. The only way he knows to smooth out social issues is to beat people up and throw them in cages to make them disappear. "Lick my boots and everything will work out" says the piggy and all the sheep bow down and bleet in agreement.

       There were people here before the American Indians were here too. So by your logic, they deserve to be culturally enriched. As I stated in another comment

       Call me a stupid liberal, but my life experiences have led me to be pro-multiculturalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       My elementary school had a focus on multiculturalism. There were multicultural pot lucks every year with performances by Mexican salsa dancers, Japanese martial artists, Dutch clog dancers... etc
      </p>
      <p>
       We also learned a lot about each other's cultures in class. I specifically remember teaching my peers to make traditional Czech deserts.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot to learn from other cultures and I suspect being introduced to them early helped me avoid major prejudices.

       There's a vast chasm between learning about other cultures, something you can do without any immigration, and drastically altering the demographics of a nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does Germany need millions of Turks to immigrate in order to learn about their culture?

       Maybe we should heed the warnings of those who are sending them.

       It'd be just as much a non consensual social experiment to enforce monoculturism by force. That's exactly what fascism did, because a monocultural society is easier to control than a multicultural one. You only have to craft one message, one doctrine, one system of propaganda. More cultures = more perspectives and ideas = more potential modes of resistance to totalitarian control. When everyone is the same, the masses are predictable one-size tyranny fits all. You can't appeal to religious doctrine with multiple religions, for instance. Inbreeding weakens a culture just as much as it weakens organisms.

       Its not a social experiment, its reality where I live. And there is still some room here in the United States for you to live isolated, if thats where you are. But I would suggest you might be more comfortable somewhere else. Its only going to get more crowded and more multi cultural here.

       t isn't important unless others are capable of respecting each others opinion no matter if they agree or not. I don't even think we need to focus on diversity. If we stop highlighting the non existent problem then it wouldn't be a problem.
The mainstream media, hollywood, the educational institutions have intentionally manifested this problem. It is a non issue. Not all of a group of people think the same.People within a group might share some cosmetic (appearance), cultural and cuisine similarities. It doesn't mean because of the color of their skin they have the same ideological preference. Fundamentally all groups of people want/need similar things. We have a need for food, for shelter, for community. How we operate those things might be different.
I'm a mutt but an American mutt. I have a love for this country and the basic premises it was founded on. I don't like how it has been shaped with the passage of time.
I don't think all is lost, I've come to appreciate the many different cultural aspects you can find within the United States of America, most people I see in life are just trying to do the right thing. Some of them define what is right into terms in which I can't agree with, but I understand that they truly believe it is right.
We just need to find a way to be able to understand one another. I don't think it matters what race you are. If you can't understand the person you are talking to, can't understand their perspective then we can't make a difference. Understanding doesn't mean agreeing with. It just means you are able to see their position. With proper debate we can enact meaningful change.
Holy crap I'm too high to be spewing out this crap but it felt good.

       Your definition of multiculturalism is a huge strawperson, but generally leftists support it because a healthy society requires people to treat other people decently. There have been multiple cultures in America for longer than there's been the US. Ultimately either they live together in peace or the strongest one exterminated the weak. The left chooses the first of those, the right chooses the second.

       Yeah, that was a simplification. A lot of the migration issues can be explained by the global shift to the right these past few decades. Neolibs had to use cultural issues to pose as leftists to their base in order to cover for abandoning the lefts traditional economic egalitarianism. Hispanic immigration to the US wouldn't be half as big without Reagan's Central American genocides or NAFTA's disastrous effect on the Mexican economy. The Mediterranean migrant crisis wouldn't have happened in the first place without Bush and Obama's decision to destroy the Arab world.

       I wouldnâ€™t overgeneralize like you are. Not every leftist believes in living in peace. Not every right-winger believes only the strong survive.

       I'm Canadian from a cosmopolitan city. Diversity is a strength. You can't let just anyone in, but without multiculturalism you wouldn't have awesome things like tacos, Chinese food, and anime. The hard part is ensuring that while you evolve as a society, incorporating various parts of everyone's culture (usually the food and to an extent the holidays - think Chinese/lunar new year) that you don't lose the cohesion that makes such a structure so strong.

       America itself is proof of it. Compare to culturally segregated Europe's experience in the early 20th century. Take all the same cultures of Europe and put them in one country next to each other and all those inter-ethnic antagonisms quickly faded and you end up with the most powerful and influential nation on the planet.

       I don't disagree that hate is generally ignorance. That said, I don't think I need the entire world as my immediate neighbor in order to overcome my ignorance. Also, perhaps America's early "multicultural" success had something to do with its highly selective immigration policy for the first nearly 200 years.

       America didn't have immigration restrictions until the 1880s when they barred Chinese people out of fear that they were lazy, stupid, and would bring the grievous sin of oral sex with them. Shows how much they knew, now that Chinese Americans are among the most educated and hard working immigrant groups in the country and it's universally recognized that blowjobs fucking rule.

       Early American history is proof that diversity makes for a more resilient society because they legislated a slave underclass who could never get citizenship?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess that makes sense from a twisted liberal perspective. Same reason the California types love illegal immigration - otherwise how else would they be able to afford two proto-slave nannies?

       What you don't get is that simply putting different kinds of Europeans in one place was a radical form of multiculturalism at that time. Whiteness was a new concept at the time of colonization, prior to its invention the idea of a shared identity between, say, English and French people, would be considered an absurdity. Within the context of the the-limited multicultural experiment, it was indeed wildly successful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Better still, as America became increasingly multicultural, with black, Arab, Asian, and indigenous people (and women) progressively gaining a voice over the next two centuries, it eventually halted its policies of genocide and slavery and extended the right to vote to all citizens. If you don't think that's progress I don't think there's much of a conversation to be had.

       It's quite a feat of mental gymnastics to, out one side of your mouth, hold up America as the pinnacle of successful multiculturalism, yet out of the other side of your mouth, push a violent agenda of opposing US based "nazis".
      </p>
      <p>
       Is America the multicultural paradise example to the world? Or is it a den of racist nazis? You can't have both, or if you can, then why is such a poor example of "multicultralism" the best you can come up with?

       Only Sith deal in absolutes. America has multiple sides and angles by which you can view it, seeing both positive and negative qualities depending on  the perspective and criteria. Maybe your aversion to multiculturalism is less about the things you say it is, and more about a personal inability to deal with complexity, nuance, and different perspectives.

       I have no aversion to a real and honest attempt at multiculturalism. One that is not just pretty words with sinister designs. It's always nice to get the personal insults without any substance though, it's how you know there's nothing left to be said.

       Marxism didn't work so well in the untied states in dividing people along economic lines. So it's been rebranded along cultural lines. While I agree we should all get along, the goal of Marxists is to create a "stateless  society."  So organizing many cultures under their flag against whomever their current oppressor is is how they operate.

       Divide and conquer, the oldest trick in the book. People are driven by emotions, and the "we should all get along" sentiment taps into thise emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also a massive difference between a 90% homogeneous society with 10% minorities (i.e. most western "multicultural" examples so far) and a 33/33/33 or 50/50 split. For some reason most people think successfully integrating a small minority means that any combination of demographics will work jusy as well. Of course this is not true.
      </p>
      <p>
       One need only look back through history to see that "true" multiculturalism (i.e. the 50/50 kind) has never once been successful, and most examples of mass migration are accompanied by mass death and suffering. There's a reason the Brits put the borders where they did in Asia and ME.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can only conclude that the attempts to force this grand social engineering divide and conquer operation is to incite violence and chaos, and unfortunately there are many useful idiots who are complicit.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this means that we aren't all worthy of respect and dignity or that we can't dream for a distant future where we "all get along", but we should not ignore the words of the eugenics social engineers (they admit it's a divide and conquer control operation) and history.

       Are you kidding? British-created borders were a fucking disaster. The middle east is the most obvious proof of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, how on earth can someone advocating cultural segregation as a necessity accuse others of divide and conquer? This is doublethink turned up to eleven.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, eugenicists were precisely the people trying to purify and divide humanity into homogeneous subpopulations. They were the ones warning against miscegination and genetic diversity. The most concerted and systematic eugenics project in history, Nazi Germany, was nothing short of a drive to create a racially pure ethnostate. I don't know how you could have it any more backwards.

       Yes they were a disaster, that's exactly my point. Why were they a disaster? Because they drew the borders to cut through the existing tribes, thus forcing tribal "multiculturalism" on the population m This of course led to violence and chaos, which in turn made it easier to control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure why you think maintaining a homogeneous society is synonymous with divide and conquer. We're talking about dividing and conquering nations, which are historically homogeneous. By your logic a no-borders globe would still be divided and conquered because the martians would be excluded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the Nazis really hurt the branding of an open eugenics program. That's why today they have to brand it with all kinds of nice flowery language that can make the useful idiots feel good about murdering people. You throw around the word doublethink but you can't seem to recognize it when it's right in front of you.

       Reread my post, I edited it to expand on how the British actively deconstructed and segregated formerly multicultural societies to make them easier to control. The conflicts that followed were the result of their systematic programs to separate and alienate from each other diverse groups who had previously built cultural institutions that supported peaceful coexistence, the sprawling Ottoman empire being the most obvious example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your idea that nations were historically homogeneous is a fantasy. Just because they look the same to you doesn't mean they actually were. National borders shifted constantly based on the palace politics of royalty, not the cultural or ethnic qualities of the masses they ruled over.

       If your premise is that society in the pre-colonial Indian subcontinent was a multicultural paradise, you couldn't be further from the truth. It was a tribal society where you were expected to not associate with other tribes let alone other cultures or races. Just because a handful of peoples of different religious faiths weren't murdering each other at times (often due to imperial decree, i.e. Mughal empire), doesn't make it a multicultural society in the modern sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even at the most peaceful and "diverse" points, the people living there shared virtually identical genetics and lived in self-segregated areas, based on their tribe. Their society today would be considered worse than pre-civil rights era segregated US.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a huge difference between a Chinese society with a mix of Han, Hui, Manchu, etc. and a modern-day so-called "multicultural" society. Compared to the modern notion of "multiculturalism", that Chinese society may as well be genetically and culturally homogeneous - and even then they famously never got along. More blood was spilled over ethnic differences in China than any other area pre 20th century. So why again is it a good idea to tempt fate and try forcing together even more divergent populations? If you think it's a good idea, you are working toward a future of violence and suffering.

       I'd put an even mix in all five of them. That way when they're solving the unique challenges on each planet, each ship has a full range of perspectives to draw from. Much better than arriving on a tropical M class planet with vicious fauna and saying "Ah fuck, I wish we had a Klingon to give some advice, but we sent them all to KV-435 which turned out to be an ice planet."

       It's not. Leftists are mentally ill and don't understand earning anything, so they think they're entitled to give away the things of others by installing a victim hierarchy. The left are feminized children who hate daddy, so they do anything to get at daddy. Ergo, victim hierarchies and a way to destroy daddy's creation.

       My point it that it is natural for humans to congregate with culturally like-minded individuals, and shun others that don't fit their mold. This is how the world works, and there is nothing wrong with that.

       Some people consume their dead. That doesn't work in other places. Mixing those groups of peoples would cause civil unrest. Some cultures marry and fuck little kids. Most of our society frowns on that cultural practice. Mix the two together and the shit will hit the fan.

       Id continue this discussion but it seems you are not honest or are making things up as you go.

       Where are these talking points you keep talking about? Show me. I don't think they exist. That is why I think you are full of shit.

       Yeah, people shun each other all the time. I shun TV watchers. Why? Cause we have nothing in common to talk about. If you try and force me into a room with brainwashed TV watchers, shit will go down fast.

       I don't know what safe spaces are, but honestly, that sounds like a talking point. No?
