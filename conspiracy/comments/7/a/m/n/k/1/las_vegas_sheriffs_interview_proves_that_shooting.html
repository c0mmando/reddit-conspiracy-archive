        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">254</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-11-03 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/stickdog99.html">stickdog99</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Please imagine that you are the sheriff ostensibly in charge of the critically important investigation into <strong>the</strong> most deadly mass shooting in US history.</p>

<p>Your SWAT team supposedly finds a dead suspect in his hotel suite with 23 firearms, all supposedly legally registered to the dead suspect, who also supposedly fired off more than 1,000 rounds from this hotel suite (and/or the adjoining room), killing 59 people and injuring hundreds more.</p>

<p>If all of this is true, over 1,000 brass casings would have been scattered on the floor of Paddock&#39;s hotel suite and/or the adjoining room. And at least 9, if not 10, empty clips would also have been found somewhere in those two rooms. By examining where these clips and brass casings were found and carefully listening to all audio recordings of the shooting, dozens of investigators would then recreate the shooting and try to account for any discrepancies in the number and types of brass casings found and the bullets collected from the victims&#39; bodies, the music venue, and the Mandalay Bay hotel. With all 23 guns in evidence, your ballistics experts would easily determine which guns had been fired during the event, which had not been fired, and which had jammed while they were fired, forcing Paddock to switch to another weapon. With this information, these same experts would then try to explain the otherwise unexplained gaps in Paddock&#39;s firing. Such a comprehensive forensic examination would be critical to your investigation in order to help explain Paddock&#39;s motives and mindset, but even more importantly for developing the best response methods for stopping or at least limiting such deadly attacks in the future. </p>

<p>So what has the FBI&#39;s and LVPD&#39;s &quot;investigation&quot; yielded more than a full month after the attack, according to Sheriff Lombardo?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-vegas-shooting-sheriff-20171102-story.html">http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-vegas-shooting-sheriff-20171102-story.html</a></p>

<p><em>&quot;Paddock expended more than 1,000 rounds over the 10 minutes he fired, in what authorities were able to identify as 12 bursts. The pauses between them, Lombardo said, could have resulted from either jammed or faulty weapons, or the need to replace clips as they were emptied.&quot;</em></p>

<p>LOL. How stupid do they think we are?</p>

<p>Exactly how many rounds did Paddock fire in his hotel suite? Exactly how many rounds did he fire from the adjacent room? Exactly which of his 23 guns were fired? Did any of these weapons jam? Were any of these weapons faulty? Did Paddock replace the clips in any of these weapons or did he simply select another already loaded rifle to continue his motiveless rampage? <strong>Are we really expected to believe that nobody has even attempted to answer any of these questions more than a month later and that none of the answers to any of these questions can or will ever be known?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s the thing I don&#39;t get. If you were covering up what really happened, wouldn&#39;t you at least try to imagine what someone in your position would be doing were he not covering this up?</p>

<p>It&#39;s as if Lombardo knows for a fact that nothing he says will ever matter since nobody will ever question anything he says. </p>

<p><em>&quot;Paddock was losing money.&quot;</em></p>

<p>OK. How do you know this? How much money did he lose? How was he losing all this money? How much did he have left?</p>

<p><em>&quot;Multiple hard drives were missing.&quot;</em></p>

<p>OK. So why what happened to these hard drives? If Paddock removed them, what did he do with them? Were the computers operable by flash drives? If so, what was on the flash drives? If not, why did Paddock have multiple inoperable computers in his room? Why not just dump the entire inoperable computer or at least leave it where you destroyed the hard drive?</p>

<p><em>&quot;Both Campos and the first cops to arrive on the scene dithered around for a few minutes before getting to the right floor.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Exactly how hard is it to get a the true stories about this straight? What time did Campos use the elevator to investigate? Remember that all Mandalay Bay elevators, including the freight elevators, have security cameras. So what time stamp is shown when Campos first responded? What time stamp is shown when the cops first used the elevators to respond? What time stamps are shown on the radio transmissions, 911 calls, dispatch recordings, and Campos&#39; cell phone calls?   </p>

You are correct, he lost all cred when he let the scary fbi guy(a Clinton buddy) start telling him what to say</p>

<p>Third, we may never get the complete truth, the advantage we have is, it&#39;s 2017(as opposed to &#39;63 and &#39;11) and the info is out there and ppl love leaking:) Godspeed</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What bugs me is the inherent conflicts in &quot;Paddock is the only suspect&quot;, &quot;Paddock was meticulous about planning and hiding his goal&quot; and &quot;We can&#39;t release any details at all because it&#39;s still an active investigation&quot;.</p>

<p>If he&#39;s the only suspect and hid his mission so well from everybody, just why do the authorities have to treat this as if there was something to hide?  Are they looking to nail random people who crossed paths with him as accessories somehow?</p>

<p>&quot;Paddock was losing money&quot; -- surely by now you could provide a fairly detailed cash flow analysis of Paddock&#39;s finances for the last five years to back this up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They know Paddock was losing money beause Mandalay Bay knew he was laundering money through their casino.  Someone doesn&#39;t spend that much time in a casino without surveillance and security connecting dots about who they are and where the money is coming from.  Paddock was likely doing this for the FBI/CIA, which, if true, Mandalay Bay would also likely know due to the amount of surveillance they would have been able to collect on Paddock.</p>

<p>This is a major reason Mandalay Bay would want to control the narrative, as it implicates them in crime and could easily lead to sensitive information unravelling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re def on the right track. Although, I&#39;m not leaning toward him working for the feds. I believe he was working as part of a criminal enterprise. MB found out about it and alerted LE. Or, MB knew about it and turned their heads the other way because this was a high powered criminal organization. The Feds ultimately intervened. But, the whole thing went awry and both had to wash their hands of it. </p>

<p>Now this may seem completely out there and I&#39;m just completely spit balling here, but what if SP was involved in child trafficking? Weinstein was exposed the next week-- with other Hollywood types to follow. A major child trafficking arrest a week before could look good for the Feds. In the end, they settled for his brother. Of course, I&#39;m sure many ppl could easily poke holes in that story. I literally just came up with it as I was typing this. </p>

<p>In any case, I do think SP was part of criminal activity, MB knew about it and this was a bust that went terribly wrong. Wouldn&#39;t make more sense for Paddock to shoot at security and the two police officers (and God knows who else that was there)? Then go all nutcase on everyone as he knew he was about to be arrested for ... whatever (drugs, guns, child porn)? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve seen a few brief mentions of a money laundering theory but they didn’t really go into depth... so I just assumed they meant the casino owner(s) were doing some criminal shit and needed someone to launder the illegal money back into the casino so the government wouldn’t get suspicious... and I thought they “hired” Paddock to do it cause he used to work for the IRS and knew how to avoid detection... but the more I read, the more I realize I have no idea what people are talking about when they mention about the money laundering theory...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the casinos can tell if regulars are laundering money, but they may or may not know where the money comes from.</p>

<p>Someone like Paddock, playing video poker full time, is likely losing a small amount of money over time, as the machines are programmed this way.  If his money is gotten illegally, Paddock doesn&#39;t mind losing a little bit to have all of his bills changed through the casino (he gives them dirty cash and gets chips, which he turns in later for clean cash).  If he doesn&#39;t lose money then the casino has incentive to shut him down, as they should know everything about their regular gamblers, but by Paddock losing some money the casino has an incentive to look the other way and make profit.  It would be very difficult to prove wrongdoing by a casino with something like this.</p>

<p>The CIA has been funding itself through all sorts of ill gotten means for a very long time.  Clandestine arms sales and laundering in casinos are absolutely in their playback, and so are honeypot sting operations.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that the FBI and CIA were not involved with Paddock, but it is extremely difficult to argue that Paddock wasn&#39;t laundering money based on his work history and the amounts of money talked about surrounding the case.  Professional gamblers who win regularly don&#39;t play video poker, they play against humans.</p>

<p><em>&quot;We are very confident that there was only one shooter in that suite.&quot;</em></p>

<p>WHY? HOW? There are no hallway security cameras. How could you know that nobody left that room at 10:15pm – two minutes before police arrived – if you don&#39;t have hallway surveillance? Because Jesus Campos, the only eyewitness, said so? The same Jesus Campos for whom there is no credible record of him reporting the incident? The same Jesus Campos whose story and timeline has changed a half dozen times, and the one version we heard directly from him (well, via Ellen) has more holes in it than any other version? The same Jesus Campos who hung out and watched police repeatedly tell the wrong timeline in his press conferences for 5 days, then left the country for the weekend, only to return on Sunday night and <em>finally</em> tell the police that he was actually shot <em>before</em> the shooting? The same Jesus Campos who, according to the story he told on Ellen, walked past the drilled through peephole and hallway camera cart – not once, but TWICE – and wasn&#39;t observant enough to notice? The same Jesus Campos who can&#39;t be trusted by MGM to speak to the press? I&#39;m not saying Campos was in on it, but if his witness account is the only thing giving police such high confidence that there was only one shooter in that room, they have a problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The weapon side of the investigation is quite possibly the least important side of the entire event. Now granted the feds have unlimited resources so you are going to have active investigation angles from all over. Yet the bulk of that investigation is still going to focus on the time sensitive side vs gear they have locked up in some federal evidence room. </p>

<p>They need to pour over hours of footage to see if/when and most of all who Paddock interacted with during his stay. They need to track where he was and look into his entire past fallowing every little connection, maybe going back years. They need to do forensic investigations into his business and financial dealing. Then do the same for anyone/everyone connect to him in some way. Being that&#39;s all stuff that is important right now with a real risk of cover ups, changes and where there is possibly accessories or even accessories after the fact to the crime. That&#39;s the most important thing right now, not how many shots where from each window. </p>

<p>The guns are not going anywhere and any ballistic sort of info is overkill at this point if the only suspect is Paddock.  What does Paddock spend X time in this window with gun A and then shot gun B from this angle gain as far as expanding the investigations? It&#39;s good info and part of the reason we have seen the FBI walking shoulder to shoulder over the entire street and marking all the impacts etc at the venue site. Yet it&#39;s still more important to look into his money and other human like connections first. Even with unlimited resources there is still only X number of lab hours in a given day and a huge backlog of cases. </p>

<p>There are different teams but there is still only, as a said, a certain amount of hours in a given day and a huge back logs of cases for a lab to process. Cases where ballistic sort of evidence is much more important to the investigation than a case like the vegas shooting where the prime suspect is already dead. So for example take the Walmart shooting we just had in Colorado where a suspect has been arrested and I&#39;m guessing, even if they don&#39;t say it (classic law enforcement), that weapons where recovered. Now odds are it&#39;s not going to the same federal lab, I&#39;m just using it as an example of another case
<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/neighbors-alleged-walmart-shooter-angry-rude-50903352">http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/neighbors-alleged-walmart-shooter-angry-rude-50903352</a></p>

<p>If weapons where recovered that case alone would be ahead of the Paddock case being they want to tie the guns (if recovered of course) to the shooter right away. Vegas case? Again, dead suspect and anyone else tied to the case is going to be tracked down in ways that are not ballistic based on what gun jammed where and why. I&#39;m sure the feds did preliminary report actions on the weapons. Your standard finger prints and other stuff like serial numbers etc that could point to other suspects or people connected to the case. </p>

<p>Yet a deep dive into the ballistics about all the bullets, jams, recording etc isn&#39;t a main focus so that side of the case will keep getting bumped by other cases that need the lab time more. It will still be done at some point but I&#39;m not surprised it&#39;s a lower priority. Then of course there is always the simple fact that even if they had more info, they would not share it anyways. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ballistics about all the bullets, jams, recording etc may not be a main focus for the FBI, but it <em>should</em> be a main focus for the ATF, who have been involved since Day 1. The FBI has had the guns at their crime lab since early October, so they should, have an idea of how many (and which) guns jammed. </p>

<p>At the Tuesday, October 3rd press conference, when asked about the weaponry, Sheriff Lombardo said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The question was, what are the modifications associated with the weaponry? ATF is participating in that evaluation. I can&#39;t give you an answer on whether any of them are automatic or not. But we are aware of a device called a bump-stock. And that enables an individual to speed up the discharge of ammunition. I don&#39;t want to give you any more details than that, but in partner with the FBI, the ATF, they are sending those weapons back east to the FBI crime lab for further evaluation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was October 3rd. Today is November 3rd. As far as I know, there have been no updates since then about the weaponry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the ballistics experts need to be interviewing Paddock&#39;s neighbors  for the first 6 months of the investigation. Once they get that out the way, then they can examine the guns and bullets. The same is true of the coroner. He needs to be out beating the bushes to see if Paddock has any other associates. That&#39;s why he has never released the official time or cause of Paddock&#39;s death. That&#39;s the least of the concerns of this investigation right now. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL. How the fuck do you know for sure that nobody was in the room firing with Paddock of you don&#39;t forensically examine the guns?</p>

<p>You are a crack investigator. You want to ignore all the physical evidence of means, motive and opportunity. Instead, just assume that Paddock and only Paddock is 100% guilty regardless of any physical evidence and proceed from there. Right? </p>

<p>Why try to confirm that Paddock acted alone by carefully inspecting the putative scene of the crime? Why try to understand how or why the perpetrators committed this terrible mass shooting? No, instead we need to simply <strong>assume</strong> Paddock&#39;s guilt and put our focus on Paddock&#39;s personal interactions. LOL. Thanks for the laugh.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>don&#39;t forensically examine each and every gun, each and every casing, and each and every bullet hole?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn&#39;t happen. You think the crime lab is going to post process every single round casing they find? Going to check ballistics of every impact mark found while look for trace evidence, then laser range it back to the hotel, then...... no, it&#39;s not going to happen. They will check some, they might check all if there is other evidence that forces their hand but that&#39;s going to need to come first. Don&#39;t me wrong, they gather up everything and catalog it along with pictures and so on. </p>

<p>Yet means, motive and opportunity is not found in if this random gun jammed. It&#39;s not found in a bullet hole in the wall. As much as the time line gets wonky in a per min by min sort of way the over all scene was pretty much controlled and locked down the police rather quickly. I&#39;m guessing they are pretty confident Paddock was the shooter. Leaving only the human element left to dig into as to why and to look for possible co-conspirators. The human element is also very time sensitive, the forensics side of this case is not, at all. They have the gear, they have the location they can always go back too and a dead suspect. </p>

<p>So yeah, it&#39;s going to get bumped back by other cases. </p>

<p>Still, Sheriff Lombardo has publicly claimed that Paddock personally paid for his 32-135 suite.

And how did Paddock gain access to it? And why would he have even wanted access to it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There correct, but I would agree there just not modeled very well. The 3D models look stretched out. In the TMZ video at 0:24 you can see the room directly across the way from room 32134 and the service exit to the right of it. Look at the lights and the room number labels right below them. Also notice in the Fox video that the light that is above up 32134 is dangling down.</p>

<p>The door you see on the TMZ video across 32-134 is the stairwell door. To the right of it is the main entrance of 32-135. 
I found a correct plan of <a href="http://www.lasvegas.net/UserFiles/Image/mandalaybayvistasuitefloorplan_644.gif">32-135</a> and combined it with what I think could be <a href="http://www.lasvegas.net/UserFiles/Image/mandalaybay550drroomfloorplan_644.gif">32-134</a></p>

<p>&quot;[Stephen Paddock] came in to the centre around 11am last Thursday and checked in at the desk, but didn&#39;t stop for lunch like he usually does,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Instead, he went straight up to the counter to speak with the cook and asked her about an enchiladas dish she cooks - he wanted to know how she made it,&quot; Mr Meland said.</p>

<p>&quot;After that he left. No one took any notice of him. It wasn&#39;t until later after what he did that we realised he drove to Vegas that afternoon. Everyone at the centre is shocked.&quot;</p>

<p>So if this witness is correct, that means Paddock had his car valet parked at Mandalay Bay on Monday the 25th, then drove back to Mesquite to get an enchilada recipe from a cook at the local senior center, then drove back to Vegas that afternoon. Does that seem weird to anyone else?</p>

But before that I remembered seeing this article -  <a href="https://m.frasercoastchronicle.com.au/news/marilou-speaks-gunman-lay-bed-moaning-screaming/3231925/">https://m.frasercoastchronicle.com.au/news/marilou-speaks-gunman-lay-bed-moaning-screaming/3231925/</a></p>

<p>Towards the end it says witnesses saw him on Thursday the 28th at the Comminitu Senior Center in Mesquite, which he frequented.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the article they include this statement from one witness:</p>

<p>&quot;[Stephen Paddock] came in to the centre around 11am last Thursday and checked in at the desk, but didn&#39;t stop for lunch like he usually does,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Instead, he went straight up to the counter to speak with the cook and asked her about an enchiladas dish she cooks - he wanted to know how she made it,&quot; Mr Meland said.</p>

<p>&quot;After that he left. No one took any notice of him. It wasn&#39;t until later after what he did that we realised he drove to Vegas that afternoon. Everyone at the centre is shocked.&quot;</p>

<p>So if this witness is correct, that means Paddock had his car valet parked at Mandalay Bay on Monday the 25th, then drove back to Mesquite to get an enchilada recipe from a cook at the local senior center, then drove back to Vegas that afternoon. Does that seem weird to anyone else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought of this a few weeks ago when I was at the indoor range shooting my AR. The range has proper ventilation and yet my booth would absolutely fill with smoke after going through a 30rnd mag of 556.   It made me think about the smoke generation from multiple AR’s with bigger mags and imagined two scenarios where one is him shooting outside the window to avoid the insane amount of smoke or the other where he stays indoors to avoid muzzle flash but endured so much smoke that the smoke alarms would have gone off.   Since he was never seen shooting rounds outside the window nor did the hotel smoke alarms go off, it didn’t happen.   It’s not possible to shoot an AR inside a hotel room and not set off the smoke detection system.   Even if detection was disabled, a large smoke extraction system would be required to clear the air enough for a person to even see to shoot a gun.   None of this is plausible at all which makes me question the entire ground situation which ultimately leads me to a large false flag operation designed to distract from JFK files showing the truth behind one of the largest conspiracies ever conspired.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m fully on board with the fact I believe there is SO much more to this story but I&#39;d like to ask, how do we know there aren&#39;t investigations going on? I fully believe there should be so much more info released by this time but does anyone know they aren&#39;t doing anything about it?</p>
