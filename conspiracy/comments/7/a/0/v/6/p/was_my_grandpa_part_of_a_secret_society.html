       This is a throwaway so people know I'm not trying to get karma.
A few years ago my parents house was in a flood zone and I was helping my mom pack up boxes in case the water broke the flood level(My dad was over seas with the military at the time). While I was going through some old paper work I found a document with my grandpas name on it that said he was awarded membership into "Some group name I didn't read" for the advancements of science and religion(Or something along those lines). I didn't get to read the whole document since my mom grabbed it from and told me it was just an award he got and then she packed it away. When I pushed her about she just kept shrugging off the questions saying she didn't know. The only other thing I noticed was a big golden pentacle at the top center of the page.
Does anyone have information about this group or if it is just some weird award given to people?
      </p>

       Edit: Sorry for the lack of information. I've tried to ask my mother about it a few times but she always says she has no idea about and it got lost which I cant really believe. Yes my Grandfather is dead so I cant ask him anything about it. They only other information I can give is that my grandfather was originally from Bergen, Norway and lived in Boston and New York for awhile when he immigrated in the 30-40ish before he moved to North Dakota. My whole family is Lutheran so I can only assume he was. He was a writer when he lived in Boston and I'm not sure what he did when he lived in New York but I know he was only there for a short time.

       Edit 2: I tried talking with my uncles about it. One uncle just said he was part of the Illuminati but hes kind of a drunk so I think hes just making stuff up. My other uncle told me that he was part of a group called the Sons of Norway but that is pretty common group that a lot of people around here are a part of. My mother is coming into town on Friday and I'm going to try to pry some information out of here.
