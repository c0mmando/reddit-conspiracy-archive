       And
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       he actually been seen or made any videos, or waved out the window? The personality in his recent tweets doesn't seem to reflect the usually measured and matter-of-fact personality he seemed to have, as an informational catalyst. Is he just playing it a little more loose because he's mad? Am I sorely out of the loop on this?

       Am I the only one who sees the different language he uses on Twitter compared to interviews? In my opinion, he's a better than average speaker, and he isn't dumb. Some stuff
       <em>
        he says
       </em>
       on Twitter doesn't feel like it would actually come out of his mouth.

       And Hannity of all people? It's like they're trying to re-brand him as a hard right hyper partisan to discredit him to half the population. He used to be aggressively objective and apolitical, and now you can't distinguish his tweets from Alex Jones. I don't think he's dead, just temporarily under their control, so they are trying to undermine his reputation for the future.

       God this stuff will never end. He's been giving interviews and meeting with people for the last several months! If he was dead it would be an international incident. The amount of people and organizations needed to be involved in the cover-up is fucking insane!
      </p>
      <p>
       Use your heads people. Is it more likely that Julian was secretly killed/captured and the US govt, Ecuador, Britain, the rest of the world's intel agencies, all of Wikileaks staff, all of Assange's contacts/friends/family are in on it or oblivious? Or is it more likely that he's alive and has come under fire from a bullshit narrative that paints his life's work as a Russian intel op and demonizes him personally after being persecuted for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now he's fucking pissed after having his internet pulled for a while and hearing slander every day in the news. And people can't believe he isn't going after the low hanging fruit that is bashing Trump, but instead  continues to hammer on the people that put him in this position?

       Old picture. Or you got them now! The illuminati killed him but instead of using a real photo of Julian they got a body double. Wouldve gotten away with it too if not for you meddling conspiracy theorists. Next BS theory.

       Hmm a video glitch/hiccup...or the most insanely complex coverup in history involving multiple countries, Intel agencies, all of Wikileaks, a CGI Julian, several reporter interviews, faking a live fucking speech from the embassy balcony that hundreds saw. Wonder what Occam's Razor has to say on the issue?
