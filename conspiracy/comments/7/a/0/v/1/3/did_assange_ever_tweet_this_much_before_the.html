I don&#39;t think he&#39;s dead, just temporarily under their control, so they are trying to undermine his reputation for the future. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>God this stuff will never end. He&#39;s been giving interviews and meeting with people for the last several months! If he was dead it would be an international incident. The amount of people and organizations needed to be involved in the cover-up is fucking insane! </p>

<p>Use your heads people. Is it more likely that Julian was secretly killed/captured and the US govt, Ecuador, Britain, the rest of the world&#39;s intel agencies, all of Wikileaks staff, all of Assange&#39;s contacts/friends/family are in on it or oblivious? Or is it more likely that he&#39;s alive and has come under fire from a bullshit narrative that paints his life&#39;s work as a Russian intel op and demonizes him personally after being persecuted for years. </p>

<p>And now he&#39;s fucking pissed after having his internet pulled for a while and hearing slander every day in the news. And people can&#39;t believe he isn&#39;t going after the low hanging fruit that is bashing Trump, but instead  continues to hammer on the people that put him in this position? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Old picture. Or you got them now! The illuminati killed him but instead of using a real photo of Julian they got a body double. Wouldve gotten away with it too if not for you meddling conspiracy theorists. Next BS theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm a video glitch/hiccup...or the most insanely complex coverup in history involving multiple countries, Intel agencies, all of Wikileaks, a CGI Julian, several reporter interviews, faking a live fucking speech from the embassy balcony that hundreds saw. Wonder what Occam&#39;s Razor has to say on the issue?</p>
