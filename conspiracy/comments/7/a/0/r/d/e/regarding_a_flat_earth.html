       So I have a question regarding flat earth theory. I'm willing to accept that people who subscribe believe that the earth is flat, but what about the other objects we can see in the sky? Are they also discs? How do flat earthers account for their orbital mechanics, that you can observe from your own back yard with your own telescope?

       This is not a direct comment on the question but it's a nice animation showing the earths movement relative to the stars.

       The big bang theory is exactly that- a theory, based on observable evidence we have so far it is but one possibilty. And if it is disproven, it will be discarded with the trash. Until such time as it is proven or disproven, it remains just that.

       Well, sure, but I have yet to see an evidence of a flat earth, if that is what you are suggesting. It's just a lot of people who say it's "this" with no evidence, no peer review, and that are not backed up by widely observed data.

       It is very individualized. I have typically pointed to it being a way to try to prove the bible as truth (particularly Genesis). However, as others have mentioned too, it often stems from distrust of NASA/the (shadow/deep/dark)governement/NWO/Illuminati or maybe even the Bilderburgers..
      </p>
      <p>
       One fella I work with, I asked him straight up if he went out in space far enough to see the earth and see it's indeed round, would he believe then. His answer was "well, maybe". But he still doesn't believe it's "possible" to get into space. Mind, he also doesn't drink tap water because he is paranoid abot the flouride.

       Ultimately, the reasons why they believe flat-earthism are irrelevant. There are pictures of earth and the moon in one image taken from beyond the moon. Flat earthers attempt to counter it is usually to say "it's fake and I can't believe they can do it, it's impossible". This is a logical fallacy called argument from incredulity. The burden of proof is on deniers to prove said claim, but they have constantly been crushed by this burden as their arguments amount to nothing but heresay and gibberish, that they believe if they say it enough it will be true. And Photoshop. You can be guarantueed they will have a video on youtube with the picture and they will be wiggling their cursor around a pixel they don't like saying it's fake! it's fake! but still, it is an argument from incredulity that does nto even start to meet the burden of proof.

       Well, the flat earthers believe that the "edge" is these giant ice mountains that can not be scaled. Maybe there are other ideas but that is mostly what I have heard. And they believe there is a huge army protecting it so people can't get too close to the mountains to prevent people from finding out that it's in fact flat. So if it were true there would be literally a million+ person army protecting it..........
