       I find it funny, the same day that a post attempting hits the front page showing how they are finding a pattern of certain users that are cross posting from the Donald(fake accounts that only make posts and comment
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       in their posts or the posts of the others doing the same thing
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/79y2tj/the_rconspiracy_conspiracy/">

       ), which is a large amount of what has made it to the top of our front page.. but it's top minds that point out what topic has been completely pushed down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aren't we the ones noticing this and pointing this out?? I realize some of these are legit posts, but some are also blatantly just trying to slide the sub.. I knew the posts today felt a bit artificial, but I didn't look for an actual pattern.

       As we all expected, r/the_donald2.0 is doing everything in their power to deflect from the subject at hand.
      </p>

       Summary
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, you saw that correctly. Not a single post on r/conspiracy's top 25 right now is, in fact, discussing the actual conspiracy at hand right now. And a bloody 21, yes, 21, of the posts are popular right-wing talking points. And, for icing on the cake, u/Orangutan owns the top two posts (right-wing link spammer).
      </p>
      <p>
       But everytime someone mentions the fact that r/conspiracy has been taken over by right-wing propaganda, the mods quickly deny it. Methinks there is another conspiracy at hand...
