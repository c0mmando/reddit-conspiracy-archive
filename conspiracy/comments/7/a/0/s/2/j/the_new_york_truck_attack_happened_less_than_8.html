       People with a lot of money (MGM, etc..) stand to lose a lot of money in lawsuits if it comes out that their actions (or negligence of actions) could have possibly prevented any or all of the shooting.
The entire MGM brand of properties would have to be shutdown (Luxor, Exalibur, Aria, MGM Grand, Bellagio, Circus Circus, Mandalay Bay) if they ended up having to pay hundreds of millions in lawsuits.
Not to mention all of the trickle down that the casinos bring to the community in terms of taxes, tourists, entertainment, etc...

       Dude, I just looked through your comment history and you’ve spent A LOT of time commenting this morning with basically the same message: you believe the official story on everything and anyone who questions is an idiot. That’s fine if you feel that way, but why are you spending so much time on this sub trying to convince people not to question things? You’re like an atheist that goes around telling religious people how dumb they are. You don’t KNOW anymore than anyone else. You have an opinion based on your own reasoning but your certainty and arrogance make you just as ignorant as anyone who accepts conspiracy theories as fact without scrutiny.

       Right on.  The NYT compilation was nicely done and I accept the single shooter story.  Maybe that makes me a rube/patsy/sheeple, whatever.

      <p>
       I think the lack of info is due to corporate lawyers viewing ANY info as lawsuit ammunition so their first instinct is to not let any information out.  Since most the good data from this is not from 'public' cameras but MGM-controlled then that explains the total lack of public info that surely exists.  Ironic that a private corporation is doing a better job of preventing leaks than government organizations.

       It does seem that there is a lot of Paddock background stuff that is being swept under the rug, I'm assuming by the FBI.  The theory that he was a gun smuggler, undercover agent etc seems plausible and being covered up to save embarrassment that of someone's agent going off the reservation.

       That doesn't hold water. In the interest of public safety footage can be released. I would say calming the American public that this has so semblance of reality would qualify.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this dude was gambling in the casino the night before there is no downside for anyone to release a still or even a short clip of him. It would not solve their problem but it would calm some people. Even normies think this stinks like Amy Schumers beef hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't need anyone's permission. There are things they have to hold back, lots of things, but a month out of a fucking lone wolf attack they can almost lay all of it out. If there were more arrests to be made they should have had time to get around to that by now. So far, no other arrests so what are we waiting for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now I'm not sure I believe Paddock was actually alive for any of this. Show me that I'm wrong FBI.

       Dude killed 59 people and injured over 500. The casino can't even release a few snaps of him with luggage because they are afraid of comprising their casino?  They would be comprising 1 camera out of the 1000's they have watching everything going on.

       Yeah, people make mistakes all the time.    I also wouldn't dispute the stupidity of plenty of people involved in law enforcement.  How many people were involved in releasing that date?  Who was it? Where did the information come from?  As I said, it can be as simple as a mistake from the hotel.  But you don't know, so why err on the side of hysterically accusing the government of a massive murder and cover-up?

       No.  The graphic photo of Stephen Paddock's bloody face after he shot himself in the head.
      </p>
      <p>
       This one:

       (GRAPHIC)
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you see the problem with the logic you're using?  ANYONE can lie.  The underlying premise you're using here is that anyone saying there was no conspiracy and that Paddock did it is lying.  That's not a good way to look for the truth in a situation.

       My point: gun behind him indicates siting or standing up when shot fired. However riffle across his legs condradicts standing up, and position in relationship to the chair in front of him makes sitting with his legs out seem awkward and unlikely.

       Paddock had access to footage from at least two cameras outside his room, presumably to monitor any incoming law enforcement personnel. There was also a camera inside the room which investigators believe was used to film Paddock’s shooting. The FBI is currently in the process of reviewing all of the footage

       No. People were perfectly fine accepting the fact that Dylan Roof and that Charlottesville guy were motivated by an ideology. It has
       <em>
        nothing to do with race
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        everything to do with ideology
       </em>
       . Do you really think that if it came out that the Vegas Shooter was a Muslim convert motivated by ISIS that people would insist that he was just a loser piece of shit and deny that he was motivated by Islamic fundamentalism?
      </p>
      <p>
       People who make every god damn thing about race are
       <em>
        racists
       </em>
       , full stop. I don’t care what color they are, how many PhD’s they have, how much oppression they’ve personally faced, or what their “lived experience” is—if they think in terms of race, they are racists.

       Do you think the people who have been caught lieing again and again are lieing or the innocent victims who were being shot at from multiple angles and elevations? How about the survivors mysteriously dieing since the attack (not due to gunshots)?

       I didn't make the rules. Those are laws. Facts. Case is OPEN. I don't care who takes me seriously. With a little research you could find this info on ur own or you could simply goto the police station in ur town and ask for evidence on an open case and they will tell you the same thing. I didn't state my OPINION at all. I gave facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       My opinion on the matter is that they could show us something. Something that wouldn't affect the case at all. Example, maybe him at a gas station or rental car place. Anything at all. But we get nothing and they do it under those umbrellas I told you above. Don't shoot the messenger.

       My logic? You mean the law? Sure go ahead and tell me genius. Or you could simply educate urself and not shoot the messenger. Now, when I say the footage exist that means that is what LE said and that if Paddock was in MB there is footage of him there.

       So you clearly understand how easy it is to make people believe in things that are not true. How is it so hard for you to understand that your government is also engaging in these efforts, when they have a lock record of doing so?
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead you blame the victims that have "died of natural causes" for contradicting what the controllers would like the narrative to be? The amount of times you've defended one of the worse cover up stories in recent history in this thread alone tells us you are nothing more than disinformation. Your trying too hard and making it obvious.

       No one's pretending it didn't happen, there just haven't been any recent developments in the investigation so there no reason to keep reporting on it. Do you seriously think the news media doesn't report something months for months after it happened that they're trying to make you forget it happened?

       Do you really want to know, or are you just being a troll?
      </p>
      <p>
       Any and all footage from inside the casino or taken by casino cameras of the exterior is private property of the casino.  They technically don't even have to turn it over to the authorities without a warrant or a subpoena (though usually they do just to be cooperative).  Given that Paddock's suite was huge and that floor caters to guests who probably want privacy, there isn't likely to have been anyone milling in the hallways to record from there with their phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       The casino is unlikely to release a lot of unedited footage to the public because right know they have a high civil litigation exposure and the last thing they want to do is fuel that with video.
      </p>
      <p>
       By contrast, the NYC attack happened outside in public on a crowded street trafficked by tourists who are routinely taking video with their cameras.  Public traffic cameras and public surveillance cameras would have been operating too.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the short answer is LV footage is privately owned and the private owner is incentived to keep it secret as long as possible due to litigation exposure.  The NYC footage is public and carries with it an obligation to make it available to the public, and does not face the same civil litigation risk as the LV footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you know.

       I'm usually the first person to call BS on people claiming false flags, and am highly critical of the people who claim those things, but I have some heavy suspicions about this recent attack. And idk if you've seen the interviews with the "witness's" but they seem so odd. This one lady who was a community college student kept talking about the same things like she was being directed to hit certain talking points. The one that stood out the most was how she kept talking about seeing dead bodies, but with no emotion whatsoever and certainly not frazzled at all like a normal person would be if they just witnessed a terrorist attack. It all seems so damn convenient. My ears perked up when they interviewed this girl while the tv was on in my gym locker room and I usually tune these type of things out especially CNN/Fox News. But this woman seemed off. And like I said I think the people who claim fals flag attacks and talk about paid actors etc. (a la sandy hook, Vegas) are fucking looney.

       I think we are all doing the best we can. Its possible the official narrative is true, he just by himself decided to commit the worst mass shooting in us history and not tell anyone why, possibly for no reason. But its good we have people watching carefully for cracks in that story because it is a strange story. The Texas shooter in the 60s was very similar, but at least he left a note saying he couldnt explain why he did it, and ended up having a brain tumor.

       Are you kidding me?!! How do we know the gun was fake and not a real one? It was clearly staged by liberal media so they could prove that he wasnt a terrorist and he was just suicidal! /s
      </p>
      <p>
       But seriously its probably cause this event was much more clear cut and a lot of the witnesses and video recording of the event, witnesses, AND the perpetrator. Rather than just videos the event and victims, which can lead to a lot of guessing and ideas about the person who did it.

       I only watched a few videos, but wasnt the firing in short bursts (of 5-7 shots in rapid succession)? I am sure that semi automatic and full automatic weapons have the ability to fire that fast, and the fire rate wasn't extremely high like a machine gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I first saw it assumed it was an AK or at least any automatic rifle because of the volume of fire. I don't think rapid fire = machine gun but I really don't have anything to back that up with.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it were gov't agencies what was their motive? I hear a lot about it being a conspiracy, but no one likes to mention what people were conspiring to do. It would make a little more sense if government officials quickly came out to support gun control, how ever no one seems to be pushing it and mostly conservatives are in control of the government at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not trying to argue, I'd like to learn more about what possible agendas are being pushed after such a violent mass shooting.

       So you disagree with the facts.... and that's why you believe the mainstream narrative? Interesting. At what point did you say to yourself "yep, that's completely legit. Nothing to see here."  What piece of evidence did that for you?
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you go about manufacturing stats that you are selling as normal deaths. You aren't looking hard enough, everyone who was there was repeating that they were being followed and surrounded by in fire. They could not run away because it was not coming from one location. This is pretty simple stuff man I think you're overthinking it trying to rationalize a narrative riddled with issues.
