<p>Really? I was digging your conversation with these guys right up until here. Now I wonder about your reasoning skills as much as I do FE&#39;ers. Perhaps you did not give much thought to this statement or are new to conspiracy research or or perhaps you don&#39;t fully understand the meaning of the word conspiracy.</p>

<p>btw &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; was a term pushed by the fbi and cia to label anyone questioning the assassination of JFK. It was and has been utilized by governments to write off people.</p>

<p>If I hadn&#39;t actually met a flat earther irl I would say it was a psyop designed to muddy the waters of conspiracy research. Sadly these guys are out there, I wish I could shoot them up into space so we could just get past it, but they probly wouldn&#39;t even believe their own eyes.</p>

<p>Weren&#39;t anyone questioning the motives or events of the day in ancient Greece...I am going to assume you did not put much thought into that statement.</p>

IF the earth really is flat, then there is no universe...no space aliens...no where to escape to once the psychos in charge destroy this place. IF the earth is flat, and we are trapped in this bubble, then we must learn to work together. If the earth is flat, then EVERYTHING that we&#39;ve been told in school is a lie.

    <div class="md"><p>Something maybe you are not aware of but prior belief systems of the Vedic tradition connected to intuitive understanding of the Earth and they describe what is the reason for eclipses. And it&#39;s an astronomical phenomenon. They called it Rahu and Ketu. They are discs within the path of the sun and moon and intersect and transpose themselves with either the sun or moon.  I have seen a few vids showing it. And also explains reality in contradiction to some of the inconsistent explanations about the eclipse we get from sources like NASA.</p>

<p>In reality the official explanation of the phases of the moon can be debunked with a few hours of critical thinking. And one thing to note is everything we know we know from television.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have the internet. Even a rudimentary search will show you how dumb of a mistake that is. As serious as a hear attack: gravity and gravitational waves are not the same thing. Gravitational waves do not prove or measure the existence of gravity. If it did, gravity would now be a law. It is not. It remains a theory because its existence has yet to be independently verified using the scientific method.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Gravitational waves can exist without gravity. Gravity is a mathematical explanation. You can call it whatever you want, but so far, gravity has not yet been directly measured using the scientific method. There can easily be another explanation for these indirect measurements. Unless you can setup an experiment to prove the existence of gravity, then you are making faith based arguments. That has nothing to do with the scientific method. </p>

<p>I think all people feel lonely, depressed, vulnerable, etc. at one or more points in their life. It&#39;s normal. I hope I didn&#39;t sound like I was judging anyone. What I meant to get across with those seemingly benign examples is that any one of us can be fooled into believing ridiculous things. Some moreso than others, but no one is immune. </p>

<p>There is a set of conditions, for each of us, that&#39;ll lead us right down Crazy Avenue. That some of us never make that trip is due, in part, to timing and circumstances. Some of us luck out. </p>

<p>Yes, I believe that everyone who argues that the Earth is flat is either a troll or presently incapacitated. People living in the year 1000 didn&#39;t even think the Earth was flat. That&#39;s a myth. No one thought anybody was going to sail off the edge of anything.</p>

<p>OP is curious and wants to know more. That&#39;s what the sub is for. It&#39;s fun to talk about this stuff. That&#39;s why we&#39;re all here. What he doesn&#39;t realize is that 20 years ago everyone understood that the Flat Earth Society was a joke, like the Flying Spaghetti Monster.  The Flat Earth proponents--those arguing, not those simply entertaining the possibility (which is fun), but the ones arguing/pushing/promoting--are screwing with him, or are temporarily out of order. This has never been a real thing.</p>

<p>In terms of Flat Earth I want it to be true more than I think it is. Honestly I dont fully understand the science of Flat Earth any more than I do Globe earth.  Ive learnt things that make sense on both sides but its all based off of what someone else told me. In school or on youtube. If their facts were wrong then what I know is wrong. </p>

<p>But when I see things like Disney&#39;s Sword in the Stone from 60&#39;s or whenevever with an owl and wizard/God character clearly pushing the Globe earth idea. Teaching about gravity, shooting off to Bemuda Island 21st century as a rocket. Making a mockery of the flat earth theory. Emphasising how important it to go to school and learn Globe earth stuff. Having planets and globe shape things in as many frames as possible and any flat earth shaped things are made a joke of like the bath tub for example. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool. I like the whole idea of a literal dream event because I do think ancient man was visited by dream like beings. One reason I think this is the contrast in our experience and theirs.  In our time we have an abundance of technologies to keep us focused on purely physical sciences.  But in the past I think just having no electricity, just that alone would focus the attention to the connection between man and nature more profoundly. Having to rely on instinct and he subjective awareness to interpret their surroundings.</p>

<p>Tbh I haven&#39;t read Enoch, I have heard of it. But the idea of being led on a journey to be shown the world while in a dream reminds me of how a person Can view the collective consciousness from a wider perspective then, but now with our technology we can also be shown the actual collective.</p>

<p>What is interesting about the collective is its not quite what we think. Yes it is a Conglomeration of our consciousness, all of us. But it is also a Conglomeration of everything, from every time. Not just our current time, but all of it.</p>

<p>I posted this a few days ago</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7a80ju/google_blurs_out_many_ancient_systems_that_are_in/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7a80ju/google_blurs_out_many_ancient_systems_that_are_in/</a></p>

<p>This is part of viewing the collective with technology. Though Google is aware of the collective and blurs it out to keep us in the dark.</p>

<p>But, if you take this map, and study it. You will find many forms emerging from the landscape. These forms are part of the collective consciousness of earth. They are a Conglomeration of different energies from different times that become formed into the earth.</p>

<p>So if you would like to go on a journey to view the collective you only have to view the details within our earth. This is the journey Enoch went on, imo, only he viewed the earth from the same perspective in the dream  state. </p>

<p>It&#39;s about the implications. The globe Earth doesnt stand on it&#39;s own. It comes together with evolution, the Big Bang and generally atheism.</p>

<p>They haven&#39;t just fooled the world into believing it&#39;s a sphere, they fooled the world into believing religion is bullshit (God doesn&#39;t exist, nor does lucifer), that people evolved from monkeys and will continue to evolve into Gods (Transhumanism).</p>

<p>Oh, and there&#39;s also Aliens coming. Cuz on a spherical Earth floating around in space, with billions of other potential Earths floating around, there&#39;s bound to be other planets with life.</p>

<p>Podesta knows they&#39;re coming. So does Hillary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>now before everyone gets all jumpy, i am NOT a technical guru, so this is just conjecture: seems that if people would just coordinate their efforts with a mass balloon and camera launch with some sort of mapping or software, the terra could be mapped out worldwide at a preset time. like when fisherman use fish finder technology under their boat, but for air to land. surprised this hasn&#39;t happened yet. eventually there will be answers, but its going to take old school research and legwork mixed with technology. like i said, im no expert so im sure to have the jargon wrong, but the idea being to ping from balloon to ground and map it out. on a large scale. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are looking for motive in the wrong direction. The real question is, why are people beginning to resist scientific knowledge? Why are people beginning to resist in greater numbers educational authority?</p>

<p>People have no faith in their government, and are losing faith in society and feel completely disenfranchised. As a result, that disenfranchisement is being transferred to anyone with any kind of authority.</p>

<p>Just watch them argue. If you try to explain relativity, or Newtonian mechanics they yell &quot;fallacy--appeal to authority&quot; or &quot;you&#39;re brainwashed&quot; yada yada. It&#39;s an escape from authority--something a lot of people in this world are feeling is less and less possible, as we have less and less input in those who govern us, and diminishing impact on society as a whole.</p>

<p>I have argued with many on this site and it always devolves into me being called names, or my questions unanswered because if you rely solely on math and logic, their stories fall apart.</p>

<p>The latest one was a FE proponent telling me that classical gravity doesn&#39;t exist--it&#39;s all buoyancy. I asked him to define buoyancy, and how he could predict the buoyancy of an known object in a liquid.</p>

<p>Of course he is unable to predict the buoyancy of a known object in a liquid because he would need Earth&#39;s gravitational constant to predict it. But gravity doesn&#39;t exist!</p>

<p>So, never a reply.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m not surprised more and more people are resisting things they are told by authority figures. It&#39;s why every major news event is now a conspiracy for someone.</p>

<p>A lot of people, like me, were educated--especially in history--with complete lies. Columbus, wars, etc., many things turning out to be complete bullshit. You could discard pretty much everything I was taught growing up about everything, except math and science. History is all BS, sociology, psychology, even dietary &quot;science&quot; was all complete and utter bullshit. Much of it still is. Fuck, the American Heart Association was founded on complete bullshit that dietary fat is bad for you and sugar isn&#39;t! What a fucking crock.</p>

<p>Anyway, as the Internet spreads, more truths are found that make those previous authority figures look like giant liars, along with increasing numbers of falsehoods that make everyone else look like a liar.</p>

<p>It&#39;s getting more and more difficult to believe anyone.</p>

<p>So, we end up with science deniers saying humans aren&#39;t causing dramatic climate change, and people who think the world is flat because they&#39;ve never personally been to the moon. And fuck that scientist, he just wants money like everyone else, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also I think evolutionary psychology has something to do with it. Bare with me as I&#39;m still thinking this through myself. </p>

<p>We&#39;re confronting the reality that we&#39;ve created catastrophic environmental disasters, new diseases and cancers from chemical innovations, depleted the oceans, all in the interest of corporate profits. This leaves a considerably depressing state of reality, great sense of guilt, and a cynical outlook that threatens our ego.</p>

<p>Its easier to rationalize this as there having been some organisation in deliberate control doing all of this (illuminati, shadow government).  Rather than accepting our repeatedly short sighted actions committed for the immediate rewards are to blame.</p>

<p>The flat earth theory includes the idea that the world is much larger and that the general population only inhibits the part that this controlling organization wants us to. Beyond this part we inhabit, is pristine lands for the controlling organization to live in. </p>

<p>At this point, in this version of flat earth theory we see many similarities to religion. The belief that there is pristine lands provides a sense of escapism from the reality. In the same way religion provides escapism from death and the human condition with the promise of the afterlife.</p>

<p>Hopefully that makes sense. </p>

Since then, I have vowed to never write something off, no matter how ludicrous it seems at the time, until I&#39;ve done a thorough investigation. </p>

<p>But to answer your question, they say that the reason for the deception is to hide our creator. Many atheists now believe in a diety upon coming across this theory. That&#39;s pretty powerful if you ask me, because most atheists are quite locked in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Copernicus was even challenged by scientists of his day and they found him to be a schmuck. Though the Jesuits did eventually fill the minds with this idea deeply enough, and made it exciting enough to get others to believe it. </p>

<p>Still to this day we have the excitement of what NASA provides to fill in this pseudo belief. It&#39;s alluring and captured the minds. And constantly indoctrinate us with movies and pictures of a spinning globe in most other media and news. It&#39;s all part of this network of theives, the shadow governments. Jesuit influence goes back very long bonds were made long ago between families we have no idea about.
