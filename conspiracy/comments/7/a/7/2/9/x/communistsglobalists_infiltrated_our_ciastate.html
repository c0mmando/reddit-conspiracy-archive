    <div class="md"><p>Then you don&#39;t know yourself. If you can&#39;t summarize it you don&#39;t understand it. Lenin spoke about getting the idiots to see the flaws in the system in left wing communism chapter 9. These communists need to magnify their supposed contradictions so the masses demand revolution. This couldn&#39;t happen before the CIA because America loved capitalism and not being in a caste. Then the CIA comes along and fucks the world up and now the communists have the evil imperialistic capitalist empire to point to. </p>

<p>Now please mr brain, what is communism and why am I so wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Communism is the ideology of a stateless egalitarian society that advocates &quot;for each according to his need, from each according to his ability.&quot;  It is a reaction to and a product of the contradictions of capitalism.  In other words, capitalism begets communism, but you claim it&#39;s the other way around.</p>

<p>Lenin wrote a whole book criticizing Imperialism as the natural outgrowth of capitalism.  The CIA is nothing if not the most potent weapon of American imperalism.</p>

<p>Communists literally is the ideology of the workers and you think they control the fucking CIA?  I&#39;m wasting my time here.  Jesus.  The CIA was created by the CFR who are globalist individuals who own huge wealth and use that wealth to control entire governments i.e. Fascists.  Your entire thread of hate would make sense if you replaced the word Communism with its polar opposite Fascism.</p>

<p>this is my point. this is all to convince you that communism is the way to go. the globalists are communists. they want a stateless world with no private property and fools like you are giving it to them.</p>

<p>for each according to his need from each according to his ability is slavery. you dont need much to survive and we are able to be worked till we collapse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again you should replace &quot;communists&quot; in your argument with &quot;fascists&quot;.  If they were true communists they would also relinquish their own private property, but they aren&#39;t going to do that, are they?  Thus they cannot be communists.</p>

<p>Also, if you &quot;used to be a communist&quot; then you would understand the difference between personal property and private property.</p>

<p>Communism in one word is: sharing.  Sharing the work and sharing the rewards.  It is not slavery.  Capitalism is slavery.  Fascism is slavery with a boot on your neck.</p>

<p>It takes someone with a fucked up agenda to argue that communists has the same goals as fascists.</p>

<p>capitalism is the answer to slavery. you want to return us to a time when citizens could not own property or generate wealth or be free. </p>

<p>understand that maybe you dont know everything and you might be wrong. you are the one, although you dont realize it, with the fucked up agenda of a post money post state post private property society where we&#39;re all enslaved and there&#39;s no competition and no choice and no freedom.</p>

<p>You really don&#39;t understand the difference between personal and private property.  It&#39;s a huge deal.  Go read up on it.</p>

<p>Capitalism is the post-feudal form of indentured servitude.  Communism the ideal state of total freedom to do what you wish without having to sell your time and labour.</p>

<p>Your entire argument is a based on defining the Elite Owners of Global Capital as communists, which is fucking ridiculous, laughable, false on it&#39;s face, totally the opposite of reality and common sense, and not worthy of discussion.</p>

Personal becomes private when the communists want it.  Your ideology is anti freedom anti choice anti property and the ideology of evil and force and coercion. </p>

<p>You still haven&#39;t addressed my question:  Who is &quot;they&quot;?  You claim &quot;they&quot; are communists, but if they are then they would relinquish their property.  If they don&#39;t, then they are fascists.</p>

<p>My undergrad was in History.  You are the one who has not read history or socialist source material.  Your arguments have no basis in fact, theory, history, or sources.  All you have is: &quot;I state this so it must be true and you are wrong because I say you are wrong&quot;.</p>

<p>Communism is, by Marx&#39;s manifesto, the democratic organisation of society by the workers and for the workers.  Yet you claim the Elite Owners of Global Capital are proponents of Communism.  You are a joke.</p>

<p>So, to you, the definition of words doesn&#39;t matter.  The unequal system of big business owners oppressing workers you describe is the definition of FASCISM, but instead you call it by it&#39;s opposite ideology COMMUNISM, that instructs workers to revolt against the owners and make society more equal.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like we&#39;re both looking at a horse and you&#39;re telling me it&#39;s a penguin.  WTF is wrong with you?  Seriously, you think this shit is going to go unnoticed?

    <div class="md"><p>communist/community loves country men &amp; women also prone to dictatorship &amp; some people benefitting more than other also suffers from nationalism &amp; propaganda. Citizens are educated, housed, fed &amp; get along pretty well.</p>

<p>globalist/dictator/crony capitalist loves money &amp; controlling majority of products &amp; housing their slaves have to pay for. </p>

<p>People fight amongst each other while globalist controls attention through the media they own &amp; broadcast/brainwash from.</p>
