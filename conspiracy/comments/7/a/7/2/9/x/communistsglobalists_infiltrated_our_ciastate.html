       It seems clear to me that the goal of the communist/globalist is the abolition of the nation state.

       US citizens love their country. So they have to turn their citizens against their own country. So they infiltrated like McCarthy said, and have created this caricature for the people to hate.

       Sure, you used to be a communist and you think communists manufactured the "capitalist enemy" whatever that means.  Then I used to be a penguin.  You have no idea what communism is.  Why don't I tell you?  Because it requires reading source material to understand it.  I'm not going to rewrite Kapital here for you.

       Then you don't know yourself. If you can't summarize it you don't understand it. Lenin spoke about getting the idiots to see the flaws in the system in left wing communism chapter 9. These communists need to magnify their supposed contradictions so the masses demand revolution. This couldn't happen before the CIA because America loved capitalism and not being in a caste. Then the CIA comes along and fucks the world up and now the communists have the evil imperialistic capitalist empire to point to.

       Communism is the ideology of a stateless egalitarian society that advocates "for each according to his need, from each according to his ability."  It is a reaction to and a product of the contradictions of capitalism.  In other words, capitalism begets communism, but you claim it's the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lenin wrote a whole book criticizing Imperialism as the natural outgrowth of capitalism.  The CIA is nothing if not the most potent weapon of American imperalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Communists literally is the ideology of the workers and you think they control the fucking CIA?  I'm wasting my time here.  Jesus.  The CIA was created by the CFR who are globalist individuals who own huge wealth and use that wealth to control entire governments i.e. Fascists.  Your entire thread of hate would make sense if you replaced the word Communism with its polar opposite Fascism.

       this is my point. this is all to convince you that communism is the way to go. the globalists are communists. they want a stateless world with no private property and fools like you are giving it to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       for each according to his need from each according to his ability is slavery. you dont need much to survive and we are able to be worked till we collapse.

       Again you should replace "communists" in your argument with "fascists".  If they were true communists they would also relinquish their own private property, but they aren't going to do that, are they?  Thus they cannot be communists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you "used to be a communist" then you would understand the difference between personal property and private property.
      </p>
      <p>
       Communism in one word is: sharing.  Sharing the work and sharing the rewards.  It is not slavery.  Capitalism is slavery.  Fascism is slavery with a boot on your neck.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes someone with a fucked up agenda to argue that communists has the same goals as fascists.

       but youre wrong. there is no difference between personal and private property in practice. they will take what they want. and people like you will welcome it.

       capitalism is the answer to slavery. you want to return us to a time when citizens could not own property or generate wealth or be free.
      </p>
      <p>
       understand that maybe you dont know everything and you might be wrong. you are the one, although you dont realize it, with the fucked up agenda of a post money post state post private property society where we're all enslaved and there's no competition and no choice and no freedom.

       Who is "they"?  Communists?  If they are communists, then they will also relinquish their own property, right?  If they don't then they are not communists. Capiche?
      </p>
      <p>
       You really don't understand the difference between personal and private property.  It's a huge deal.  Go read up on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalism is the post-feudal form of indentured servitude.  Communism the ideal state of total freedom to do what you wish without having to sell your time and labour.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your entire argument is a based on defining the Elite Owners of Global Capital as communists, which is fucking ridiculous, laughable, false on it's face, totally the opposite of reality and common sense, and not worthy of discussion.

       Hate to break it to you but you're wrong. I know the 'difference' between personal and private but it's not a real difference. Personal becomes private when the communists want it.  Your ideology is anti freedom anti choice anti property and the ideology of evil and force and coercion.
      </p>
      <p>
       God that you say communism is the idea state of total freedom (except for all those things you can't do that get you gulaged) plus your account age makes me think you're a baiter.
      </p>

       You have a lot to learn about the history of communism and where it comes from and what it looks like in practice.

       I have many accounts.  That's not how you're going to win this argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       You still haven't addressed my question:  Who is "they"?  You claim "they" are communists, but if they are then they would relinquish their property.  If they don't, then they are fascists.
      </p>
      <p>
       My undergrad was in History.  You are the one who has not read history or socialist source material.  Your arguments have no basis in fact, theory, history, or sources.  All you have is: "I state this so it must be true and you are wrong because I say you are wrong".
      </p>
      <p>
       Communism is, by Marx's manifesto, the democratic organisation of society by the workers and for the workers.  Yet you claim the Elite Owners of Global Capital are proponents of Communism.  You are a joke.

       You can't form a cogent argument with any supporting sources or facts.  Now you're wailing like a 5 year old.  You can't even answer my basic question I've asked 3 times:  Who is "they" that you are referring to?  Are you saying "they" --the Elite Owners of Global Capital-- are supporting the ideology that would strip them of their wealth and power?

       you've insulted me in every single one of your comments and then go on to call me a 5 year old. you think communism will strip them of their power but really it will place everything in their power and you will have no choice and no freedom and no property.

       no they will own everything. and you will have no choice, no freedom, and no property. much like how 'democracy' has led to both parties acting the same.

       So, according to you, they will own everything and workers will own nothing.  Congratulations, you have defined fascism.  Now go remake this thread but replace the word "communism" with "fascism".  Then you will be correct and people will agree with you instead of everyone insulting you in this thread.

       Don't get caught up on the words because you're blinded by your ideology. They globalists want a stateless world where you have no property and no competition and no freedom. That's communism.

       So, to you, the definition of words doesn't matter.  The unequal system of big business owners oppressing workers you describe is the definition of FASCISM, but instead you call it by it's opposite ideology COMMUNISM, that instructs workers to revolt against the owners and make society more equal.
