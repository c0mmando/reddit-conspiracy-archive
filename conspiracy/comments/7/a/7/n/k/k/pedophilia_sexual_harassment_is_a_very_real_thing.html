        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I literally just saw an OP in <a href="/r/filmmakers">/r/filmmakers</a> with <a href="https://www.mandy.com/news/dustin-hoffman-brett-ratner-film-news-anna-graham-piven">this article in it</a> where Dustin Hoffman is the latest high profile celeb being accused of sexual harassment and misconduct.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t personally know Dustin Hoffman and have nothing at stake with him one way or the other, so if he <em>did</em> engage in sexual misconduct and if that sexual misconduct is illegal, then fuck him.  Bring him down.  I don&#39;t give a fuck.  Bring <em>all</em> these fucks down.</p>

<p>However - and this is a bit of the point of this OP here - there do seem to be a <em>lot</em> of allegations that have just been pouring in as of the past few weeks.  It seems a LOT of people continue being accused of sexual misconduct.</p>

<p>It happens.  It&#39;s real.  And it should be punished, prosecuted, and discouraged.  However, I also wonder about the to which it might be &quot;weaponized&quot; so to speak, and used as a means to simply accuse a bunch of people one wants to vilify - since it seems to be the hot button topic as of late.</p>

First off very few will believe you, second off as a kid you just block that shit out and it end up affecting you later in life. Point is if you had no proof, a little kid coming off and saying this so so producer or huge actor raped me. It won&#39;t get anywhere. But if you are older, you can say look this happened, I was affected in this way. And besides most of these people do say something. Some of the alleged Cosby victims told people and they didn&#39;t believe the girls. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Statue of limitations is a thing, and I don&#39;t imagine up and comers are going to want to destroy their career by coming out and saying it. That being said, if bigger more reputable stars come out and say they were raped/sexually assaulted then that might incentivize others to come forward to try and cleanse Hollywood of the biggest offenders. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any way to weed them all out unfortunately and ultimately I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s going to have a huge impact on the greater scheme of things either. In my heart I want things to change but my brain tells me that these are some of the most wealthy and powerful people in the US committing these atrocities and not too many are going to be willing or able to accept the fight. I know my kid isn&#39;t going anywhere near Hollywood, trying to identify your every day sicko is hard enough because sometimes they&#39;re from your own family. My mom, my uncle and my grandmother were all sexually abused by the same relative, I&#39;ve never met him and it&#39;s probably a good thing or I might be behind bars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It occurs a lot. I was lured into the back of a grocery store by a stock clerk when I was 10yrs old. He asked me if I could hold the door while he moved some boxes out (this was the 80s and my mom would let me wander the isles)  This gross fuck acted like he needed help loading the pallet on the lift. So me being young and dumb tried to help while he struggled. He then tried to hold me and rub his crotch on my back. I flipped out and ran. I found my mom and tried to be cool until we left. She knew something was up. When we got home I told her what happened. She called the police ,we had to go back and I had to point out the guy. Charges were filed. I had to go to court and all the bullshit. He got two years. He served eleven months. That was very traumatic for me.</p>

<p>Fast forward to me being 17.  Gas station clerk. Owner was a horrible drunk. Explains why he hired a 17yr old as a clerk? No. He was a pedo. He asked me to drive him to play video poker so he could drink for $200 bucks cash. This was the 90s so I agreed. -yes I was still a fucking idiot. On the way back he asked if he could suck my.....</p>

<p>I said no and he begged. I was driving while this occurred and freaking out.  Finally he stopped asking and apologized and cried. </p>

<p>Made it back and left without a word.</p>

<p>Went back to work next day and stole a bunch of money and products. $1100  and cigarettes.
Yes I was an idiot!</p>

<p>Sold the cigarettes 
Spent the money</p>

<p>Couple yrs later dude shot him self in the face with a 45. </p>

<p>Sorry if typos. </p>

<p>This shit has fucked with me for a long time ✌️</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people are confusing pedophilia and underage sex a lot around here. Pedophilia is the exclusive attraction to prepubescent children. Just because someone has sex with a 15 year old doesn&#39;t make them a pedophile. Immoral or wrong yes. But that 15 year old could look 20 and be fully sexually developed. </p>

<p>Sexual harassment and casting couches are obviously wrong too. But people are throwing out the pedophile term pretty loosely when it might just be underage sex. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is that supposed to mean?  That the allegations of sexual misconduct <em>don&#39;t</em> get thrown around more often than they occur? that every time an allegation occurs, it&#39;s somehow <em>necessarily</em> true?</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>Look, as I already said, sexual misconduct of <em>any</em> type should get absolutely eradicated.  I cannot stand by that more.  However, the thought that <em>every single allegation</em> of sexual misconduct is somehow necessarily true is just not good thinking.  I wouldn&#39;t say that solves much of anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that for every count that is proven there are countless that occur. That&#39;s all. What is visible is only the tip of the iceberg should all be made visible.</p>
