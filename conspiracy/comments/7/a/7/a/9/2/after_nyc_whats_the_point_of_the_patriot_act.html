    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve considered doing a write up about the topic on this sub before, but I&#39;ll just do a quick rundown of the true value I think the Patriot Act involves and why.</p>

<p>It&#39;s based off the FBI&#39;s reaction to a ruling about Stingray devices a few months back.</p>

<p>Basic background - a Stingray device is an electronic device that mimics cell phone towers, allowing the holder of the device to essentially gain access to the information on the phone.</p>

<p>Problem is, they were being used even though they&#39;re almost certainly unconstitutional. However, we have judicial <em>review</em> in this country, so until their use is challenged (and even there, getting standing to challenge it would be difficult), they&#39;re used.</p>

<p>The FBI would basically lease the devices to local police departments/district attorneys offices, providing them direct access to a suspect/defendant&#39;s phone and all the information contained therein. This was done without the use of a warrant, which means two things:</p>

<p>1) no judicial review or limitation on the use of the device (warrant&#39;s are specifically tailored), and</p>

<p>2) no head&#39;s up for the target of the device. </p>

<p>Multiple rights are implicated here - no ability to face your accuser (Fifth Amendment right) because you don&#39;t even know they&#39;re collecting/using the information. No protection against unreasonable search and seizure.</p>

<p>Part of the deal with the local offices was that the prosecution cannot reveal that the Stingray was used, nor that the FBI provided it to them. This was likely done to keep their use out of the public (legal system) consciousness, because their use would certainly not hold up to judicial scrutiny.</p>

<p>Eventually, some intrepid defense lawyers began to realize that there&#39;s just no way the prosecution could have gained the information it had based on the claimed processes. </p>

<p>Remember the concept of &#39;fruit of the poisonous tree&#39; - if evidence is illegally obtained, it cannot be used in a prosecution. This is HUGELY important to the issue.</p>

<p>When these defense lawyers eventually were able to demand a more thorough explanation of how the prosecution was getting the information they had, the FBI hung the local prosecution offices out to dry.</p>

<p>The NDA signed by the local DA&#39;s (sorry I&#39;m using DA/prosecution interchangeably if this is confusing) prevented them from revealing any information. You do NOT want to break a federal gag order, even if it&#39;s bullshit. </p>

<p>So instead of the defendant being able to face the accuser, the FBI prevented the prosecution from using the information obtained by the Stingray (as it would reveal the use of the device itself). In some cases, this led to the DA having to drop the charges entirely!</p>

<p>That pissed off the local DA&#39;s offices. Fast forward a bit. The info keeps leaking out, finally there&#39;s judicial review of the Stingray devices, and the court rules that they cannot be used without a warrant (no shit).</p>

<p>That leaves a lot of pending/ongoing cases in a bad place for the DA&#39;s offices. So what does the FBI do to help? They actually suggest that the prosecution uses <strong>parallel construction</strong>. What is that?</p>

<p>Parallel construction is working backwards with the information already obtained to create a narrative for how it was obtained in a different manner. Application being the Stingray obtained information about the defendant in an illegal manner. </p>

<p>Fruit of the poisonous tree means that evidence can&#39;t be used, potentially jeopardizing the entire case. But since you already have the actual INFO, you work backwards to find a &#39;legal&#39; manner of creating a chain of evidence/analysis that leads you to the info you already have.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re thinking &#39;that&#39;s lying!&#39; - yes, it is. And it&#39;s also incredibly illegal and incredibly dangerous. It makes all of our Constitutional protections a joke. And this wasn&#39;t a random bad actor, this was the actual suggestion of the FBI.</p>

<p>So it&#39;d go like this:</p>

<p>-use a Stingray to illegally obtain all the information you&#39;d need for a prosecution
- hide the fact that you used a Stingray
- using &#39;parallel construction,&#39; <em>MAKE UP</em> a story about how you obtained the information that was really obtained by the Stingray (keep in mind it has to hold up in court)</p>

<p>Now what does this have to do with the Patriot Act? The Patriot Act contains a multitude of provisions that reduce requirements for spying/data extraction, etc.</p>

<p>If the FBI is literally suggesting to local DA&#39;s offices to use parallel construction, how likely is it that the Patriot Act is not used to obtain the actual INFORMATION on suspects and then worked backwards to create a narrative of &#39;legal&#39; investigation leading to the info?</p>

<p>Another part of the Patriot Act is smoother information sharing between different agencies and departments, as well as state and local governments. Everybody gets to play a little ball...</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t speculation or theory, or even hidden information - more just extremely under reported. If anyone&#39;s interested maybe I&#39;ll do a fuller write up and include the sources - but if you&#39;re curious right now, just google some of this info. It&#39;s not hidden.</p>

<p>TLDR - The Patriot Act provides a method of gaining any information for essentially any suspect of any crime that allows authorities to work backwards via parallel construction to hide the true method of obtaining the information. This renders the Bill of Rights useless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please remember that this tyrannical piece of legislation called the Patriot Act was written by Roman Catholic Jesuit Georgetown Professor Viet Dinh. </p>

<p>This same Georgetown University is where the director of the CIA during 9/11, George Tenet was trained and where the Saudi Prince Turki Al Faisal was trained. Prince Turki resigned as head of Saudi intelligence 10 days before 9/11. The heads of the most influential neoconservative groups were Georgetown alumni as well including David Steinmann, the head of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (of which PNAC was a front for) and Frank Gaffney, head of the Center for Security Policy. The director of Mossad during 9/11 was given the CIA directors award from Jesuit George Tenet. </p>

<p>In fact, Georgetown University is the number one school in the world for foreign diplomacy. </p>

<p>Dinh was certainly counseled by Jesuit priests at Georgetown when drafting the Patriot Act. </p>
