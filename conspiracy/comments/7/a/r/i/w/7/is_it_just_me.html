       Is it just me, or does everyone surrounding you and I in life seem to be in a comatose? The best way I can describe it is that I’m awake. I feel awake, physically and mentally. But my family, friends and everybody around myself seem to be sleeping. Not physically, but mentally. They’re asleep. I can’t explain it all that well. Even more, I feel out of place in our world. Seeing people around me pursuing delusions and being interested in meaningless stuff is so disappointing. It’s not only disappointing—sometimes, it makes me wonder what I’m doing here, among these people, and I feel like I’m not meant to be a part of this world. Am I the only one? Surly, I can’t be. I pray not to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       (I’m not saying I’m above anyone or better than anyone. I’m not. People in my generation—millennials—don’t question anything. They wallow in their blissful ignorance. I simply want people to question, learn, research, et cetera.)

       It's actually part of many spiritual teachings. Most are unconsciously living in the day dreams of their mind/thoughts. Very few are self aware or have theirs consciousness awakened to high state.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you learn how to OBE, you can see that the unconscious are very grey and colorless and the ones who are awakened have light and color/life around them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The battle is ultimately to awakened and revolt

       My biggest mistake was thinking that the masses were capable of 'waking up'. Acceptance of reality - the reality that they are designed to be lemmings and will never change - seems to be a key step towards finding peace.

       They will wake up, it will take time. Imagine if humanity is a person. Right now they are somewhere around 13-14 and full of themselves, jealous, self hatred, unconscious..... Except for the moments of deja vu which reminds them that there's more

       Because soooooo many more people than ever before are doing things they never used to do or you use to see less of. Moe people filter their water, read the food labels, discuss Soros, the petro dollar, more are meditating and looking for spiritual growth, etc.

       When I was growing up and getting into all this stuff, the majority were unconscious sports watching hot dog eating beer drinkers where conversations centered around who's picking up more alcohol, sports talk, and complaining.

       I'd say the majority suck. And I'll go ahead and say I'm not 19 years old either. I just know people like the back of my hand. I don't like or trust them, trust them about as far as I could throw them. I know from experience. People will screw you over or stab you in the back in a heartbeat.

       NPC theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I recall it correctly, some anon dropped a theory on one of the image boards that goes along the lines of: There exists a limited number of souls, which means that to fulfill certain actions, there exists even more "NPCs" than souls. This is to fulfill roles and obligations in order to progress the destiny/story of those with souls.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may be mixing two theories up, forgot how it went, and while I don't believe in it... it is an interesting theory.

       I really just enjoy reading just about anything. I like hearing other theories or perspectives. I guess I just have a curious mind. It looked like a more of a rambling than a theory I would say at first glance.

       That screenshot clearly comes from someone who hasn't been outside in a while. I mean, I talk to people every day randomly at grocery stores, events, walking down the street, on social media, etc and everyone has a unique personality and is happy to joke and chat with you. That screenshot comes off as someone just trying to feel superior.

       It also depends on what his "deep topics" are. He calls the guy a blue pill so the assumption is that he's a red pill guy. That said, it wouldn't shock me if some of the shit he brought up didn't just make the other guy uncomfortable and he didn't know how to approach it. I mean, if you were talking to someone and they made a compelling case as to why women are inferior such that you couldn't argue it but you don't agree with it, on principle because women are human, how would you respond?

       I wonder if that author thinks he is more deserving than most. I personally know literally hundreds of people more deserving than me to be given one of these 'souls', and I am no slouch. Having a model like this is ridiculous. Given that there have been billions upon billions upon billions of people on the earth who all share common DNA and similar moral value. Its ridiculous. I would be much quicker to believe in reincarnation than this. And thats much more difficult to comprehend.

       That's a REALLY good point, that they are just so absorbed in their own ego they just don't see the fact that there are a ton of awesome people. It makes it hard, when someone thinks they're perfect, to see people, who are different, as anything but flawed.

       Me too. Some are just ahead of the curve. And I don't mean that as like gloating or bragging. You find out so much it overwhelms the mind temporarily while you process it. And it's not always good. It's a temporary to permanent disconnect from the matrix and from its belief systems because of what they produce. And it is possible to be mentally within a parallel reality to the one in which others are part of. I do think others will eventually go through the disconnection from this particular social structure and experience trauma. So if anything we could be a benefit to help in that process of transition.

       For me, all I see is sick people. People who literally can't process anything more. They are in emergency mode and all resources (body, mind, soul, and belongings) are already dedicated to their crisis. It's not that new information would help or even improve their situation, it's that they are unwilling to believe there is a better path in life, because when you're in a crisis, your mind is stuck on the crisis.

       Keto works for some yes, but if you look across the internet there are also many people who react badly to keto. Also a high carb plant based (vegetables and fruit) with coconuts/avocado/nuts/seeds etc instead of animal fat works for many too, just as it doesn't work for others. If you want to talk about heart disease, obesity and fatigue.. of course refined sugars are bad, but the research also points toward excessive consumption of fatty meat relating to heart disease amongst a myriad of other potential concerns, such as the fact that if you aren't eating grass fed and organic meat, you are highly likely to be pumping yourself full of antibiotics and hormones whilst supporting the slaughter of animals in digusting conditions. But as with nutritional research, the key is to remember the varying non-homogenous response of individuals to particular diets depending on their genes, individual biology and lifestyle.

       The burning of proteins for energy is a highly dirty fuel. Ketosis produces ketones, (the simplest being the carcinogenic acetone), and leads to ketoacidosis, and overly acidic body and kidney load. The body shunts off those toxic ketones by diluting them with water, and so the weight you lose is almost all water weight, and lean muscle mass, (which is a desirable, highly metabolically active body tissue). Meat is also incredibly carcinogenic source of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Heterocyclic Amines (HCA's and PAH's, some of the worst chemicals in cigarette smoke). Increased choline consumption reacts to Amines and Amides in Meat to form Trimethlymine, another carcinogen. Environmental toxins, (heavy metals, pesticides, industrial chemicals) work their way up the food chain in increasing concentrations. Meat consumption is one of the most significant risk factors associated heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       A far more health promoting diet is a Whole Food, Plant-based diet as promoted by Dr. Michael Greger in his "How Not To Die" book/audiobook as well as nutritionfacts.org, (which has thousands of short, informative, evidence based videos on a huge range of topics).

       You are horribly uneducated in this matter, or at least brainwashed by the vegan 'lobby'. Once keto-adapted, your ketones will be derived primarily from beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), not acetone.
      </p>
      <p>
       And these ketones are incredibly anti-cancer for many types of cancers, which fuel on

       You miss the forest for the trees regarding your meat statements. Shitty 'farmed' meat is indeed shitty. Quality, grass-fed beef has a far better fatty acid profile.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I will state that high vegetable intake is still
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       important, and most keto dieters do NOT do this right (or at all), and that's a very bad thing. Ketosis with veggies is unreal.

       I'm starting to feel like we are all in a pressure cooker. "They" see people as a disease and want to wipe us all out. They are doing it right in front of or faces with chemicals and pollutants. But really it's us doing it to ourselves because we continue to buy all the shit they say we need. 
I'm ready to go live in a commune in Costa Rica. I'm dying here.

       It feels that way but it is not so. Those of us awake - really awake (and there are more than you realize) are selective in the things we say to others. Being awake can be detrimental to one's survival so we learn to act like we're asleep while inwardly we're all too aware.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want a tip for finding those who are awake?  Find those who are listeners rather than talkers.  Not shy folks or severe introverts but those who are socially normal but little is known about him/her. Usually these folks will have plenty of rumor and speculation floating around about them but nothing concrete.  It's not guaranteed but I've been alive long enough to know nine times out of ten, those people are the awake and knowledgable ones.

       I'm not OP, but if I may, knowledge alone isn't what's necessary, but enhanced awareness, which amounts to expanded consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I suppose the main thing that needs to be known is the big picture perspective that everything is illusion (the famous Bill Hicks quote "all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves.")

       are you saying that needs further explanation? it's pretty simple...to be awake is to be aware, to be asleep is to be unaware, and there are various degrees of awareness...somebody like Sherlock Holmes would be an obvious extremely aware person that sees details everywhere that others ignore...this can apply to all facets of life including emotional empathy and compassion to problem solving...the more aware you are the better your intuition is going to work too and you can predict how things are going to play out.

       It's not so much what you but what you understand. That in and of itself can seem an odd statement but let me put it like this:  I don't know why our governments do what they do but I understand they are responsible for much of the world's suffering.

       Realize that everything you experience is a game of creating the life you live. Be mindful of everything you see and the effect it has on you. Be mindful of your actions and the effect they have on the unique dynamic of your universe. Strive for the highest potential for your reality, it will open your mind and heart beyond the limits you put on them.

       Just because they work for money, doesn't mean they don't care about morality and are stepping on people's backs.  You're just creaiting an excuse that you're unemployed.

       So you're telling me that people who line up to spend 1k on a new iphone every year care about morality and aren't stepping on people's backs to do that? When the materials required for those phones are mined in Africa by literal child slaves, and then assembled by slave labor in sweatshops. They buy products that are made by destroying the rainforest and plating palm oil trees.  You're saying that these people are moral and have strong values? A phone that is barely different than the one they bought last year is worth children working 16 hours a day as slaves?

       Life is not meaningless. Life’s purpose is to live. The only thing that can take away the meaning of life is if we were to never die. Don’t think about money either. Money does not define happiness. You can do anything.

       The reason you observe this is that people are under a spell. Ultimately, this is a spiritual war. All of the black masses and incantations serve a real purpose. Most people are literally under a spell that prevents them from being awake or seeing the truth.

       It is not just you. I have felt this way for some time...that people are zombies and not paying attention to what's really going on. I know some people think I'm a little offbeat when I get going on things. I've become hyper aware of how others are feeling and I truly believe that there is a purpose for me but I"m not aware of it yet

       Dude. I was talking to my wife about 9-11 and her eyes just glossed over. Didn't want to hear anything I had to say about it. Literally told me she didn't want to know! I woke up the day I read Culture Jam. I'm ready for a revolution, but not a lot of people around me in my life are ready though...

       Can you manage to get around 300,000 people ready to squander their entire lives for this revolution? Because the thing about a revolution, is you have to win. Also, do you have arms, do you have maps, do you have people on your team within the regime, do you have clear communication channels, etc.

       It's frustrating, amazing, and wearying. It feels like everyone should see it so obviously, but that's not the case. I'm here most of the time, when I'm not learning more about the true history of America. Then I log in to Facebook expecting to see the conspiracy talk flying, and instead I see mockery, the same weary tropes being trotted out.

       I feel that exact way when I go to cities.  I know this is a huge generalization, but in my experience, the closer you get to a city, the more important it becomes for people to obtain meaningless possessions, and flaunt them as status symbols.  The further into the country I get, the more grounded in reality people seem to become.  Being around family becomes more important than working 60 hours per week to drive a leased BMW.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I visit friends in a big city, and see everyone working 2 jobs, not to get ahead and move somewhere nicer, but to impress neighbors with their new car and expensive clothes, I feel exactly how you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming you live in a place like this, maybe you need to move somewhere where the average person values the same things in life that you do.  When you're surrounded by materialistic people, you start to feel like you're the crazy one, and it gets very lonely.

       Last year I told my nephew who is a police officer that Snowden would always be a hero to me because he exposed the NSA and spying on us.  Something many were called crazy for, for many years.  My nephew was pissed and tried to talk about how he was a traitor and so forth.  I told him the only thing that separates me and you is that you are on team law enforcement and I'm team civilian.  If you were on my team you'd see it different.  He hung up on me and didn't speak to me for 6 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the CIA wikileaks exposure vault 7 happened with their tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       My nephew texted me and apologized.  He said for years he thought I was crazy and tin foil conspiracy theorist.  When that dump happened he opened his eyes for the first time and actually saw what I had been talking about all these years.

       The more you'll learn about politics and psychology, the more advanced you will be compared to normies. People who believe what TV news says will seem to you like children who believe in Santa Claus. People who seek happiness in consumption will seem to you like people who seek happiness in drugs. You will be glad you're not like them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Understanding how politics work is a long process with many false paths. Understanding your own psychology is easier and more important. Learn meditation and Jungian psychology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also learn self-motivation. Using your time efficiently does not happen by itself. You must learn to direct and guide the part of your psyche that controls your attention and energy. That's an important step out of normiehood. Normies waste all their time and energy. That's how the controllers want it. You must rise above the programming. You will be glad you're not like them.

       It's almost impossible, because deception is a major part of politics. All the political factions want to fool you into believing a certain ideology that benefits them. The news outlets (including alternative news) will pretend to be impartial and objective but they really aren't.
      </p>
      <p>
       What worked for me was going deep into many different ideologies. Start with some subreddit about an ideology that you're interested in. Read it for a month or so until you believe every post. Then stop and go to a subreddit of the opposite ideology and read only that for a month. From the outside you will see what was bullshit about the first ideology and what was rather true. Then you move on to the third ideology which is different from the first two, and you will get another perspective. The more perspectives you get, the more you will be able to see the big picture. But it takes many many years until something useful crystalizes. And you will hold many false beliefs. But you will learn to question your own beliefs and to discard the false ones without fear.

       I'm vehemently opposed to psychiatry (it's a fucking scam that ruined my life, PM me about it if you are interested). I feel that people seem normal until I bring up something about psychiatry and then they just glitch. They start making arguments that don't make sense like "well, sure the drugs don't empirically do anything, but if placebos help people what's wrong with that." They generally just kind of turn off and get very uncomfortable. It's like a just said a racial slur

       Some of my blended family walk around with blinders on, drinking the Koolaid and allow life to happen to them.

       I like to live life, pay attention to those around me, try to pave an easier path for my fellow man, be courteous and polite yet aware and alert for potential dangers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes, I need to put my bitch hat on, and take rather than give (like assert my way in traffic rather than let another wave of fifty ungrateful pedestrians just walk in front of my car with no acknowledgement that I stopped in the middle of the street for them) or I will fail to hold the door for the bastard that pulled it shut in front of me, even though my hands were clearly full.

       I have left NO toilet paper (warned my daughter ahead of time) and yet one roll is retrieved from the separate garage, rather than the plastic wrapped six pack. WTF? Lazy, inconsiderate....and then I will ask if they saw the "controversial news" and they have not, but the MEN will tell me what happened to Facebook friend soandso.

       It’s not just you. It’s you, and every other delusional individual convinced they’re somehow above those who don’t question everything. I get it. I do. But it’s a dangerous thing to assume that somehow your consciousness is more aware and that you don’t belong. You’re awake, they’re awake, you’re in society. If you weren’t, you wouldn’t be posting in a conspiracy subreddit on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you ever consider that? You’re posting your thoughts about how everybody is asleep, and you’re awake, in a corporate owned oligarchy. You’re on the grid and part of the grid in the same way those you assume to be asleep are.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of us are awake. We can’t see beyond the veil. The veil covers our eyes just as those who refuse to believe in a veil. We will likely never see beyond  it. We are not here to look down on those who think differently from us, we are here to help them feel and recognize the veil that covers their eyes. They’re aware, you’re awake.

       This is the reason we have been enslaved by Satanic Aliens. This has gone on for a long time. Most people regardless of formal education, jobs or material items they own, are in fact sleeping morons. They will attack those who question the norm and ridicule those who have figured out the horrific truth. This planet has been completely enslaved. It does not end after Physical death. Parts of the same Control Group cleverly con the deceased human into Reincarnation yet again, and the enslavement continues.

       I'm noticing people starting to come out of their slumber. I like to drop small nuggets to see how they respond and see how far along they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       The unraveling of things like Hollywood pedogate help provide shell-shocks, even though I think that's a lot of distraction right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I typically don't keep super close company to those who are too far asleep either. Talking about sportsball and TV shows is simply less interesting.

       A little late to the party, but...
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to think we exist in a perpetual state of being "almost over the edge".
      </p>
      <p>
       Prices for goods, services, and commodities are high, but...not high enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Social tension is high, but...not high enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Political and corporate corruption is high, but...not high enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is high enough to get our attention, but not so that we feel pressured to change it. We exist in such a fashion that we feel more or less forced to accept it
       <em>
        as is
       </em>
       . We long for the way things used to be while accepting that things are the way they are because things haven't changed enough to push us over that edge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually it will, though. Something will have to give, but ultimately, change will come when we, the average people, can't sustain the system the powers that be want us to. Whether it's the fact we can't afford the roofs over our heads, putting food on the table or clothes on our backs, something will cause us to break.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until then, we live in that state of being individually and socially unhappy...
       <em>
        but not unhappy enough to do something about it.
       </em>

       I know exactly what you mean.  I know enough to see that the stuff people talk about is meaningless, and that the stuff that's meaningful is taboo in polite conversation and most people will enforce that rule.  What's more, the people that care about things are so bogged down in minutiae and dogma that they're impossible to talk to as well.

       God everyone has to think they're special and that everyone else is just asleep. No that's your delusions finally reaching a point where you have to be special for no reason, get over yourself you are not special or better because you think everyone else is dead, everyone thinks they're special. The truth is no one is.

       I agree with you in the perception that mostly everyone seems asleep. But I have to say, a large amount of millennials in my life seem awake or are in the process of waking. It’s the babyboomers in my life that seem completely lost on what is actually going on. But then again, that’s obviously just my experience.

       The older people get, the more stuck in their ways they are. Younger people are way more likely to question why things are the way they are because rules and norms have not been fully established with time, just in general according to many psych studies. I believe they call it the Einstein Effect (if I remember properly, it does have to do with Einstein having his big breakthrough at a young age because he challenged previously established rules in his field). For example, recent med school graduates have a high tendency to consider rarer diseases when diagnosing patients, while older doctors have a greater tendency to miss rarer diseases in patients because they are more likely to conclude things are status quo.

       We were asleep once. We must find the combinations of triggers that might wake them. Let's start with the ones that awakened us. Mine was stumbling on sandy hook when researching life after death. I didn't choose the red pill life. The red pill chose me.

       I'd say the majority suck. And I'll go ahead and say I'm not 19 years old either. I just know people like the back of my hand. I don't like or trust them, trust them about as far as I could throw them. I know from experience. People will screw you over or stab you in the back in a heartbeat.
