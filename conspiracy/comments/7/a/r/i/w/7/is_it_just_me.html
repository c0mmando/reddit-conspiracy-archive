        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is it just me, or does everyone surrounding you and I in life seem to be in a comatose? The best way I can describe it is that I’m awake. I feel awake, physically and mentally. But my family, friends and everybody around myself seem to be sleeping. Not physically, but mentally. They’re asleep. I can’t explain it all that well. Even more, I feel out of place in our world. Seeing people around me pursuing delusions and being interested in meaningless stuff is so disappointing. It’s not only disappointing—sometimes, it makes me wonder what I’m doing here, among these people, and I feel like I’m not meant to be a part of this world. Am I the only one? Surly, I can’t be. I pray not to be.</p>

<p>(I’m not saying I’m above anyone or better than anyone. I’m not. People in my generation—millennials—don’t question anything. They wallow in their blissful ignorance. I simply want people to question, learn, research, et cetera.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually part of many spiritual teachings. Most are unconsciously living in the day dreams of their mind/thoughts. Very few are self aware or have theirs consciousness awakened to high state.</p>

<p>If you learn how to OBE, you can see that the unconscious are very grey and colorless and the ones who are awakened have light and color/life around them. </p>

<p>The battle is ultimately to awakened and revolt</p>

<p>My biggest mistake was thinking that the masses were capable of &#39;waking up&#39;. Acceptance of reality - the reality that they are designed to be lemmings and will never change - seems to be a key step towards finding peace.</p>

<p>Because soooooo many more people than ever before are doing things they never used to do or you use to see less of. Moe people filter their water, read the food labels, discuss Soros, the petro dollar, more are meditating and looking for spiritual growth, etc.</p>

<p>When I was growing up and getting into all this stuff, the majority were unconscious sports watching hot dog eating beer drinkers where conversations centered around who&#39;s picking up more alcohol, sports talk, and complaining.</p>

<p>Now its entirely different</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NPC theory.</p>

<p>If I recall it correctly, some anon dropped a theory on one of the image boards that goes along the lines of: There exists a limited number of souls, which means that to fulfill certain actions, there exists even more &quot;NPCs&quot; than souls. This is to fulfill roles and obligations in order to progress the destiny/story of those with souls.</p>

<p>I may be mixing two theories up, forgot how it went, and while I don&#39;t believe in it... it is an interesting theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That screenshot clearly comes from someone who hasn&#39;t been outside in a while. I mean, I talk to people every day randomly at grocery stores, events, walking down the street, on social media, etc and everyone has a unique personality and is happy to joke and chat with you. That screenshot comes off as someone just trying to feel superior.</p>

<p>It also depends on what his &quot;deep topics&quot; are. He calls the guy a blue pill so the assumption is that he&#39;s a red pill guy. That said, it wouldn&#39;t shock me if some of the shit he brought up didn&#39;t just make the other guy uncomfortable and he didn&#39;t know how to approach it. I mean, if you were talking to someone and they made a compelling case as to why women are inferior such that you couldn&#39;t argue it but you don&#39;t agree with it, on principle because women are human, how would you respond?</p>

I personally know literally hundreds of people more deserving than me to be given one of these &#39;souls&#39;, and I am no slouch. Having a model like this is ridiculous. Given that there have been billions upon billions upon billions of people on the earth who all share common DNA and similar moral value. Its ridiculous. I would be much quicker to believe in reincarnation than this. And thats much more difficult to comprehend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me too. Some are just ahead of the curve. And I don&#39;t mean that as like gloating or bragging. You find out so much it overwhelms the mind temporarily while you process it. And it&#39;s not always good. It&#39;s a temporary to permanent disconnect from the matrix and from its belief systems because of what they produce. And it is possible to be mentally within a parallel reality to the one in which others are part of. I do think others will eventually go through the disconnection from this particular social structure and experience trauma. So if anything we could be a benefit to help in that process of transition. </p>

<p>Keto works for some yes, but if you look across the internet there are also many people who react badly to keto. Also a high carb plant based (vegetables and fruit) with coconuts/avocado/nuts/seeds etc instead of animal fat works for many too, just as it doesn&#39;t work for others. If you want to talk about heart disease, obesity and fatigue.. of course refined sugars are bad, but the research also points toward excessive consumption of fatty meat relating to heart disease amongst a myriad of other potential concerns, such as the fact that if you aren&#39;t eating grass fed and organic meat, you are highly likely to be pumping yourself full of antibiotics and hormones whilst supporting the slaughter of animals in digusting conditions. But as with nutritional research, the key is to remember the varying non-homogenous response of individuals to particular diets depending on their genes, individual biology and lifestyle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The burning of proteins for energy is a highly dirty fuel. Ketosis produces ketones, (the simplest being the carcinogenic acetone), and leads to ketoacidosis, and overly acidic body and kidney load. The body shunts off those toxic ketones by diluting them with water, and so the weight you lose is almost all water weight, and lean muscle mass, (which is a desirable, highly metabolically active body tissue). Meat is also incredibly carcinogenic source of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Heterocyclic Amines (HCA&#39;s and PAH&#39;s, some of the worst chemicals in cigarette smoke). Increased choline consumption reacts to Amines and Amides in Meat to form Trimethlymine, another carcinogen. Environmental toxins, (heavy metals, pesticides, industrial chemicals) work their way up the food chain in increasing concentrations. Meat consumption is one of the most significant risk factors associated heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.</p>

<p>A far more health promoting diet is a Whole Food, Plant-based diet as promoted by Dr. Michael Greger in his &quot;How Not To Die&quot; book/audiobook as well as nutritionfacts.org, (which has thousands of short, informative, evidence based videos on a huge range of topics). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are horribly uneducated in this matter, or at least brainwashed by the vegan &#39;lobby&#39;. Once keto-adapted, your ketones will be derived primarily from beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), not acetone.</p>

<p>And these ketones are incredibly anti-cancer for many types of cancers, which fuel on <em>glucose</em>!!!</p>

<p>This guy is on the right path:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEE-oU8_NSU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEE-oU8_NSU</a></p>

<p>You miss the forest for the trees regarding your meat statements. Shitty &#39;farmed&#39; meat is indeed shitty. Quality, grass-fed beef has a far better fatty acid profile.</p>

<p>But I will state that high vegetable intake is still <em>very</em> important, and most keto dieters do NOT do this right (or at all), and that&#39;s a very bad thing. Ketosis with veggies is unreal.</p>

<p>The body is awake and moving and interacting, But the auto-pilot part of the brain is still firing strong and focusing their body on needs/wants and for-filling the ego task for that juicy squirt of dopamine to make everything better until tomorrow where the whole routine happens over again.  No time to focus on the real stuff when you have an uncontrollable Id</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It feels that way but it is not so. Those of us awake - really awake (and there are more than you realize) are selective in the things we say to others. Being awake can be detrimental to one&#39;s survival so we learn to act like we&#39;re asleep while inwardly we&#39;re all too aware. </p>

<p>Want a tip for finding those who are awake?  Find those who are listeners rather than talkers.  Not shy folks or severe introverts but those who are socially normal but little is known about him/her. Usually these folks will have plenty of rumor and speculation floating around about them but nothing concrete.  It&#39;s not guaranteed but I&#39;ve been alive long enough to know nine times out of ten, those people are the awake and knowledgable ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>are you saying that needs further explanation? it&#39;s pretty simple...to be awake is to be aware, to be asleep is to be unaware, and there are various degrees of awareness...somebody like Sherlock Holmes would be an obvious extremely aware person that sees details everywhere that others ignore...this can apply to all facets of life including emotional empathy and compassion to problem solving...the more aware you are the better your intuition is going to work too and you can predict how things are going to play out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re telling me that people who line up to spend 1k on a new iphone every year care about morality and aren&#39;t stepping on people&#39;s backs to do that? When the materials required for those phones are mined in Africa by literal child slaves, and then assembled by slave labor in sweatshops. They buy products that are made by destroying the rainforest and plating palm oil trees.  You&#39;re saying that these people are moral and have strong values? A phone that is barely different than the one they bought last year is worth children working 16 hours a day as slaves? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel that exact way when I go to cities.  I know this is a huge generalization, but in my experience, the closer you get to a city, the more important it becomes for people to obtain meaningless possessions, and flaunt them as status symbols.  The further into the country I get, the more grounded in reality people seem to become.  Being around family becomes more important than working 60 hours per week to drive a leased BMW.  </p>

<p>When I visit friends in a big city, and see everyone working 2 jobs, not to get ahead and move somewhere nicer, but to impress neighbors with their new car and expensive clothes, I feel exactly how you do.</p>

<p>Assuming you live in a place like this, maybe you need to move somewhere where the average person values the same things in life that you do.  When you&#39;re surrounded by materialistic people, you start to feel like you&#39;re the crazy one, and it gets very lonely.</p>

I told him the only thing that separates me and you is that you are on team law enforcement and I&#39;m team civilian.  If you were on my team you&#39;d see it different.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s almost impossible, because deception is a major part of politics. All the political factions want to fool you into believing a certain ideology that benefits them. The news outlets (including alternative news) will pretend to be impartial and objective but they really aren&#39;t. </p>

<p>What worked for me was going deep into many different ideologies. Start with some subreddit about an ideology that you&#39;re interested in. Read it for a month or so until you believe every post. Then stop and go to a subreddit of the opposite ideology and read only that for a month. From the outside you will see what was bullshit about the first ideology and what was rather true. Then you move on to the third ideology which is different from the first two, and you will get another perspective. The more perspectives you get, the more you will be able to see the big picture. But it takes many many years until something useful crystalizes. And you will hold many false beliefs. But you will learn to question your own beliefs and to discard the false ones without fear. </p>

I feel that people seem normal until I bring up something about psychiatry and then they just glitch. They start making arguments that don&#39;t make sense like &quot;well, sure the drugs don&#39;t empirically do anything, but if placebos help people what&#39;s wrong with that.&quot; They generally just kind of turn off and get very uncomfortable.

<p>I like to live life, pay attention to those around me, try to pave an easier path for my fellow man, be courteous and polite yet aware and alert for potential dangers. </p>

<p>Sometimes, I need to put my bitch hat on, and take rather than give (like assert my way in traffic rather than let another wave of fifty ungrateful pedestrians just walk in front of my car with no acknowledgement that I stopped in the middle of the street for them) or I will fail to hold the door for the bastard that pulled it shut in front of me, even though my hands were clearly full. </p>

<p>I have left NO toilet paper (warned my daughter ahead of time) and yet one roll is retrieved from the separate garage, rather than the plastic wrapped six pack. WTF? Lazy, inconsiderate....and then I will ask if they saw the &quot;controversial news&quot; and they have not, but the MEN will tell me what happened to Facebook friend soandso. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s not just you. It’s you, and every other delusional individual convinced they’re somehow above those who don’t question everything. I get it. I do. But it’s a dangerous thing to assume that somehow your consciousness is more aware and that you don’t belong. You’re awake, they’re awake, you’re in society. If you weren’t, you wouldn’t be posting in a conspiracy subreddit on reddit.</p>

<p>Did you ever consider that? You’re posting your thoughts about how everybody is asleep, and you’re awake, in a corporate owned oligarchy. You’re on the grid and part of the grid in the same way those you assume to be asleep are.</p>

<p>None of us are awake. We can’t see beyond the veil. The veil covers our eyes just as those who refuse to believe in a veil. We will likely never see beyond  it. We are not here to look down on those who think differently from us, we are here to help them feel and recognize the veil that covers their eyes. They’re aware, you’re awake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A little late to the party, but...</p>

<p>I like to think we exist in a perpetual state of being &quot;almost over the edge&quot;.</p>

<p>Prices for goods, services, and commodities are high, but...not high enough.</p>

<p>Social tension is high, but...not high enough.</p>

<p>Political and corporate corruption is high, but...not high enough.</p>

<p>Everything is high enough to get our attention, but not so that we feel pressured to change it. We exist in such a fashion that we feel more or less forced to accept it <em>as is</em>. We long for the way things used to be while accepting that things are the way they are because things haven&#39;t changed enough to push us over that edge.</p>

<p>Not yet.</p>

<p>Eventually it will, though. Something will have to give, but ultimately, change will come when we, the average people, can&#39;t sustain the system the powers that be want us to. Whether it&#39;s the fact we can&#39;t afford the roofs over our heads, putting food on the table or clothes on our backs, something will cause us to break.</p>

<p>Until then, we live in that state of being individually and socially unhappy...<em>but not unhappy enough to do something about it.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you in the perception that mostly everyone seems asleep. But I have to say, a large amount of millennials in my life seem awake or are in the process of waking. It’s the babyboomers in my life that seem completely lost on what is actually going on. But then again, that’s obviously just my experience. </p>

<p>The older people get, the more stuck in their ways they are. Younger people are way more likely to question why things are the way they are because rules and norms have not been fully established with time, just in general according to many psych studies. I believe they call it the Einstein Effect (if I remember properly, it does have to do with Einstein having his big breakthrough at a young age because he challenged previously established rules in his field). For example, recent med school graduates have a high tendency to consider rarer diseases when diagnosing patients, while older doctors have a greater tendency to miss rarer diseases in patients because they are more likely to conclude things are status quo. </p>
