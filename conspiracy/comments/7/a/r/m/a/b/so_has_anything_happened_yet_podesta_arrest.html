    <div class="md"><p>Infiltrator of Antifa. What are you trying to say? That Antifa couldn&#39;t have planned anything because there is absolutely no central leadership therefore it&#39;s not even possible they would have coordinated things across regions?</p>

<p>Even with a headless cell structure (which I don&#39;t believe for a second they have), they are still capable of coordinating. In fact, that&#39;s part of the reason you do this kind of structure, it makes it impossible to infiltrate fully but you can engage in unified action at times.</p>

<p>ISIS = Organization</p>

<p>Antifa = Categorization. </p>

<p>You can infiltrate an organization, and have access to the top. You can infiltrate a brotherhood, and have ... at least a council or some sort of rough hierarchy of power. You can infiltrate a categorization for.. uh.. whatever that local isolated group that shares ideas with other groups in the categorization might know or do.</p>

<p>That’s really about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for <em>finally</em> saying what you meant.</p>

<p>So, you&#39;re a member of Antifa and they told you there is no central leadership? Are you familiar with compartmentalization?</p>

<p>&quot;The basis for compartmentalization is the idea that, if fewer people know the details of a mission or task, the risk or likelihood that such information will be compromised or fall into the hands of the opposition is decreased. Hence, varying levels of clearance within organizations exist. Yet, even if someone has the highest clearance, certain &quot;compartmentalized&quot; information, identified by codewords referring to particular types of secret information, may still be restricted to certain operators, even with a lower overall security clearance. Information marked this way is said to be codeword–classified. One famous example of this was the Ultra secret, where documents were marked &quot;Top Secret Ultra&quot;: &quot;Top Secret&quot; marked its security level, and the &quot;Ultra&quot; keyword further restricted its readership to only those cleared to read &quot;Ultra&quot; documents.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes. Are you familiar with how any of these groups operated, and were infiltrated, in the past? Are you familiar with COINTELPRO?</p>

<p>Do you know anything about how George Soros has paid &quot;young disenfranchised punks&quot; across the world to do the will of the US State Departmnet under cover of NGOs? Do you know about how he funded the Nazis that took over Ukraine?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perfect example. The alt-right is run by a bunch of FBI informers, like Richard Spencer. It is painfully obvious that he is a <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/10/exclusive-report-richard-spencer-confirmed-deep-state-plant/">fed</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;Media darling and Alt-Right leader Richard Spencer ran his own Discord chat server, where he required that Alt-Right members submit photographs and detailed personal information about themselves, before they were allowed to join the group planning the Charlottesville attacks.</p>

<p>We have already exposed how Spencer’s close friend and fellow Charlottesville rally organizer Jason Kessler watched while the terrorist attacks were planned on his personal Discord server.</p>

<p>On October 8th, revealed that Richard Spencer employed his close friend, and suspected pedophile, “TheBigKK” to gather data and require photographs of everyone connected to the Charlottesville rally on August 12th. Spencer required these measures to be taken in order to extract EXIF geotagging data from the images, so that he could obtain the home addresses of his recruits...</p>

<p>Richard Spencer is not a conservative. He has praised Bolshevism, and has called himself the “Karl Marx of the alt-right”. His mentor is a confused, retired academic, named Paul Gottfried. Gottfried says that the United States is no longer a republic, and is Nietzschean social Darwinist, who is a disciple of Marcuse and has been described as a “right-wing proponent of the Frankfurt school.”</p>

<p>The robotic talking points that Spencer reads off in mainstream media interviews come from his boss, William Regnery II, founder of the National Policy Institute. While college drop-out Richard Spencer pretends to “run” NPI from the basement of his mother’s 3 million dollar condo in Whitefish, Montana, it is really Regnery who is calling the shots.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It looks like it was a misdirection so the cabal didn&#39;t know the strike would actually be in Saudi Arabia. We will probably find out there was a lot more to this operation over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Secondary goals were leaking intelligence to the 4 chan intelligence agency (you&#39;ve got a bunch of eyeballs, why not give them &quot;bread crumbs), warning Antifa not to do anything stupid, and possibly causing some of the swamp creatures to panic and do something incriminating, like get arrested at the airport trying to flee the country.</p>

<p>Why Saudi Arabia? They run many of the <a href="http://larouchepub.com/other/2013/4032bust_lond_sar_axis.html">terrorist operations</a> in the Middle East so that the bankers don&#39;t get blood on their suits. </p>

<p>Drain the Saudi Arabian swamp and you shut down a nation that was behind 9/11 and ISIS, denying the CIA the ability to keep spreading mayhem through the whole Middle East theater.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if something would have happened, you&#39;d have been proven right? If something doesn&#39;t happen, it just shows how sneaky, sophisticated and coordinated &quot;they&quot; truly are? </p>

<p>Seems an awful lot like the excuse for continuing with the Cold War military build up: &quot;See how we can&#39;t even detect the Soviet advanced weapons systems? That must mean that they are light years ahead of us!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Or the excuse to invade Iraq: &quot;See how we&#39;ve repeatedly failed to find their WMDs? That&#39;s how advanced their program is! They&#39;re mobile labs on train cars!!!&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not super logic savvy though... can&#39;t figure out it you&#39;re denying the antecedent or confirming the consequent... regardless, you are wrong both anecdotally and formally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, then, don&#39;t reason like that. Sure, what you propose is POSSIBLE, but so is divine intervention (God literally inspired each and every antifa &quot;agent&quot; not to riot), parallel universes (antifa DID in fact riot their asses off... but in the Barenstein dimension), it was too cold so everyone independently decided not to do it, they all fell off the edge of the flat earth...whatever. I realize where I&#39;m posting, but has absolutely everyone lost the ability to discern the possible from the plausible? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get it, but we&#39;re arguing the significance of something that didn&#39;t happen.  I contend that the reason nothing happened on Nov. 4th was because there was nothing planned, while you contend that something COULD have indeed been planned, but was cancelled. It&#39;s a matter of what particular narrative (re: Antifa) that each of us holds as correct.</p>

<p>The difference in our narratives is that yours requires coordination between (likely) tens of thousands of rioters (who are all centrally controlled and, apparently, don&#39;t make independent decisions... wouldn&#39;t it have been likely that a few folks would have said &quot;screw it&quot; and rioted anyhow?) AND tens of thousands of law enforcement officers/military service personnel who were poised to strike and impose martial law.</p>

<p>My narrative is that it was a non-event from the outset and it was the fear and paranoia of the folks who were spreading &quot;inside information&quot; about 11/4 (&quot;I just got off the phone with a high ranking military agent, and he said that...&quot;) that lit up Reddit and 4chan...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the scenario I was talking about requires tens of thousands of rioters. In fact, it could be as simple as someone planning to plant a bomb or do a mass shooting or something. </p>

<p>Neither one of us knows enough to say definitively, so we have to try to draw logical inferences from the available information, rather than refusing to even lean toward one idea or another until it&#39;s proven.</p>
