        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">758</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-11-04 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/PrimeChronic420.html">PrimeChronic420</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I posted some general questions about this a few days ago and have finished my initial investigation. The journalist I was speaking to seems to think the peopl at the top are involved but didn&#39;t seem to want to pursue it further so I now release the information to all of you. I hope that with more minds involved, more truth can come to light.</p>

<p>First, the only legitimate reason I have been able to find for multiple people to hold this many different business names so similar is to protect real estate. I have looked for realtors licenses for most of the people involved and had no luck in the states the businesses were registered in.</p>

<p>Second, a majority of these businesses are either inactive or had their license permanently revoked. Some are still active, including Paddock&#39;s PR21.</p>

<p>Ok, so from the info that came out about Paddock being tied to Paradise Ranch 21, LLC, I started looking at that and found it on nevada-register.com. I noticed near the bottom it had similar businesses and there was listings for several other Paradise Ranch&#39;s with different numbers after them. After digging more, I found PR&#39;s numbered 1-25, plus some other PRs with other names after them, like PR Development, Entertainment inc, estates, group, learning center, etc. </p>

<p>From that I made a list of all the people listed as agents or managers on the same website and started noticing a couple addresses used a lot. Both were used by Paddock. I also noticed some names repeating.</p>

<p>From searching those addresses and names, I connected 3 other business names with the same setups, same name and just changing #s after the name, then adding LLC. Those other 3 businesses are:
Traverse Village (#1-25), LLC; 
Magnolia Center (#1-22), LLC; 
LVABP (##1-22), LLC</p>

<p>The main address tying these together is:</p>

<p>2360 Corporate Circle Ste 400
Henderson, NV 89074</p>

<p>There are only a few names that appear on more than 1 companies lists. There&#39;s only a few that appear on 3 companies lists. There&#39;s only one set of names with the same last name in that list.</p>

<p>Ralph Wallace Crawford; 
Orlyn Ann Crawford</p>

<p>There are multiple same last names on the managing lists of the companies though, indicating to me there are multiple families involved as well.</p>

<p>Stephen Paddock was PR21, Peggy Paddock was PR22. (Both used the 2360 address) I found through google an organization at pinoykids.org that claims to partner with Paradise Ranch. The organization is located in the Phillipines, rumored to be near Paddock&#39;s girlfriends home.</p>

<p>The old military base it talks about is rumored to be a hotbed of child trafficking.</p>

<p>To me that shows possible ties to child trafficking. That&#39;s what got me digging more, hoping to expose more of these pedophiles. I may be wrong, but that is my gut. </p>

<p>That is the major chunk of what I found. I hope between everyone else the real truth can be uncovered. </p>

<p>Note: I do have handwritten notes of all names and addresses in case they get scrubbed.</p>

<p>Note note: I am of sound mind and body and have no desire to take my own life, should my identity become public and this lead to some truly shady shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When filing for LLC’s etc, usually the address of the lawyer filing is used, so that could be why the addresses tie together. 
Also, many people who are in shady real estate have many LLC’s for various reasons, taxes, lawsuits, etc. for example one will own the house, and rent it out to the other one, then that one will rent to the renters. It’s usually to have multiple options come tax time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh wow! The plot thickens. Some files were released last year, I can’t remember which ones. In those files, a lady was telling her story of being mind controlled by the CIA and her interactions with the Clintons. She was naming names of the people involved, I wonder if his name was in there? I saved the file, but it is at work. I’m going to dig through those again and look for a mention of him. I’m willing to bet he was. It was all about when they were still in Arkansas, I believe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People often use LLC&#39;s for real estate transactions because of the tax benefits.  It is quite likely that a lawyer would set up these LLC&#39;s and assist in the RE transactions.  The address being repeated over and over is probably a law firm.  The LLC&#39;s will stop being paid for when the RE holding them is sold or otherwise transferred.  Thus they are terminated either voluntarily or by state revoking them for failing to pay yearly fees.  </p>

<p>Since OP didn&#39;t actually post the info as a document, it makes it hard to verify any of this without duplicating the work. If all of these businesses were in a similar region, the idea of it being a franchise is far more likely, if it&#39;s spread across the country and we aren&#39;t finding a highly successful Brand that operates nation wide, then OP may have a point.</p>

<p>Perhaps every kid and every nature-lover&#39;s ideal getaway, Paradise Ranch in Clark, Pampanga boasts of a petting zoo, various parks, and swimming pools. General manager Erick Gomez says Paradise Ranch is ran by non-profit organization the Philippine Children&#39;s Fund of America. It is also DENR&#39;s wildlife center for Region 3 where confiscated animals are kept, cared for and rehabilitated before they are released to the wild. People go here for events, parties, and seminars, or for rest and relaxation in any of their villas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious, since this guy was a high stakes gambler at these casino&#39;s in Vegas... wasn&#39;t he also one of those guys that has a player card for them?  That keeps track of what they&#39;re betting and earning?  Wouldn&#39;t they be able to tell if he actually made money off gambling like they are putting out in the media?  It&#39;d show his betting and his losing/winning correct?</p>

<p>This whole thing is just crazy.  Now it comes out he&#39;s an owner of all these &#39;business&#39;s&#39;??  There&#39;s some crazy stuff going on behind the scenes that aren&#39;t being put out to the public.  Someone&#39;s gotta sue to get those records. </p>

<p>I was very understanding of there not being a whole lot of victims coming out and demanding the truth for the first few weeks, but after this time frame, I&#39;d think there&#39;d be a whole lot of families coming out and asking what&#39;s up?  I know lawyers are probably involved but nothing of this makes sense.</p>

<p>They put out that he was struggling with money before the shooting... yet was able to just wire $100k to that chick?  Doesn&#39;t sound like he had money problems to me.</p>

<p>I want another interview with the wacky brother.  Trying to pretend to be normal, with his coffee mug in hand, almost like some prop since I never saw him drink out of it... and him having some theater shirt on one time.</p>

Each casino will have their own records and may or may not share them since they are in competition with each other. As far as releasing them to the public, good luck...

    <div class="md"><p>The problem here is that you can&#39;t go and say every Paradise Ranch 1-X is connected to every Traverse Ranch 1-X because there happense to be a solid connection between a couple of each.

<p>The second issue is that your object that links most of these companies together is a business address for a fairly large company that helps people register their businesses. I bet if you really wanted to dig, you would find thousands of businesses linked to both 2360 Corporate Circle Ste 400 Henderson, NV 89074 and 3773 Howard Hughes Pkwy - Suite 500s
Las Vegas, NV 89169-6014... because Incorp Services LLC. is openly associated with both addresses. incorp.com</p>

It is also entirely possible that these 4 companies using similar setups is not just a coincidence and there is something more here, whether immoral or illegal or both. That&#39;s all this is, a pursuit of the truth.
