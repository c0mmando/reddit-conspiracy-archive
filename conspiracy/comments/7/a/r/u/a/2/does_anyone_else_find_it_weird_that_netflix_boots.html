      <p>
       Bill sold out a long long time before "now". He has pushed the deep states pseudo science religion for decades. 99% of his degrees are recent and honorary. I think the only legit degree, if you can even call it that, was his BS in mechanical engineering. He is a failed comedian/actor who sold his sole to be a talking head on TV...nothing more....

       There is proof of what I say. That's the point....
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill and other tools like him, along with useful idiots, ignore and actively suppress actual proof obtained via experimentation in physical reality and replace it with theoretical nonsensical pseudoscientific dogma that completely ignores the scientific method. When they are called out with said proof, they mock, divert, attack, quote their theoretical mathematical dogma and assert their false "scientific authority"...but never produce results from objective real world experimentation.

       You are using a lot of big words. It almost looks like you are copy pasting this rhetoric from some script. I'm done talking about Bill.  We agree to disagree on his ideals. What I do want is your proof of the earth being flat. Because I can proove the diameter of the earth with math and measuring the angle of the sun from different points on the globe. Where is your proof? I want the reason you think the earth is flat? Reasons and evidence not your copy past rhetoric please

       I'm not copying and pasting anything...I just have the ability to use the brain God gave me before I type. And since I have had this type of conversation many times before, its a topic I am versed in.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off when i say "flat" its not to say that there aren't mountains and valleys slopes and levels. Its to say its not a globe. The proof is found in the results of real world experimentation. While math is used to calculate the shape of the globe earth in theory, the same math does not coincide with results of real world experimentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, I could ask the question, "If the earth was a globe 25k miles in circumference( or a globe of any size), what would be the rate of curvature?" and I could use math to answer that question accurately. But that in of itself does not prove that the earth is a globe 25k miles in circumference( or any size). You still need to apply that math to physical reality via experimentation to obtain proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "scientific" establishment ignores the real world experimentation step because it does not produce the results that they want. And because said experimentation does not produce said result, the earth therefore is NOT a globe 25k miles in circumference (or any size).

       Basically its the math used to calculate the curvature...and its telling us, "between any two points on a globe with a circumference that TPTB give us, this is how many inches of the globe will impede line of sight.". So at one mile you will lose ~8 inches, at 2 miles you will lose ~32 inches, 3 miles you will lose ~72, so on and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       To conduct the experiment you will need
       <strong>
        unobstructed line of sight between two points
       </strong>
       ( western united states will make this easier due to lower population density, but you can still do it in the eastern US...many have used the ocean or great lakes)
       <strong>
        at roughly the same elevation
       </strong>
       ( keep track of elevation at both points to account for it)
       <strong>
        Favorable atmospheric conditions
       </strong>
       ( meaning a clear day where atmosphere isn't impeding line of sight )
       <strong>
        and an adequate zoom lens, telescope or binoculars.
       </strong>
       ( the human eye has its limitations ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably the easiest thing to do would have 2 6ft or shorter friends stand 3 miles apart and look for each other across the distance. If they can see each other, they have proven that the curvature does not exist because at that distance their line of sight would be blocked by roughly 6 feet of earth if in fact it was a globe with a circumference that TPTB give us. Remember to account for elevation and atmospheric conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       FTR, people have tested this at much greater distances.

       because I think it is the best summary available, which include examples of above mentioned experiments. There might be one or two points that I am on the fence about, or flat out don't agree with, but to be honest, I have not watched it in some time so don't quote me on that. Regardless, if only the above mentioned experiment is correct, then that's all the proof one would need to at least show that earth is not a globe....I'm just mentioning this because the video goes into more than just the shape of the earth. And to be clear, I don't recommend the video to promote the narrator. I just think its the best summary in an ocean of information and disinformation. I can also link other material as well if you are serious about the topic.

SATS would not be needed on either a globe or a flat earth. Ground based devices could and do establish communication networks that TBTB claim SATS establish. I could go into a bit more detail about this, and will if you would like, but for now I will just conclude by saying that, while I'm sure there are things such as drones and balloons used for temporary networks for multiple reasons, at MUCH lower altitudes than what pseudos claim for SATS, what we are told about SATS is wildly nonsensical and impractical, and in some cases physically impossible.

       Well technically everyone lives in space, as all matter occupies space. But I'm confident you meant astronauts live in outer space on the ISS. This is a well established falsehood. There is ample evidence to prove that NASA is little more than a "hollywood production entity" ( see the 200 proofs video for more on this) that creates fabrications to fool the masses. And tbh, their productions are becoming harder to spot due to advances in technology such as
       <a href="https://youtu.be/V-Y6CvkEHvc">

       Motive will almost always be left to speculation, but IMO, the PRIMARY motive is to establish doubt about God's existence and creations into the masses. As well as control and financial reasons. Funding for "space" programs have generated billions of dollars in revenue over the years via taxation, and TPTB want to be God.

       To me, it doesn't always appear so, but regardless, the shape of the planets and or the moon, or what some will refer to as "wandering stars", does not have any bearing on the shape earth because they are all independent from the earth. A room full of monkey's does not make me a monkey simply because I am in the same room as them.

       I acknowledge that we see something up there, but people in general just accept what they have been told about them, as opposed to using the scientific method to know for themselves. This is because the ability to use said method to gain knowledge is virtually impossible. TBTB on the other hand lie and tell us that they have the ability to do so, so we should just take their word for it.

       SpaceX and other "private companies" are TPTB answer to people waking up to the NASA deceptions. SpaceX and similar companies receive shit tons of funding from governments via subsidies. They are a civilian agency in name only and participate in the same deceptions and productions as NASA does. So yeah, they are fake in all the was that matter.

      <p>
       I will conclude this by saying that like most globers, you tend to aim your attention and questions to the matters of space above us, when you should be starting your journey of discovery closer to home. Start with the curvature experiment and work your way up. Crawl before you walk, connect the dots along the way and the truth will become apparent.

       Ok, thanks for answering all of my questions. Where is your proof tho? Where is the edge? If its flat there is an edge right? Finding proof of the edge seems a lot easier than faking entire industries. My career uses the curvature of the earth for a lot of things. If the earth was flat we would be able to use one coordinate syestm for the entire earth. Since it is a ball we cannot use a flat plane. I do transformations on coordinate systems every day. Do you know what that is?

       The proof come from results of experimentation conducted in our physical reality. Thought we already covered this.

       Well, this is a topic still being debated, even within the flat earth community. Primarily because of limitations in the ability of man to traverse the distances and withstand the elements required to conduct experiments. Not to mention the active suppression of information spoken of in my previous comments and restrictions to travel which have been applied using military forces.
      </p>
      <p>

       ] is generally accepted as a map of our "flat" earth. Where the north pole is in the center and Antarctica is actually an ice wall making up a perimeter around it, as opposed to globe earth where Antarctica is a land mass on the "south pole" of the globe. So no "edge" to fall off of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some have theorized that the "ice wall" expands to infinity, as illustrated
       <a href="http://whotfetw.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Flat-Earth-Models-13.jpg">

       , or that our physical plain of existence expands to infinity and there are multiple "habitats" on said plain, as illustrated

        here
       </a>
       . But most are in agreement that said habitat or habitats are enclosed in a transparent, or ever so slightly opaque, dome of some kind, as illustrated
       <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eizwrSK4UP8/maxresdefault.jpg">
        here
       </a>
       Some more still have theorized that there is actually liquid or a dense gas on the other side of said dome as illustrated

       ..an "Aether" if you will,  and that the stars and planets are actually traveling through it, using it as a medium in which to travel. This last part could even be considered to be proven correct already, as explained
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7tIbwK0ulM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">
        here
       </a>
       . But I need to do more study on it to come to a conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, it's extremely difficult to conduct experiments to know the answers to some question for sure because of distance and the elements involved. A lot of these theories have been constructed from known truths, ancient myths,ancient texts, "religious" texts and observations from a distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       SOmethign worth asking yourself though...Is it just by chance, as scientism would assert, that we as humans have the perfect habitat to thrive in? And at the same time, we have natural barriers from going to far in any one direction? We go to far up and we lose our air to breath and atmospheric pressure and matter as a medium to travel. We go to close or too far from the north pole( the center of flat earth) and we encounter extreme cold. We go too far down below the surface and we encounter extreme heat or too far down in the ocean and encounter extreme pressure. But at the same time we have a vast area to explore and thrive in. Seems almost like a testing ground to me. An ant farm or rat maze, or observatory if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quick side note about going down and experiencing heat. Did you know that even though scientism claims to know how the inner workings of the globe earth works, down to the depths of its core...the deepest hole on record anyone has ever dug is
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole">
        less than 8 miles below the surface
       </a>
       ? It's an obvious assertion that scientism says they know what is going on for sure at approximately 500 times that depth...

       But I agree...video and pictures are one thing....seeing it for yourself is another...this is why i suggested that you should conduct the previously mentioned experiment yourself. And if you actually took the time to watch the 200 proofs video and tried to understand what was being said, you might just learn something.

      <p>
       I don't know how I can say it any differently....proof is obtained by verifying theory via real world experimentation. You want proof? Look at the video I have provided where people are conducting the experiments...or again...go do it yourself.
      </p>

       And lets get something straight here bud...YOU came asking me questions...so anytime you want to stop asking them, that's fine with me. No one is forcing you to be here....

       I see manipulations. They mixed lies with truth to confuse the viewer and to push their false narrative. If the earth was curved, and the lazer remained level, the lazer beam wouldn't have been higher, the earth, or in this case the water on the earth, would have been blocking the lazer beam...or to say, the beam would have had to travel through the water to reach its target. So what happened here is that someone by the lazer angled it up. You can actually see this at the 3:21 mark.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, TPTB actively try to suppress the truth, by any means available to them. But an objective mind will always discover their deceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Multiple people have actually conducted this experiment without cheating and got the results one would expect if the earth was "flat". There is a lot of disinfo out there. And there were lot of "fair videos" that were readily available in the past on places like youtube that have since been removed and or buried...but I will look for some to share.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, you can conduct said experiment yourself with or without a lazer, and I would encourage you to do so. Remain objective and control the conditions of your experiment so that it remains honest and you will get the results I described.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you haven't already, watch that 200 proofs video. This particular point is discussed and experiments are shown.

       As I have mentioned before, the sun moon and stars are separate from the earth. Their shape, whatever it truly is, does not dictate the shape of the earth. I am not a monkey simply because I am in the same room as a bunch of monkeys.
      </p>
      <p>
       I acknowledge the phases of the moon, and won't pretend to know what is causing the phases, though i do have theories. But one can prove that the earth is not a globe, so I know that it's not the earths globe shape that is causing them.

       Even if the earth was an "oblate spheroid", one would be able to measure for curvature. and you would still be able to see it while doing real world experimentation...even at modest distances....but YOU CANT....because its not there.

       Dude that is exactly what you and the majority of the population is doing...disregarding evidence because it doesn't fit your narrative....

      <p>
       Again....the moons phases are a separate issue than the shape of the earth. You only insist that its not because you believe that the earth casting a shadow causes them, because you believe that the world is a sphere...or as neil calls it, a spheroid....but that assertion can be disproved via real world experimentation.

       I disagree because the "flat" stationary earth can be proven via experimentation in physical reality. And I have apparently "fit the pieces together"  adequately enough for at least one user in the last day to actually consider the possibility that the earth is "flat" and that the "globe" is false. As seen
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7arua2/does_anyone_else_find_it_weird_that_netflix_boots/dpde09j/?context=3">
        here
       </a>
       . Its not like I am the only one who sees the truth. The debate on the shape of the earth has never stopped....it has only been suppressed and or mocked by TPTB and useful idiots. But thank God for the internet, because more and more people are gaining access to this type of information...
      </p>
      <p>
       And its not about me "winning people over"...if you want to believe in a spinning globe earth, feel free to do so, but don't tell me that its a proven physical reality, because I can scientifically prove it to be a false reality. It's like all this tranny acceptance stuff being pushed... If you are a man who wants to dress up, take drugs, surgically alter your body to look like a woman, or vice versa...that's your choice...but don't tell me that you ARE a woman and expect me to agree with you...because you aren't...and no amount of theoretical math or assertions is going to make that a physical reality....

       His show was the perfect blend of scientific facts, assumptions based on those facts, and completely erroneous or unprovable conclusions based on those assumptions which is essentially the same exact formula that the pseudo scientific religion follows as a whole.

       Well there are different levels of respect for a number of reasons. I think the number of people I do respect, in one way or another, far outnumber the people I don't. But then again, I have had little to no contact with most of the human population....so who knows?

       Illuminating isn't it. Same basic concept most people have when it goes to most any conspiracy theory. They are happier not knowing or not believing. It is why most avoid such topics.

       The video I think was about sexuality. Sex education is an invaluable tool to teach children about the reality of sex and sexual preference. I don't see anything wrong with the video. Bill Nye is not a pedophile. He's one of the good guys. I was taught about sex and genitalia when I was 14. She should have included STDs and pregnancy in the song but okay.

       I haven't made any comments one way or the other, my comment was stating how certain information would rather not be known by most people as it could hinder their perception of the world. So, coolio that you perceive Bill Nye as a good guy. It isn't for me to say whether or not he is a pedophile I don't actually know. Nor have I inferred. The subject matter within the video was illuminating was it not?

       Yeah it was cringe-worthy, but educational. And also, fleshlights. If I had kids I would totally buy them sex toys to masturbate with when they turn 14. I'd rather them masturbate than get knocked up or get an STD. I'm the kind of person that wants people to have knowledge. I don't care if it makes people feel uncomfortable. Better to be safe and aware than in the dark and repressed.

       Wait until you have kids my dear. Perhaps your stance will change as they age. Perhaps not. I think it could be beneficial, but I don't think buying a flesh light for your teenage son will deter him from wanting to have sex. If there is a will there is a way. That is the basis for anything though. If you have the will to achieve something and that will isn't easily diminished than it is likely you will achieve that goal. Doesn't matter how long it takes if that is where all your energy is being spent you will achieve it.

       Well I mean, I guess it's okay? As long as they use condoms, get tested, both CONSENSUAL, legal, and provided they are aware of the consequences then okay?
      </p>
      <p>
       Purity is virtue. Saving one's self for love is beautiful. But, if people want to get it over with and explore that's also okay. I am all for expression and gettin one's freak on in a healthy, safe, CONSENSUAL way.

       I forgot to add, I myself find impure people unattractive. I'm a bit of a prude. But I don't judge 'experienced' people and I wouldn't judge my kids if they want to be 'experienced'. I just personally find that not attractive at all.

       Just wanted to make one last comment in general. Sexuality is good and is necessary for healthy development. It is when sexual experiences are forced on someone that sex becomes bad. Teens should be able to touch themselves, explore their bodies and when they are ready, be in a committed relationship when they're older. They should be free to love women, men, both. Obviously there must be self control and safe sex is crucial, but sexuality is a beautiful and worthwhile thing to explore. It is who we are.

       If I had a kid, I would still check out the series first before letting my kid watch it, because it's a new series - people change. That's just common sense. Now, original episodes of BNtSG, sure...but, a new show, I'd be checking it out beforehand.

       I have no idea what your problem is, tbh. I don’t find anything about this remotely alienating, except for the sketchy musical artistry involved. What’s your cultural background, if I may ask? I‘m from Germany, and compared to the sex education classes and programs in our schools, this is cutesy and tame.

       Would you sit down and watch all episodes of something before letting the kid watch, or would you watch the first 1-3 episodes and then make a decision?

       Considering this show isn't actually marketed as for kids, I'd give it more careful scrutiny. Maybe even...oh, I don't know...sit down and watch it with them if they really wanted to see it.

       yes everybody should but there are ways of teaching that are betters than others, bringing this kind of song on a science tv show it's not, even if you give someone the consensus to teach your kid about it this song isn't a good option.

       The tv-14 link is just an imgur of the shows logo or something?

       I watched half the second link. Wtf? I'm wondering at this point how many of these people are smack-puppets or even straight up hostages being forced to do this shit. Are they really so caught in their own little bubble of bullshit they think this kind of thing is a good idea on any level?

       He was THE MAN back in the day when he was just Bill Nye the Science Guy, getting us all interested in science. Then he was gone. He wasn't on the air anymore. Everyone started to forget. Sure, we had reruns to watch and show our children once we grew up and started families of our own, but Bill wasn't really there. He yearned for the good old days when he was in every classroom, on every TV after school. Now he has an opportunity to appeal to a whole new generation of kids. He sees the way things are now, he's still a smart fella, and he jumps on it. Throws himself into it fully, all the while aware that he's alienating his old audience. It's okay, though. We aren't paying his bills anymore. He's an entertainer. A children's entertainer. He knows what he has to do and say to appease the liberal networks and media. He needs a steady paycheck. But more than that, he wants to be relevant again. He needs it. If he taught real science pertaining to sex and gender, he'd be vilified.  I miss the old Bill. The one from my childhood. The Bill that was a rock-solid science guy. The Bill that you could trust to give you the coolest facts and show you awesome experiments. That Bill can never come back now. We've all seen what level he'll stoop to for the sake of being in the spotlight again. RIP Bill Nye the Science Guy. I'll never forget the man you once were.
