     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       So, before I start, let me say; I do not think I am being monitored in my everyday life.
      </p>
      <p>
       This strictly relates to my online "life".
      </p>
      <p>
       First, let me take you back to about 4 to 6 months ago...
      </p>
      <p>
       I was working in my work area at home. I have a desktop and a laptop. I was working on them both simultaneously. While I was working on my laptop, I catch something out of the corner of my eye. I look over to my desktop and it's reacting like it has been remotely accessed. Hovering over icons, clicking folders, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I go to my desktop and try to stop it from moving, but it's like someone is fighting me on the other end. I turned off my wifi, but it didn't work. So I decided to perform a cold boot on my computer and shut it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       As soon as I do that, my power in my entire house shut off. I looked out the window and a few other houses around me were out too, so I figured it was just a coincidence...
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast foward to now, I am working on a collabo song with someone of middle eastern ethnicity located in the Netherlands.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never met the guy in person. It was strictly online only. He makes music. I record vocals. So we collabed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So he sent me the music and I recorded it in my studio. The lyrics are vague, but they have certain keywords that I think may trigger algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
       If not this song, then something in my past. I have songs that literally explain and lay out things like Operation Northwoods word for word.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I worked on it for a couple days and let it sit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I put all my things on a cloud drive after having multiple problems with external hard drives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still back my shit up on external hard drives, but I went against my instinct and uploaded to a cloud, just in case the shit hits the fan and I lose all my drives.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I open up my music project file today and there is a new audio track added and it's titled "harder".
      </p>
      <p>
       I never title my tracks something generic like "harder". If the song requires a harder/harsher more death metal type vocal it would be titled something like V1AHarderVox. Not just "harder".
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody else accesses my computer, let alone knows how to access the programs I use to add tracks, record music, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am convinced that someone is monitoring me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably some bored asshole at the NSA who has nothing else to do. Maybe he did his research on me and likes a song I made and now he's discreetly adding his own opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make it "harder". I don't know. I realize this sounds stupid. But, I know if my job at the NSA was to watch for terrorism and I had access to everyone's personal info, I'd probably fuck around with people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am considering just abandoning the internet all together when it comes to "speaking my mind". It's really becoming a waste of time. I complain, people downvote, don't agree or think I'm being ridiculous. Nothing ever gets resolved from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, participating on subs like r/conspiracy just feels like a way to set you up for treason or domestic terrorism when the government figures out a way to fuck us under some new future fascist laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your only real "get out of jail free card", is to claim it is art or comedy. And if it's good, they'll monitor it and if it's too good, they'll offer you a contract and mold you into their perfect little mainstream puppet.

       So you're saying an employee of one of the worlds most advanced security agencies is monitoring you, and in thus monitoring process they opened a folder of your music and changed the name of the file to "harder." Yeah dude seems totally plausible /s.

       If I told you in 2000 that a handful of weak looking middle eastern men were going to hijack planes with box cutters and change the course of US history, you would have scoffed at that too.

       My point of this post is to outline that if you are too out spoken online, it is possible and probably likely that someone is keeping tabs on it personally.

       It could well be that somebody has accessed your computer using Remote Desktop. Maybe they just cast around looking for IP addresses that had a slumbering PC at the end of it, found yours, and used the default password to access your Administrator account. After that they can get into your computer any time they want so long as you stay on that IP.

       strategy of tension and paranoia usually works well to garner results. it's basically psychological non-violent terrorism used to shut people down... and it definitely has a precedent of being used on journalists, researchers, and the yet to be killed curious cats... :/ a little fuckery goes a long way. our entire russian cyber war interference on the news is exactly this same thing. a bit of tallent and trolling is causing an entire nation to foam at the kiester

       when you have a perfectly manicured garden, you tend to the weeds, water it, and mow the lawn regularly to stay ahead of crisis mode. it is easier to nip the probing budding seeker in the bud and keep em down before they flower than it is to only uproot the blossoming and windblown dandylion. why not use the vast resources garnered, to in their down time prune the garden? 
it's what i would do.

       are you saying that open minded online active collaberative artists who ask questions ARE NOT on the scan of pruning the garden? this isn't a new science. it's a millenia old pattern with new high tech toys. toys people 1000 years ago would consider magic and god powers. the silver lining is that in a free world, any individual is allowed tpo learn and use these powers at equal measure so that the wizards and warlocks can keep the world in cjheck...

       Yeah um...the population being what it is...I'm sure they would devote resources to following people who were actually suspicious rather than someone making music. Millions of people dabble in making music in one form or the other. Highly doubt they would be so obvious while following people as well.

       When i was in a college a fellow engineering classmate was an avid WOW player who had a friend in the NSA. He told me that recently he had been talking to this friend, who asked if he could use D's WOW account. D told him sure, no big deal, let me give you the password, to which the NSA friend told him, well, I have already been using it, I used my work laptop to get your password.
