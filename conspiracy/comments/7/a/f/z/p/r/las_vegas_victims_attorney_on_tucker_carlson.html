<p>even the smallest amount of pain or discomfort changes my voice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Experience some pain/a serious injury in your life, and you will encounter the world of &quot;shock&quot;.  Where you can be bleeding profusely from a head wound or trying to stand on a broken limb, and not realize you are seriously hurt.  I had a co-worker cut off a part of a finger in a deli slicer, and she had the dis-association with pain enough to turn off the slicer, take the meat off the slicer, and collect the piece of finger off the platen before she even called the manager to let him know to call the paramedics and have them respond.  </p>

<p>The human brain is a mysterious organ that can allow us to function even under serious injury.  Look at the case of a man who had his arms ripped off in a farm accident, and called for help, then waited in the bathtub for help to arrive so he wouldn&#39;t bleed on the carpet. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like keeping his wits and running 400 feet uphill to his house with blood oozing from the stumps of his arms; like using the bone that dangled from his left shoulder to open the door; like phoning for help by using a pen clenched in his teeth to peck out the number on the touch-tone dial; like waiting for some 30 minutes alone, huddled in the bathtub so he wouldn’t get blood on his mother’s carpet; like helping the volunteer ambulance crew locate plastic garbage bags and ice to pack his severed arms...</p>

<p>here, maybe testing to see what americans reaction would be. to pass laws requiring sales of metal detectors to hotels would be another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it was a False Flag. Every False Flag we (think) we have had (9/11, Sandy Hook, etc) Those stories were running 24 hours for months and the entire narrative and story was almost completely created within a day or two of the event. Then the politicians started pushing <em>already written</em> bills because of the event. </p>

<p>In this case, This was scrubbed from the news cycle in weeks. We don&#39;t even have people who were at the concert talking about it on the news or radio shows. No &quot;parents of the victims&quot; having press conferences, no politicians using the event to push bills, and the most telling is there is No narrative, No timeline, and No official &quot;story&quot;. </p>

<hr/>

<p>So if this was a False Flag done by the Deep State and their goal was (lets say) Gun Control (could be anything but I just use gun control as an example).</p>

<p>We would have a full and complete story (within days) Of Paddock getting guns because of &quot;loopholes&quot; multiple character witnesses saying &quot;He should have never owned a gun&quot;, we would have videos of him buying guns, of him taking the guns to his room, we would have his internet history clearly showing &quot;signs&quot; he shouldn&#39;t own a gun. Ect. </p>

<p>But we don&#39;t have that. We have absolutely nothing. </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t believe in any way that this was a False Flag. If anything it was a botched undercover CIA mission. And now they are just trying to sweep it under the rug. </p>

<p>I mean, the dead guy in the pictures in not even Paddock, Or Paddock is not Paddock. The entire thing is just completely fucked. And MGM may have had some insider information form the CIA that the &quot;sting&quot; was going to go down, and after everything went so completely fucking bad they just noped the fuck out, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are jumping to conclusions. That does not mean you are wrong, but you&#39;re concluding before you have factual evidence and due diligence to back it up. </p>

<p>Like you, I have a massive amount of suspicions about what happened and what I think might have happened. </p>

<p>One thing I can see (and can&#39;t say with certainty) is that MGM knows that they are massively and grotesquely liable if there was a large amount of time passed between Campos calling in the shooting to the team at MGM and MGM then waiting for six minutes to call 911.  </p>

<p>I see a coverup by MGM to limit their liability. I see LVPD helping them cover it up. MGM has so much persuasion in that town. LVPD seems to be in their pocket and acting as their puppet. Scary shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard the audio before but just listened a few times right now. I would honestly bet everything I own that he was not shot during that call.</p>

<p>Two things:</p>

<p>1) you would not talk that slow when you have a .223 round in your leg. </p>

<p>2) the bigger one...he starts off the call saying &quot;hey ummm&quot;. Now just picture yourself getting shot at 200 times and having a bullet go through your leg..would you really call 911 and start a conversation off with &quot;hey ummm&quot;</p>

<p>He literally sounds like someone calling in a Dominos pizza...&quot;hey ummm can I get the 5-5-5 deal?&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fucking Murdoch network is it not? On TV networks, the viewer is the product and the advertisers are the clients. Seeing how every major network - especially a fucking Murdoch one - are connected in the giant clandestine and subversive web of clandestine operators, it&#39;s literally impossible anything damaging to government narratives would be shown on a network like Fox.</p>

<p>What you&#39;re saying is literally a retarded concept on its face. Murdoch has helped presidents in the past. They are politically and financially motivated - not journalistically. It&#39;s not even a news network, dude. It&#39;s an advertising agency.</p>

<p>That’s the source of confusion. This is the first we have heard of <em>any</em> law enforcement on the floor at that time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I specifically recall a woman calling in to The Larry King Show and pleading or someone to listen that her husband was the pilot that flew George Bush 41 to Europe (That he was being held political prisoner and gave his name, etc.) for the October surprise gift delivery that kept the Iranian (Americans) hostages from being released before the election and Jimmy Carter from being re-elected.</p>

<p>A few days later, someone else called in and asked if there was any update to that story and good old Larry, true to form, said he &quot;did not remember any such call&quot;</p>

<p>After the break, he launched into this big diatribe about how conspiracy theories never pan out and that, &quot;My first producer told me to never get too involved in theories, because nothing ever comes of them and you end up looking like an idiot.&quot;</p>

<p>What a tool.</p>

<p>If you look up the pilot, Gunther K. Russbacher, the Wikipedia article on the October Surprise comes up, yet his name is absent from the article.</p>

<p>To this day, I remember that lady&#39;s call. It was his wife Peggy. She sounded honestly and genuinely desperate. That was in 1987 and I was in Beloit, WI, working. Thirty years later, I remember the call. Larry forgot in a few days and she was ignored.</p>

<p>Time is both the enemy of the truth and the revealer of lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, at least the Sheriff&#39;s handlers agree with me that Paddock&#39;s complete lack of motive is problematic.</p>

<p>Questions for Sheriff Lombardo:</p>

<p>OK, so how was Paddock losing money? Was he on a gambling losing streak finally after years of getting rewarded as a comped high roller by casinos for fleecing them for millions? How many millions did he have before he started losing money? How many millions had he lost and how was he losing these millions?</p>

<p>What did Paddock do with the hard drives that were missing from more than one of his computers? And why did he have computers in his room with no hard drives in them? Were these computers operable in some way? Were any bootable flash drives found? If not, why would Paddock have multiple inoperable computers in his hotel room?</p>

<p>We just heard that Campos radio in that shots were fired.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwJVkxubaWQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwJVkxubaWQ</a></p>

<p>Does this sound like a guy who had heard drilling, found hotel floor that had been barricaded from the stairwell, had radioed in to report this 6 minutes earlier at 9:59 p.m, had then took the stairs to the 33rd floor, exited, walked to the elevators and took one back down to the 32nd floor and who had just been was shot in the leg as he walked outside Paddock’s door?</p>

<p>And just when did Paddock kill himself? What is his estimated time of death? If not more than an hour previous to the LVPD &quot;wolf at his door,&quot; why didn&#39;t the police hear or react to the fatal shot or shots?</p>

<p>Exactly how many rounds did Paddock fire in his hotel suite? Exactly how many rounds did he fire from the adjacent room? Which of his 23 guns were fired? Did any of these weapons jam? Were any of these weapons faulty? Did Paddock replace any clips? We are really expected to believe that nobody has any of this information a month later and that none of it will ever be known?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m just basing my assertion on the fact that MGM is the main actor here changing the timeline up and releasing misinfo/omitting information. We&#39;re on what, the 3rd or 4th timeline now? No videos released. With the releasing of the news about these officers on the floor now, that makes 4 MGM employees there (2 were off duty officer from what the video says). If it was a hoax or setup for legislation, its failed to even ban bumpstocks with Dems and the NRA agreeing they should be illegal, but a month later and it&#39;s all old pretty much old news. I would think they&#39;d make a push quickly to ban guns or whatever, plus it&#39;s a republican congress/presidency so you can&#39;t expect much (if any) anti-gun legislation. </p>

<p>MGM not wanting to get sued is one thing, but the more information they release the less it makes sense. Why would campos go to Mexico at this time? Why have him only go on Ellen first (where she speaks for him and is being handled)? With the new info about these MGM cops being on the floor, we now have a group of people possibly conspiring together to attain an end..the only question is what that end may be. </p>

<p>Also, watch some body cam videos of police shootouts (if you haven&#39;t seen them), someone involved in a gunfight (and especially if they&#39;re shot) is yelling that shit out ASAP, campos seems really calm and relaxed for having 200 rounds shot at him and being hit (could be shock, but I&#39;d think you want to put it out there that you&#39;re hit in order to save your life). </p>

<p>Also, if the photos from the scene are real, they are staged as fuck. Who places a rifle down on its bipod in a hallway in the middle of a rampage? How does a rifle bipod have your leg in between it after you blasted yourself with a revolver? Where&#39;s he evidence markers seen in every crime scene ever (with measurement indicators, numbered shells etc). </p>

<p>With this info plus everything else that&#39;s come out on paddock and his family/income/investments..I&#39;m thinking he&#39;s either a fall guy dead body, or was involved in some kind of deal with these MGM employees (still doesn&#39;t answer the question of why shoot at the concert, maybe a diversion?). I&#39;m just basing it off of the facts we&#39;ve been given and don&#39;t want to seem like I know exactly what happened, just working with what we have. Maybe LVMPD found out, as did the FBI and the FBI took over the case and is colliding with MGM to not release info/spread misinfo.</p>
