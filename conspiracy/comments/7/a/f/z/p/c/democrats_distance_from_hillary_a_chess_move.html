Are they distancing themselves from Hillary and exposing their own party&#39;s corruption to spend the next three years creating a new and improved &quot;transparent&quot; party? 
We aren&#39;t Hillary ...and we def ain&#39;t Trump...vote for us....idk I just be thinkin</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I was thinking earlier today as well. They finally realized that HRC is a toxic brand, and that as long as people associate her with the Party, then the Party&#39;s brand is also toxic. I fear this is all a cynical ploy to pin all the corruption on HRC, DWS, and her campaign to continue to avoid major changes.</p>

<p>They purged Bernie&#39;s appointments to the Rules and Ethics Commissions in the DNC...they have no plans on changing what they do, they are just working on a face-lift. </p>

<p>You&#39;re taking the political theater way too seriously. People are finally telling the truth about Hillary Clinton because it&#39;s been made clear they won&#39;t be murdered or their blackmail files aired to the American people for doing so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps, though I think this is far bigger than HRC. The Party has no plans on changing, the real power brokers who donate to the party and its members/politicians don&#39;t want anything to change, so HRC may finally be allowed to whither away in an attempt to save the Party. Won&#39;t do shit for em&#39; though in the Primaries and for defending themselves against the Progressive insurgency that has taken 8 state parties from them so far. </p>

<p>There was just an indictment of several swamp creatures, it was announced that John Podesta&#39;s lobbying firm is under investigation, and the former head of the DNC is openly calling Hillary Clinton a criminal and it&#39;s being covered by major news outlets. It&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>First: I am going to re-institute a 5-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government for 5 years after they leave government service.

<p>Yeah, we got a few fallguys getting indictments on offenses that are nowhere near the true depths of criminality and corruption within government. That should be enough to satisfy everyone that justice has been done! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I noted this in another thread, but </p>

<p>1) Jimmy Carter comes out an defends Trump<br/>
2) The media starts reporting on Uranium One<br/>
3) Podesta linked to Manafort (though this was known before)<br/>
4) Clinton and Obama linked to Steele dossier by the media<br/>
5) Indictments. Dates in Manafort&#39;s indictment point to Podesta Group<br/>
6) Tony Podesta steps down from the Podesta Group<br/>
7) Skippy goes on a twitter rampage, bringing up PizzaGate for no reason at all. Claims to be a victim of a witch hunt<br/>
8) Reddit says it won&#39;t ban T_D<br/>
9) Twitter admits to censoring DNCLeaks and PodestaEmails<br/>
10) Brazille throws Obama and Clinton under the bus by admitting they colluded to rig the primaries against Bernie<br/>
11) Elizabeth Warren agrees the primaries were rigged against Bernie  </p>

<p>Seems the writing is on the wall for a good number of people. </p>

<p>That seems to be the main problem, most of what Hillary did was legal but wrong. She knew how to play the system too well. Hopefully it!&#39;a fixed to prevent a repeat down the line.</p>
