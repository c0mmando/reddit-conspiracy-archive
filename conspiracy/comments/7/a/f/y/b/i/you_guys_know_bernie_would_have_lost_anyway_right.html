       To be fair, Clinton lost by a combined 80,000 votes in three states, so if Sanders even did like 0.2% percent better than Clinton, he wins.

       Trump won in a landslide. Biggest victory ever. Even defeating illegal votes. Bernie woulda got destroyed and shamed by the country for being a murderous communist. We can't afford to pay for people to get free school. I had to pay for mine is the Uni going to give my money back?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've paid for medical expenses out of my own pocket for years. We can't afford free healthcare because we need our rich to have more money to trickle down on us so we can all succeed. We also need our military budget or we'll get swarmed by carrier ships of muslims and mexicans invading us. BUILD. THE. WALL.

       Bernie would have been assassinated, but if he somehow survived I think he had a shot. No point in arguing though, it's all just speculation.

       The real American Leftists are always assassinated when they start gaining steam and a real chance at power or influence. JFK, RFK, MLK...personally I believe if Bernie is healthy he will run in 2020, so I still fear for his life.

       I actually agree. I have even stated this before Trump was sworn in. If it was Bernie against Trump, Trump still would have won. Ofcourse Bernie would have had a much better chance of beating Trump. People also said I was stupid for claiming Trump was gonna beat Hillary in a land slide despite the polls and constant media bashing. Dude had high energy during his campaign and would not back down from anything.

       I think this is one of the biggest things that Trump does not get credit for that Clinton totally whiffed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the last few days before the election, Trump was out there campaigning like a madman....3, 4, 5, stops per day...giving speeches, asking for votes, full of energy and showing Americans
       <em>
        he really wanted to be president.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary had a few tightly controlled appearances, seemed to be waiting to be coronated, that it was a done deal. She never even visited a few critical states that she assumed were in the bag, while Trump campaigned in those states hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       I truly believe that if Clinton went to Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and campaigned hard, she would've won the election. But she didn't. And she didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       CAVEAT: Voting machines are fixed and can't be trusted. I really have no idea if Trump won or not. But I'm glad he did, because she's the fucking devil and he's just a greedy narcissistic asshole.

       I had a feeling she might lose when a friend of mine drove across country and told me he saw thousands and thousands of Trump signs through the south and midwest and like 40 Clinton signs.
      </p>
      <p>
       At first I thought, "Well, there's a whole new generation that's online, they don't know the value of political signs," etc. But as the campaign rolled along and I was reminded what a hateful evil murderous piece of shit she is, it began to dawn on me that maybe Trump actually could win. I still didn't believe it until it happened, though.

       Its because the media actually did a good job in making people believe she had it in the bag. Repeat something enough and it will start to engrain itself in your mind. This is why some were stunned when he did pull off the win. I wasn't surprised, I was 90% sure he'd win just based off of how full of shit the media is as proved by Trump himself.

       Bernie sure had a hell of a better chance than Hillary did. It is one of the more egregious parts of what she did by stealing the nomination.

       Trump was the most disliked candidate of all time, Bernie is among the most popular politicians in America. It would've been no contest.

       I don't believe so at all.

       A
       <em>
        lot

       of people chose not to vote. Bernie would've taken the countries young voters by a landslide and would've brought people out to vote who normally don't.

       I said this in another relevant thread, no one was gonna wait hours to vote for Hillary because they didn't like Trump, but they would've waited all day for Bernie.
