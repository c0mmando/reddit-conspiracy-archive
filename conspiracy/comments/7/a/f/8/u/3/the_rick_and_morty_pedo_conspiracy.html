       Tied Into Kid Konsumers Knots
      </h1>
      <p>
       Secret Love Tunnels under the White House? Machiavellian Surveillance? No problem! But, watch as your kids witness the hilarious cartoon smorgasburg orgy of
       <strong>
        cannibalistic incest
       </strong>
       that is Rick And Morty. Don’t get me wrong, I actually like the show, but this too shall not pass unremarked, as it does in MSM after Saint Weinestein Day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m no expert, but I don’t think kids should watch the depravations of developmentally thwarted adults. The same child porn idiots in charge of your kids’ AI devices. If you give your kid one of them, some perv in Oregon or Seattle will know more about your child than you do. Especially at their weakest, when they start to come of age. Swipe left if you don’t like me. Down for summary execution.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s 10 a.m.! Do you know where your kids are?  There is a fad for child blood transfusions and pineal glands. And the glands get you extra high if the child dies frightened. I don’t usually think of collapse in human terms, for good reason. This all started with a pizza delivery scene last year.

       I tried watching to episodes of that shit and couldn’t get past the 2nd episode. It’s completely gross media garbage. I can’t believe they decided to redpill the public from sick and twisted cartoons like this.

       Perhaps you're just not intelligent enough to enjoy it. My example for this claim is your use of the word "to" instead of "two". Now that you are more educated, let us know how amazing the show is!

       To be fair, you have to have a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from
       <em>
        Narodnaya Volya
       </em>
       literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly
       <em>
        appreciate
       </em>
       the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic
       <em>
        Fathers and Sons.
       </em>
       I'm smirking right now just
       <em>
        imagining
       </em>
       one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I
       <em>
        pity
       </em>
       them. 😂
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick &amp; Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

       It’s the grossness that is typical of adult swim that tortures me when I watch it. I honestly think that endless grossness is a psyop. I studied media poison for years so I know how it works.

       It's very complicated but the shortest way I can say it is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if your thinking space is one giant probability meaning it is nothing and everything at the same time. Whatever you think will manifest into your reality one way or another in the future. It effects everything in your life and in the life of others. The cabal's strategy is to pour as much garbage into your mind as possible because they know it will spill over into society. Using this technique, they destroy society 24 hours, 7 days a week using media.

       Ok I get you. I also believe in the perception-based reality.

       Nowadays I feel like I'm more well-equipped to handle the negativity surrounding us all at seemingly all times but I have also detached myself from a lot of media sources. That said, I never really felt that Rick and Morty was one of those programs (but that could just be my own bias.)

       Thank you for your concern and insight on the situation. I largely only watch a few shows nowadays through streaming and I think Rick and Morty is the only Adult Swim one that I typically see.
