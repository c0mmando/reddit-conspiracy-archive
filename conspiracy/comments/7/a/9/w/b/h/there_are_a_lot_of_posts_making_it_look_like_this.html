<p>The opposite is clearly true. Yes, we have Trump supporters here. Why not? He is the first conspiracy theorist president in modern times. You are free to have your opinion about what Trump is actually doing, but let&#39;s stop pretending that the presence of Trump supporters here is some big mystery. And let&#39;s stop pretending that the non-supporter crowd is a minority. Well, in fact that may still be true, but that would automatically imply systematic vote manipulation across the subreddit, because comments like yours are almost always upvoted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have many negatives to prove you wrong lol.</p>

<p>I think it has to do with what thread you post in. So are rah-rah go Trump posts, some are fuck Trump posts, and some become political battlefields.</p>

<p>Unless there is bot manipulation, which I think is overblown and not as common as everyone here thinks, I think this sub leans pretty heavily right. The right wing seems to attract conspiracy theorist, and the president certainly is one. I&#39;m politically moderate, although I really hate Trump and what he&#39;s done to the GOP and the country. I&#39;m also a pretty skeptical conspiracy theorist. I enjoy reading about theories, but I find that most of them ignore facts that don&#39;t support a narrative.</p>

<p>I do believe in the ancient history stuff though, like the pyramids being much older than experts think, and that civilisation is far older that we think. Not ancient aliens or prehistoric astronaut type stuff, but bronze age/iron age type societies existing long before what&#39;s accepted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be, if it could without a doubt be proven and was being officially investigated. Theres alot of weird stuff with 9/11, and it wouldn&#39;t shock me at all if there was more to it, but my feeling towards it is that the attacks themselves happened as reported. The conspiracy is how the country responded after. Most of the hijackers were Saudi, as was Bin Laden and it seems like there were certainly people in the Saudi government/royal family who knew about it and possibly funded it. Yet, we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan. Just like Bill Kristol and the project for the new American century, a think tank that helped form the &quot;bush doctrine&quot; had planned on doing for almost a decade.</p>

<p>But the Trump thing is even more obvious. There&#39;s so much we all ready know, and what this investigation is still finding by the hour is blowing this thing way open, in a way thats much more public and likely to end up with arrests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Building 7 for me used to be the biggest proof, but then I saw videos from other angles that changed my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/_kSq663m0G8">https://youtu.be/_kSq663m0G8</a>. This video does a pretty good job of showing what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>But the main reason I don&#39;t think 9/11 was an inside job is that I&#39;m in the government, and there&#39;s no way people could keep their mouth shut, and theres&#39; no way they wouldn&#39;t have fucked this up. Military commanders know that complex plans like a staged 9/11 have a very high percentage fail rate and would never had greenlighted something like this because the blowback from failure would be astronomical. It&#39;s easy to lie about stuff like the gulf of Tonkin, or single assassinations, but something like this has way too many moving parts, way too many witnesses, and would take too many people to pull off. The more people, the risk of a leak grows exponentially.</p>

<p>My opinion is that the_donald and conspiracy is leaning to the right and r/politics are leaning to the left.</p>

<p>That some people are middle or don&#39;t care about tribalism doesn&#39;t make it a fact.</p>

<p>Fact is, if you critize the sitting government on the Donald or here you are a Hillary shill...</p>

<p>It used to be a positive thing to question the government, especially if they have full control over all houses and seats. Now it&#39;s not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have taken over the &quot;right&quot; and redefined or are redefining it. It has been being redefined since Nixon to be more and more preverted, but with Trump I believe that segment is so far from the core of the &quot;right&quot; it should no longer be considered the right.</p>

<p>Look at what their main tenets have become. Not what they state, but what they do.</p>

<p>Larger government</p>

<p>Larger deficit</p>

<p>Against immigration</p>

<p>Against Healthcare reform</p>

<p>Anti hispsnic</p>

<p>These are diametrically opposed to long standing principles held by the right and while some of them have been fallacies, especially in the last 17 years, they have not been do overt as they have green as with the Trump supporters.</p>

<p>There really needs to be another term for them aside from right or conservative since they are neither. I think they&#39;re is about to be a major split, but I do not know where. The middle is no longer represented. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While the sub isn&#39;t pro one way or another as a whole, compared to the rest of reddit, right-wing (and Trump supporters in particular) are a much higher % of the user base (both the active posters/commenters and the silent voters) than if you were to look at reddit as a whole (a mostly liberal/left leaning site). So of course average redditors look into /conspiracy and see a right-leaning sub.</p>

<p>So what does this mean for /conspiracy though? Well lot more right leaning topics get faster and stronger exposure and sit on the front page longer than left leaning topics.</p>

<p>Day to day (excluding big topics that get outside votes), could you argue this is a problem in terms of left-leaning topics not getting proper representation? Sure. Is it that much of a problem though? I don&#39;t think so, it&#39;s not like it&#39;s that much harder for them and there&#39;s regularly left-leaning topics on the front page. There could definitely be better left-leaning user representation in the comments in the day to day lower traffic topics, but that&#39;s just a product of having a conspiracy sub on a left-leaning site more than anything else. Left-leaners will generally go to other subs and see their opinions validated there, so they won&#39;t come here unless something big is happening, whereas right-learners will have a harder time to find representation outside of a few subs. But left-leaning users aren&#39;t exactly non-existent here either and there are a decent chunk of users that are more conspiracy focused than politicalconspiracy focused that balances out the left/right imbalance.</p>

<p>tl;dr. No it&#39;s not solely a right-wing sub, but right-leaning topics do get more representation than left (this is what outsiders see when they look in, hence the general view it&#39;s a right-leaning sub), it could do with being magically fixed with the wave of a wand (I don&#39;t see many other ways to really fix it than with magic), but it&#39;s not much of a problem to begin with anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that it is right leaning. That is part of the problem. The posts pushing the Murdoch narrative are not right leaning. They are mindless, scripted repeats of the narrative of the day. That is what do chilling. This is supposed to be a conspiracy sub and here you have a giant media empire being run world wide, influencing elections, pushing narratives, controlling large sections of countries through their media and most of the posts here are in lock step with that giant machine.</p>

<p>You want a conspiracy? Look no further than the largest propaganda campaign ever run and it is very active here in this sub</p>

<p>Left? Right? Those terms do not even matter any more. Now it is libtard, alt-right, Russian bots, Soros, trumps tears, etc. When was the last time there was an actual discussion about left/right ideologies? The powers that be do not want that. They want you at war with each other.</p>

<p>The problem is we have a hostile country that saw what was going on and said, this looks like KGB style campaign. We can do this better. So now you have KGG psyops mixed in with Murdoch&#39;s propaganda campaign and they are battling for control. Except one side just want to sow discord and distract us even further so they can do as they please.</p>

<p>Two conspiracies butting heads and we are all in between them. The fallout is going to be ugly if it does not get under control </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I was passing out conspiracy lit in the 1990&#39;s.  The CT community has always been strongly right-wing.  Donald Trump worked his way into this community&#39;s favor (primarily through twitter trolling) over a number of years--not just 2016--and so, it makes sense that he still finds a fair amount of support here on reddit and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Of course, none of this makes sense to the people who have always hated &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; yet felt the need to swarm r/conspiracy after their big L last November.  They just don&#39;t get it.</p>

<p>No surprise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a huge Donald supporter but still very low big government supporter, I and many others came to this sub after vegas.  There are very few places on Reddit that won&#39;t instantly bash you for either questioning the DNC or Hillary.  It&#39;s been very clear they are extremely corrupt and have infiltrated every part of government.  At the same time I have the same feeling about establishment republicans.  I think alot of us realize Trump is not perfect but he&#39;s definently not a bought off government crony.  That&#39;s why this place leans a little right.  </p>

Their response is oh well it is what it is or get over it.  I&#39;ve liked this sub for years and since the primaries it&#39;s been invaded by the Donald geeks to push their agenda. Everyone who calls it out is a shill. I grab the popcorn and enjoy watching the mods and users pretend like this isn&#39;t a right wing donald sub now.

    <div class="md"><p>It would be a lot easier to agree with you (though in general, I do) if there wasn&#39;t so much overt Trump support, and so much overt racism promoting itself as &quot;It is ok to be white&quot;.

<p>Using this slogan (for a recent example) is a means of distilling victimhood in white people as a tactic of garnering sympathy for far right wing movements, in particular.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a hardcore Trump supporter, check my post history lol. I have always and will always hold true to my beliefs. I&#39;ve said long ago that if he invades Syria and fucks Assad or rolls over and gives up on crushing the deep state, that I will renounce my support. FORTUNATELY, he is holding steadfast to his promises. So yes, praise be to the GEOTUS. </p>

<p>Also, to NOT admit that the cisgendered white male and by extension the nuclear family and conservative values are under constant attack is downright delusional. To act as if this country is full or racists and nazi&#39;s is delusional. To think that a &quot;united white patriarchy&quot; is at the top and purposefully holding everyone down is delusional.</p>

<p>You useful idiots really are making things too easy for those that seek to divide us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sending a warning strike that had 0 casualties was ok - yes. Considering the lead up was a &#39;most likely false flag&#39; chemical weapons attack to bait the US into another nation building, occupying war against boogyman terrorism. It was a perfect move.</p>

<p>I have not personally been attacked for being straight white male because I look and act like a hippie. I get along with most everyone and make it a point to be kind to people. That doesn&#39;t mean its not happening. Just check the outrage of putting &quot;It ok to be white&quot;. Check the comments and shit people are posting in response. Check the police departments labeling it as an act of aggressive racism. What a joke.</p>

<p>and this is not the same as attacking people. The person Im arguing with says white males are under attack. Iam a white male, Iam not under attack. What is under attack is the idea that only straight white males are the ones that get to make decisions for everybody. </p>

I am sick of the constant barrage of attacks and absolute LIES that are pushed on a daily basis on reddit and on colleges campuses across the nation. What kind of attacks are &quot;straight white men&quot; facing? FUCKING GOOGLE IT. Endless videos of conservatives getting chased off, harrassed, humiliated over arbitrary hyped up bullshit. Actual discrimination and intolerance of peoples viewpoints simply brushed off because they&#39;re white.</p>

<p>And.. please don&#39;t accuse me of shifting goal posts to conservatives now lol. Straight white males make up the overwhelming majority of those dubbed &quot;conservative&quot; now a days. Easy example to your questions/accusations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personal anecdote time: I&#39;ve frequented other conspiracy boards for a couple of decades now (hell, I frequented conspiracy BBSes back in the 1980s), and I noticed an increasing division creeping in especially in the past 5-7 years.</p>

<p>Prior to that, even if people had different political opinions re: free market libertarians vs &quot;some aspects of socialism are good&quot; types, there was little political bickering. There were definitely always disagreements, but it was part of the background, not the foreground of common positions vis a vis mechanisms of control, etc.</p>

<p>From personal observation, conspiracy boards started seeing an influx of strong libertarian/freeper/Tea Party types when political conspiracies about Obama started getting traction.</p>

<p>Note: this isn&#39;t to knock ALL libertarian ideals. Just pointing out that this is when the &quot;political divisiveness&quot; started to really grow.</p>

<p>It also doesn&#39;t help that in the past decade started equating &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; with right-wing or alt-right political positions, adding to the left/right paradigm.</p>
