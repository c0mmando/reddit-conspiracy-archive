       I stumbled onto the Youtube page of a woman named Padma McCord. The page uploads hundreds of videos with titles that appear to trigger keyword searches. For example: "DOTCOM BURSTS tech selloff tech stocks crash" or "Social media bankrupt and shutdown by Governments for breaking privacy security copyright laws regul". The videos are simply compilations of the same images every time.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Padmamccord1/videos">
        The youtube page.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/M3MN5">
        Here
       </a>
       are her pictures. There are dozens of these, all in these poses, all with these men, all equally edited.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's attached to a
       <a href="https://www.facebook.com/padma.mccord1">
        Facebook page
       </a>
       and
       <a href="https://twitter.com/padmamccord?lang=en">
        Twitter
       </a>
       that do nothing but post the videos. She has a
       <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+PadmaMcCord">
        Google plus page
       </a>
       that does the same thing. Is this intended to trigger some sort of keyword monitoring thing? Is it an attempt to manipulate computer-traded stocks?
      </p>
      <p>
       Weird part, she has several blogs. Nothing of substance, just links to her Youtube videos and dozens of pictures of her in the same three poses. Her
       <a href="https://padmamccord.tumblr.com/">
        Tumblr
       </a>
       as well as her web site
       <a href="http://www.padmamccordenterprises.biz/">
        PadmaMcCordEnterprises.biz
       </a>
       . These as well as the dozen or so blogs with her name make it seem more like an attempt to create an internet footprint for someone who doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://padmagmccord.wordpress.com/2017/09/05/padma-mccord-brian-mccord-jeevan/">
        Her blog
       </a>
       about her brother, that consists of nothing but a series of, you guessed, it, essentially the same picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://marrriagepadmamccordbrianmccord.blogspot.com/2015/12/marriage-wedding-married-padma-mccord.html">
        Another blog
       </a>
       about her marriage. Again, nothing but the same picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://padmamccord.wordpress.com/tag/marriage-married-padma-mccord-brian-mccord-2/">
        More blog gibberish.

       . Clearly, these are not intended to be actually used or visited.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        She's also on
        <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6812890/">
         IMDB
        </a>
       </strong>
       . Her page has a photoshopped picture and she is credited with two movies coming out in 2018. The movies have the same weird nonsense titles as her youtube videos. ("Enterprises War of the Worlds Time Travels" and "Dot Com Crash Stock Market Crash Internet Regulations World War 3") No information can be found on the movies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can someone clue me in to what the shit is going on here?

       If not maybe it is some new secret way of intelligence communication or something.

       Oh no. I’m just speculating. My daughter’s HS had a computer technology program. Each year or semester was a different course that built upon the previous one. One semester could be photoshop. The following semester could be websites &amp; how to create content for them. Etc.

       That sounds like a reasonable idea. The keywords op says she uses are very odd though. Not typical for normal media class imo.

       The application some guy is working on is designed to read a social media footprint. This is the demo "footprint". All the codewords and gibberish is designed to show how well the application associated kew words.

       So Padma McCord LLC is a real LLC. Go to:

       And search "padma mccord" under Entity Name. I will not post anything from it even though it is public records as I don't know if that constitutes doxing or anything like that. It tells you that the Registered Agent Name is "United States Corporation Agents, Inc." which leads to this:

       I think it's a doll. It's not a real person. I looked at the wedding page and each picture has the 'husband' with his hands behind her, like he's holding up a sex doll or something. Super strange and I have no clue as to why someone would put so much time into this internet footprint.

       I did SEO work in the past. And although I didn't look through everything you posted, it could be something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would build a lot of free sites, things like Wordpress and Tumblr with the sole purpose of putting links on them to whatever site I was going to promote. Wordpress and Tumblr sites are free to make, and Google likes them. Google doesn't know what the content really is on there but they do prefer pictures and videos to be on a page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, a lot of the content is written by "spinners" which are software programs that pump out articles written about a subject. It's mostly gibberish but has the keywords and Google can't tell that it's gibberish.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have probably built thousands of sites that look insane if you start following the links and think a person really made all of that on purpose..lol
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there is a Russian site where people sell links from their "PBN" or private blog networks. They sell hundreds of thousands of links, so this may be one of those network of sites.

       Aahhh! What's wrong with her face? It's like uncanny valley times a million. Is this an AI person? I've heard about sophisticated AI/bots that were just let loose on the internet and roam free, just learning and doing stuff of their own accord. Maybe one of them got themselves an image they identify with and started making themselves blogs and channels and stuff?

       So weird- I only looked at the pics and Facebook page and at first I thought she was a RealDoll that someone just threw snapchat filters on, but if you look at her older pics, from like 2012 and earlier, you can see she is(was) a real woman who for some reason has always applied her makeup like that.

       I've seen several instances where extremely lonely, troubled or schizophrenic women have this kind of identity meltdown, create a new persona and project that they're a queen, actress, new age/health guru (men do this too but usually go in the opposite direction and claim to be in some sort of special forces, entrepreneur, rapper/musician etc) and start to believe it themselves, post multiple pics of the same thing, rant random ideologue in unrelated pics and the like..,
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is something else, or something much more. I can't figure it out. It's spooky.

       Really strange how her twitter account lists 1.5 million followers. I think that it‘s a real family, however looking at all these blogs and sites and all these weird „ramblings“ i have no idea what the purpose of all this is. I‘m honestly creeped out.

       Holy shit.  That chick looks like one that I saw on a TV show about unsolved murders.  She had a mental breakdown and was found dead days later.  She kept calling police saying someone was trying to break into her apartment only to be corrected by her roommate that she was hallucinating.

       I'm not sure what this is, but it looks like an attempt at raising profile in search engines. or a test of SEO. My first reaction was that she may be mentally ill. The combination of her choice of makeup, her body language in the video, and the way she poses like a broken doll seem very odd.

       Somehow this seems possibly linked to the Somaly Mam Foundation. When googling Pamda McCord anti trafficking I found this:

       Two celebrities that donated to the foundation are:
      </p>
      <p>
       AnnaLynne McCord
      </p>
      <p>
       Padma Lakshmi

       I'm not sure what they are pushing with these keywords though but when further researching  "Padma McCord" I found:
