       Genuine question. It seems that any notion of seperate elite factions is scoffed at by a lot of the community, who believe that the handlers of society all work as a cohesive unit. I understand the professional wrestling analogy, that politics are like pro-wrestling without the ring, but why couldn't the people managing these wrestlers still have a rivalry with one another and compete within set rules? Like a game of chess played with countries and politicians instead of game pieces. I mean CLEARLY 99.999% of what WE see in politics is distraction tactic BS, but who is to definitively say that there is no split in  loyalty when it comes to the powers that be? Can you really know for sure? I know a lot of you are open to the multiple factions angle, but I want to hear from the ones who think that it's a laughable concept. I just want to learn more. Thanks!
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: If anyone has seen Mr. Robot, imagine a Price/Whiterose type rivalry.

       I like your question. From what I understand there were warring factions for about a few thousand years, and as time progressed, the factions grew, consumed smaller factions and became more and more established. As we get closer to the present, I believe most of the factions have been consolidated to one entity. One thing that makes me raise an eyebrow is the Vatican/City of London/DC trifecta. However, there may very likely be warring factions still, I still haven't wrapped my head around exactly where Russia and China, or even Asia in general stand. Even Trump for that matter! I really cannot tell if he is a complete puppet actor, or they just have him by the balls. Think of Joe Rogans joke about the president gets elected and they take him down stairs and show him a different angle JFK being shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I also would certainly like to hear from any open minded people who are knowledgeable about this.

       This would require acknowledging that almost everyone's "team" has elite representation or works to protect the interests of elites. Democrat, Republican obviously, but that's just the start.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, those most likely to view "the elites" as a monolith entity somehow cannot conceive of guys like Steve Bannon or Donald Trump being elites themselves. Why? They're lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same kind of perspective produces the general "let's take down the establishment!!!" hyperbole that never mentions what would be a fitting replacement...when in most cases it means Your Team will step in and assume eliteness and control.

       The allure of real systematic change is so strong the next part can be covered without inquiry. The vast majority of those who want to bring it all down know exactly what they'd like to follow, and in most cases it's some extreme that will fuck over others. Comes with the territory I guess.

       We would be silly to believe that there is not quarrel all the way to the top.  I picture it like Chinese checkers being played by marionettes while the puppet master's are trying to distract each other with hand movement but none of them will take their eyes off each other. Throwing elbows and stepping on each others feet to mess up the preformance of the two each below.

       I think organized criminals took over/became the government when jfk died. They have more or less held control over what really mattered since then. Now trump and his cronies want to become the new ruling criminal syndicate and the established criminal powers are attempting to thwart that. Or maybe not.

       The elites are no different to the Mafia. Fiefdons within fiefdoms, and though they swear the same oath, members quite able to kill and move into another family's territory when it is profitable, killing others who have sworn the same oath as them. As long as the "family" they take an oath to serve makes money for them, then they serve that family.
      </p>
      <p>
       When this family does not make a profit or runs into trouble, then they rid themselves of their family's old junta for a new junta.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose like all other human endeavours there are those within who will backstab, kill, etc... other rivals to get to get to the top of the totem pole, breaking rules they swore an oath to uphold  By the very nature of what they do I don't think any person involved with any elite faction take their oaths seriously, their service and obedience to laws of said organisation being conditional on it being profitable for them.

       Using your chess analogy, there's still people higher than these players. By being sucked in by the chess game, we miss the other guys sent in by the big dogs that steal our money, give us cancer, imprison us etc. If you want to watch the chess game and get sucked in, by all means go to sleep. At the end of the day, these "warring factions" win and you lose.

       I have always thought that "the elite" and "tptb" are given too much credit. People talk about them and speak as if they are omnipotent gods or something, but in reality they are likely scared old men who make mistakes and fall victim to the same traps, vices and mistakes as your average human.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are powerful, and wealthy beyond comprehension but we can't rule out the fact that they make mistakes and that there are screw ups (Vegas sloppiness?).
