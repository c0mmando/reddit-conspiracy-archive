<p>Which is troubling, because anyone can see that Trump and the people he&#39;s surrounded himself with are up to super shady stuff (ie: appointing rich banker and industry buddies to prominent positions). Should be prime fodder for conspiracy-minded people.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t how <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would have survived without your incredible contribution of 5 posts and 34 post karma. We all owe you a huge debt of gratitude. /s</p>

<p>You are one of a large group of fringe users who don&#39;t actually contribute anything positive at all - all you do is complain about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and most of us don&#39;t want to wade through that sort of negativity. </p>

<p>Even in the Pizzagate discussions I&#39;ll see people go deep down rabbit holes grasping at straws and not slowing down for any inconsistencies.  Then something comes out credible that would involve Trump(Epstein&#39;s little black book rings a bell) and immediately it must be a setup, or he must be in the book for other reasons.  However every other name in the book is considered suspect.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a shame because I love digging into this stuff with you guys and when I see momentum come to a screeching hault because the majority is too afraid that they could find out they&#39;re wrong about their all star-I feel it will be our undoing.</p>

<p>The problem is that there&#39;s an active and easily provable disinformation campaign being run by the current administration, so any left of &quot;racist shitbag&quot; is sort of upset with the way things are going.</p>

Orwell warned us, Huxley warned us, many many others did too. I just hope that it has gone so far that maybe people might start to realize how fucking stupid they have become. Not getting my hopes up too much though. Regardless, it is up to the ones who still think with their own mind and have some common sense left to shake these poor brainwashed fucks awake and help them see and understand what is happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The amount of hate / open racism in regard to that event was extremly different and many people were shocked by certain statements, because it was never like that before. Sure, there were racists before on reddit, but I think many of them got riled up in these threads, pushed in the &quot;right&quot; direction (pun intended). I revisited these threads a few weeks ago and most of these comments/users are deleted. At the moment I&#39;m not sure if there was a general push for divide &amp; conquer from the puppetmasters or a russian social-media campaign, maybe it&#39;s even both. Sadly it&#39;s working, society is very diveded at the moment, no real discussion is happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably because there is a huge fucking problem when this shit is happening. We don&#39;t give a shit if you call us racists. We have literally stopped caring. Its a completely natural reaction from people who aren&#39;t brainwashed and naive to want to protect their country, culture, and people. You need to just come to terms with it and try to understand where we&#39;re coming from, because it isn&#39;t gonna go away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I first started using reddit 3 years ago. That sub hosted much more balanced discussions at that time.</p>

<p>The year running up to the 2016 election saw the greatest change. Anything positive about Trump or critical of HRC was downvoted to oblivion and elicited a wave of derisive comments. Many people said it was due to the Correct The Record shills, and I found nothing to discredit that.</p>

<p>In fact, the morning after the election, everything changed. People were asking why, others were claiming the CTR ceased funding. Maybe, but within two weeks the ‘Resist!’ movement was begun and things swung back to the hard left.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have only ever been liberal/left wing, but since the election I feel forced into being right/conservative because my beliefs are firmly rejected by the neo-liberals controlling reddit. IMO, Trump is a true liberal while the old liberals have turned into standing for nothing except anti-Trump and everything rasicm &amp; sexism. I don&#39;t consider rasicm &amp; sexism to be political issues, just a distraction from policy. I vote for policy and I notice that nothing on reddit focuses on policy anymore. The establishment is scared shitless because if liberals understood Trump&#39;s policies, they might actually like him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you are right about r/politics, it is an anti-Trump, pro-DNC propaganda sub fueled by paid submissions, comments, and up votes, to create the semblance that these are genuine individuals with the popular, common opinion. Up votes are seen as validation and down votes as refutation. Its quite a hard conditioning to break, as it feels like you&#39;re going against the masses, but this is simply a guise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel like this subreddit is fairly balanced. I think that comes with the territory since we are very open minded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to be very careful with assumptions like this. Why do you think this subreddit is balanced, and why do you think people are open-minded here? Because we are conspiracy theorists and this is a trait of ours?
 Does this make you more likely to believe what you see on this sub versus r/politics?</p>

<p>This last part is going to maybe sound wacky to you, but here it goes anyways.</p>

<p>There always has been and currently is a war going on for your mind. Through timely and consistent exposure of select content and narratives, there is an attempt gain control of your attention and therefor your perception. Through repetition of exposure to a certain perception, it reinforces it in your mind to develop a belief. Established belief systems can be exploited through appealing to your emotion. And at this point, they have created your ego and are in control of your mind, and you may not even be aware.</p>

<p>Question any belief you may have. Work to remove any and all beliefs you have. Strip away at your ego. Remove emotion from critical thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Democratic party bias not the same as &quot;left wing&quot;. Most of what we&#39;re on is actually to the left of democrats. How we look at the war, the attacks, the suppression of information, that&#39;s all to the left. It&#39;s to the left of many &quot;progressives&quot;. If you investigate these events, you find they are objectively fucked up, that&#39;s just what it is. People will use it as a way to support Trump, and they&#39;re full of shit.. but most people in this sub simply want what&#39;s best for people. That&#39;s why we got a pic of JFK chillin&#39; over there to the right. </p>

<p>Even second amendment rights. That&#39;s personal liberty, if you&#39;re far left you&#39;re in favor of it, ect. People tend to think of democrats and republicans as left and right but it really isn&#39;t so. They&#39;re clearly all fascists. But yes, r/politics is a bunch of a-holes. Their way of thinking is on the way out thank god. Nobody is enthusiastic about those views, so they won&#39;t survive the next few years.</p>
