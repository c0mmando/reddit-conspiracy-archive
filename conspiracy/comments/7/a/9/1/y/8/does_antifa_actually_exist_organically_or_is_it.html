       Personally, I know a lot of dedicated "left wingers"... and a fairly equal number of passionate "right wingers".  And amongst those two crews... none of them have any clue re: these so-called "November 4th antifa protests":
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          who's organizing them?
         </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          have permits been filed / granted?
          <br/>
         </li>
         <li>
          who's signature is on the dotted line?
         </li>
         <li>
          i.e.,
          <strong>
           <em>
            who's paying for these events???
           </em>
          </strong>
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          where will they be held?
         </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          what states?  what cities?
         </li>
         <li>
          what's the schedule?
          <br/>
         </li>
         <li>
          where do you "sign-in"?
          <br/>
         </li>
         <li>
          is there an "online registration"?)
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       ... just seems like a LOT of noise ("national media" attention!!!) w/o any real interest from
       <strong>
        <em>
         actual people
        </em>
       </strong>
       -- kinda reminds me of Hillary Clinton's campaign, frankly (i.e., massive "poll" numbers, with less than 100 supporters showing up at her campaign stops.
      </p>
      <h2>
      </h2>
      <p>
       bottom line:
       <strong>
        <em>
         what's going on here ?
        </em>
       </strong>

       <li>
        if someone is actually going to one of these Antifa™ protests, please identify yourself... i have some questions that i would LOVE to ask you!

         apparently, this is the website that is organizing the protest:
         <a href="https://refusefascism.org">
          https://refusefascism.org
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         NOTE!
         <strong>
          it's called "refuse fascism"  -- not "antifa"
         </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          i.e., not one #fakeNews organization actually calls it by the correct name
         </li>
         <li>
          apparently they all got together and actually "synchronized" on a totally new name -- bizarre -- so much for factual reporting.
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         everything is anonymous
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          no contact names given anywhere on the website
         </li>
         <li>
          no organizer names given anywhere on the website
         </li>

          it's as if they are not proud of their own efforts

       BLM, like antifa, is also a decentralized movement with no real organization beyond local groups. def not a dupe.
      </p>
      <p>
       antifa is literally short for anti-fascist. if you do t like fascism, youre antifa.

       Yes, conservatives created BLM, antifa, "new black panthers," code pink, PETA, ELF that fake SJW "movement," OWS and nearly every other so called liberal opposition group.

       What finer way to control the acts and news coverage than owning the actors who get the news.

       Oh they exist, they're just incredibly misguided. Also worth noting that many chapters of the Anti-Racist Action group have merged with Antifa in many states. Just google Anti-Racist Action and Antifa city by city, and you'll find plenty of old blogs and websites for meetups and organization. To me they seem to be mostly organic but naive fools who don't realize they're being played by the establishment.

       I'm not defending them, I'm just saying that they are real, and real delusional people participate. I've dealt with some of my local Antifa/ARA before, they're completely unhinged but they exist, unfortunately.

       No. IMHO, it doesn't NOT exist organically. Take away the funds, and they will cease to exist. It is an agenda. All of the media noise is a dead giveaway. Actual people don't care as much as they pretend to. It is all for show.

       The majority.  The entire point of these groups is to capitalise on the unrest which the government and other such groups already know exists within the public.  The idea is to get the radicals out of their bedrooms and onto the streets protesting, so that law enforcement can identify, register, and/or arrest them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the main reason why going to any of these events is never a good idea.  At worst you'll end up on a watch list, and at best you will unintentionally give support to organisations whose only real goals are the promotion of tyranny through social destabilisation.

       why is it that literally no one on this sub seems to know who bob avakian and the revolutionary communist party are?
theyre good at organizing large events and getting people in the street but otherwise they are not to be trusted.
that said, RCP is not representative of all antifascists everywhere.

       November 4 has been pushed by the right wing far more than the left, that's why dedicated left wingers haven't heard about it. Go to the website, it's being sponsored by a fringe group, with no connection to antifa.

       Seattle.  If you're not in a place where there're fliers, you're not going to see anything happen.  The people behind it are a tiny cult, the conservative freak out's probably done more recruiting for their protests than they've been able to do with weeks of dedicated effort.

       i think you've got three different main groups, where the SJW Left are concerned; at least that I've seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       a}  Financial backers.  These are people like Soros and others.  This group are usually neurologically psychopathic.
      </p>
      <p>
       b}  Principle ground zero organisers.  These are people who were originally part of the more ordinary rank and file, but who have unusually high levels of ambition and have thus moved through the ranks.  The Left are openly obsessed with "leaderlessness," however, which means that these individuals tend to operate invisibly; you will only find evidence of their existence if you specifically look for it.  Some of these people may be liasons for the financial supporters, but only a few of them.  Adbusters, the think tank behind Occupy Wall Street, are an example of this group; as are the April 4th org who were responsible for the Arab Spring in Egypt.
      </p>
      <p>
       c}  Idealistic, non-critical teens, twenty somethings, and women; who are essentially the majority of foot soldiers.  These were who showed up at the Women's March, for example, and also at Occupy Wall Street in fairly large numbers.  Anonymous also draw heavily from this pool.  These people are the bulk of any movement, and the more ambitious ones will end up becoming leaders, as described above.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing to understand about both leaders and many of the foot soldier types in these groups, is that they are almost always severely psychologically damaged.  Said psychological damage usually comes primarily from poor or non-existent parenting in childhood, and especially from minimal or no physical/emotional nurturing.  We're talking about people who spent their early to mid childhood in either daycare or in front of a television.  This either makes them psychopathic to the point of emotional neutrality, or it renders them a walking mass of rage and pain for the rest of their lives.  This is the main cause behind the pathological nature of the Millennials as a generation.  Most of them have not had loving parents.

       Antifa actually exists in considerable numbers in Europe and has a proud history dating back to the German socialists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Antifa in the US was a small but legitimate group who wanted to play the same role as the opposition to fascism but they were not connected organizationally to Antifa in Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somewhere along the way, TPTB infiltrated Anitfa USA and used it for propaganda, false flag, and social engineering purposes.
