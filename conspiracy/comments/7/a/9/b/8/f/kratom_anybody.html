(commonly known as kratom, also ketum),[2] is a tropical evergreen tree in the coffee family (Rubiaceae) native to Southeast Asia in the Indochina and Malaysiaphytochoria (botanical regions). M. speciosa is indigenous to Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia, Myanmar, and Papua New Guinea[3] where it has been used in traditional medicine since at least the 19th century.[4] Kratom has some opioid- and stimulant-like properties.[5][6]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kratom helped me come off heroin. I heard horror stories about suboxone or methadone and cold turkey kicking heroin is difficult as hell. It&#39;s convenient that a natural compound is scrutinized while pharmaceuticals are pushed on us. Kratom has its own addictive properties, of course, but nothing compared to suboxone, methadone, or heroin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right about the demonizing of natural substances. When I scheduled my surgery, the thing I dreaded most was eventually having to deal with getting off the pain meds. I remember how hard it was from a prior surgery. I&#39;d read about Kratom here, and some other places, so I ordered one of the smaller samplers &#39;just in case&#39;. </p>

<p>So far, I&#39;ve cut back my prescribed dosage by almost half, only taking the oxycodone at night and a cup of the kratom tea in the morning. I should be completely done with both by the time I&#39;m cleared to go back to work.</p>

<p>It&#39;s downright criminal that they&#39;re keeping this from the market.</p>

<p>It does taste like total crap though, which I like to think is nature&#39;s way of encouraging you to stop using it unless you really need it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s how I even started using heroin. I got hit by a car and shattered my foot (the only injury aside from scrapes and cuts). Had to have a surgery done to place some hardware in there. Anyway, I come out of there with 1 month supply of 10mg of vicodin and 1 refill (back before you weren&#39;t allowed to give advanced refills). Well, I couldn&#39;t afford to go back to get another refill and I was still in pain so before you know it I&#39;d bought a few pills off the street, then some stronger, purer pills, then heroin.</p>

<p>It blew my mind when I finally had enough and went for treatment only to be told that I was expected to put down one addictive, destructive dangerous drug (heroin) and pick up another addictive, destructive, dangerous drug (methadone and then after I refused that, suboxone). I left empty handed and defeated and spent another 7 months going downhill from depression and feeling helpless. I can&#39;t even remember how I heard about kratom but I decided it was worth a shot. I was just so tired of being an addict, it cost me my job, my family, my friends, and I wanted to expel this burden from my life. Well, the kratom arrives and I was withdrawing. I took some and immediately threw up from the taste and the withdrawals. I kept trying and finally kept some down. I&#39;ll be honest, suboxone works a lot better (I&#39;d taken suboxone a few times to help ease my bones), but kratom did it just fine. It&#39;s been almost 2 years now and without kratom I&#39;d have probably killed myself to be honest.</p>

<p>Just like you hear of people having their kids taken away for giving them CBD oils to help myoclonic seizures. The kids aren&#39;t being taken because it is dangerous, they&#39;re being taken because it is counterproductive to the big pharma industry. Same thing for kratom. By no means could we entirely do away with opiates, suboxone or suboxone like drugs, those drugs do have their place since kratom can&#39;t treat really severe pain but they are currently over used and over prescribed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately kratom is still barely known in America in my experience, even after it got some attention with the attempted ban last year. I&#39;m glad it made a positive difference for you-- it&#39;s really not an exaggeration to say it can be a life-changer. It&#39;s very effective at helping with withdrawal and chronic pain, in addition to being an occasional mood-booster or sleep aid.  In almost all cases it is safer and less addictive than alternatives, the main exception being people ingesting high quantities of concentrated kratom in an attempt to get high. I think it&#39;s a pretty open secret that big pharma et al. lobby against kratom in the US because it is a threat to their profits, same as medical marijuana.  </p>

<p>As for why it&#39;s not more widely known, I think the shops/websites selling it as a &#39;legal painkiller drug&#39; are very unhelpful. I&#39;m not saying concentrated kratom should be illegal (I haven&#39;t tried it myself), but it allows opponents to label kratom as a drug. In reality the vast majority of users probably ingest an amount that is less intoxicating and addictive than a lite beer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>use it occasionally. i used to use it more before i got on suboxone. mainly on days that i couldn&#39;t find real opiates back when i was still using pills and heroin. it really helped me through some rough spots, but never could fully stop opiates full time with it. i eventually had to get on subs.  </p>
