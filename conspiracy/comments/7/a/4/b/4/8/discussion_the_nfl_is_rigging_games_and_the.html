        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This morning I am seeing articles and tweets about Zach Millers TD against New Orleans. A couple officials have come out and said it was a TD, and there&#39;s some controversy. The clip of the play? Nowhere to be found. </p>

<p>A couple weeks ago, ASJ caught a TD against the New England Patriots. This would&#39;ve been a big play for the Jets. Overturned, and much like the Zach Miller TD, there are links to stories about the play, but <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2017/10/15/new-york-jets-austin-seferian-jenkins-fumble-call-controversy">no video of the play</a>. The video of the play has been replaced with &quot;the next clip in que&quot;. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had multiple people tell me the NFL rigs games, and with the current controversy surrounding kneeling, I&#39;m not surprised. In week two we had multiple overtime games, and a lot of the games were decided by a TD or less. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are other examples, but it appears that the NFL rigs games through officiating. They discuss these plays with a New York office during review. For close plays, they can determine game outcomes. Then they put the video in the vault so you can never say otherwise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do believe that penalty calls are made or missed, touchdowns reversed, and ricky-tacky penalties (like holding in which 99% of football plays have holding albeit the hold is &quot;away&quot; from the ball and does not directly affect the play at all). </p>

<p>I believe this stuff happens, sometime bc of incompetence but most of time bc the NFL wants &quot;close&quot; outcomes to games; more importantly, the closer the game as it comes down to the wire, the more likely it is that fans from both teams (the team winning the game AND the team losing the game) will remain pasted onto their television set, earning the League more leverage in TV advertising deals, of which the current NFL / TV contract is set to run though 2022. </p>

<p>the NFL and NFLPA deals is also a BIG DEAL that mandates how much of the $$ pie is allocated to player contracts (this is different from the SALARY CAP which itself is negotiated on an annual basis).  All of these factors are indicative of pursuing parity in a league where viewership is dwindling due to just as many internal factors, such as penalties and lack of consistency in penalizing play, as it does external factors, like politics in football.  </p>

<p>Not an expert on any of this stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not possible for refs to rig an NFL game. They don&#39;t control tempo, there are few judgment calls, some plays are reviewable in-game, all calls are reviewed after a game, and all 32 teams + outside entities receive copies of all tapes for every game. A ref may make a bad call or two, but even if done purplsefully &amp; intentionally, it is not likely to affect the outcome of the game most of the time. And he sure as hell would not get away with doing it each week. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A deeper aspect is that players and coaches throw plays at crucial times, particularly in Super Bowls and conference championship games. Not for Vegas, but for the NFL. It&#39;s connected to much deeper things, for example Patriots winning for the Patriot Act. (Black) Panthers against (white) Broncos a few years ago, Saints during Katrina, etc. There is often numerology and freemasonary attached, all highlighted by the satanic Super Bowl half time show. The Super Bowl in particular is a ritual. </p>

<p>On a smaller scale, do you notice that every time a player is short of a milestone, say 99 TDs, and is playing in a nationally televised game that they always get a TD, usually in the 1st quarter. It&#39;s almost like both teams agreed to get it out of the way early. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watch NFL 2-4 football games/week.  I have done this for over 30 years.</p>

<p>I am also a conspiracy person who reads 2-4 books or long-form pdfs/month.  I have done this for over 30 years.</p>

<p>Vegas would never let the NFL control the outcomes.  Vegas needs a clean environment in order for their information and research to matter.  Those dudes don&#39;t spend their work life researching NFL games just to a have a suit in New York change the outcome.</p>

<p>Aside from that...</p>

<p>Football is the hardest sport to fix.  The NFL as a league has the least influence over individual games.  NBA is the easiest to fix and the league has big influence over the outcomes.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t exactly a conspiracy.  My normie friends in 2002 knew (KNEW) the refs influenced Game 6 of the NBA Finals.  Even still, Vlade could have grabbed the ball, not tipped the ball.</p>

<p>My normie friends KNOW that in the Super Bowl, teams must also overcome the refs/league if that team is the less-favored by the league.  Almost every Super Bowl has a return TD.  This is much rarer in the regular season.</p>

<p>Most of the evidence claimed in the OP is conjecture.  Games are close because the NFL pushes parity on the league.  Teams themselves are fairly even.  Injuries play a huge role in football, so a team&#39;s strength can ebb and flow over a season.  MOST games are decided by less than a TD.</p>

<p>Videos with severe injuries are typically not shown.  I&#39;ve seen both TDs in question with no effort online.</p>

<p>As another reply notes, the NFL is very transparent.  All calls are reviewed.  Tape is sent to every team in the league.</p>

But the truth is... by convolution of the rules in favor of player saftey and the pass interference rules, all fans are conditioned to accept it was a bad call.  It&#39;s very easy to turn the tide of the game via one or two calls.  Now, run all replay through headquarters as they do now, and their is a central hub to do it.  It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if Rodger Goodell was in a ref&#39;s ear saying &quot;Throw the flag&quot;  he is Vince McMahon</p>
