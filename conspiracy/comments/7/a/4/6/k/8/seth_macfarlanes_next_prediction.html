        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I believe it will be Billy Ray Cyrus.</p>

<p>For the uninformed, MacFarlane has now predicted two separate Hollywood abusers, Kevin Spacey and Harvey Weinstein, both from his TV show Family Guy and a quote from his Oscar performance.</p>

<p>Some are speculating Tom Cruise is next. While I don&#39;t think he is innocent at all, he seems too powerful for that to happen in my mind. He&#39;s one of the highest earning actors of all time, and deeply tied to the organized crime group known as Scientology.</p>

<p>In episode 5 from season 8 of Family Guy, Hannah Banana, we see Billy Ray and his daughter Miley on television.</p>

<p>&quot;So Hannah isn&#39;t my daughter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yep&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Great. Then put the wig on&quot;</p>

<p>The tone implies Cyrus is about to rape his own daughter. He then says.</p>

<p>&quot;Shut up! This is REAL&quot;</p>

<p>I believe it is only a matter of time before this next celebrity is revealed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s even weirder is the episode&#39;s plot. Miley is literally a robot, &quot;programmed&quot; by Disney to be the perfect pop star. Brian suggests they &quot;reprogram&quot; her in order for her to perform sexual acts on him, despite being underage. Then she goes mad and tries to break her programming.</p>

Did you notice a couple of scenes after Billy Ray&#39;s bit the kid is sleeping, Dad and his mate enter the room fuck with him and physically abuse him. Mum enters to get cash.

<p>Another episode I think is important, Family Goy. Peter accidentally kills his cardboard celebrity wife, buries her, and then converts to Judaism. Very strange patterns here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watched it. Yeah think you are right. Peters artifical love. Porn immediately came to mind. Quagmire then comes along ands all fucked up due to porn.
Not a coinkidink. Stewie becomes Jewish shit at sport but still gets the trophy. That sort of 4th wall break about Cleveland show being the spin off. Connecting the context of the show with the real world? Stewie prays then rips Megs heart out, she starts chanting. either child sacrifice or brain washing? Lois is getting crucified then snipered. &quot;How do you like it?&quot; suggesting thats what they do to their enemies and showing how easy it is for them. Reference to Holocaust and every Jewish story being about escape or tricking better people. Nice hint to Christianity, Islam, Judaism being of the same thing to control. Interesting...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think Tom Cruise will be next. Church of Scientology has too much to lose by losing Tom. The church has policy that if a member is charged with rape or other sexual crimes without the support of the church, then they will be excommunicated. They also have a policy to only engage in healthy, wholsome sex (in silence as well), and I believe Tom probably believes every single word that comes out of L Ron Hubbard/David Miscavige&#39;s mouth</p>

<p>I believe if Tom goes down, the Church of Scientology will go down, and I don&#39;t think they will allow that. Tom Cruise is absolutely batshit, and I think if he&#39;s convicted of something of a sexual nature that he will argue he did it with the support of the church (because he will feel that he&#39;s done nothing wrong if the church says he&#39;s done nothing wrong), and the church will of course deny it like they did with Leah Remini.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true. The fact that he made that joke twice, once with the USO show, and another time with Stewie literally saying he&#39;s a woman makes that one especially weird.</p>

<p>Also the parallel&#39;s between Spacey. Jenner didn&#39;t &quot;come out&quot; until he was being sued for killing a pedestrian. Spacey is attempting to use his coming out as a diversion from his pederasty.</p>
