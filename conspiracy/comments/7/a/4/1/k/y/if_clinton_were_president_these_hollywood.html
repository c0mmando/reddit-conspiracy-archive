<p>So a sub for discussing conspiracies is now an acceptable place to post completely irrelevant &quot;what-ifs&quot; regarding a thing that literally <em>never</em> happened?</p>

<p>No, this place is just another alt-right cesspool full of scared little white supremacists. Most of the post histories in this sub read like an indoctrination seminar in bigotry and fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re kinda missing the main point of the post though right? The Hollywood scandals are the conspiracy that only recently got &quot;proven&quot;.

<p>There is no fucking conspiracy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fucking What-If based on something that literally never happened. If it was a post about the Clintons currently working to cover up these crimes, that would be a conspiracy theory. But &quot;what if blue was really yellow, would bees still love the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch?&quot; is just dumb, pointless speculation about a situation that doesn&#39;t exist. It has been posted here and upvoted to feed on the frothing hatred of something THAT LOS THE FUCKING ELECTION.</p>

<p>You kind of are yes. The point is to discuss the Hollywood scandals, and how Clinton probably knows a lot of these people and may have helped to cover some of it up. I think the posts also promotes discussion about these same scandals that happen in other industries and even politics, so again, I&#39;m not sure why this post is not okay here. </p>

<p>&quot;Your post&quot; does not refer to the OP (or original post) it refers to the post you made. The multiple posts you made responding in the comments. I&#39;m having trouble understanding what relevance you &quot;not posting here&quot; has to do with your assertion I use bots.</p>

You are trying wayy too hard to support your claim, which was a shitcomment in a shit post but it supports Hilldog Millionaire so I was dv&#39;ed to hell <strong>without</strong> saying an opinion. And &quot;I know&quot; does not equate to an opinion. Its soo vague, your entire argument is a waste of time. &#39;Her Majesty&#39; need to accept that she lost the election.

    <div class="md"><p>Errrr.... no. I was pointing out that your assertion of &quot;my bots are showing&quot; was ridiculous because the only reason you would have to believe that I was in anyway connected to bots is because the upvote/downvote ratio didn&#39;t show you what you wanted/expected to see which is proof of nothing. So in other words I was pointing out that claiming someone used bots when you&#39;re getting downvotes makes you like an arrogant asshole.</p>

<p>Nothing was said anywhere about &quot;Hillbots&quot; and if you meant to say something about them you forgot to, again I&#39;m not magically able to decipher what you intended to say, I only have your statements and words which speak pretty clearly on their own.</p>

<p>But we agree on one thing, this is a waste of time. It was great to occupy through an otherwise dull morning but I&#39;m done responding to your shitposts now. Cheers.</p>
