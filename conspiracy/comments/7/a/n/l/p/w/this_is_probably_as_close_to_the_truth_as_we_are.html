        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I found this doc tonight in the new JFK files that say they were concerned about this guy who had files they thought showed Jack Ruby&#39;s connection to DORFMAN.  The doc:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/docid-32144605.pdf">https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/docid-32144605.pdf</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So then i web searched Jack Ruby Dorfman &amp; found this guy: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Dorfman">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Dorfman</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Allen Dorfman had connections to Jimmy Hoffa.  After this I web searched LBJ Hoffa &amp; this link was a bit shocking:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://impiousdigest.com/john-connally-and-johnson/">http://impiousdigest.com/john-connally-and-johnson/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We know from the first batch of files that the Russians thought there was a coup.  For LBJ motive Jackie Kennedy had this to say:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>here is a book called I heard you paint houses about Hoffa and a prolific hitman who they call the irishman. At the end of the book the Irishman tells a story about how he had to go load guns into a plane in New Jersey for a last minute flight. The original plan had a low level mafia/teamster guy drive the guns to Dallas but he stopped for dinner on the trip and had a few drinks. He got back in the car and crashed. The Irishman said those guns eventually made their way to Dallas for a specific purpose. Hoffa knew all of this and eventually threatened to spill the beans once he lost control of the teamsters. Crazy enough after all the years of friendship between the two, the Irishman was instructed to kill Hoffa and he carried out the orders. Anyway it&#39;s a pretty good story and it&#39;s being made into to a movie which should be cool. I wonder if they will add the JFK stuff into the film. The book is definitely worth reading and in not sure these two things are related because they wasn&#39;t a trunk full of guns but still interesting. </p>
