    <div class="md"><p>He lost his status as a high roller and was hemorrhaging his estate via gambling.  He was never that rich, he was definitely, wealthy, but not mega-rich.  He could have done good in the world, but instead chose to wear his true colors on his way out.  That said, I think his plan was known and there are others unknown.  Lastly, his hdd disappearing reminds me of Lanza.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a sample space of 58 families, you are bound to have some that are super private, will bury their dead and get on with life as soon as possible.

<p>I have no evidence to back up what I&#39;m about to say but...</p>

<p>I feel the families were given an enormous, Yuge, unheard of wrongful death settlement, contingent on a lifetime gag order and media black out. One family cracks, no deal, so you got the peer pressure angle going as well. (P.S. just a hunch) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am leaning antifa/Isis motive with multiple shooters/chopper and a 9/11 type plan. Could have been CIA undercover and something went wrong ...not sure. The van was supposed to be pulled under the tanks with the vaporizing leaking fuel and the Tannerite exploded to cause maximum damage. I keep remembering the local tv reporter who was friends with a LV police who told her that night...his room was full of antics and Isis paraphernalia. The camera in the room sending a stream of video possibly off shore. Isis has repeatedly claimed credit. The reason for the messy cover-up.???... Well. I think about the civil war that could possibly break out if it was confirmed that antifa  was responsible even in part and I can see why they might be scurrying to tell a different story.</p>
