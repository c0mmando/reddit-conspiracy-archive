      <p>
       You may or may not have heard of Odebrecht before but I will sum up the situation. Basically Odebrecht is a Brazilian conglomerate company that dabbles in everything from chemical production, gas and oil, to their bread and butter building contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odebrecht">
        https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odebrecht
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So Odebrecht was doing something I assume most companies of their size do but don't get caught. They had an entire department dedicated to making bribes to government officials to secure contracts. The US justice department put it as such:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Odebrecht and Braskem used a hidden but fully functioning Odebrecht business unit—a ‘Department of Bribery,’ so to speak—that systematically paid hundreds of millions of dollars to corrupt government officials in countries on three continents,” said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Suh.  “Such brazen wrongdoing calls for a strong response from law enforcement, and through a strong effort with our colleagues in Brazil and Switzerland, we have seen just that.  I hope that today’s action will serve as a model for future efforts.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/odebrecht-and-braskem-plead-guilty-and-agree-pay-least-35-billion-global-penalties-resolve">
        https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/odebrecht-and-braskem-plead-guilty-and-agree-pay-least-35-billion-global-penalties-resolve
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In that link you'll read that Odebrecht is fully cooperating with all investigations, internationally as well as in Brazil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I call Odebrecht the silent killer because this scandal and investigation, known as operation Car Wash, is taking down political leaders left and right without much fan fare. And the Brazilian Supreme Court judge who was overseeing the whole investigation was killed in a mysterious plane crash but that's almost expected when you're talking about bringing down world leaders right ?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-19/brazil-supreme-court-judge-on-passenger-list-of-crashed-jet">
        https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-19/brazil-supreme-court-judge-on-passenger-list-of-crashed-jet
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Odebrecht was a contributing factor to the impeachment and conviction of Brazilian President Dilma Rouseff and it looks like the CEO of Odebrecht will testify that she knew of the bribery and that they had warned her about being discovered.
      </p>
      <p>

       Ecuador had to replace their Vice President recently because he was caught up in Operation Car Wash as well.

       Former President of Panama is facing charges, as well as two of his former ministers, the former President has some business dealings with Trump, the Trump Ocean Club was opened with the former presidents help in 2011 (I'm not sure how connected they are but I've included this because if I don't someone will say I'm avoiding and now that I have someone will say that I'm reaching, damned if you do damned if you don't)

       And most recently it's worked its way a little farther North to Mexico and it's getting realllllll cozy with the President. Now this one is pretty fresh so we've only got the ball rolling. So there was a businessman who was working full time on the Mexican Presidents campaign and his name is Carlos Fadigas. He was also the head of the Baskrem the petro division of Odebrecht. You've got a head of bribery dolling Odebrecht working on a campaign that was looking for funding....hmmmm I wonder how long until those dots are connected? Well Pemex, the state owned Mexican oil company that would have done the deals with Odebrecht has agreed to comply with the recommendations made by Mexican state auditors
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Except there's a problem with Mexican state auditors, they are corrupt as fuck.
      </p>

      <p>
       Except when you're spending that good good government funding on Telanovela style safety films...then they come at you
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line is don't expect many arrests out of Mexico.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you can see there's plenty of political blood being shed over this scandal but there's the potential for plenty more. Until the main investigation is complete and all the subsequent investigations world wide we can't know the full scope of the damage. But we can certainly follow some clues and bread crumbs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Big companies do not like losing money, it's how they got to be big businesses. Odebrecht is no different in their disdain for losing money. One of their larger international contracts was one that was secured between Mommar Gaddafi and Odebrecht pre-revolution, to build an international airport in Tripoli. Then the revolution/coup happened and that contract was up in the air, now this wouldn't be too much of a problem for Odebrecht if they hadn't already laid most of the ground work and done most of the engineering and costly planning/designing. So they wanted to do what they could to secure the contract.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now let's create a hypothetical situation and then we can try and draw from the real world afterwards to see if we can find a fit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm Odebrecht and I want to ensure that I will still have this contract I want to get in touch with what ever body is now acting as the Libyan government. That was the National Transition Council of Libya. But they aren't exactly in the phone book. How do we get in touch with them? Brazilian ambassador to Libya? Not exactly a big fish with the juice to get things done. Well who's running point on this Libya situation? The Americans? Well we can't just go as a private foreign firm to the US government and ask them to go to bat for us and secure the contract with the temporary government. How could we get them to do what we want? Their Secretary of State runs a pay for play bribery scheme through her foundation? Excellent we just happen to run a bribery department and when our clients have that kind of set up it makes our lives much easier. The hope would be that we would pay a fee that would be a fraction of the cost of the contract and the State Department would secure us the contract and we'd call it a day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quite the scenario I know, but let's compare to evidence from real events and see if reality lines up with that scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       First we need to see if Odebrecht did re-up the contract with the temporary government
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.libya-businessnews.com/tag/odebrecht/">
        https://www.libya-businessnews.com/tag/odebrecht/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2013 they did have the contract. Okay so they did get the contract secured post revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next can we find any evidence suggesting the US State Department was actively involved in helping Odebrecht with these contracts? Well here is an interesting email chain between Hillary Clinton's right hand woman Cheryl Mills, the (at the time) US Ambassador to Brazil Thomas Shannon, and Hillary Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/12907">
        https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/12907
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Start at the bottom of the page and read up. The chain starts with Cheryl receiving a daily news alert with various recaps. The next part is Cheryl forwarding a section of the news alert to Thomas Shannon and CC's Jacob Sullivan who was at the time Director of Policy Planning at the White House. The section she forwards is a quote from the Brazilian Foreign Minister essentially saying that there was no rush to recognize the temporary Libyan government as the Libyan representative at the UN. She says that it will be settled later in the week when the general assembly votes on the matter. Nothing really alarming but apparently this was cause for concern to Shannon and Mills.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next part of the email shows just how concerned Shannon was about this little hiccup. He says he can't understand why the Brazilians are being so standoffish, and he says in especially surprising considering the Brazilian companies with contracts at stake and specifically cites Odebrecht as a particular concern. He says he's going to reach out to the Brazilian government and
       <em>
        work back through these companies
       </em>
       and urge them to reach out to the minister. And remember all the minister said was there's no need to rush, we're having a vote next week and that's when it'll be decided. And the vote was had and it was passed with 114 votes in favour and only 17 against. There should have been no worry that the UN wouldn't recognize the temporary government. So why the urgency from Shannon? And Mills immediately forwards Shannons reply to Hillary Clinton and that's the end of the chain. To me this is pretty clear evidence that the State Department had a big hand in securing the contracts for Odebrecht and showed concern and acted quickly when there was even a whiff of dissent against the plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's only a couple pieces to the puzzle left, proof of payment being the big one. First, was the Clinton Foundation used to "pay to play" bribes? The evidence suggests so
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-new-clinton-emails-uncovered-reveal-additional-mishandling-classified-information/">
        https://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-new-clinton-emails-uncovered-reveal-additional-mishandling-classified-information/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       These kinds of foundations are used by many people from Trump to The Aga Khan to easily launder bribes under the guise of donations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, did Odebrecht contribute to the Clinton Foundation?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/contributors?category=%2450%2C001%20to%20%24100%2C000&amp;amp;page=6">
        https://www.clintonfoundation.org/contributors?category=%2450%2C001%20to%20%24100%2C000&amp;amp;page=6
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There they are in the $50,000-$100,000 range. So yes they gave at least $50,000 to the foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So make of that what you will but it's laid out pretty black and white if you ask me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Odebrecht is a quiet bubbling mass of destruction and it's not finished yet.

       Wow, Thanks OP! This is literally the exact topic I'm writing about in one of my business ethics classes.
