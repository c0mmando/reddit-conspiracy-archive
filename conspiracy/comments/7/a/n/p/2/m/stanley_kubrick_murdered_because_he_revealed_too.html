        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>EWS showed what elites did privately (orgies, murder, etc). Parts of it were actually filmed in a Rothschild mansion in England. Apparently Kubrick wasn&#39;t happy with the theatrical cut and planned on adding an extra 20 minutes to it. Before he could do this he died suddenly of a heart attack in his sleep. We know that heart attack guns have existed for decades. I was just wondering if anyone had done some deeper research on this and could perhaps share some insights here?</p>

The big talk from the media at the time was that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman had a few sex scenes together that showed more than we were used to in feature films at that time.

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone ever looks at his daughter? She&#39;s a Scientologist and had a falling out with her father during the filming of &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;.. You know, that movie starring Tom Cruise?</p>

<p><a href="http://heavy.com/entertainment/2016/11/vivian-kubrick-stanley-daughter-shelley-duvall-gofundme-scientology-the-shining-twitter-alex-jones-anya-family-bio/">http://heavy.com/entertainment/2016/11/vivian-kubrick-stanley-daughter-shelley-duvall-gofundme-scientology-the-shining-twitter-alex-jones-anya-family-bio/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the making of Eyes Wide Shut (1999), which stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, Kubrick was set to score the movie. But for some reason, she refused to do it. She flew off to San Francisco and Los Angeles while the film was made in England.</p>

<p>“They had a huge fight,” Christiane told the Guardian in 2010. “He was very unhappy. He wrote her a 40-page letter trying to win her back. He begged her endlessly to come home from California. I’m glad he didn’t live to see what happened.”</p>

<p>Eyes Wide Shut was Stanley Kubrick’s final film. Jocelyn Pook ended up doing the original music for the movie, which was released a few months after Stanley Kubrick’s death.</p>

<p>She showed up at her father’s funeral with a mysterious person who “spooked” the family.</p>

<p>Katharina Kubrick, Vivian’s step-sister, also confirmed to the Daily Beast in 2010 that Vivian came to her father’s funeral with a “handler.” Katharina said that was the last time she saw Vivian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jay Wiedner (room 237) postulates that Nicole&#39;s character was at the ball in ews, and that the older gentleman she dances with at the Xmas party was part of this story line. He speculates there is an mkultra tie in that has been scrubbed from the story and that&#39;s why that interaction while intense and weird seem truncated.</p>

<p>Other rumors I&#39;ve heard are regarding the editing of naked black people from the film (questionable), and that Kubrick&#39;s contract stipulated he had full control over the final edit of the film (likely)</p>

<p>We know that his next project was going to be AI, which had overt themes of pedophilia, but was instead given to Spielberg and made into a quasi family friendly mess.</p>

<p>Kubrick died 666 days before 2001. Strange coincidence.</p>

<p>Tom cruises character in ews helps a doctor (Zeigler I think) w an overdosed prostitute. That doctor&#39;s name translates to &#39;mason&#39;</p>

<p>Kubrick was very specific about scrubbing any trace of &#39;jewishness&#39; from the script of ews (per the screenwriter)</p>

<p>The story that ews is based on (all Kubrick&#39;s movies are based on books) is a short story about a man who wakes up one day and starts slowly shrinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. As I already stated, he delivered a rough cut that was releasable. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t honestly know if they edited any bits out of it. </p>

<p>As I said, it WASN&#39;T ABOUT OCCULT DISCLOSURE. It was about Kubrick being dissatisfied with the film and he wanted to continue shooting until he felt he had it right. It was one of the longest shoots in Hollywood history and everybody was going nuts that Cruise was unavailable.</p>

<p>Not about vastly changing the film. Not about important scenes being gone (though they may be). Not about re-editing it so it made sense. </p>

<p>It was about getting Tom Cruise back into the marketplace. </p>

<p>Honestly, I thought I&#39;d made that pretty clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds plausible but that&#39;s pretty fucked up.  Seems like they could have done something short of killing the guy to get them out of their contracts.  Got any dirt on Joss Whedon? I was talking about this with a friend of mine, he has a certain &quot;type&quot; and he keeps casting the same girls over and over regardless of suitability for the roles.. I sense a casting couch vibe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This extrapolation is pure conjecture, but Kubrick had more power in Hollywood than even Cruise at that point. He hadn&#39;t made a movie in a decade, it was a huge EVENT that Kubrick was coming back, and with a film rumored to be the first truly &quot;art&quot; NC-17 motion picture. So much buzz (ultimately unfulfilled), there was no way out of that contract. Plus I&#39;m guessing some kind of occult thing was going on too, but I&#39;m not privy to any of that. </p>

<p>But just to note....Kidman&#39;s dad was a pedophile, she had a super fucked up upbringing and I believe she is programmed, Monarch style. Both Cruise and Kidman were scientologists at the time, they may well have been TOLD to make that movie, and defer to Kubrick. Again, I have no idea about that, but it fits. All those people are super fucked up, believe me. If Cruise and Kidman had sex in that movie, it may have been the only time in their marriage, LOL.  </p>

<p>As for Joss Whedon, it&#39;s the usual dirt, the same dirt that EVERYBODY has on them in Hollywood, and of course it&#39;s the casting couch, which, frankly, is low level dirt considering the town has more than its fair share of rapists, child molesters and flat out murderers.</p>

<p>I was only still working around Hollywood at the very beginning of Joss&#39;s career, the Buffy time. But from what I&#39;ve heard and somewhat know, Joss enjoys the perks that all the powerful creators/directors get. Beautiful women will suck his cock or fuck him at the drop of a dress, in hopes of getting a decent role, or even a single line for that matter. Do a demure strip tease during a 1-on-1 casting session. Roleplay the captured action heroine turned damsel in distress, or innocent goodhearted schoolteacher who will reluctantly do anything for a generous donation to the poor, underprivileged children. It&#39;s all just to see how &quot;convincing&quot; the actress is, of course.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter who you want to name....actor, producer, director, maybe even a screenwriter or two (but not many, LOL), they all take advantage of the casting couch. Don&#39;t think presumably wonderful guys like Ron Howard or Tom Hanks are even close to spotless, when it comes to lovely young ingenues. Or handsome young studs.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s also a quid-pro-quo--the actress/actor knows s/he&#39;s making a transaction, and while it is certainly a power kick for the guy and not excusable ethically, at least we&#39;ve got two cynical adults doing their thing.</p>

<p>What&#39;s not so transactionally excusable is the guys far worst than Joss Whedon who won&#39;t take &quot;no&quot; for an answer and really lean on women to give it up, threaten to destroy their careers, or, like Weinstein and the Affleck boys and bunch of others, just rape them. And even those guys are a cut above the actual psychos who get off on hurting people and the pedophiles, who are just now maybe coming to light but I more than half doubt it. The guys at the top of that food chain--and it is a food chain--are scary powerful and kill people. They&#39;ve killed quite a few.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the cannibalism. But I think at that point most everybody will stop believing me, so we won&#39;t go down that path. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve not been around Hollywood with any regularity for more than a decade now, in fact pushing two decades, but I still keep in touch and hear things from time to time. I have friends is SAG and DGA. You want more?</p>

<p>Scarlett Johansson&#39;s nickname in Hollywood is &quot;The Mattress.&quot; She&#39;s the ultimate casting couch queen. Not hard to figure, really; how often did she work with Woody Allen (huge perv)? How many movies has she made for Harvey, either at Miramax or Weinstein Co.? Now recall that time when the two closeted Avengers guys Renner &amp; Evans made that out-of-left field joke on a press tour about Black Widow being a total slut. They weren&#39;t talking about the comic character, they were making a mean joke about ScarJo. She&#39;s actually sort of a joke in Hollywood, but since she&#39;ll suck anybody&#39;s dick for a dollar she&#39;s managed to make it near the top of the heap with moderate talent only slightly-above-average looks.</p>

<p>Tom Cruise&#39;s nickname is &quot;Tom Thumb.&quot; Not sure if it&#39;s just because of his height. He&#39;ll never get caught doing the dirty with one of his boyfriends because he uses a plane. Guy is incredibly disciplined.  Anybody who&#39;s got their own plane--Cruise, Travolta, Spielberg and so on--you should see as suspect of some really awful stuff. </p>

<p>Nearly every male actor you see on screen is at least bi-sexual and the majority are gay. Most male actors have had to suck dick to land their early key role. The few who don&#39;t come from outside the mainstream, often from outside the country---Mel Gibson, for example, for all his fucked up flaws, did not have to suck dick because the first extremely low budget &quot;Mad Max&quot; made him an international movie star, even if it didn&#39;t do so great in the USA. Jim Carrey didn&#39;t have to suck dick, at least at first, he may have later if the rumors about him being the top satanic priest in L.A. are true. You don&#39;t get up that high without sucking a dick or twelve. And eating a few turds. </p>

<p>Clooney, Pitt, Affleck, Damon, they&#39;ve all fucked each other as much as they&#39;ve fucked hot women. It&#39;s just the way it goes. Go back 35 years, it was Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Bruce Dern, Dennis Hopper, Clint Eastwood....all fucked each other as much as they fucked any chick. </p>

<p>People presume Hollywood runs on sex, but they have no idea how much it runs on sex. It infuses and consumes everything. The more I went there for work, the more it infected me, and the most insidious thing is that you don&#39;t even realize it as it&#39;s happening. </p>

<p>After getting to know John Travolta, the actor/celebrity who I knew better than any of them professionally and found smart and charming and really easygoing and likable, I remember telling my (now ex) wife once, &quot;You know, I&#39;ve never felt like this before, but I could see myself sucking his dick and being okay with it.&quot; Never felt that way about any guy, before or since, and when I think about it now, I&#39;m like &quot;WTF was I thinking?&quot; But there you have it; it&#39;s an intoxicating atmosphere there that way. (I didn&#39;t suck his dick, btw. Phew!). </p>

<p>Anyway, this has gone on far far far too long because I&#39;ve been drinking and cooped up on a Friday night because I was just paranoid enough to think that fucking LARPer about Podesta and Antifa was telling the truth and maybe Civil War was going to break out this week end so I wanted to be close to home. I may erase this by morning, or maybe not, but I hope you get to read it before I do. </p>

<p>And oh--Robert Wagner killed Natalie Wood. She flipped out when she caught Wagner blowing Christopher Walken on that yacht, he bopped her, threw her overboard, she was drunk and drowned. Everybody in Hollywood knows. </p>

<p>You... get a lot of stuff here spot on. However, I think you&#39;re more of a collator of info, then a first-hand observer, to wit, let axe you sumpin&#39; - what do Nicole Kidman and Mel Gibson have in common? I&#39;ll give you a hint (this is a <em>very</em> tough question), it has something to do with their country of birth?</p>

<p>Give up? Yeah, I&#39;m sure none of you got this, they were both in the United States of America. Kidman in Honolulu, HI and Gibson was born in Peakskill, NY.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to respond to everyone&#39;s questions here, but I&#39;ll return for this. </p>

<p>You are correct about both Kidman and Gibson being born in America, something I should have remembered but forgot about...like I said, I&#39;m not really in those circles anymore, not everything is fresh in my mind, and I was drinking last night. Not going to try and foist the Kevin Spacey excuse on you, but that&#39;s how it is.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll get back to Gibson/Kidman, but I&#39;ll address the first-hand observer/collator question. The best way for me to describe myself and my relationship to Hollywood would be to say I was &quot;in the world but not of it.&quot; I was at the forefront of a certain category of the digital age during the first dot-boom years, and through a couple lucky breaks ended up getting to work with Hollywood studios and stars in the 90s as they tried to figure out how to monetize their movies better through the internet. I didn&#39;t live there, but I was flying there once, twice, three times a month for business and lived like a king--staying at the 4 Seasons and other luxury hotels--invited to premieres, eat at elite restaurants, attend a few parties in the hills.</p>

<p>It sounds great, but it was mostly a clusterfuck. Everybody was paranoid and nobody knew what they were doing, and it made people insecure. I&#39;ve always, for some reason, been somebody people will talk to. I ask a lot of questions and I listen. Everybody in Hollywood wants to talk and gossip. It&#39;s really very easy to get them to spill the beans, and after a while you start to hear the same stories from different people, and so on. You take this stories and research more, and the puzzle pieces start to form into a concrete picture. </p>

<p>Moreover, the sad truth is that people in Hollywood aren&#39;t that smart, especially the acting &quot;talent&quot; and the ones who are smart are eager to commiserate with other smart people. I&#39;m pretty smart, and I was in a field that they didn&#39;t understand at all, so they would try to impress me with the things they knew that I did not. </p>

<p>Now back to Kidman/Gibson. I have to admit, I&#39;m a Mel Gibson fan, so my views there will be biased. I met and spent a good deal of time with him once, around the time of &quot;Ransom,&quot; and he was really smart, funny, seemed far more sincerely empathetic than most anyone else out there (except maybe for the aforementioned John Travolta, who just exuded compassion and friendliness) yet carried this subtle aura of pain. He had real presence. Plus, he&#39;s a great director. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m also aware Gibson&#39;s dad was a fucking evil loon, he&#39;s obviously carrying some mental scars, and I may be wrong that he didn&#39;t have to &quot;pay the price&quot; and do the &quot;gravy&quot; stuff. </p>

<p>But I&#39;ll be more direct: Are you insinuating that Kidman and Gibson were both groomed by a satanic pedophile cult that had to flee the US for Australia? Because that would not surprise me in the least. One Hollywood rumor that I didn&#39;t mention during my EWS piece was that Kidman&#39;s creep of a dad pimped her out for kiddy porn films as a young girl. Maybe you&#39;re suggesting Gibson&#39;s dad did the same for him? Maybe Gibson and Kidman have a secret kiddy porn video entrusted away in some big old European castle somewhere, let&#39;s say? I know more than you think, yes?</p>

<p>What I&#39;m wondering is if Test_user21, wants me to take people down an even more shadowy and briar-laden path. He&#39;s possibly trying to get me to tell you that the entirety of Hollywood is one giant luciferian/satanic cult with varying degrees and levels, loyalties and internecine warfare, but all of it with the ultimate goal of driving the planet towards a one-world authoritarian satanic government. </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t surprise me. That&#39;s how fucked up it is out there.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m willing to take a hard look at Gibson, as you suggest. Despite my being a Christian, &quot;Passion of the Christ&quot; is my least favorite movie of his. Hours of torture, a minute of salvation at the very end. How many crazy parents took their young kids to that movie and traumatized them forever? Maybe even put them off Christianity for good? If a viewer is not a Christian, is this movie <em>more</em> or <em>less</em> likely to make them consider Christ? From the inside looking out, my guess is <em>less</em>. </p>

<p>Yet....on the other hand....too many Christians have generally turned Jesus and his ultimate sacrifice into a greeting card sentiment. Being compelled to take a good hard look at what He had to go through could be a sobering wake-up call for some, and it&#39;s not Gibson&#39;s fault if some crazies take their kids to a hard-R extremely violent film. I also appreciated Gibson&#39;s depiction of the Devil as a hermaphroditic entity along the lines of Baphomet. </p>

<p>So I&#39;ve told you. What more can you tell me? Or all of us here, who are clearly fascinated by this subject matter? </p>

<p>Do you think part of the obvious Civil War that&#39;s going on is taking place inside the Jewish Community? Regular ol&#39; Jews vs. Zionists? That&#39;s occurred to me. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am sad to say that it doesn&#39;t surprise me to hear that cannibalism occurs behind the scenes in Hollywood.

    <div class="md"><p>Amazing post! Thanks for sharing. This is a total shot in the dark, but I was wondering if you had info about some of the low profile actors in Hollywood. For example, I&#39;ve always liked Daniel Day Lewis, but I know there&#39;s no way he gets to be that big without having some skeletons in his closet. What about Al Pacino?</p>

<p>Also, what about  the authors that hung out in these circles ie Hunter S Thompson, Arthur Miller....even Ernest Hemingway </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the rumors about what really happened with EWS and Kubrick&#39;s final cut are shrouded in mystery. But I can tell you a significant portion of what really happened.</p>

<p>The primary motive for Kubrick&#39;s murder is strictly a Hollywood business decision. It&#39;s got nothing to do with the Rothschilds, the Illuminati or the elite. Well, I&#39;m sure it does peripherally, but it&#39;s got little to do with their fear of exposure. The folks at the top have very little fear of that, believe me (whether this lack is valid or not, I have no clue).</p>

<p>What happened was that every contract every actor signed to work with Kubrick stated that their first priority was to finish his film. They could take other gigs, BUT if there were reshoots or anything like that, they would have to return to Kubrick, no questions asked, non-negotiable.</p>

<p>This essentially committed Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman to EWS until Kubrick delivered final cut. They were boxed in, and boxed out of other movies, other studios, Cruise especially, as he is in nearly ever scene. Kidman, though also top-billed, had much less screen time and managed to make one other (occult!) movie, &quot;Practical Magic,&quot; during this period.</p>

<p>But Cruise, the #1 movie star in the world at that point, was locked in. As the shoot went on and on and on--entire scenes reshot with different cast (Harvey Keitel replaced by Sidney Pollack, for example) Tom Cruise couldn&#39;t make any other movies. </p>

<p>This became a big problem. The country&#39;s #1 movie star couldn&#39;t work with any other studio--Paramount was cooling its heels waiting on him for &quot;Mission Impossible 2&quot;--until Kubrick was done with him. And Kubrick wasn&#39;t done with him.</p>

<p>Just look at Cruise&#39;s IMDB. Big gap in his resume from 1996 (&quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;) all the way to 1999 (&quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;), the longest hole in his career by far. BY FAR.</p>

<p>Finally, after delivering yet ANOTHER rough cut to Warner Brothers, Kubrick was still dissatisfied and refused to approve a final cut, deciding to shoot even more material, as you note in your original post. Whether it was 20 minutes or two, doesn&#39;t matter. Cruise and Kidman were still on-call. </p>

<p>At that point, with a rough cut that was certainly at a point where the film could be released, with the added incentive that Kubrick was overplaying his limited hangout disclosure, but above all the feeling that enough, Cruise needed to get back in the marketplace, they killed Kubrick. </p>

<p>Cruise quickly got slotted into a small but meaty role in &quot;Magnolia,&quot; so he had two fast movies released in 1999, then shot &quot;MI:2,&quot; and it was back off to the races. </p>

<p>Who did it? Who made the call? That I don&#39;t know. The top Hollywood money men? The Scientologists? Cruise himself? No idea. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s the story. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent a good amount of time in Hollywood, though not for many years, which is okay because it&#39;s more fucked up than ever and the level of talent is the lowest it&#39;s been in at least eighty years. </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t surprise me if some Hollywood director oversaw 9/11, but I doubt it would be a 70+ y.o. I&#39;d also presume they&#39;d only call on you once for something like that, it&#39;s a deal with the devil, and then they give you near free-reign. </p>

<p>Some way out-there rumors have said Spielberg was the producer/director of the Boston Bombing &quot;event.&quot; So who might&#39;ve handled the 9/11 production? Considering it was such a shit show, I&#39;ll lean with Michael Bay. ;-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m inclined to agree with you. The dominant forces in the US are pure unadulterated and unrelenting greed and what one might only call a very highly evolved form of &quot;gangsterism&quot; in relation to how those afflicted with it go about feeding it.</p>

<p>It seems to apply just about anywhere you look in a society that upholds and continually rewards those who have always had more than enough at very direct expense of all those who never had enough to begin with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue 2001 was much more of a threat to any  of the elite than EWS. It is the foundation for many societies. If you want to look I to it further, you need to know that the movie was supposed to take place on Saturn and not Jupiter, but had to be changed due to cost of special effects. The black cube also plays into this.</p>

<p>I would also argue that &quot;they&quot; don&#39;t really care if you know about their parties, rituals and beliefs. All of it can be found on line and in books. They know we have little power to interrupt them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is very complicated but I&#39;ll try to explain</p>

<p>I believe within the next 100, 150 years max this world is going to be drastically different. We are entering a new astrological age in Aquarius and exiting Pisces. We are living in the &quot;end of times&quot; Jesus forewarned about. Now, whether you want to take this literal or understand it&#39;s meaning on a metaphysical level (the latter of which I choose to do and think others should as well) is your choice, but what can&#39;t be argued is going along with the Zodiac timeline that dates back 1000&#39;s of years we are entering the age of Aquarius.</p>

<p>Okay, so there&#39;s been a battle of good and evil since the beginning of our consciousness as we know it. People like to refer to the evil group as &quot;Illuminati&quot; but really it&#39;s just practitioners of a mystery religion that dates back to Babylon (see Bill Cooper&#39;s Mystery Babylon). Why people would practice this stuff is it gives you &quot;power&quot; in this dimension . Money, fame, etc.</p>

<p>Okay, so putting those two together, leaving the age of Pisces and the mystery religion/occult, the occult is very aware we are leaving this astrological age. I can also tell you (from first hand experience) that these people hate Jesus because they know his teaching is able to bring people to the light (this is a whole other discussion, anyways continuing)</p>

<p>So, as we are leaving this astrological age the theory is that these high ranking occultists are looking for a way to immortality (a modern day tower of babel). Basically, the plan is to use technology to get there. Technology is advancing at a rate that humans are not able to comprehend, and as Carl Jung said, we have probably opened up Pandora&#39;s box here. Eventually this technology is going to be able to surpass human capabilities. </p>

<p>So long story short because this is all very confusing when first hearing it (and confusing to me even talking about it but this occult stuff is weird in itself) as this age ends and technology is advancing this world is going to never be the same within 100-150 years, and the occult agenda has to do with going into space and becoming star children. I do believe, whether occult or not, we&#39;re gonna be in space a lot as a species during this new astrological age. The last 30 minutes of the 2001 movie is basically a allegory for an occult ritual in which the end result is becoming a star child by the end (again this is very complicated).</p>

<p>Basically they think shit&#39;s about to get real on Earth (they are right it&#39;s just a matter of when) and are planning for a way to join the cosmos. I&#39;ll keep it short with this one, but going along with the theory I believe our consciousness as we know it could be coming to an end in the next 100-150 years, and with the rapid advancement of technology there is a theory that the occult believes a digital matrix in which we can &quot;live forever&quot; is going to be created when the time comes (see Don Hertzfeldt&#39;s World of Tomorrow for a good visual representation of this)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is really to much for a Reddit reply, but if you look I to Saturn and the black cube you will get a good picture.

<p>YES YES. You are on the right track. </p>

<p>Christianity is both SO SIMPLE and SO COMPLEX it defies human understanding, the harder and farther you case it. But YES, the Cross is the opening up of the black cube for ALL, in a benevolent way, through Christ&#39;s sacrifice UPON A CROSS. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve just simplified this so much it&#39;s ridiculous, but I&#39;m so happy to see somebody make this connection, and it&#39;s (symbolically) what differentiates Christianity from all these other occult religions. GRACE is what separates Christianity from all other religions, as CS Lewis said long before I did. </p>

<p>He also grew up connected to powerful people. You know what he said about it? Never get near it.</p>

<p>kubrick ode to joy european union clockwork orange </p>

<p>He talks about Ode to Joy being this empty piece used for ideology. His reasoning for Clockwork Orange was the sickening feeling he got when he heard that Ode to Joy would be the European Union&#39;s anthem. The basic idea is that it&#39;s this completely patriotic song, but patriotic about nothing, so it is used and manipulated by powers.</p>

<p>Not Kubrick&#39;s words directly, but Zizek is a good starting point on all o this:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It might not play to contemporary conspiracies, being a period piece, but rewatch it. There&#39;s the conspiracy of the duel which causes Lyndon&#39;s wander to start (and this is all about money and marriage, reminds me of what is told to Kidman while they dance in Eyes Wide Shut.) Then Barry infiltrates the courts of Europe, works as a spy, as a double agent, etc..</p>

<p>Sure, there&#39;s no cracking open of a particular conspiracy, but it is an investigation of power, marriage, spycraft, nation building, and war. These are the things that all major conspiracies are built around.</p>

In other words out of character the two know/knew one another. While they&#39;re dancing there&#39;s a woman who looks like a gypsy dancing directly behind them, which is no coincidence.<br/>
&quot;The Dionysian Mysteries were a ritual of ancient Greece and Rome which used intoxicants and other trance-inducing techniques (like dance and music) to remove inhibitions and social constraints, liberating the individual to return to a natural state.&quot; This is almost the exact same wording that Zandor uses to Alice in reference to the reasons why women used to get married. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that Alice was in on everything (the initiation) going on with Bill (Tom Cruise) as was everyone that Dr. Bill converses with throughout the movie, but was she doing it as a mind controlled victim or otherwise? I go with that she was raised as an MK Ultra victim. Especially when we analyze what&#39;s going on with the daughter (she&#39;s being prepped for her role, being groomed to look pretty and learning about money)... especially her final scene (she looks back at her parents and walks off with 3 people who we see earlier at the Zeiglar party). My final conclusion as of this time is that there are two stories Kubrick is telling. Alice and Bill&#39;s relationship within society... societal roles/rituals. And then in terms of the ritual within the organization that Bill was being initiated into. Of course I&#39;ve always grasped the concept that two stories were being told, but I interpreted it as one story with a parallel as opposed to two separate stories that parallel one another (I now lean towards the later). 
Does anyone have an opinion/idea - did Dr. Bill fail his initiation when he tells Alice everything? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does have a bit of that feel to it, there is Alice&#39;s dream, and of course the ending speech. The climax (forgive the pun) of that speech ends Dr. Bill&#39;s (great pun on Kubrick&#39;s part) sexual odyssey. However, instead of an exotic encounter, he&#39;s led full circle back to his wife. ... Although maybe that sexual encounter too is delayed, if their child is indeed abducted they&#39;re probably going to have to wait a bit longer to fuck.</p>

<p>Is Bill really initiated? He might have seen something, but he&#39;s also having the door closed on him, and learning that he&#39;s just help.</p>

<p>This is an interesting article discussing how &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is basically a remake of &quot;The Firm,&quot; but taken up one power level. Both star Tom Cruise, and the director of &quot;The Firm&quot; is Sydney Pollack: Zeigler.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s interesting about Eyes wide shut apparently having a tie in to the firm. Are you familiar with Traumnovelle - Dream Story (1969)? It&#39;s a German film from 1969, which Eyes wide Shut is essentially a remake of that film. What amazed me is how shockingly similar it is (the general plotline is virtually identical).
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfZyIoQYS_g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfZyIoQYS_g</a></p>

<p>If the Hartfords are good enough to be invited for the 2nd year in a row to Zeiglers party, if I knew nothing else I would say they are definitely being considered? They do need doctors. I&#39;m guessing that they probably were one of the only ones at the party who weren&#39;t members. The overdose definitely seemed planned for Dr. Bill to come up and save the day. The young daughter in the costume shop whispers in Bills ear what type of tux he should pick. </p>

<p>AT the end of the day is kubrick trying to convey that Alice is psychic and/or has an insane level of intuition or is she part of the plan (wittingly or unwittingly)? One of the first lines in the movie is do you know where my wallet is. It&#39;s actually really humorous because the wallet is buried under a book by the bed and Alice knows where it is without hesitation. I understand Kubrick drives that point many times with the daughter and the money math problems etc., but I think it could also be that everything that happens from that point forward is pre designed and specifically placed. Alice calls Bill right as he&#39;s about to have sex with Domino (name not coincidental). Then Alice has the exact same dream as to what just happened to Bill. Then to go back to the fight they had... she definitely created that fight, it was going down regardless of how Bill responded... after smoking weed no-less (the opposite effects of weed especially if you don&#39;t smoke often). Then you get to the end and she has a the mask next to her on the bed. There are several other smaller moments I left out, but I feel much more confident that she was in on the initiation  (I&#39;m guessing Zeigler knew Alice first through the Art game before he knew Dr. Bill) as opposed to wanting the viewer to believe that Alice has borderline supernatural abilities. </p>

<p>Anyways, so much of it definitely seems staged. Obviously the chick sacrificing herself for Bill was extremely theatrical... actually all the conversations in the house with Bill were theatrical. The Nick Nightengale scene where Bill gets the password was definitely set up in a way to where Bill or anyone would have inquired further to ultimately get the password, but it was definitely intentionally set up by Nick. 
And I just remembered the gay hotel clerk can be seen at the masked party in one of the scenes. And that was another instance where Bill was setup to inquire further until he got some disturbing details. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first three films are usually cut from the list, as Kubrick believed in Auteur theory (one person makes a film, writes, directs, has final say, etc..) and he did not get that until Lolita. One interesting thing is to note how his movies differ from the books ...</p>

<p>Lolita: Major change from the book is that it goes from a Pedophile to nationwide organized groups of pedophiles.</p>

<p>Dr Strangelove: Fluoridation, Communism, Operation Paperclip, the ability of the Military to subvert the President (read the original &quot;pie fight&quot; ending, and you can even see a discussion of the MIC killing JFK.)</p>

<p>1968: I mentioned as the weird one, but it&#39;s about aliens and the soul and such, which a lot of people tie in with various Satanic Conspiracies.</p>

<p>1971: The government is experimenting with treatments to control society by changing their behavior, what Kubrick called &quot;Psychedelic Fascism.&quot; The gangs and their activities are meant to be mini-stand-ins for what nations are like going with Kubrick&#39;s quote that &quot;Throughout History, large nations have acted like gangsters, and small nations like prostitutes.&quot; Then there&#39;s the connection of Ode to Joy to the European Union and Kubrick&#39;s vision of the new fascism in Europe.</p>

<p>1975: It&#39;s the story of a spy and a double agent infiltrating European courts, and the use of marriage as means of control and keeping peace.</p>

<p>The Shining: There are a number of theories on this one, and no matter what answer I gave, someone would say it&#39;s a different one. However, there&#39;s entire documentary about the conspiracies people see this movie talking about &quot;Room 237&quot;</p>

<p>Full Metal Jacket: It&#39;s about the war machine and the horrors of it. It&#39;s about the brainwashing of young men in bootcamp and sending them off to die.</p>

<p>1999: The elite of the world meet in satanic orgies, have connections to pedophiles, and kill people that get in their way.</p>

<p>His movies are not about conspiracies like Oliver Stone&#39;s JFK or trying to tell what really happens. Instead all of his movies center around things like war, pedophilia, and control of people. Everyone of them can be seen as in some way a separation of classes, the poor serving the elite as their soldiers or prey.</p>

<p>A relevant Kubrick quote:</p>

<p>“Never, ever go near power. Don’t become friends with anyone who has real power. It’s dangerous.”</p>

<p>Look at his background and family background for a hint of how he might have known some of these things (besides being incredibly intelligent and an avid reader.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kubrick was talking about mgtow concepts before it even formally existed. All else gives us as a red herring because, even then, this subject is/was forbidden in liberal Hollywood. If you want to work in Hollywood, or in Sceintology for that matter, you must adopt their opinons and views, and must virtual signal it within their own unique set of rituals. Praise Harvey. Wallbanger.</p>

<p>Corporate structures, and these both are, demand a cetain ideological fealty. Ask James Woods. Ask James Damore, formally of Google.</p>

<p>From the trophy wives of as Dr. William &quot;Bill&quot; Harford and Victor Ziegler, to his daughter groomed for such a life. Witness the shopkeeper selling his daughter to someone of means. The legions of attractive &quot;whores&quot; kept by wealthy and powerful men partying in a mansion. Why must Dr Bill shut up about it the so-called &quot;illuminati&quot; and why the piano player beat down? Their wives mustn&#39;t find find out. These men and women in Kubrick&#39;s world treat each other as disposable commodities. </p>

<p>The Scientology connection probably in place because his daughter was in, I think there&#39;s an angle out of the scope of this sub. It&#39;s egalitarian in practice but it&#39;s fiercely protective of its ideology, a practice very much in line with Hollywood and its media partners. </p>
