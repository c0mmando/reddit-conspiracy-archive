    <div class="md"><p>I just pointed out an interesting coincidence. This isn&#39;t my thread. However, I&#39;m also humble enough to know I don&#39;t know the real answer to this. Maybe those teams earned it. Maybe it was a conspiracy on a human level involving owners, players etc. Maybe it&#39;s a deeper conspiracy weaved into the fabric of space/time. I&#39;m just here collecting data. My mind is not made up on any of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I know. And full disclosure, I&#39;m a native Bostonian, so it&#39;s a somewhat sensitive topic for me, insofar as it gets irritating AF when your team wins and people claim your team didn&#39;t deserve it, that they only won because TPTB rigged it to boost morale. It was especially irritating in Feb 2002 when I was living in New York, and the Pats won their first Superbowl, and everyone immediately started saying the Pats only won because of 9/11 and being the &quot;Patriots,&quot; it was good for America. This was only a couple months after NY&#39;s team (also Giuliani&#39;s team) had gone to the World Series and lost. So when the Yankees lose, the Diamondbacks earned their win, but when the Rams lose, the Superbowl must&#39;ve been rigged and the Patriots didn&#39;t earn their win. Guess I&#39;m still bitter about that. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can relate. I lived in Boston in 2001 during 9/11 and have been a New England sports fan my whole life. I won what for me at the time was a ton of money betting on the Pats to win that SB over the Rams. I <em>knew</em> they were going to win. And they did. I&#39;d like to think they earned it, but the coincidence of the events surrounding it at the time certainly speak to at least some sort of synchronicity at play. </p>

<p>FWIW, I placed a bet on Denver to win in 2016 after watching a ton of Zachary K Hubbard on YT where he only talks about Gematria. There was a very bizarre news story that came out that year where someone was dangling from a highway sign after an accident, which was just unbelievable. Totally random, I know, and admittedly I stopped watching his videos quite a while back, but I felt like he really decoded something there and was willing to risk some money on it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know exactly how you could rig a sports game, physically, other than officials and coaches and at least some players in on it (which I&#39;d imagine someone would have talked by now) but my gut tells me there&#39;s something deeper that we don&#39;t quite understand yet. I am not a coincidence theorist, so when I see patterns that shouldn&#39;t exist, I always have to stop and wonder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude come on. Houston has been building a bad ass baseball team. And New Orleans roster was stacked that year. Attempts could be and have been made to fix games but at the end of the day in order to win your way to the top you have to have a good organization/ball club with competitive, committed and talented proffesionals to win championships. Yes its entertainment and alot of money goes into all of it but you cant dismiss the competitive nature of sport </p>

<p>You could say something about hurricane Sandy and the Patriots. But Tom Brady is the reason they win so many super bowls</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was going to post my conspiracy theory here that the Dodgers threw the 7th game by staring with Darvish. There is no reason why managers with as much experience as those on the Dodgers staff made that choice in any other effort other than to completely throw the game. </p>

<p>It&#39;s an amateur asinine decision. A clear throw imo and I don&#39;t have a horse in the race. I&#39;m a Braves fan, but that just seemed so obviously a throw.</p>

<p>I know the NBA has been in hot water before for rigging games or series. I&#39;m starting to think all sports are just rigged either to boost morale for grief stricken areas (Houston), or just for simple capitalistic gain (extending series).</p>
