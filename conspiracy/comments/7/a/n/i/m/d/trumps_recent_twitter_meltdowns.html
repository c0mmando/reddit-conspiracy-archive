        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you have been following Lil donnie on twitter lately,  he released a storm of angry tweets over the course of 3 hours regarding the justice depts unwillingness to prosecute hilary and other dems for the while election fiasco where they stole the nomination from bernie.</p>

<p>One of my senators, GOPs Bob corcker, called trump out.  He said that trump is trying to goad the doj into prosecuting his enemies.  And I agree with him.  </p>

<p>Truth is, we don&#39;t know that hilary broke any laws when she stile the nomination.  All we know is that it was ethically wrong.  Remember, the DC is a private buisness, not a state run entity.  They can do whatever their board of directors want with their money, so long as they follow state and federal laws. </p>

<p>Should it be investigated?  Probably so, yes.  But here are my problems with how trump has reacted to all of this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>He is behaving as if he is just powerless in all of this.  If he doesn&#39;t like how people in the doj are doing their job, he could fire them and appoint new people.  If he really cared about justice in this matter, this is what he would do.  Instead he wants to act all self-righteous on twitter.  And call for immediate punishment of his political opponets, thereby sabotaging justice just as he did in the bowe bergdahl case.  When he made his opinion known on twitter, it made it impossible to get a truly fair trial.  It poisoned the well of opinion.  This may have played into the judges decision to let bowe off with no jail time, and if this thing with hilary goes to court it will ruin that too.</p></li>
<li><p>He only wants justice on his terms.  He wants his political opponets prosecuted.  He doesn&#39;t care who was hurt or what was taken from the American people.  If he did, he wouldn&#39;t have referred to sanders as &quot;crazy bernie&quot;.  He is only using this issue to make himself look less corrupt .  Basically saying, &quot;I&#39;m not that bad, look what hilary did!!&quot;  Which is not surprising considering his historically low approval rating. </p></li>
<li><p>He is undermining the publics Confidence in the doj.  He paints them as incompetent layabouts.  He acts like, because they aren&#39;t doing what he wants they are betraying the American people.  The reality is that these type of things take time and are complicated.  But people that voted for him don&#39;t know that and think trumps word is gospel.  You would think that, as someone that is under investigation for collusion, he would be a little more respectful to the doj.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Trump is a twitter warrior.  He has the temperament of a butt hurt 12 year old.  He is purposely misleading the public.  He is the cause of so much division in this country.  Nobody can argue that.</p>

<p>SPEZ:  I took out some of the name calling.  And for the record, hilary belongs in jail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have an alternate theory. Yesterday Carter Page while pleading the fifth and withholding all documents threw Sessions under the bus for knowing about his Moscow July 2016 trip while he and Sessions where on Trump&#39;s campaign foreign advisory team. Recently Sessions also admitted he did recall Papadopoulos and his Russia meeting.</p>

<p>Sessions has been caught lieing in testimony to Congress and has most likely drawn Mueller&#39;s eye.</p>

<p>My theory is Trump is distancing away from Sessions for future attempts to paint Sessions as barely part of his team and a Clinton plant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t think he should talk about it.  It&#39;s trump casting aspersions and calling for people to be put in jail that I have a problem with.   He coukd suggest an investigation take place without immediately saying they should all be in jail.  Any good lawyer will take his Twitter statements and say they make it impossible for a fair trial.  That&#39;s just more ammo for the defense.  Past presidents didn&#39;t say things like trump dies because they already knew all of this.  This aline blows the whole 3d chess theiry out of the water.  Unless he knows hilary and company will be investigated and he&#39;s doing  what he can to make sure she gets off easy.</p>

<p>I want her to go to jail, but trump is making that a harder reality to achieve by taking to twitter and firing off poorly thought out tweets like these.</p>
