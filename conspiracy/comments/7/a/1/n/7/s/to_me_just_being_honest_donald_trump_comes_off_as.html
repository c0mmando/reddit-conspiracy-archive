       I think TPTB are using him as bait, to make us trust the current government and support whatever they do. Wars, accelerated NSA spring, expansion of police state, illegal wars...

       It all sounds like more of the same to me. Every election everybody thinks the new president is some hero, and then he ends up being a fucking puppet just like the rest...

       He is a threat to everyone, not just the establishment. You speak of nuance, maybe the establishment was scared of him because he is a mean, incompetent hack. He is certainly no threat to take the establishment down.

       You're right that he isn't one of them. He tried to join a golf club and they wouldn't accept him, so he bought the place. Then the old members left and started another. He will never be an elite. However, he wants to be one of them still, and he thinks being president will give him that prestige. Which is wrong, we've had trashy presidents before. TPTB are ecstatic to have him on board distracting everybody, squabbling amongst ourselves. Do you remember 5 years ago when we were furious at how the rich were getting richer at an alarming rate, and the average income was stagnant? Who is talking about that now?

       this "ideal" is why I started to come to this sub but I was dismayed to find it like almost any other sub with political lines drawn. And from an outsider looking i am very surprised to hear here this narative of "he is just one of the guys" This guy literally had a gold throne in his 5th avenue penthouse. I would bet my house on the fact that Trump does not give 2 shits about the common working man. The political class in both our countries is a joke and are willfully complicit in all sorts of illegal shit on a daily basis. We should never forget that.
