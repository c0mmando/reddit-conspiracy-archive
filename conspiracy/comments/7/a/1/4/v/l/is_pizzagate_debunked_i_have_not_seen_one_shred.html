    <div class="md"><p>The extent of it may be overblown, but we have actual convictions and many accusations of elites in politics, entertainment, finance, and other major institutions who were engaging in pedophilia.  It&#39;s definitely something that happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t think of pizzagate as simple kiddy diddling in a pizza parlor. Pizzagate is the overall pedophile slavery epidemic in elite society. That pizza parlor is only one piece of the puzzle. </p>

<p>Child trafficking, generational sex slavery, breeding programs, etc. The elite have a heavy stream of children flowing to them in exchange for money and power.</p>

<p>These children are all raped, some horribly tortured, and all eventually killed once they&#39;ve served their purpose (hours or years later).</p>

<p>That&#39;s the real PizzaGate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to add, The Clinton Foundation does have ties to child trafficking (Haiti is a good example). Not saying Hillary is hand shipping kids to Ping Pong, but certainly child traffickers hover over her foundation like she&#39;s the mother ship. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t debunk pizzagate because there&#39;s nothing to debunk, it&#39;s piles and piles of circumstantial &quot;evidence&quot;, made-up stories and extreme leaps of logic.</p>

<p>Take the emails for instance.</p>

<p>You have a bunch of personal emails from a number of people talking about random things, planning get togethers and generally bullshitting.</p>

<p>So, from those emails, you have people dive into them doing two things:</p>

<p>1) Searching for &quot;creepy&quot; phrases or messages. Since the person looking for messages is already going in with the conclusion that everyone involved is actually talking about having sex with children, anything where someone says something out of context or they&#39;re making a joke or a reference to something they don&#39;t understand has sinister intentions.</p>

<p>2) looking for &quot;code words&quot;. Aside from &quot;Cheese Pizza&quot; being a chan term for child pornography, the source of other code words (&quot;pasta&quot;, &quot;map&quot;, &quot;sauce&quot;) comes entirely from an random 4chan post. Investigators have stretched this to essentially any mention of food or eating to be a secret reference to pedophilia.</p>

<p>Debunking Pizzagate is like debunking Christianity. You can&#39;t do it, because so much of it relies purely on faith. You can&#39;t &quot;prove&quot; to a Christian that Christ wasn&#39;t the son of god.</p>
