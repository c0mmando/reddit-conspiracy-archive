<p>Don&#39;t invest so much time into the political puppet show and all the theatrics that come with it, because that stuff is all bullshit and meant to just take up time and keep people arguing, while the president and government at the highest levels do shady shit behind the scenes...</p>

<p>Stay on your toes as just ALWAYS assume that there is something bigger going on. Use your head, be patient, remain focused.  Disregard any developments in the mainstream media that deal with partisan garbage. </p>

<p>If we wanna beat these people, we can&#39;t fall prey to their psychological tricks and tactics. As paranoid as it sounds, assume every talking head is full of shit, and don&#39;t trust any politicians. Especially at the highest levels. </p>
