       Hmmm.  A former president had an intern blow him under the table, was accused of rape, and never gave it a second thought. - Not one day in jail ever, nor any threat of it...  If, Trump did these things, and if it comes out as a true fact, it will certainly haunt him, but those other pervs will be watching him run for a second term from their jail cells.
      </p>

       I personally like having a constitution and a government to back it, but if our government over the past few decades has proven anything to us, it is that they are untouchable.

       FWIW--and maybe not a lot, because James Patterson's book "Filthy Rich" was the most limited of limited hangouts--Trump tossed Esptein permanently out of MarALago for hitting on a 15 year old.

      </p>
      <p>
       It's worth noting. But it's also worth noting MarALago is reportedly loaded with mid-and-late-teen girls in pretty skimpy white outfits who work there.

       Unpopular opinion (I think).  FWIW, I don't live in the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The following is said as a casual observer of Reddit... and oh my fucking lord, Trump shit is everywhere.  Hillary shit is everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unpopular opinion: Reddit was virtually unanimous in its hate and contempt for Trump.  People spoke regularly about protesting, his poor policy Tweets, and their deep feelings about the trouble he presents for the USA in general.  It got extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
       ... then people started getting sick of it, the USA didn't fold, nor did it succumb to civil war.  Much of Trump sentiment these days in my view, are moderates who might have also decried him in anti-Trump fever that swept across the internet previously.

       But Trump was also the only person to respond to a subpoena for Epstein's court case to testify. Everyone else refused to testify.

       That case was made up for campaigning reasons. Trump even called Epstein out about it, but there is better evidence that he is involved with child trafficking.

       Also trumps top economic advisor Steven Feinberg.

      <p>
       Feinberg owns Cerberus. Cerberus owns dyncorp.

        Dyncorp trafficks children.

       So trump says he's been to the mansion and his top advisor is THE guy who sets up brownstone operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       In case you don't know, brownstone is the killing of children. They do it on a sacrificial stone, they shit their pants when they die. BROWNSTONE.
While they don't still kill them as offerings on stones, the name stuck.
On to Steven Feinberg. He own dyncorp as established above. Dyncorp is the CIAs hand that gets the children and takes pics of them with politicians and cops, ducking.

       Because none of the partisan idiots that propagate reddit nowadays want to admit that every politician, every candidate, every major and influential person that gets to grace the face of mass-media is a bought and paid for puppet. Simply re-iterating what some study group/corporate advertising specialists told him his target demographic likes to hear. No one wants to admit these elites have no interest in serving us, or playing by the rules. No one wants to admit that they view us as cattle and nobody's for our lack of wealth and lack of extreme privilege. No one wants to admit that the entire history of the world has been composed of one group pinning us against each other so they can stay in power. No one wants to admit that their rulers are fans of Thelema and Crowley and other elitest bullshit because it propagates the idea that you're a better person the worse you behave. No one wants to admit that their trusted statesmen regularly engage in human torture, trafficking, and mass murder just to prove their lack of empathy. No one wants to admit that they've been strung along a massive reality show by people who are friends and accomplices behind closed doors, or that they're completely powerless against the mass of people being engineered into compliance and indifferent through careful psychological technique.
It's easier to just point the finger.
