        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The US propaganda machine is in full operation,   and pointing its fat finger at the puny Russian propaganda efforts.</p>

<p>The US declaired war on Russia by trying to shut down Russian naval bases in Crimea and Syria. Russia is fighting back. Now we have a new cold war, which is perfect since the justifications for the war on terror were all proven to be lies, and 9/11 was proven to be a false flag to justify the war on terror. Turns out Russia/Soviet Union are indispensable to trillion dollar defense budgets. The US wants to be global top dog and anyone who doesn&#39;t join us is against us. We live in constant trumped up fear that our global hegemony and the dollar could be undermined. By our mythology, we are the good guys, and the shining city on the hill. Which makes Iran, Venezuela, former Libya etc. the evil enemies.</p>

<p>Remember Wesley Clark? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw</a></p>

<p>Too bad we don&#39;t have a whistleblower yet who has exposed the plan by Obama, Hillary etc. to oust Putin, to take over Ukraine, etc.</p>

<p>What Russia is doing is only to preserve their own self interest. You think they would just roll over? After Napoleon and Hitler? Doubtful. As with Julian, information will be used to undermine the Rogue Empire. Whether its Trump or Hillary, the US in disarray is better for the world than a US that started WWIII in the middle east and now is taking it global.</p>

<p>Follow the money.   If only people would compare the way Israel uses US politicians. By comparison, Russia has very little influence.</p>

<p>Our founders where slavery- the man who wrote the constitution was raping is half sister, who he owned </p>

<p>We bought half our country from napoleon so he could afford to keep committing genocide </p>

<p>Our leaders committed genocide to our natives</p>

<p>Our leaders outlawed liquor to help empower organize crime and then poisoned the ingredients to make moonshine to kill hundreds of thousands of our own people- and they didint stop until they needed a new tax bailout </p>

<p>We lynched blacks, put gays in nut houses, banned Jews from neighborhoods, forced Chinese immigrants to leave their wives in china and work as slaves </p>
