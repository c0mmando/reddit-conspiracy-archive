       The US propaganda machine is in full operation,   and pointing its fat finger at the puny Russian propaganda efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US declaired war on Russia by trying to shut down Russian naval bases in Crimea and Syria. Russia is fighting back. Now we have a new cold war, which is perfect since the justifications for the war on terror were all proven to be lies, and 9/11 was proven to be a false flag to justify the war on terror. Turns out Russia/Soviet Union are indispensable to trillion dollar defense budgets. The US wants to be global top dog and anyone who doesn't join us is against us. We live in constant trumped up fear that our global hegemony and the dollar could be undermined. By our mythology, we are the good guys, and the shining city on the hill. Which makes Iran, Venezuela, former Libya etc. the evil enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember Wesley Clark?

       Too bad we don't have a whistleblower yet who has exposed the plan by Obama, Hillary etc. to oust Putin, to take over Ukraine, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Russia is doing is only to preserve their own self interest. You think they would just roll over? After Napoleon and Hitler? Doubtful. As with Julian, information will be used to undermine the Rogue Empire. Whether its Trump or Hillary, the US in disarray is better for the world than a US that started WWIII in the middle east and now is taking it global.
      </p>
      <p>
       Follow the money.   If only people would compare the way Israel uses US politicians. By comparison, Russia has very little influence.

       We lynched blacks, put gays in nut houses, banned Jews from neighborhoods, forced Chinese immigrants to leave their wives in china and work as slaves

       Can you explain to us why some of what "Khazars" are despised for primarily (Talmudic adherence, money-changing, societal disruption) are good things in the modern age?

       No one is focusing on Russia as a war threat. Russia is as much threat as America is to the world. With that said, America is doing everything to rig elections outside America. Russia is the same, and now they are doing it to America.

       Not to start a war, they want more instability because it gains their interests

       I remember when Trump talked non-stop about ISIS and Muslims, and we have to keep them out of the country. Why do you think he was trying to make people fear them so much?

       Trump knew how to play on the American myths and American fears.   Deep down inside,  people know US bombs have pissed off a lot of people and those people want us dead.   We are scared.

       Just like driving the injuns off the land and settling down on that land.  You bet the settlers were scared till the killed every last injun or rounded them up in concentration camps.
