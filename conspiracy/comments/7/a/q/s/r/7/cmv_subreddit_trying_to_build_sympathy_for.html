    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not knowledgeable on the laws, but certainly its not a crime for pedophiles to discuss in confidence with a therapist regarding their feelings? If so, I&#39;d say that&#39;s understanding enough. Scum like Spacey who did not seek out help to purge these feelings and who actually took action should be punished severely though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they abuse children, they should absolutely be thrown in jail. But if someone is sexually attracted to kids and has never acted on it, everyone would be better off if they could get the psychological help that they need. I don&#39;t say this because I care about the well-being of pedophiles, I say this because it would lead to less kids getting abused.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. As far as I know those with such feelings can already discuss them with therapists and have no fear of legal repercussion or being ostracized. We don&#39;t need scores of these people coming out in public and demanding acceptance, there can be no acceptance of such a condition. There can only be treatment and punishment if they decided to act out on their urges. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. And therapists are mandated reporters in the US, so if they suspect that their client is abusing children, not only are they <em>allowed</em> to break confidentiality, they&#39;re <em>required</em> to</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apart from the pettiness of linking a CMV thread that explicitly is there to have people rethink their stance on an issue: yes. You may harbor all that anger towards pedophiles, but the truth is that we don&#39;t have a good approach to all this. Getting to know the characteristics of potential perpetrators is going to help stop them. Making them afraid of even admitting their condition to professional therapists... that is where things get difficult. There has to be open dialogue about all this but we still pretend that relentlessly hating people who, by the way, aren&#39;t <em>at all</em> happy with their condition is the way to go.</p>

<p>Sure, avenge people. Cheer when a convicted molester is being beat up in jail by people since somehow this rights all the wrongs you could think of. But don&#39;t end up surprised when you find out that you did jackshit to ameliorate those circumstances because you helped strip away the last incentives for making pedophiles come forward and confess to their suffering.</p>

<p>Making groups of people fear for their lives, however derranged and awful they may be, is going to cost the public greatly. Even fewer people talking about it --&gt; more people not getting help --&gt; your child just became the next victim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  It&#39;s scary that some want people jailed, or worse, because of their thoughts. Chances are they were victims themselves and it turns into a vicious cycle.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;m not sure that there&#39;s enough awareness that a child is more likely to be victimized by someone they know and trust, not a stranger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, on some level I understand the more compassionate approach to those that wouldn&#39;t physically harm a child but where is the empathy for the children? Every photo, video, etc. they look at was produced from an abusive situation. Even if it is just animations or thoughts in their mind...This is all a process of normalizing it. 
It&#39;s bubbling at the surface to become the next crusade for &quot;equal rights&quot; in a decadent navel gazing society, propped up by studies that have an inevitable agenda and an exploitation of our empathy. </p>

<p>There is already a movement to call non-offending pedophiles MAPS (minor attracted persons). I remember reading a thread of a known gamer dude on twitter that was outed as a pedo and explained this. Very unsettling. </p>

<p>Mix all that with allowing, if not eventually outright demanding, children to &quot;choose&quot; their gender identity and sexual orientation... seems like a dangerous path to be walking down. </p>
