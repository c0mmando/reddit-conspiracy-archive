       For starters, I've always been fascinated by the parallels between the ancient Sumerian epics and the theories of some astronomers like
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Van_Flandern">
        Tom Van Flandern
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea is there used to be a Saturn-sized oceanic planet between Jupiter and Mars (Tiamat) and it was destroyed in a cosmic battle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Van Flandern traced back the paths of scores of comets and found they converged at that location roughly 2 million years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering that we are in the process of rethinking everything we thought we knew about the timeline of human history, it seems highly plausible that such a major event in the solar system would have been recorded in our most ancient lore.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for how the planet "exploded", that's a whole different matter...

       Don't wanna speak for peyotl but Sitchin is rumored to be an Illuminati type, sent as an "expert" to toss mis-information into the field, give the Official Translation of Sumerian Tablets and all that.

       Could you do a small summary? There are two leading theories in how gravity works and I haven't heard of a third one and would like to hear about it.

       2 main theories of gravity:
       <br/>
       1) Masses exert a pulling force on other masses and move toward each because of this force (Newton)
       <br/>
       2) Masses exert a "deforming" force on spacetime and other masses are caused to move by this deformed spacetime (Einstein)

       The electric universe proponents have this idea that protosaturn was a red dwarf in which the earth inhabited within the plasma atmosphere, until the planets were captured by our current sun, throwing the solar system into chaos. You should check out thunderbolts.info for more. They have a lot of scientific research and theory on YouTube and hold conventions yearly.

       I always thought that saturn and Jupiter were planets ravaged by war. Saturn hit Jupiter with a weapon that drove deep into Jupiter's core, creating what we know as red eye and destroying all life on the planet at the same time by making the atmosphere unlivable. Jupiter on the other hand retaliated by hitting saturn with a weapon that vaporized its surface and unstablized it's gravity. This lead to debris floating out into orbit and forming the rings we see today.

       If you figure out the vectors and momentum of an object in a frictionless environment, you can quite easily project where its heading and also reverse the clock to see where it's been. Rewind 2 million years and they end up in the same spot. Strange?

       If I have a general
       <em>
        belief
       </em>
       on human origin, this is it. I don’t preach it and I don’t necessarily believe every detail of it, but did the most part I just think this makes sense mostly because I’ve always felt, almost instinctively, that we are an introduced species.
      </p>
      <p>
       The summary of it is that the Annunaki landed on earth at Euphrates River and colonised the first settlement of Eden. Their
       <em>
        mission
       </em>
       here was supposedly to mine gold to fix their home planet atmosphere. However the work was tough and environment didn’t suit them and so they genetically created man - an Annunaki-great ape hybrid. We were to be their labour force.
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point they left earth and left us to our own devices. As primitive hunter-gathers we survived. At some other point in time they returned to teach us civilisation and they left again, forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where I think the strongest evidence of this (or something close to this) are;
      </p>
      <p>
       • in ancient texts, including the bible.
• in ancient culture including Sumerian, Aztec, Egyptian, Peruvian, Incan, Australian Aboriginal, and Easter Island.
• in that humankind seemingly stepped away from nomadic, primitivism, and almost within a generation learnt all the sciences and social sciences.
• global megaliths which I could talk about all night, but specifically their alignment and positioning.
• elongated skulls and otherworldly skeletons.
• the missing link of human evolution. 
• humankind’s fused chromosome 2. 
• and as I said above, the simple fact that I just believe humans are an introduced species.

       Many researchers have suggested that the "monsters" depicted in ancient Sumer (and elsewhere) where actually genetic hybrids created during these experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
       The modern "pig" is also said to be created from combining wild boar and human DNA.

       I'm in a place where rodeo and 4H are still active, and I know lots of farmers who would laugh at that pig statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       But my perspective on human DNA manipulation after diving into this stuff for the last 20 years, and interest for ~30, leans more to stoned ape theory than this, though I like to read up on it. My personal feeling after spiritual exploration and psychonautic experimentation is that there are primal metaphors in all this Archon stuff that deal mainly in the inner struggle, metaphorically our "rise from the mud" or our exit from the cave. Celestial Mythos and the ever-expanding history of humans, Oannes and the Apkallu brotherhood - all that, and what we'll continue to find actual evidence of is where I place my "faith."

       Ok so what ive been thinking through my research is we were created by a species and then visited numerous times afterwards by other species that had a hand in altering our DNA at different points in our history. Which would explain the periods of rapid brain growth in humans over different periods of time. Also what do you think about hollow earth theory and how the elites tie back to our alien origins? Idk I feel there is a possibility they are hiding in plain sight or maybe right under our noses. Or the theory that over time they had to interbreed with humans and maybe the annunaki at present are a shadow of their former strength idk you seem to know alot and id love to bounce some questions off ya

       I’m don’t know anything about hollow earth, however Phillip Schneider claimed we have an existing subterranean alien species living here now now in the Tall Greys. I don’t know how much credence should be given there though. I think he was debunked as a liar.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are stories of Annunaki-human breeding though. Forgive me the source right now (probably somewhere in Sitchen’s writings), but the idea is supposed that Annunaki became attracted to our females, developed relationships, and bred with them. This is where the Nephalim supposedly came from.
      </p>
      <p>
       It even goes as far as claim that upon departure of earth humans were supposed to be eradicated with a great flood but an argument ensued and, with Enki as our greatest advocate, it was agreed to leave us alive.

       I think so. I think the modern religions are books translated from cruciform and Hebrew, which were translated from Aramaic, which were translated from the first stone carvings, which told the story of aliens landing on earth and creating mankind. The repeated misinterpretation has lead us to a story of “a god in heaven” when it’s original meaning was probably something like, “visitors from the stars”.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best example of this that I can give is how Sumerians depicted gods. Their symbol for gods (plural) was that of a flying, hovering thing, similar to a gliding bird which flew but did so specifically without flapping it’s wings. This was interpreted in Hebrew as the word “spirits”, which we translate today as the word “god” (singular).
      </p>
      <p>
       Spaceships = Spirits = God (or some variation of that).
      </p>
      <p>
       I must stress, I’m no expert and I have no source of this. This is just my personal thoughts.

       Side Question:
      </p>
      <p>
       There needs to be a distinction between interbreeding and genetic manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       By definition if two creatures can interbreed and have a viable offspring (which is not sterile i.e. mule) they are technically the same species. The term "extraterrestrial" means not of this earth, not necessarily alien. So in theory there could be humans who live their entire lives on other worlds.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this scenario the only leg up they ever had on us was knowledge / technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternately if we could suppose that these "creators" were non human and used something more advanced than their cock &amp; balls to genetically engineer humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is the added twist of not only engineering humans, but imbued the humans with part of their own DNA spawning a new race like the The Sorcerer's Apprentice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this hybrid theory opens up another never ending blood chauvinism where people compete for who has the most dragon blood or wtvr.

       According to what I’ve read it was both. Humans were first created from alien/primate gene splicing. We were created sterile but were given the ability to procreate some time later.
       <em>
        Side note: this is an alternative translation to original sin in the bible where.

      </p>
      <p>
       Once established as a species, the Annunaki took our women as mates creating a second new species, or supposedly the Nephalim.

       The question would be 'why was it trendy' it could have been merely aesthetic with no other motive like chinese foot binding or it could have been a status thing based on an already existent class of people who had such a shape naturally. We know in more down to earth(heh) scenarios people absolutely do go to great lengths to alter their bodies and those of their children to more closely resemble more high status and powerful people in society. ie. the complicated history of hair straightening in the african american community and skin whitening in societies that came under colonial rule by white europoeans. I'm sure there are many other cases of people modifying their bodies to look more like colonizers or rulers for various reasons.

       The Peruvian elongated skulls have a larger cranial volume than we modern humans do as well as a different dental formulation from us, which are supposedly unique to each species. I'm on the trolley right now so i have no web, but i'll post links later.

       All other primates have 24 pairs of chromosomes except for humans which have 23. Our chromosome 2 is a much larger, fused chromosome of two others which contains 242 million base pairs and 8% of our total DNA.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s argued that the fusing of chromosomes cannot occur naturally, and is an act of intelligent intervention.

       So ill type what I've researched that relates to this roundtable. First I would like to start with the dogon tribe in Africa. They go way back and are believed to have originated from Egypt. Anyhow, in the 1930s some anthropologists visited them and asked some questions, they got on the topic of astrology and were astounded at some of the things they heard. The dogon told the anthropologists about their the Sirius cluster back when we thought it was just one star they also compared the size difference accurately between the two stars and claimed that sirius-b was a white dwarf with a 50 year orbit around Sirius-a, they also knew about Uranus and Neptune. Now we come to find out later that all of theur claims have been verified. Again they made these claims before we even knew sirius b existed. Even the orbit of Sirius b comes out to be 50.1 years exactly. Obviously that anthropologists asked where they learned this astrological knowledge, and they said it was given to them by our creators, the nommo/nummo. They depict them as fish like humanoid beings which coincidentally are similar to depictions throughout other cultures, especially mesopotamian cultures. The rest of the creation myth aspects weve learned from them are pretty interesting, but all of this brings me to the enki enlil aspect. Watch or read Mauro Biglino if you have not yet heard of him and are interested in this stuff. Mauro was a prominent translator for the Vatican and some of their most ancient texts. He translated the oldest versions of the bible. Whats interesting is the interpretation, he wad only allowed to interpret the words in the way the Vatican wanted them translated. When he translates the words the way he believes they were meant to be read the bible takes on a whole new meaning. Mauro is not a Christian and thinks the new testament is mainly fiction and that the old testament is a first hand account or diary of sorts from people that were living through an invasion/enslavement of mankind. The idea is that humans are millions of years old as a species and when earth was tiamat it got struck by another planet or ravaged by space war, and this species was on the losing side of the battle and got stranded on earth. The story in the bible also suggests the elohim altered our DNA while they were here. I've even read theories that the elite believe they descend from these bloodlines and that's why they have a divine right to rule in their minds. So all in all I would strongly suggest you all look into Mauro Biglino as well as the nommo and the dogon tribe, sorry if this was poorly put together, dont usually make this huge comments lol

       That would make sense seeing as how mauro translates pre Hebrew texts, because as he explains, most of the important events of the old testament occurred before Hebrew existed as a language. For example, Moses did not speak Hebrew because it did not exist at the time.

       To do this justice, we have to understand that the Hebrew language was passed on as cononants, and they have no idea what vowels were inserted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vowels are the meaning. They give meaning to the sentence, paragraph, and in order to know this Hebrew would have had to exist at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time of Moses, Hebrew did not exist as a language and all scholars/academics know that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the bible is not an accurate thing, but is actually someone's opinion. The opinion of a certain powerful family took precedence over everyone else's. Of course that family was located in the Holy Land because coordination was going to have to take place between religions to some extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are words where up to 70 meanings could be ascertained depending on the vowels.

       That's fucking amazing. I knew about the no vowel things but the way you put it into context makes me really think. I just figured scholar's had a special trick at deriving meaning, but they're mostly guessing.

       When you translate between twoblanguages, there are sometimes words that don't directly translate. Germans might have one word to convey an aversion to socialization, where as in english, it would be the name of some behavioral disorder. It would also convey a label, rather than a meaning.

       Is prophecy being fulfilled, or are powerful men manipulating world events to make it appear so? I think the later. The Templar sect in the masons are manufacturing the end of the world. Will you accept this end as god's return, (nothing we can do about it), or  not fall for it ( and do something about it).

       Have you looked into the book of Enoch? It describes the elohim/annunaki as fallen angels and deterred the ancient isrielites from worshipping these elohim. Mesopotamia literature presented the elohim as good guys but the book of Enoch presents them as bad. There is a great book by Dr Michael Heiser called the unseen realm that goes into great detail about this stuff, very interesting read. He is a Christian tho so if ur adamantly opposed to that stuff it might be a difficult read.

       Definitely not adamantly opposed, I'm spiritual in my own way. But yeah ive seen the book of Enoch, there were other books removed from the bible by the Vatican. There is an overwhelming sense of manipulation, especially apparent when looking at how much the catholic church has to spend on lawyers to defend the pedos

       Yeah, im not religious myself, but like you said im in touch with the spiritual side of things...The gnostic gospels from the Nag Hammadi library that were discovered this past century are another good example of religious texts that were censored. The Gospel of St Thomas is a really good one

       Check out the nag hammadi codices.  They contain the apocrypha (books removed from the bible) and more.. Including fantastic works like the hypostasis of the Archons and on the origins of the world.  These are the texts of the Gnostics who as previously mentioned believe Yahweh to be a counterfeit mimic of a God.  Check out "not in his inage" as well.. A wonderful write up on the Gnostics and their history.

       It just means when they landed in the ocean they stayed there, and created a city. I don't believe they are fish gods. They wear fish like armor, or clothes, but not actually fish people. The annunaki look like much larger versions of you, and I.

       sacred symbols of the dogon is a great read, basically it describes how egyptian hieroglyphs contain references to string theory (dogon written language is similar to egyptian, but the difference is that the dogon still have an oral tradition whereby the esoteric meanings of the glyphs are explained, giving us insight into the deeper meaning of egyptian texts).

       Some historians believe that the hieroglyphs are more metaphorical than straight up this and that.  For example a relief of the pharaoh catching birds with a net could be translated into the pharaoh catching his errant thoughts (bird's representing thoughtforms).  Hieroglyphics are far more complicated than most think.

       "Anyhow, in the 1930s some anthropologists visited them and asked some questions, they got on the topic of astrology and were astounded at some of the things they heard. The dogon told the anthropologists about the Sirius cluster back when we thought it was just one star - - -"
      </p>
      <p>
       If I understand this part right, you suggest the modern science did not know about the cluster - or Sirius B - prior to 30's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Afaik: Sirius B's existence was anticipated by calculation 1844 (F. Bessel) and it was visually observed first time in 1863 (Alvan Clark). Thirty years later, in 1893, a group of French astronomers visited Dogon areas in Mali during their solar eclipse expedition that lasted more than a month.
      </p>
      <p>
       "1930's some anthropologists" refer to works of Griaule and Dieterlen, who've seem to been unaware of the earlier expedition. In a oral culture of the Dogon, there have been 40-50 years of time to pass any information they possibly got from expedition team to next Dogon generations. Including, at the time, the latest astronomical information about the double nature of Sirius. IMHO: No doubt the astronomy and Sirius were important for the Dogon culture. Perhaps because of this news of Sirius were welcomed and eagerly shared forward during the decades before Griaule and Dieterlen visits.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1970's Griaule's and Dieterlen's works were re-popularized by Robert K. G. Temple who expressed the actual and initial claim about the extra-terrestial aspect. Something Griaule, nor Dieterlen never mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later there have been discussions about possible confusion Griaule and Dieterlen may have had, mainly concerning what actual stars the Dogon were referring to, Sirius or Venus or what. It is proposed that the oral heritage varies even amongst the Dogon people themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did not write this in order to disturb your interesting discussion. Just wanted to enlighten the subject with another, perhaps more plausible, point of view. Hopefully you may build up a better theory on updated facts, something Temple so far never managed to do.

       Yeah, true or not there is something to these nummo myths and ancient translations of texts. Like I said we won't know until we know, but I personally believe whatever we learn, humans have had a long interesting relationship with probably multiple different alien species and were most likely seeded on Earth by a race much more advanced then ours. It sure will be exciting to see what unfolds in this age of Aquarius!

       I already posted this on a different subreddit. Anyway this is titled: Possible Geologic Effects on Earth due to Nibiru fly-by.
      </p>
      <p>
       First I've asked myself, what are the known and possible effects of the moon on Earth's present existence as we know it?
      </p>
      <p>
       1: Ocean Tides
       <br/>
       2: Axial tilt allowing for variable seasons through each part of the globe
       <br/>
       3: (Theory) - According to
       <a href="http://archive.is/BVtxS">
        this National Geographic article
       </a>
       , lunar cycle may play a role in Earth's volcanic activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming a brown dwarf will have a gravitational pull exponentially greater than the moon's but at same time be much, much further away, I wildly speculate the geological effects will be somewhat 5 to 10 times greater in each of the 3 "effects" I've listed.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on Zecharia's Sitchin 3600 year Nibiru orbit/flyby interval and assuming the Minoan eruption of 1600BC (circa 3600 years ago from present) was the last occurence, these were notable supporting geologic effect:
       <br/>
       1.) BBC:
       <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2001/glasgow_2001/1531049.stm">
        Giant wave hit ancient Scotland [3600x2 = 7200 years ago]
       </a>
       <br/>
       2.) As a result of the fly-by, Greenland (for argument's sake) may end up having a longitude similar to where southern Canada is at the present; thus Greenland may allow for more arable land during the "summer time". The closest "coincidence" supporting this theory of a major axial tilt, is that the Sahara dessert was once a plush green grassland with river's flowing through it. Unfotunately I can't come across a solid date for it; here's a article by
       <a href="http://archive.is/sCJMc">
        the smithsonian
       </a>
       .
       <br/>
       3.) And of course the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_eruption">
        minoan eruption
       </a>
       around 3600 years, that supposedly played a role, in Europe's first (as we know it) civilization, long predating the Greeks, the sea-faring (thalasocracy) Minoans (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_civilization">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_civilization
       </a>
       ). Interestingly another sea-faring civilization sprung up after this catastrophe, and are credited with gifting the Greeks and Roman our

       </a>
       we take for granted.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm no where or anywhere near a qualified geologist, but when you have mainstream academics, claiming the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonaguni_Monument">
        yonaguni monument
       </a>
       is a "rock formation" you gotta follow the coincidences and come to more logical conclusions.
       <br/>
       If one has link or book, theorizing the effect of a second sun/large orbital body's geologic effect while being relatively close to earth it would be appreciated. When typing "What if jupiter was closer to earth" in search, I only get photoshops of jupiter in the night sky.

       Well, I was hoping for a London vs Vatican round table, but you've picked a subject that I have spent just a little time on. I'm about to head out, so I'm going to give yall a little start and Ill be back later.

       "Myths in which Ea figures prominently have been found in Assurbanipal's library, and in the Hattusas archive in Hittite Anatolia"
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the things I've tried to talk to yall about but got ignored is the Hittites. Everyone here has heard the story of the Khazarians right? Well, what no one has been paying attention to is the connection between the Khazarians and the Hittites. The importance being the Hittites would collect artefacts from their conquering of other peoples... and the Hittites at one point invaded Sumeria. There is some very interesting similarities too between the Anatolians/Scythians and the Hittites. (go visit
       <a href="/r/artefactporn">
        /r/artefactporn
       </a>
       sometime)
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing about the Sumerians if you have to understand they existed for a good long time, so the majority of what we have found is usually from much newer times in Sumer or in the age of the Babylonians or the Akkadians. Do not confuse the Babylonians for the Sumerians, they are not the same thing. My point is many tablets such as the Enuma Elish are actually sorta bastardardized versions of older stories from what is called the archaic sumerian era
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_language">
        Sumerian lang wiki
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, when going through catalogs/collections like
       <a href="http://cuneiform.library.cornell.edu/collections%5BUPenn%5D(http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/dcclt/index.html">
        Cornells
       </a>
       , etc, I think the gold is to be found in the archaic texts. Many tablets sit waiting to be translated, including at Oxford/Cambridge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sitchin: Worked out translations on his own for most of his life. His translations academically have not always stood up (he made many mistakes), but very often his interpretation is different, not necessarily wrong. He is far too quickly dismissed as a quack, but that defense doesn't make him right either. You must also consider the fact that he has been accused (keyword) of being seen in some of the illuminati rituals, and has tried to mislead people  from the real translations to keep the people in the dark. One of his assistants/apprentices is now continuing his work and doing talks sometimes, that at the very least are interesting. Can't remember his name right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nibiru: Some of the older archaic texts talk about "alien astronaut from another planet" type stuff, but I wonder where the first references to Nibiru are. That how you investigate a sumerian word. You just start digging through the collections looking for the oldest version of the word you can find (oldest in my book often being closer to the source of the myth).
      </p>
      <p>
       Egypt/Giza is very relevant because of another town. Sais. The egyptians according to the account of Solon by Plato, had priests in Sais that told Solon about Atlantis and the egyptians were refuges from there, during a cataclysmic flood that happened ~9k years ago (in Solons time, so nearly 11k years ago now). The secrets hidden beneath the pyramids/sphinx are likely to be atlantean.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a couple of different ways of relation between Egypt Sumer from this.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Both the Sumerians and the Egyptians were the Atlantean refugees.
       </li>
       <li>
        The Sumerians were the actual original refugees and spread west, a priestly sect established egypt.
       </li>
       <li>
        They are both refugees from their own "atlantis". The Sumerians from what I call the Tamil Atlantis or from the fertile crecent flood atlantis, and the Egyptians from the pillar of hercules atlantis.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The actual archeological evidence suggests to me the fertile crescent   theory might be the right one. Floods archeologically verified at between ~9-11k years ago caused massive displacement events around the world, including the fertile crescent in what is now the Arabian sea which was much more receeded then. (Keep in mind Dilmun) So the fertile crescent theory goes that the origins of all the main civilizations from that area were from Atlantis in the pre-flood fertile crescent and the Indus valley civilization, egyptian, and sumerians are all offshoots of refuges.

       It's a little hard to explain - I've found my research synchronicities point in this direction... not to say that ALL Egyptians, Canaanites, Basque, etc were aliens/survivors. Just the leaders who raised them out of the darkness, so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truly it looks like a sea-faring network of cities world wide collapsed in a flood and those less civilized or uncontacted peoples before who lost everything and were forced inland, made these more advanced people (giants?) their first kings and gods... but it's literally always those same civilizations and peoples coming up...

       Truthfully, a lot of it relates to the proto-basque cultures and how they intertwine with similar civilzations around the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has been a LOT of forgery regarding Proto-Basque digs... and just, the name shows up so often in my research but I haven't spent a lot of time on it yet. I should do that :\
      </p>

       For example, I was going to not post this yet and went back to the article I was reading and came across this in it:

      <p>
       "“Genetic DNA analysis can trace the ethnic tribal lineage, and thereby land of the origin, of a human being.  Native American tribes contain four distinct DNA groupings, designated A, B, C and D. These groupings are found in Asia but not in Europe or Africa. While 96 percent of all indigenous natives in North and South America fall within A, B, C and D, there was a mysterious four percent, dubbed Group X, which could not be explained.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Type X subjects were not found in the vast majority of tribes, including none in South America. It was also determined Type X subjects arrived in North America 10,000 to 38,000 years ago, later than the other groups.  By far, the highest concentration of Type X in Europe was found in the Basques, a race of Caucasians who live in the Pyrenees Mountains between Spain and France. And the highest frequency of Type X in the entire world was found in the Berbers, a race of Caucasians who live in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco in North Africa.  The Basques and Berbers have long puzzled anthropologists, linguists and historians because they don’t seem to fit into their continental surroundings.

      <p>
       nephilim3“However, independent researchers of the Association of Research and Enlightenment (A.R.E.), followers of Edgar Cayce, have come forward and made a few observations of their own.  Known as the Sleeping Prophet, Edgar Cayce (1877-1945) is considered by many to have been America’s foremost psychic. Throughout his lifetime he performed over 14,000 readings while in a self-induced trance. Although delving into many subjects, 8,976 of his readings, transcribed onto 900,000 pages of notes, were devoted to medical problems, a majority of which were resolved, often advancing current medical technology."

       Most interesting to me about Sitchin is the idea that the Annunaki needed gold to spray in their atmosphere to protect them against global warming..

       He described Geo-Engineering / Chemtrails just with gold instead of aluminum in the 70s.

       Did the Sumerians really know about ancient extraterrestrial chemtrails? What does it mean for what we see in the sky today?

       Big fan of the Nebiru/Zecharia Sitchin theories (that's why I based my sci-fi series largely on them). What's amazing is all the parallels and coincidences you find between ancient cultures. Of course there are the big ones like the pyramids, the creation myths, the importance of snake symbolism. But there are also the smaller things like the commonality of twelve in ancient cultures:

       Personally, I don't know if this stuff is true, but it's fascinating to consider how it could all potentially fit together (which a lot of it seems to). And as a writer, it's allowed for a lot of fun world-building.

       This is the Hidden Hand perspective.
      </p>

       Disclaimer:
      </p>
      <p>
       This was not written for you. This was written by an Illuminati insider, for other insiders who had questions. These insiders came from lots of different programs and projects within the structure and after leaving were finding out that they all had been lied to just as much as the rest of us. So questions were submitted, and this blog was written as the answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shane held many positions within "the Illuminati" where he was taught very much about their system. When he left, he started meeting others who had left programs and projects who were starting to realize that they each had been told their own version of the truth, and that none it was actually the truth. Shane started providing them with answers to questions. To make it easier, someone suggested he put up a blog. So the blog is written by a guy in the know, for others in the know. It was never meant to be public, but got discovered when he mentioned the Blue Avians once. And the rest is internet history.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, and I can't stress this enough, the blog was used as a teaching instrument. It has a start, a method, and an end. It is meant to be read from the beginning, in order, a step at a time. Like any learning course, you need to advance one concept at a time to understand the bigger implications and meanings. Calculus won't make much sense if you haven't taken algebra. Start at the beginning, read one entry, and let it soak in for a day or two. And don't skip the comments, they are just as insightful, if not more, than the entries themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       A word of caution though, it's one of those things that can be pretty heavy on your mind and soul. So tread cautiously but purposefully down this path if you choose. There's no going back.

        Annunaki
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The most confused name this writer knows.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       As it has been presented to the public, this word simply means alien or extra terrestrial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Others believe that the Draco are in fact this race.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        With a slight variant on the name,
       </em>
       the Annunaki,  a race that created one of many versions of humanity, does indeed exist.  Their story is much older than the most recent interpretations suggest.  The most recent is a case of impersonation, by the Draco.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many elements of this translation are correct and many are incorrect, but the source material itself is a Draco creation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word meaning "alien" has caused several races to address themselves as Annunaki when interacting with humans, confusing the name.  A true race, with a very similar name, is being used as a model by the Draco.
      </p>
      <p>
       The true Annunaki race lives on Nibiru. The Draco do not.  These Annunaki once created a human species utilizing an older hominid from earth, the Draco manipulated an already existing human species.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many have received contact with races who call themselves Annunaki and are then forced into arguments with people who know these translations as being a Draconian creation.  This is unnecessary.  The truth is in the middle.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a race of humanoids who look like us in a larger size.  They are benevolent but apathetic or self-centered and they check in on this planet often despite having no authority beyond that gifted to them by the Draco. (This is changing of course)
      </p>
      <p>
       They will have dealings with us again, as the transition sparks a brand new cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their true name is connected to the planet they come from and is not entirely dissimilar to the impersonated name which has become known also as alien.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Names, names, names..
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Annunaki is not their name truly, and other races besides them have called themselves this.  The Draco used both their name - with a slight twist - and their image. One of many clever little mind fucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Draco have also completely erased the presence of some very close friends of the Annunaki.   Many older versions of humans also associate with them often.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apathetic?  They are not cruel, very kind, but they do not meddle.  They leave others to their own business, these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       They do seem to contact those of you who have had close encounters with the Draco, which shows a slight bit of willingness to push back and assist.  Yet they also have made some terrible, although honest mistakes when interfering with other races, and therefor they take a slightly stand-off approach to most other planets.

        Some more background
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Atlantis was a ship.  An alien mother ship filled with many races that landed here very long ago, integrated with the humans here, and a city and then culture grew around the ship.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Enemies of these aliens eventually found them, and a terrible war broke out in this galaxy.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A large earth-like planet that was between Mars and Saturn was destroyed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Earth as a planet was "reset" and the humans and alien refugees from the was continued to live here but under very difficult conditions for a long time.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It was in this traumatized state that the Draco arrived.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A deal was struck where they were given control in exchange for help. It was a trap, and is the root of our control system today.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Everything dealing with the Annunki took place even way before all of the above.

       Hmmm interesting.  I guess like Humanoid, Reptoid or Reptilian can just be another category that extends throughout different civilizations that isn't limited to one specific one.

       In this context demons would be another entity all together.  Aliens being separate from demons. Although each may portray themselves as the other at times, so that complicates things.

       So how do we overcome their rule over us is the question isn't it. Surely they seem to want a violent revolution, but that must mean that path is another trick. How do we peacefully dispose of them. Any ideas other than the slow trickling spread of info such as these round tables?

       Actually, the situation has changed recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a post I made once in response to a question asking why all the pedo stuff is coming out now.  It explains some and link at the end for more.
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple years ago the Draco empire left. They were running the shit and had many projects and programs setup to generate certain powerful human emotions because they used the energy it produced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since they left many of those projects and programs shut down because there was no need for them anymore. This doesn't mean it has stopped, just lessened. But as a result, more and more of it is getting exposed. Its more complicated than just that, but you get the general idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently, the Draco built the control system on this planet. The human elements of the structure is what we'd call the Illuminati or such. They're the minions that do the bidding, but it was always the Draco calling the shots.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the empire left, they handed over control to the Illuminati, who immediately began fighting each other in the power vacuum. You can see this playing out today with all the different factions of the Cabal fighting and exposing each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, they were harvesting our energy. The Illuminati were very much caught up in all that, but not so much getting the same benefits the Draco were. So when the empire left, there wasn't as much a need for it all. I don't think I need to describe it all, we're all very familiar with the sick shit that's been going on. So with those types of programs dissolving, the truth of what's been happening has started being used against certain factions. Also people trapped in that crap are more free now to come out than before.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also another layer in between that really strange. They're called the parents, and they were the interface between the Draco and the Illuminati. They are mostly gone now too, but still a problem for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just posted a nice write up that describes more of what we can expect. Check it if you're interested. Feel free to ask questions.

       Totally agree with these sentiments actually. It's like choosing the future of humanity. On one hand is the darkest timeline, something similar to warhammer 40k in a way I'd say, vs something peaceful like the idea most cultures have of heaven. Thanks for the info brother, keep up the good work.

       Well that blog is a hell of a rabbit hole. I read the first ~70% of it including many comments (which I advise anyone considering to read it to check out, because they contain more writings from the author than the actual blog posts).
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't help but notice that he contradicts himself on something so fundamental that it discredits his entire story. So I find it hard to believe. Very interesting and enlightening nonetheless. He is either the GOAT whistleblower or a brutally sophisticated larper (or maybe just batshit crazy).

       So glad you're enjoying it.  I think it's by far the greatest rabbit hole out there.  The kinda thing that can affect your view on all the other rabbit holes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read it several times over the years and always find more connections and understanding of references or concepts I didn't get before.  Good stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can I ask what the contradition is you see?  So few have read the blog it's hard to find people to talk with about it :)

       Well one minor discrepency is when he talks about his background. He says he told his parent's about his "summer programming" at "his aunt's" house. They respond by accusing him of lying and saying he drove his aunt insane. His mother is a supposed ex-member of the 13 bloodlines. She is obviously in the know. Why would she treat him that way?
      </p>
      <p>
       The big contradiction though is when he talks about the universal law of free will (or whatever he calls it). The Draco's are not violating it because they recieved permission from earlier generations of mankind and also are informing us (subliminally?) about their plans through various means. Our passivity supposedely indicates consent.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Unfortunately no one besides us have the right to stop them.  Their violations of free will and natural laws are handled by the universe not a galactic police force or legal system.  In those courts what they are doing with this planet would be considered frowned upon but still technically legal.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So they are supposedly not violating our free will. But he says one (or more) of the life extension methods used by the parent's involves babies. He doesn't state what they do with them but one would assume they are taking their blood and/or harvesting energy from them. Whatever they do to the babies I can't imagine how a baby could consent to this. Passivity doesn't really indicate consent when it comes to babies.  In fact it's reasonable to say that if a baby starts to cry when you do your business with it, that would mean you are violating its free will. It has no other way to communicate its unwillingness to participate.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also says he was offered a job to telepathically influence people's actions. How is that not a violation of free will?
      </p>
      <p>
       How is MK Ultra mind control programs not a violation of free will? Even if consent is given at the beginning of the process, one would imagine that intense torture would cause the affected person to beg for it to stop. At which point free will is violated if the torture is continued.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I don't see how one being could give consent for the actions performed against another, even if our social and legal norms tell us that's the case (e.g. parents, ancestors, legal guardians).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there are more discrepencies regarding free will (and perhaps regarding other things as well) but none come to mind right now . I would have to give the material a second reading. Perhaps my understanding of the actual mechanics of free will is just flawed but I can't see how any of these things don't violate free will.

       Well said my friend.  I think it would be great if all peoples and non-peoples read your statements about free will.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spent a lot of time pondering this concept too, not sure I understanding it any better yet. But my feelings on the matter are right in line with your comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the author of the blog, Shane, he feels the same as you do.  That what the Draco were doing is a violation of free will, and in many ways, just like you pointed out. This is why he could never fit in with any of their programs and projects.  It's why he got moved around so much and was given the moniker "the ruiner".  His conscience always got in the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I've gathered listening to his interviews after, it seems nobody "out there" was really aware of the details.  The "legal" aspects of it were similar to how we have a House and Congress and Judicial system, but behind that is a sinister and hidden force always doing dirty deeds in the dark.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems recently at lot more attention has been focused on our planet and I've heard him speculate with others that it might even be part of the reason the Draco left, because word was getting out of what they were really doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far a Shane's family, I also can't imagine his mother wouldn't understand what was happening.  Unless she really was that far removed from it all.  He said she was never brought into the folds of it all because of her rebellious and conscience spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But all the dirty details aside, thanks for your words here. I hope more read them because I feel its important we all hold a mirror up and try to deal with all aspects of ourselves, including how we perceive the concept of free will for ourselves and others.

       So, I'd like to add a piece to the 'free will pie'  as it were. There's the idea that, there exist multiple levels of reality above us and that there's actually an elaborate pre-incarnation process that goes on before a soul actually ends up incarnated. This is where the really nasty alleged free will twist is said to happen and actually, if even remotely true, gives us the association of devils with contracts and even the very concept of souls being stolen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, the idea would be that in order to incarnate on a planet you have to make an agreement with whoever rules that planet on the level that oversees such decisions. The entities in charge of earth, being general assholes have a particularly nasty setup in the contracts they require of souls that want to drop in and spend some time on our lovely sphere. The biggest one, however is the one having to do with memory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, everyone or almost everyone 'agrees' prior to reincarnation to have their memory wiped and lose all knowledge of all prior existence or history and conscious knowledge of any pre-existing agreements that have been made this is coupled with a bunch of other agreements that involve 'agreeing' to being subject to the risk of free will violations while physically incarnated. So, that right there allows a tremendous amount of leeway with what's done to people down on the surface because they 'agreed' to a whole bunch of ball and chain clauses that limit them without even knowing about it. 'The devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he doesn't exist' if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allegedly, that by itself isn't really enough to for some of the nastier free will violations, but the next part involves tricking or convincing people to do things actually 'of their own free will' so that the authorities upstairs can point to those actions in order to get permission to do what would otherwise be 'against the law'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the really wild idea of soul capture following death. So everyone's memory is wiped prior to incarnation and then all their life they're indoctrinated and programmed into false belief systems, when they die they end up in a situation that most aren't prepared for and things show up and try to trick them into agreeing to things they really shouldn't be agreeing to. Apparently, there's a whole process for retrieving all past memories etc. and people get caught before they can do it, fed a bunch of bullshit about karmic debt etc. and convinced to agree to reincarnate with all that that entails. You end up with a weird recycling system where people aren't ever actually able to comprehend what's going on because they've been denied access to the full picture and an elaborate system of smoke and mirrors has been erected to trick them into agreeing to things they shouldn't agree to. Since this all technically started with free will agreements in the first place, the nasty tricks are allowed because the nasty tricks where agreed to at least in principle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course you also have weird ideas like people actually being multidimensional entities where parts of them exist outside of time as we understand it, so under that framework the person down here on earth or even a newly disincarnated soul might very well just be a tiny fraction of a larger personal structure that primarily exists outside of the weird shenanigans alleged to be going on down here on earth with earth as some sort of really really fucked up game that's a bit of a puzzle to resolve from the higher points of view, but a game none the less.

       Basic idea is that it used to be a paradise and people came here all the time for tons of reasons, then new management took over and no one new came here except for the very stupid and the very brave. The few who managed to figure out a way to get out even from under the veil of ignorance probably weren't particularly keen on coming back given the risks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Supposedly, there are also people who come in given the risks because they're part of an effort to weaken the system and assist in changing management. Presumably, things like Bodhisattva would be the types of entities that would drop in despite circumstances.

       Not everything is a trick. You're supposed to incarnate without any memory. That's what gives life meaning. The true trick is influencing the newly incarnated with making the wrong choices. That's why a lot of this revolves around the media, entertainment industry and so on.

       I think you're right, but a. there's degrees of possible loss of memory. You can imagine a situation where the loss of memory is less profound than ours is and b. you can see how if such a process isn't explicitly put on lockdown to prevent meddling it could be hijacked. You can have a hypothetical situation where the re-incarnation rules are different for different domains and ruled by different interpretations of whatever universal law is the overriding determinant of what is and isn't allowable. The fact that we're stuck down here in ignorance makes us easy pickings for anyone who knows more of the big picture than us and is interested in hindering the rate at which we discover it either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there's like a thousand narratives and counter narratives so I was just sharing one wild one I'm fond of because it makes things even weirder than the trite we incarnate here because we want to be here one, which is technically true if free will is a thing, but figuring out how free will could be twisted into something decidedly un-free is an interesting thought experiment, at least for me.

       This round table reminded me of a video I'd seen about a year ago where Arizona Wilder talks to David Icke about her time as a Ritual Mother for Draco Illuminati rituals. She speaks about Sitchen being a feared Illuminati misinformer. Really interesting interview. Long, but sheds so much light on this topic.

       Here's a link to the spot in the video, but I suggest watching it all:

       You were right though, it can weigh pretty heavily. The claim the Ra material was another manipulation is probably the hardest thing for me to digest. Ive put a lot of stock in that one, I just don't see how any negative spin could outweigh the benefits that the Ra materials provides people with. I am also curious to see why the guy, and a few others, have a beef with the New Age movement, more specifically what they think it is doing to continue to illusion. It's a shame it was written a few years ago. On that note the odd predictions the guy made about 'the wave' haven't seemed to pan out with drops its credibility a bit.

       Yeah, I hear ya.  He had good quote once in an interview where he said, "The truth shall set you free, but first it'll piss you off."
      </p>
      <p>
       It is quite the rollercoaster. In regards to all our materials being corrupted, he's made the remarks more than once about not throwing out the baby with the bathwater.
      </p>
      <p>
       He understands well that its difficult to come to grips and made sure to emphasis that lots of truth is still in those materials.  Mostly focus on the concepts and less on the details, that's where they mostly muddy the waters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know the Ra material other than the lectures Ive heard or stuff from Wilcock, so I can't comment much about it.  Just be wary of any parts that have you giving you power to someone else or putting others above you.  Mostly they would twist thing in way where you end up relying too much on another authority or getting constricted into closing out other ideas or beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is mostly where concerns about the new age stuff come in.   It can be trouble if people ate waiting for some higher power, aliens, or spirit, or whatevs to change things or fix things for them.  The new age type stuff where arch Angeles are coming "soon" to enlighten us or ascend us or were gonna go to 5d, just you wait, no need to do anything, just wait.  I know that's a terrible generalization, but you get the idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny, kinda sounds like his "wave" talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although, I do wonder a lot if all the craziness happening in the world now has to do with it. I don't know, but I think about it a lot.

       Thanks so much for sharing your thoughts.  It great to have other to discuss this with.

       "Woke" is knowing you are the source of all existence. "You are the One, Neo." And then learning how to co-create your reality back to harmonic intervals instead of the disharmonic chaos you birthed yourself in. This is God's Video Game, where you are one of the many Avatars of Conciousness. We are just now learning how to
       <em>
        truly
       </em>
       and beneficially affect the quantum field/matrix. This matrix is not the "enemy", nothing is truly the "enemy" because we are all the same thing, playing on different "sides" of forces. This matrix has just been heavily minced with mis-truth and illusionary distractions, which are fun unti you hit a certain point, as humanity is now. We are transcending into a higher Octave of existence, where negatively-oriented, self-serving traits such as greed and manipulation etc can not exsist vibrationally. We are watching the transition now, just the beginning. How it plays out is directly up to you and your quantum assumtions of the future-presence. We are all the "ONE" so we each have our own "path", yet we all end up at the same spot: The SOUL seat. Sole, Sol, One, "Son/sun of God". You are that One.,
      </p>
      <p>
       "Believing" =/= Knowing, which is why religions are a poor perversion of this truth. Placebo can not be manufactured. Faith cannot be "hoped for". You will know when you know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Decided to post this and see what resonates, or which belief systems I have offended, and how I can help fellow humans dissove their own personal prisons. We are different 'Cells' of the same existence. Can one (or a small majority of) braincell(s) cause a cascading effect on others in a beneficial, logical, and truthful way? Look up the 100th monkey effect and see how it pertains to human consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a small scale, It's like changing the plasticity of your brain, One group of braincells understands that starting a new, healthier habit will be better in the long run, but is faced with the overwhelming discomfort/pain of the other braincells that have to change/grow/adapt to the newer, healthier paradigm. Which is why habits are so hard to break and create. our human brain is a microcosm of our collective mind. Only need a few persistent braincells to start the domino effect on enlightenment, and the surrender of lower-logical structures/assumtions of reality, so they can be "washed away/transmuted" into "higher octaves/higher levels of order". Thus the "death" and "ressurection" of humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just seeing what resonates, this is all I got for now. Thanks for reading

       Whether it be Planet X, Nibiru, Nemesis, whatever you want to call it, I don't understand why the 'conspiracy' subreddit is so quick to call it bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's look at the indicators.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Every ancient civilisation leaving writing and legends about cosmic cataclysms being a regular thing. Some of them even going so far as to have their whole society revolve around tracking them.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         NASA going from 'Planet X is bullshit' -&gt; 'There might be a planet x' -&gt; `There is a planet x we just don't know where it is yet' - &gt; 'Our sun might have a binary twin'.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Compelling evidence from whistle-blowers and investigators that billions have been spent over the last few decades building underground bases/cities in the USA and all over the world.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Revalations, Mayan astronomy, The Law of One all indicating that the next one is around this time.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Solid archaeological evidence continuing to surface of previous cataclysms (Hancock)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Increased erratic behaviour of natural disasters and climate change, with evidence that the magnetic field of large celestial bodies influences these things.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Now one of these points isn't cause for concern. But all of them, when viewed together, seem to indicate that this threat is real and it's coming. And here we all are arguing over bullshit, calling each other shills, and labelling everything a psyop.

       All of those bullet points can be countered by understanding orbits. It is absolutely impossible for a planet to orbit the Sun in such  way that we can't see and be on a collision course with us.
      </p>
      <p>
       ?NASA going from 'Planet X is bullshit' -&gt; 'There might be a planet x' -&gt; `There is a planet x we just don't know where it is yet' - &gt; 'Our sun might have a binary twin'.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just bullshit. NASA has not claimed anything remotely like this, except the first statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that this does not take into account the fact that we can infer the existence of celestial bodies from their gravitational effects and nothing makes us think Planet X exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       This theory is about as mathematically sound as the Earth being flat. Grouping this "conspiracy" with the real deal only hurts the movement. That's why we should shy away from it. "The CIA is doing stuff behind our back" - good conspiracy. "A planet we never saw will hit us and destroy all civilisation" - bad conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, even if the planet exists, there is nothing we can do to prevent the end of the Earth. There is no need to panic now, when we can panic when we will actually see Planet X with our naked eye.

       I'm seeing some go on about literal demons and Satan lurking about in this world so I'm not sure if this place is a joke or not. Government conspiracy and coverups? Sure, I believe that. Lizard people/demons/planets crashing into us seems like too much.

       tbh, it sounds far stretched, but not to crazy when you begin to read the bible and gnostic texts. I was never religious, but the more I read these old texts, I understand where all these theories are coming from that deal with the supernatural, aliens, lizards and soul trap things.

       Wasn't it the sumerians that wrote that the planet is full of creatures that come to harvest humans when the planet comes near?  A culling would reset the world, giving it 10000 years to build up again for the next orbit.

       I've read Sitchin's work, but it's been a while...but basically that the highly eccentric kepler orbit of planet X allows them to visit earth on a time interval and that all sorts of shit has gone down when they do so.  They essentially had engineered/created humans as robots/slaves to mine for them at one point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'culling' i think is mostly tales of impact events and floods that coincide with planet X, which now mainstream science admits there is evidence of periodic flooding that triggers mini ice ages, likely from impact events.

       Hang on a second though, saying there might be another planet out there that we don't know about yet, compared to, there's a planet we don't know about that will destory Earth, are two entirely different things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please correct me if I'm wrong, as I'm no expert here, but I thought the whole Planet X conspiracy thing was about Planet X being on a collision course with Earth and that it's gonna wipe us all out, or something like that?
      </p>
      <p>
       A planet that we don't know being in our solar system, I can 110% get on board with that, it's actually very likely/probably and not a deep conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       A planet being on a collision course with Earth, well that's much more difficult to buy into. I've said to people claiming this for years, like the recent September viral news that we were all gonna die, I kept telling people if a Planet was that close to Earth and posed a risk to us, we'd see it coming to us way before it hit us.
      </p>
      <p>
       So which is it, possible unknown planet or the latter + it's on a collision course and going to destory Earth?

       No, I don't think they'd tell us, I'll give you that, if bunkers are being made, they can't save everyone and if such a cataclysmic event occurred then it would make sense for them to keep things hush hush to prevent an uprising or people tyring to break into facilities they've made to protect the rich/elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said I've only just YouTubes Nibiru and Chemtrails, granted, I'm not far into the videos but it's stuff like this that SCREAMS out 'FAKE' to me and discredits the entire scientific community.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may just be watching a poor video but this guy is saying that because these 'chemtrail clouds' have a 'sunny glow' behind them when the sun is on the other side of the sky, well that's just horse shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone with two brain cells knows that's not how light works. it spreads, that's why you can see the sun in the sky when you look north and turn directly south and it's still LIGHT. The way the light reflects off these clouds is normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not dismissing the whole nibiru thing, honestly, I'm curious. I just think claiming chemtrails can hide a planet is silly. You wouldn't have to have chemtrails in one area, you'd have to have them all over the world at the same time, most chemtrails I see aren't big enough to hide the sun, never mind any other planet in close proximity to us. It just doesn't make sense and goes totally against scientific knowledge.

       Fair point.  One thing I have noticed, up here in Canada, is that the geoengineering sprays are usually deployed near cities, toward the sun, at sunrise and sunset.  Seems suspicious to me.  Why near cities, and why target the rising and setting sun?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe 100% that chemtrails are to prevent us from seeing anomalies and thus our panic.  Also, the sun's azimuth has been off for years.  Sun rising and setting too far north or south.  They can't hide this with their silly sprays.  How classy of them.

       It's kind of both. Astronomers around the world keep finding evidence of another planetary body that interacts with our solar system, even NASA admits it's there. The conspiracy part comes into it because the more you read into our ancient history, the more indications there are that periodically our planet is affected by other celestial bodies to a cataclysmic degree. This knowledge is hidden from people for the reason of various adgendas. As a side note, it may not hit us but the magnetic effects of celestial bodies passing close to one another means huge geological turmoil on the surface of our world.

       Do you at all know what you're talking about?  Have you seriously never heard of a highly eccentric Kepler orbit?  Do you understand how comets work and why we only see them on specific time intervals?

       You don't even seem to understand the basis of the stories of antiquity he mentions.  Show me where they state that it actually collides with earth every X amount of years.

      <p>
       They infer that it passes near us every X amount of years and that it's presence sparks geological events (ie; earthquakes, impact events caused by asteroids that pass through with it, etc....or in the Sumerian's case; visitation from the Annunaki)

       I've long felt that instead of looking for "ancient astronauts," we should be looking for ancient humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any evidence I've seen for the former seems theoretically consistent with the latter, and an advanced collection of humans guiding the development of less advanced human societies seems far more likely than alien visitation.

       Albert Tarantola was a highly respected geophysicist at
       <em>
        Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris
       </em>
       who also taught at Princeton and Stanford and was one of the inventors of Inverse Theory. He thought there was an advanced civilization before Sumer before the last big glacial melt in what is now the Persian Gulf and was accumulating funds to perform a shallow high resolution seismic survey in the Gulf to look for the ruins when he passed. He did not publish much of his material in this area because it was highly unfashionable amongst his colleagues. There is a small amount still on his preserved web site including this paper:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If anybody knows of his students pursuing this work I would be very interested to see it.

Zecharia Sitchin translates that the Archons or Annunaki, flew around in black cubes.  I have seen a black cube UFO.  If anyone ever sees one, please report it in my subreddit, r/BLACKCUBEUFO.  Thanks!  I will sit back and read all the great comments in this thread now.

       So is there any empirical evidence for the existence of planet x? when is that supposed to hit us again? Because I'm pretty much 1,000 percent sure that there would be legit papers and measurements for an event like this. Not just poorly made videos and cheesy paperback books.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean other legit conspiracies are often taken down this way. Explosives in the towers for example... published and peer reviewed. There is not a global science conspiracy I'm sorry... that's what it seems to hinge on, and such an extraordinary claim needs extraordinary evidence. Seems like alot of story telling and a whole lot of nothing burger

       I read “Nothing in this book is true but it’s exactly how things are” back in 1997. It explains how there are microscopic inter dimensional space ships inside a chamber in the Sphinx which can be activated using star tetrahedron technology which is some sort of interior mechanism anyone is capable of activating through meditation. I think I’m going to read the book again. It’s excellent in my opinion.

       Simplest research exposes Sitchin, just like Erik van Daniken, as Rockefeller stooges. I am disappointed in the inability of this sub to shake these poisoned theories off and see clearly. Is it so hard to see that the entire UFO agenda and alien origins of man are Hollywood driven? This crap will lead you nowhere at all. It only induces into your mind inferiority of humans, and this is the aim.

       Well, it's not that simple. Hollywood places real things or concepts into it's movies and disguises it as entertainment. On some level, they are trying to get people to think that alien origins are fantasy (by associating it with entertainment 1st and foremost). Alien origins are real but good luck piecing the story together. Most people are not capable of this.

       Nice, there is a lot of info (theories) in here (about niibiru and enki/enlil) and im sure some of it is true but just how much is there disinformation about this and why ? Is there a bigger secret behind all of this... i wonder what could it be.

       End of discussion.

       I can't believe there is actually a thread here on this nonsense - hasn't anybody even bothered to check this guy out?.. What I really wanna talk about is the first link in the list of round tables - the Archon nonsense, presumably written by the exact same people who hired Sitchin.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are currently living in virtual reality, or more precisely a consciousness-created construct. The Hindus call it "Maya." When the Bible tells you that the real world is Heaven, which I hope is obvious - again it's telling you that where you are not is all a test.
      </p>
      <p>
       There ARE no Archons - or, more accurately, YOU are the "Archons."
      </p>
      <p>
       You were created "In The Image Of God," meaning given the power to Create Reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why so much effort is expended to fill you with fear, lust and greed - so that you generate negative reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to realize that you are far more powerful than the people doing this to you. YOU are connected to God's Creative Force - YOUR power is INFINITE. THEY do not have it - which is why they have to resort to rituals and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       They fear the day you find out all this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess that day is now. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, you are now concluding Day 26 of the collapse of evil worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
       More will be happening shortly. The entire worldwide system of evil is three weeks into total, irreversible collapse. Free fall. God has taken over. On October 13th.

       THANK YOU! This really needed to be said. There are so many out there running around with false information and false beliefs due to questionable sources. Even the Annunaki themselves debunked Sitchin. &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       The Gnostic stuff is pure garbage and I've seen how it's affected people. People love following and believing in fantasies because it's something for them to fight against.

       I highly suggest the Earth Chronicles by Zecharia Sitchin.  It's a great alternative source that can be used to compare to other sources.  At the end of each Earth Chronicle book he comes to some fantastic conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the first book, the 12th Planet, he posits that their is a binary star in our system on a huge elliptical orbit.  Those from this planet have enslaved and altered us for their mining operations.  All fascinating stuff that he goes into great detail.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the second book, Stairway to Heaven, he discusses the story of Gilgamesh.  How he believes he is part divine (alien) and wishes to return to the stars where they originate.  It's a story about how Enkidu (an AI/Robot) and Gilgamesh make their way to a rocket ship and try to leave Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wars of Gods and Men details many of the battles that took place between humans and their slavers.  It goes into the drama between Marduk, Thoth, Enki and Enlil.  Their lineages and the actions they took.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Lost Realms is fantastic.  Sitchin says that Thoth left Egypt and came to start the Meso and South American Civilizations.  Talks about the pyramids, alignments and their mythologies.  He also lines up at the end of the book how there are two myths discussing the same event from two sides of the planet.  In the Bible it is said there are 22 hours of day and in the Americas, it was night for 22 hours.  He tries to pinpoint when this occurred and if it had anything to do with Niburu swinging by.
      </p>
      <p>
       So many more book in the series and so much more depth.  It's a fantastic read and actually is where I started in my journey.  I was trying to world-build a game/story and here I am almost twenty years later deep in the hole.

       The annunaki stories are the first religion known to man. All other religions come from it. Creation of man, through the wars in heaven everything is touched on here. I do not really believe in nibiru in the way we accept it. I'm thinking maybe a traveling ship , so large its considered a type of planet. Maybe, multi dimensional. You would get more truth out of the annunaki tablets than any modern day religion by far.

       All of those bullet points can be countered by understanding orbits. It is absolutely impossible for a planet to orbit the Sun in such  way that we can't see and be on a collision course with us.
      </p>
      <p>
       ?NASA going from 'Planet X is bullshit' -&gt; 'There might be a planet x' -&gt; `There is a planet x we just don't know where it is yet' - &gt; 'Our sun might have a binary twin'.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just bullshit. NASA has not claimed anything remotely like this, except the first statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that this does not take into account the fact that we can infer the existence of celestial bodies from their gravitational effects and nothing makes us think Planet X exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       This theory is about as mathematically sound as the Earth being flat. Grouping this "conspiracy" with the real deal only hurts the movement. That's why we should shy away from it. "The CIA is doing stuff behind our back" - good conspiracy. "A planet we never saw will hit us and destroy all civilisation" - bad conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, even if the planet exists, there is nothing we can do to prevent the end of the Earth. There is no need to panic now, when we can panic when we will actually see Planet X with our naked eye.

      <p>
       Well, it's not that simple. Hollywood places real things or concepts into it's movies and disguises it as entertainment. On some level, they are trying to get people to think that alien origins are fantasy (by associating it with entertainment 1st and foremost). Alien origins are real but good luck piecing the story together. Most people are not capable of this.
