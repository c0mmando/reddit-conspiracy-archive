      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The FBI's behavioral analysis unit gave a detailed assessment of Lanza's mental state and found he shared many of of the same characteristics and behaviors with other active shooters and concluded he "had an interest in children that could be categorized as pedophilia," an internal briefing document states.

       Kids have less blood higher heart rates high breathing rates less fatty tissue weaker immune systems and it is harder for their bodies to reach homeostasis. Also kids tank harder and faster then adults making it more difficult to tx them in dramatic events again due to less blood reserve.

       If that were the only oddity I might agree.  Not one picture of even Lanza entering the school.  No proof of any deaths.  Super Bowl performance looks suspiciously like a bunch of the supposedly killed kids.  The medics examiners “crashing down on our heads later” comment.  The changes they made to make it where no one could investigate the children’s “deaths”.  The websites set-up before it occurred using Victoria Soto’s name. Using one picture of Adam Lanza to make two pictures.  I could keep going if you like.

       Hmm. Well, I was in the Army for 4 years, during which time I trained on and fired multiple weapon systems countless times. Trust me, it isn't all effortless like in video games and movies. This kid (no doubt fresh from a particularly heated bout of COD on Xbox Live) says he shot a gun once in his life, but could have carried out the alleged crime at Sandy Hook. And this based on... his confidence. Well just excuse me, but I find that to be a dubious proposition at best.

       You make it sound he was shooting at targets attempting to break contact at a long distance. It was school kids sitting in a corner because they are terrified, not exactly a difficult target to hit.

       No, when I say "range" I also include close quarters/room-clearing ranges, these mock-up houses with multiple rooms and targets inside (some moving, some sitting still). We called them shoot-houses, and we did TONS of them before deploying. It's simply not as easy as an inexperienced shooter tends to think. Confidence has fuck-all to do with it (well, maybe a little bit to do with it, but very little).

       He wasn't clearing rooms in the school because there was no threat. He was moving through the building and killing easy to hit targets. Want to know how hard it is to hit those targets? Not at all.

       talking about?? I was simply stating what my experience is with shooting at targets in a room, as opposed to the kid who claimed that because he is confident, and has shot a gun once, that he could have carried out the alleged shooting. Your response is a fallacy, pal. And at the risk of committing a fallacy myself, are you implying that Adam Lanza was Special Forces? haha (see, I can be obtuse as well, bud)

       You're talking about your impressive experience in shoot houses like that has anything to do with what actually would have happened with the Lanza case. Yes, any monkey that has a working trigger finger can throw enough lead at non aggressive targets at close range to kill them plain and simple.

       I'm glad you found that impressive, but I wasn't trying to impress anyone lol and what you're saying is simply not true. It isn't impossible, but it is extremely unlikely that Adam Lanza (assuming he was even a real person) could have done the alleged task. We probably better agree to disagree on this.

       Because when you're acting alone, are under significant time constraints, and seeking the highest body count possible, shooting victims multiple times makes perfect sense. The more likely explanation is a fully automatic weapon operated in burst mode was used.

      <p>
       That's bullshit. Lots of killers have 100% kill ratios. Maybe if you qualify it as a single shooter with more than N victims, you could argue he has the greatest kill ratio.
      </p>
      <p>
       But most mass murderers weren't shooting six year-olds trapped in a room. Six year-olds hiding in a bathroom. Shooting them over and over until they stopped screaming.

       I think the shooter legitimately thought he was "saving" those kids from a lifetime of manipulation and brainwashing at the hands of adults... at least according to the only interview in the FBI files with someone he talked to a lot.

       Adam Lanza probably didn't even exist, and he certainly didn't shoot anyone. Unanswered
       <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2015/12/33-unanswered-questions-on-sandy-hooks-3rd-anniversary.html">
        questions
       </a>
       from Sandy Hook:
      </p>
      <p>
       "How was a skinny 19-year-old boy with no military training capable of killing 26 people clean while injuring none?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was there no evidence of blood? A total of 26 fatalities (children and adult) would produce at least at a conservative estimate 20 gallons (75 liters) of blood. Thus would require a concerted blood cleanup (blood is considered a biohazard in this type of situation), yet when Sofia Smallstorm asked who did the cleanup, all the departments were ignorant of it and even claimed that no one did the cleanup.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does the Sandy Hook shooting crime not exist on the FBI 2012 crime report?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does the tax accessor’s website shows the victims’ families got free houses on Christmas day when all Government offices are closed?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does the Sandy Hook Timeline of Evacuation not match the video evidence from the trooper’s car stationed at the Sandy Hook Elementary School car park?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was there an active shooter drill at around the same place and the same time as the Sandy Hook event?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are people walking around the Sandy Hook fire house in circles like a movie set? Why was there such a lack of urgency in the emergency personnel who were responding for many hours after 10am when people were still unaccounted for (e.g. nurse Sally Cox who claims she hid in a closet for 4 hours until 1:15pm)?
      </p>
      <p>
       If Sandy Hook Elementary School was a legitimate and operational school at the time of the event, why is there evidence that the school shut in 2009 due to asbestos, was reinspected in 2011, and was flooded again with Hurricanes Irene and Sandy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why were the entire school grounds of what we were told was “Sandy Hook Elementary School” demolished and rebuilt? Does this remind you of how the metal scraps from 9/11 were immediately shipped off to China before they could be examined for evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did Town Clerk Debbie Aurelia and Connecticut State Attorney Kevin Kane refuse to release the death certificates and the names of the “victims”?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did Connecticut officials conspire to pass an unprecedented bill banning FOIA requests and access to death certificates and other information, normally part of the public record as a matter of course for centuries?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why were all the ambulances parked at the fire house away from the crime scene?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why were there so many black and silver (Government-type) cars around the school and fire house in place before the event?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do so many of the victims’ family members appear to be acting, smirking, giggling, snickering and outright laughing after the event?
      </p>
      <p>
       How does one explain the highly strange behavior of Wayne Carver, the chief medical examiner and coroner? Why did Carver say that “You can control a situation depending on your photographer, and I have very good photographers”? Why did Carver say that “I hope the people of Newtown don’t have it crash on their heads later”?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did Lieutenant Paul Vance threaten to prosecute as a crime anyone who reported information that contradicted the official narrative?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did no one sue the school or the estate of Nancy Lanza?
      </p>
      <p>
       How is it that no parent wanted to see the dead bodies of their children in the school?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why were all the funerals conducted with closed caskets?"

       Sandy Hook is actually one of the more blatant fake/staged crises ever perpetrated. It just takes a little earnest and un-prejudiced looking into it to see the truth. I recommend the documentary We Need To Talk About Sandy Hook (2015) to anyone who has not yet watched it. It blows the official narrative out of the water. It was one of the most eye-opening experiences of my life, as I used to be the type of gullible, complacent, self-assured moron who made fun of the whole Sandy Hook Truth movement. Luckily I pulled my head out of my ass and actually looked into it.

       I didn’t read through it, but the quote by OP seems to be just a profile, no actual evidence. When I’m watching anything crime related and they mention “he/she didn’t act the way normal people would when in X situation” is when I start rolling my eyes and questioning everything else they’re presenting.

       Yeah... The only pedo claims came from the FBI behavioral analyst who seemed to be profiling typical schoolyard shooters. FBI did find pedo advocacy materials on his computer, but no kiddy porn. He was a self described asexual.

       The MF in the 2nd picture is eating while escorting a dead body out of a massacre?!?! Who the fuck would be eating standing over the body like that. Also that is the same shape/body in all three pics. Look at the protrusions at the feet and the head. All the same length. That's longer than a child's body btw.

       This might shock you, but Police and EMTs and others who deal with emergencies have seen dead bodies.  They aren't shocked and shaking and crying every time they see one, especially one that's already been covered and strapped to a stretcher for transport.  It's shocking to your average person, I'd be horrified, but my buddy who was an EMT for 15 years and a cop for the last 5, he would handle it differently, and that might involve trying to get something to eat while working what was probably a super long day and night.

       Lol yea man I was thinking the same thing.. But like the other reply said, cops and emts are used to dealing with stuff like this. Seeing 20 something kindergarten kids dead shoulnt be a big deal for them.. Im tired but that was meant as sarcasm and while I hear where that other guy is coming from theres a difference between wheeling out a couple people vs 20 fucking kids.

       Also that's the only pic I ever saw of bodies from sandy hook... So I'd love more proof that there was 26/27 people killed that day.

       Well, it's true. The vast vast vast majority of people are not entertaining any question about Sandy Hook being fake. The police and parents are not about to release photos of dead children to placate a tiny minority. Especially since that tiny minority would almost certainly find a way to discredit the photos.

       Police can do what they want.  And we can point out all the anomalies in the case:  the bizarre behavior of the medical examiner, his total misstating of the facts, the lack of bodies, laughing grieving parents, logistical problems with what Lanza is claimed to have done, principal interviewed when she was dead, changing story of Yates the nurse, staging of the kids in a line photo from months earlier,  people going in circles at the fire station, people wandering through crime scene tape, the school being in total disrepair, the pics of the scene already set up before windows were broken, the bizarre story of Gene Rosen, the age of all the parents... That's just off the top of my head

       It's only suspicious to the people that spent more than 10 minutes looking at evidence presented outside the normal media 'tunnel of unexplained narratives.' So basically it's suspicious to normal people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only people that are left believing official stories any more are the fringe. YOU are the fringe. Normal people know things are screwed up with the Sandy Hook narrative. Damn near every parent now has a cell phone that takes video.. Sandy Hook video? none.. Pictures? none..
      </p>
      <p>
       The school stopped trending on Google years before the shooting. The pictures of the school showed a moldy building that no parent would let their child attend. Even the released photos show the school being used as a storage facility. The event looks like one big fake drill reported as an actual event. Any actual questions about the event get attacked with errors in reasoning rather than just answered.. and people like you do nothing to contribute to the discussion or even add to understanding.

       It wasn't cops who declared them dead. Two of the first responding cops were also EMT's, another was a nurse. Three more medics were brought in and they used heart monitors.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were in contact with doctors at Danbury hospital and that's how they were declared dead.

       Shill or no shill, if it fits the official narrative it's better to say it than not. Also some topics are like magnets especially if you have a conflicting view. In some cases it's easier to give up, like with the flat earth theory, but I think this one is not on that level.

       Before the building was secured, the initial triage was performed by police with EMT training, including:

       The police rushed two injured children and one injured teacher out to ambulances, which approached the school as soon as it was secured. Later, a kindergarten aide with lesser injuries was also transported.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the building was secure, Sgt. Cario picked the most experienced paramedics to enter the building.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I realized that at some point those victims presumed dead would have to be officially pronounced dead. We also needed to impact the fewest number of EMS personnel and that we needed to preserve the integrity of the scene Looking around I recognized two other senior paramedics that I believed had the experience and training to handle this situation tactically. I told Cassavechia I would bring himself, Paramedic Bernie Meehan, and Paramedic John Reed into the school, which was secured by that point. They were told to bring minimal equipment. As we walked to the school I tried to prepare them for what they were about to see. I told them of the number of victims and the nature of the wounds. I told Cassavechia, "This will be the worst day of your life."

       That's interesting. Maybe if the streets hadn't been blocked from the start they could have had more EMTs and doctors actually make it there.

       Actually yes- I would want everyone to see the horror that had occurred so that they would feel as passionately as me in preventing this sort of thing in the future. I would want to end any gross discussion that the atrocity was fake - and rub it in any doubter's face.

       So he picked an elementary school because he was...a pedophile? Lmao, comon idiots, Adam Lanza is a completely fabricated person and nobody died at Sandy Hook. Wake up, this was common knowledge on this subreddit for years before the Shills took over in 2016.

       I saw that video a couple years ago, couldn't believe how blatant the deception. What I want to know is, how much do the involved children know about what they were used for? I mean they were young enough to bullshit at that age, but surely at least ONE of them, once they're older and hear more about the Sandy Hook hoax theories, will remember something fishy about it, and hopefully come forward about what they know. Such a crazy situation, and it's really surreal/scary how many Americans still completely believe in the official version of events.

       They probably know but they are not aware of the real significance, they were so young they have already been brainwashed that this was done for a good cause (gun's control). I am sure there will be one of two who will despise their parents for forcing him to lie, for being manipulated, and more for being used not to have a better society, free of guns, but for some corrupt politicians agenda.

       Lanza isnt real... thats why he's supisedky hold up in a special kind of prison where noone can speak to him. At the very least he isnt the person they're speaking about here...its all fabricated to push the crazed lone gunman image.

       Most children inside that school had survivable wounds (Dr. William Billups, Anderson &amp; Rush). They died 18 minutes from an excellent hospital because they were not transported to it. When NPD found the rooms full of wounded, they failed to give their dispatcher an update, i.e. they failed to declare an MCI. For thirty solid minutes, dispatcher Bob Nute thought there were 1-2 wounded adults; so he sent two ambulances, and a single paramedic, to a scene that required a minimum of 15 ambulances and many paramedics. When he found out third-hand via an EMT that there were more than two wounded, it would then be another 30 minutes before mutual aid from surrounding towns could arrive (by which time the only ambulance route was thoroughly blocked by police vehicles). The patients had been bleeding for 60 minutes. The Golden Hour--the time during which even a severely wounded patient can be expected to survive, in suburban/urban America--was gone. That is the double tragedy of Sandy Hook, and it is now a triple tragedy, because the state of Connecticut has committed 5 years' worth of felonies suppressing this information instead of using it to save lives.

       Adam Lanza probably didn't even exist, and he certainly didn't shoot anyone. Unanswered
       <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/2015/12/33-unanswered-questions-on-sandy-hooks-3rd-anniversary.html">
        questions
       </a>
       from Sandy Hook:
      </p>
      <p>
       "How was a skinny 19-year-old boy with no military training capable of killing 26 people clean while injuring none?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was there no evidence of blood? A total of 26 fatalities (children and adult) would produce at least at a conservative estimate 20 gallons (75 liters) of blood. Thus would require a concerted blood cleanup (blood is considered a biohazard in this type of situation), yet when Sofia Smallstorm asked who did the cleanup, all the departments were ignorant of it and even claimed that no one did the cleanup.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does the Sandy Hook shooting crime not exist on the FBI 2012 crime report?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does the tax accessor’s website shows the victims’ families got free houses on Christmas day when all Government offices are closed?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does the Sandy Hook Timeline of Evacuation not match the video evidence from the trooper’s car stationed at the Sandy Hook Elementary School car park?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was there an active shooter drill at around the same place and the same time as the Sandy Hook event?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are people walking around the Sandy Hook fire house in circles like a movie set? Why was there such a lack of urgency in the emergency personnel who were responding for many hours after 10am when people were still unaccounted for (e.g. nurse Sally Cox who claims she hid in a closet for 4 hours until 1:15pm)?
      </p>
      <p>
       If Sandy Hook Elementary School was a legitimate and operational school at the time of the event, why is there evidence that the school shut in 2009 due to asbestos, was reinspected in 2011, and was flooded again with Hurricanes Irene and Sandy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why were the entire school grounds of what we were told was “Sandy Hook Elementary School” demolished and rebuilt? Does this remind you of how the metal scraps from 9/11 were immediately shipped off to China before they could be examined for evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did Town Clerk Debbie Aurelia and Connecticut State Attorney Kevin Kane refuse to release the death certificates and the names of the “victims”?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did Connecticut officials conspire to pass an unprecedented bill banning FOIA requests and access to death certificates and other information, normally part of the public record as a matter of course for centuries?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why were all the ambulances parked at the fire house away from the crime scene?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why were there so many black and silver (Government-type) cars around the school and fire house in place before the event?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do so many of the victims’ family members appear to be acting, smirking, giggling, snickering and outright laughing after the event?
      </p>
      <p>
       How does one explain the highly strange behavior of Wayne Carver, the chief medical examiner and coroner? Why did Carver say that “You can control a situation depending on your photographer, and I have very good photographers”? Why did Carver say that “I hope the people of Newtown don’t have it crash on their heads later”?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did Lieutenant Paul Vance threaten to prosecute as a crime anyone who reported information that contradicted the official narrative?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did no one sue the school or the estate of Nancy Lanza?
      </p>
      <p>
       How is it that no parent wanted to see the dead bodies of their children in the school?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why were all the funerals conducted with closed caskets?"

       Get off your high horse, White Knight. These pieces of shit accepted
       <em>
        millions
       </em>
       of dollars to do this hoax, many of them got new 1/2 and 3/4 million dollar houses in exchange for
       <em>
        lying
       </em>
       to everyone and saying their kids were murdered, so they could try to violate our Constitutional rights.
