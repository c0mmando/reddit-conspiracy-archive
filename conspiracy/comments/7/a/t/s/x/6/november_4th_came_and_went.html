Because I was in Philly all day today and I didn&#39;t get murdered in a marxist riot, but maybe that&#39;s just the news covering it all up. I&#39;d argue that the lesson everyone here should learn is that believing whatever you hope to be true no matter how little evidence is clearly a bad position to hold, but I guess that just makes me a shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I don&#39;t entirely disagree with you but besides the kid from charlottesville you don&#39;t see them running around setting jews on fire. </p>

<p>I also think alot of trump supporters automatically get lumped in as nazis, as do white activists.</p>

<p>Very little violence or oppression from the &quot;alt&quot; right but the left is constantly violating the rights of people with differing opinions.</p>

<p>BTW I voted for Jill stein.  So I really don&#39;t have a horse in the antifa/alt right horse race, I just call it like I see it. </p>

<p>You can almost always find examples for whatever it is you&#39;re lookin for.</p>

<p>The rhetoric matters a lot  I think:
 Some dude smacks someone over the head with a bike lock at a protest or shoots a bunch of republican staff playing softball and by and large the Lefty&#39;s disavow. There&#39;s the &quot;punch Nazis thing&quot;, which comes down to &quot; deplatforming hate speech in public because our govt doesn&#39;t make it illegal&quot; (IMO the US govt shouldn&#39;t ever shut down hate speech, but what they don&#39;t govern then necessarily falls to the public), but they&#39;re not calling for homes to be torched or people to be hung and thrown from helicopters.</p>

<p>Someone runs over protesters he disagrees with and you don&#39;t have to go far for comments that at best say &quot;it was an accident, he was scared, they shouldnt have been in the road etc&quot; and at worst call her an obese liberal retard who had a heart attack and deserved it. The dialogue on the alt-right impregnates itself with violence, and thats why Im not surprised when they birth it. And thats worrisome, because right now theyre also playing the victim, and they attract other people with that complex: desperate white men who feel something promised to them has been stolen. Beyond that, the right seems more prone to spur of the moment/random attacks, and especially in the case of general aggression towards minorities and immigrants. These are anecdotal and underreported, but I have seen it myself even in the &quot;libcuck shitstain&quot; of NYC.</p>

<p>Read into the response as well as the action. Search Heather Heyer on t_D. Look at the 4chan Trump threads. One bad apple shouldn&#39;t ruin the bunch, but when the bunch is defending that bad apple and representing their own rotten cores then something is fucking up.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to pick which bunch you want to be in right now, but that day does seem to be close.</p>

<p>As an unrelated side note: good shit voting your conscience, I know it isn&#39;t easy. I personally withheld my vote entirely this election. Clinton&#39;s a snake and a warmonger, Trump is a conman and a cunt, I didn&#39;t agree with Steins overall policy and specifically her stance on vaccines (and further, I think its dangerous)...so instead of voting I went out and registered college kids to vote their first time and helped run a voter helpline. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we agree more than we disagree.  It&#39;s an issue I take to heart because I have taken alot of verbal abuse from CO workers and family for being outspoken about things that I truly feel are wrong. </p>

<p>Even though me and these people I&#39;m talking about have the same ideas on pretty much everything we talk about they find error with my &quot;how to&quot;, &quot;why&quot; and who I am critical of.</p>

<p>I laugh most of it off, and I tend to be diplomatic enough to get people to cool off.  But I witness alot of that &quot;tolerant&quot; left on an everyday basis.</p>

<p>Im good with same sex marriage, free speech, guns, abortion, I&#39;m pretty much good with anything until you inflict harm on other people which is exactly what my coworkers are for with exception of guns, but the second I mention something like drone strikes in Libya under Obama I&#39;m literally called a racist nazi. It&#39;s bizarre.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all good I&#39;ve grown around the criticism, but I just feel like my libertarian-ish aqueintences are much more tolerant than the so called progressives.</p>

<p>I think abstaining from the vote was an excellent choice btw. I think we can all agree that our choices were not optimized :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I hear you. The left isn&#39;t doing itself any favors, from the top and the DNC all the way to the bottom and the militant SJWs. </p>

<p>Its pathetic, and it drives people to the other side.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a rash of thinking that contains no nuance that&#39;s spread across the whole spectrum of the public. Either from the Trumpets who don&#39;t listen to criticism and concern or from the leftists who demand you think <em>exactly</em> as they do and everyone&#39;s called xhe. </p>

<p>And that lack of nuance is good for the people at the top. They&#39;re safe up there, and a fully divided public is the goal of our time.</p>

<p>It used to be that we disliked the ideas of our countrymen, now we seem to care little for the ideas and have skipped to simply disliking our countrymen. There&#39;s no shades of grey anymore.</p>
