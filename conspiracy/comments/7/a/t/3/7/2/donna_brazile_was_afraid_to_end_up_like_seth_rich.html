      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Brazile writes that she was haunted by the still-unsolved murder of DNC data staffer Seth Rich and feared for her own life, shutting the blinds to her office window so snipers could not see her and installing surveillance cameras at her home. She wonders whether Russians had placed a listening device in plants in the DNC executive suite."

       Thats funny to say after you edit it. But how exactly does the fiber backbone prove seth rich did it?(to save you time the forensicator report doesn't prove anything like that, much less conclusively)
      </p>
      <p>
       This is beside the point that I wasn't saying donna brazille was correct in saying the russians killed seth rich, but that she isnt saying the DNC killed him as most people are taking out of this(usually people are leaving out the last sentence when quoting that paragraph)

       I think the point people are making is that everyone in the DNC, including Brazile, insisted Seth Rich was killed in a botched robbery. Why would a random botched robbery have Donna Brazile so scared?

       Doesn’t really make any sense though. She wouldn’t say the things she’s said without going all the way. There’d be no point. If she were legitimately afraid of the DNC, she would either say nothing, or say everything. Feels like you’re trying to force a narrative to conform with the theory

       I had the same thought at first, but the Seth Rich thing is on so few radars right now, basically folks on this sub, similarly minded individuals, and some other right wing outlets, that it would be strange for them to drag it out again. Who would they be trying to fool? The only people discussing it would never believe the spin anyway. It’s weird.

       The narrative they're trying to push is that Russians interfered with the elections. Of course they'd want to make it seem like Seth Rich was manipulated by the Russians to leak incriminating emails and then killed to frame Clinton. Anything to distract from the fact that the emails were incriminating.

       Actually if you concede that Russia has been using an active propaganda campaign to try to control the narrative or spin stories, it might actually make sense that Russia would put out a false conspiracy theory that Clinton or the DNC had Seth Rich, their own person, killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you look at his death, if the DNC or Clinton truly killed him, couldn't they do better than shooting him twice in the back and in what's been called a botched robbery? Is the theory is that Clinton is that sinister that she kills her own people and has it intentionally look suspicious? Or is she that clumsy that her killers are this bad?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the Russians actually did kill him, but the police don't find anything and rule it a botched robbery? The Russians might blame Clinton because it looks shady enough and muddies the water if anything was found pointing to others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it turns out that Russian military intelligence posing as guccifer 2.0 edited the wordpress document that Assange linked to on wikileaks' twitter page, that listed the DNC hacked emails. Added to a few of the documents in those emails were the word "confidential" that were not on the original emails. However, there wasn't actually anything incriminating in the wordpress document that showed those 1000s of emails. No one bothered to actually check those emails, it just sounded shady knowing those leaked emails existed, therefore there must be something bad in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange said in an interview that he was timing the release of the email leaks with the DNC convention for maximum political effect. Assange is a known for disliking Clinton, and wikileaks has not criticized or released leaks about Russia. People believe that  Seth Rich's death is what Assange was referring to when he said "there are consequences to leaking," but I haven't been able to find a reliable source on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize this could just grasping at straws, but if Donna Brazile is serious (and if she is claiming Russia is responsible for Rich's death, publicly) that might actually be why there were theories quick to blame Clinton for his death-- a Russian disinformation campaign brought to you by a building full of Russian trolls pretending to be Americans and farming artificial outrage and trying to divide all sides without actually being for anything.

         Guccifer 2.0, who claimed to be an independent Romanian hacker, made multiple contradictory statements and false claims about his likely Russian identity throughout the election. Press reporting suggests more than one person claiming to be Guccifer 2.0 interacted with journalists.

         Content that we assess was taken from e-mail accounts targeted by the GRU in March 2016 appeared on DCLeaks.com starting in June. We assess with high confidence that the GRU relayed material it acquired from the DNC and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks. Moscow most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its selfproclaimed reputation for authenticity. Disclosures through WikiLeaks did not contain any evident forgeries.

         In early September, Putin said publicly it was important the DNC data was exposed to WikiLeaks, calling the search for the source of the leaks a distraction and denying Russian “state-level” involvement.

         The Kremlin’s principal international propaganda outlet RT (formerly Russia Today) has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks.
         <strong>
          RT’s editor-in-chief visited WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in August 2013, where they discussed renewing his broadcast contract with RT, according to Russian and Western media. Russian media subsequently announced that RT had become "the only Russian media company" to partner with WikiLeaks and had received access to "new leaks of secret information." RT routinely gives Assange sympathetic coverage and provides him a platform to denounce the United States.

       Well do you honestly think she would publicly accuse of HRC of the murder of Seth Rich? She's already thrown her under the bus once, doing so again she knows would surely condemn her. The woman knows HRC very well, if anything she has a good idea that it wasn't the Russians, but she wanted to bring up Seth Rich and how the murder has bothered her so she threw in the Russian tidbit so she could bring it up publicly.

Im not sure it makes her lose credibility, she knows more than we do for sure. Like I said if anything she would have a better idea that it wasn't the russians hearing things through the grapevine.

       I think if anything its projection and her just covering her ass throwing that in at the end since there are probably multiple people out there who dont want her bringing it up at all, or she could just be misdirecting blame on purpose. Who knows.

       She is dropping truth bread crumbs rather than saying it outright. Very smart in a 3D chess kind of way.

       they wouldn't. in russia, when someone is killed, there is a very clear reason why. usually because they went against someone and the motive/executor is clear (altho rarely punished).

       Seriously though, considering Rich was murdered almost a full month after the DNC announced in the Washington Post that they'd been hacked by Russia, it makes no sense whatsoever to pin it on Russians. But I'm all for any acknowledgement that the "botched robbery" explanation doesn't cut it without more evidence.

       That quote is so dramatic. If I didn't know Donna to be a woman of outstanding moral fortitude I might guess she was taking a bit of artistic license with her recounting of the whole thing to bolster book sales. She didn't have security cameras before all this? She thinks the DNC or Russians or whatever are gonna snipe her in her house and that closing her curtains is gonna foil the assassination attempt? I mean maybe she watch too much 24 or some shit and maybe she was scared at some point, but this bitch is looking more and more like Don King every day... straight con man.

       Maybe. Either way though, beggers can't be choosers I suppose. If she is coming out with legit info about corruption, I guess I don't care too much if she is smart or dumb or playing up the less important details to sell her book, as long as the end result is good info that saves people from falling under the DNC's hynpnotic spell, I'm not gonna complain too much.

       Yeah, the more I read about our leaders, the less impressed I am. The guy that lied to the FBI in the Trump investigation went and got a new cell phone and deleted his Facebook account after his meeting with the FBI that he lied at. First, those actions do not cover up any past actions. And they just pretty much admit guilt to investigators.

       If Brazile truly believed the Russians killed Seth Rich and she feared for her own life, she certainly seemed to get over her fear of them with a quickness

       If I truly thought Russia's are out to kill me, I'd keep my damn mouth shut. Not write a book about it.

       Yes, the "Russians".

       Hillary Clinton really does have herself to blame for losing the election if the "Russians" are also the ones who killed Seth Rich.

       I totally agree. All of her statements pointed to Russian surveillance. The DNC most likely knew Seth had the files but it sure looks like the Russians got them from Seth. Seth shopped the files looking for a buyer. One being Wikileaks since they recently offered cash for data. I think the Russians got to Seth then used Wikileaks to distribute the files. His murder (or hit) was probably the grab for the drive containing the files. The robbery wasn’t botched they only took a thumb drive.
