        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Summary:</p>

<p>A little bit of background to the Paradise Papers.</p>

<p>The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders.</p>

<p>The 13.4 million documents were passed to German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). Panorama has led research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including the Guardian, in 67 countries.</p>

<p>The BBC does not know the identity of the source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You guys are idiots with this shit. It would be impossible for Trump supporters to not know Trump puts high level CEOs in office because you kids bitch about it incessantly. When things like this come up of course one or more of those guys are going to have money in there.
No one is shocked on either side. People that make tons of money try to avoid taxes.</p>

<p>The big shockers are the Hollywood actors and the &quot;public servants&quot; who&#39;s salary is listed in the low hundreds of thousands that have millions rolling though these things.</p>

<p>You guys go for such low hanging fruit to catch a bit of karma or blow off steam. Come up with something original other than &quot;Trumperdumpers are all over conspiracy!!!&quot; or &quot;omg trumpeteers are just gonna act like this didn&#39;t happen&quot;</p>

<p>We want this shit gone as bad as you guys. The more tax these douche bags pay the better our country is. Get <em>your</em> heads out of your ass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m asking why focus on that when we may have proof of politicians hiding money they don&#39;t want people asking questions about. Genuine corruption by those in power is far more pressing than some Hollywood hypocrites.</p>

<p>Also they don&#39;t create the pedestal or the soapbox, millions of fawning idiots do, I don&#39;t see the problem with so many choosing to use that influence to support causes they believe in. Sure Bono is a cunt, but there&#39;s probably a good few people alive today because of money he raised, something I can&#39;t say about myself. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have as much of a penchant for conspiracies as some of you guys, but I&#39;ve always enjoyed coming here to see what&#39;s being talked about, and getting different perspectives on stories, but lately it&#39;s almost become an unusable subreddit because of the undying admiration of Trump.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to tell people what to do, but it seems to me that a conspiracy subreddit should never admire the most powerful man in the world and regurgitate his talking points.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we ever had a POTUS who was legitimately trying to make America a a better place and take power away from the manipulative folks who&#39;ve been running things for a while, how do you think those folks would try to take him down?</p>

<p>Do you think that they&#39;d use their propagandist media control to convince the malleable populace that he&#39;s mentally unstable and completely ineffective? Do you think they&#39;d astroturf social media?  Do you think they&#39;d try to prevent him from getting anything done with a strong message of &quot;RESIST&quot; and getting the corrupt members of <em>both</em> parties to prevent anything from passing? Would they use their Hollywood mouthpieces to convince idiots that Trump is a fascist? </p>

<p>Because that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening. Whether or not Trump is a good man trying to do good things and get our country back on track I can&#39;t say for sure, but there is plenty of evidence that this is how the PTB are treating him. Anyone saying &quot;lol he&#39;s the President and therefore he can&#39;t be trusted so all of his supporters are retarded&quot; are shills or fools regurgitating their shitty arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. What’s bothered me about this sub is the hyper politicized nature of the conspiracies. I get that there’s a political angle to a lot of theories, but the us v them was establishment/big brother/whatever against we the people. Now the rhetoric is us v us which is such bullshit because we all know that’s what they want. Being opposed to the left right paradigm is what was appealing about this sub, then along come these hyper politicized fucks with their obviously biased conspiracy theories and change this sub.

    <div class="md"><p>They are going throught the stages of grief. There is denial, they will deny or deflect everything. There is bargaining, and making up excuse. <strong>Then there is anger. And embrassement. There is this misguided notion that you are less of person for admitting that you are wrong. That is not  true, you are more of an admirable human being you can admit you are wrong. There is no shame in that. It is okay to be wrong about something. They are defensive because they are anxious, and feel guilt or shame. We have a tendency to ridicule them, but that just adfirms their misguided notion that they are right and that other side is evil. We need yo accept them and be patient with them. Ask them if they have any questions, or just listen to them.</strong></p>

<p>Totally agree with evrything you said by the way</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a hardcore liberal for life. I voted for Bernie in the primaries (whoops!) and Jill Stein in the general. I thought Trump was a buffoon but, to my credit, I knew Hillary was worse.</p>

<p>At this point I would like to say that I absolutely admit I was wrong. Trump is not a buffoon - in fact he&#39;s a goddamn genius. His persona is a tool he uses, and he uses it well. There is a reason he faced off against the Republican AND Democratic establishments and came out on top -- it&#39;s because he knows exactly what he&#39;s doing.</p>

<p>Download the source.  There&#39;s actual evidence here.  There is none to support your conspiracy theory other than funding of the parent non-profit by Open Source and thousands of other donors.  There is no evidence you can bring to suggest or show Soros had any influence on the outcome or reporting of the story.  For all we know it was a donation made to reduce his taxes.</p>

<p>You are choosing to ignore hard and direct evidence for this story to make allusions to an entirely different conspiracy theory based on circumstantial evidence and a motive you cant explain or prove.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve got that exactly backwards. The German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung obtained the data and shared it with the ICIJ, who shared it with over 700 journalists of multiple other newspapers who then spent over a year independently working on articles. ICIJ is not the source of the data and not the source of the articles. </p>

<p>If you can explain to me how Soros via a donation through a charitable foundation (which is a donor, not a founder of ICIJ) influenced several hundred journalists of multiple highly acclaimed international newspapers who are not paid or employed by the ICIJ and who at least in case of Süddeutsche Zeitung had access to the data first, I&#39;d be really surprised.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to see this russian propaganda that 200 million people saw that were convinced by them to vote Trump.  It couldn&#39;t have been Comey reopening the investigation because of Weiners laptop, of the emails leaks of their own admitions of corruption, of the fact Hillary barely campaigned and acted like she deserved it.  No, none od those things, it was Russian propaganda they beat out CTR.  It&#39;s fucking delusional, she lost because she was a shitty corporate fascism canidate who had to rig the primaries in order to even get to the General. </p>

<p>Can you show me examples of these ads?  Also, I think this is the 1st time I heard they were trying to make a guy who&#39;s been in the lime light since the 80&#39;s, reality tv show host, and who was attacked on a daily basis by 24hr MSM, as trying to change his image on face book.  <strong>Do you have a source that&#39;s what their goal was?</strong></p>

<p>Maybe people got that perception because he was running a campaign and that was their slogan.  Also he paid 5 million to Cambridge Analytics.  Maybe that&#39;s why.</p>

<p>This comment was after I pointed out how people&#39;s perception of him was manipulated. You want it to be Hillary&#39;s fault so badly that you will you completely disregard the highly credible fact that propaganda works. And Russia has figured out a highly effective way of doing it.</p>

So yes, a over bloated health care bill that was based off of a republican idea and rewritten by the insurance companies, that everyone bitches about how much it costs with high deductibles, but defends it because it helps the ultra poor and pre-existing conditions, is quite a impact.  Especially when Obama who ran on single payer, had the house &amp; senate couldn&#39;t get single payer and instead we got economic fascism (aka Mussolini type, not Hitler) with a mandate to purchase a product from a pricate institution or face a penalty.  </p>

<p>None of which have to do with Trump or his campaign.  Can you show me otherwise.</p>

<p>Sure, the RNC didn&#39;t want Trump either, but the info pertaining to Russian officials weren&#39;t a part of it then.</p>

<p>Trump says a lot of shit, I&#39;m not a support of his, but I do argue against this red scare.  And yes, tge fbi <strong>might have more</strong>, but it&#39;s been a year and we&#39;re only seen indictment for crimes commites under Obama&#39;s DOJ.  Keep spinning your wheels on the dossier if you like.  Looks like the Paradise Papers might actually hold more weight than anytging else to date.</p>

<p>But republicans and democrats in America don’t give a damn about the average man, and easily the most pressing issue for the masses is health care. </p>

<p>I’m currently$1,200 in debt after having multiple surgeries, and I’ve paid $800 off too. I’m 19 years old. I had my last surgery Right before trump got into office, and right before my health insurance rates and premiums became Too expensive for me, a college kid, and my single mother to pay. </p>

<p>Could you imagine if I had my surgeries this year? Not only would my deductible have not been met, but <em>i don’t even have health insurance</em>. I’d be in 10x the debt, and I would be locked into that for the rest of my adult life. </p>

<p>So yeah, I can’t agree more than healthcare is more important than “trump/ Russia gate”. Trump, pence, his whole cabinet, and most people from the rnc and the dnc need to be removed. None of them want to help us. And Russia gate won’t help that whatsoever. </p>

<p>The Podestas and Comet Pizza are disturbing. One only need to look at the obvious pedophile artwork displayed and communications between the people involved to see that something&#39;s not right.</p>

<p>Call it &quot;Spirit Cooking&quot; or &quot;Demonic Rituals&quot;, I have a problem with <em>anyone</em> in power deranged enough to think that they can draw on some higher power to achieve their results.</p>

<p>Of course Obama, his wife, his family and his publisher all claimed he was &quot;Kenyan born&quot; before his run for President. Nothing to see here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and they do so in disgusting ways.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Disgusting but often times legal ways.  Gov and corporate power have all but merged in the states and the citizenry have been left out of the equation.  Most legislation is either completely composed by corporations or highly shaped by their lobbyists. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fox is state run at this point</p>

<p>I agree with this but I believe all of the major media companies are compromised.  The two party system is a convenient illusion.</p>

 It is not the end of world.
It does NOT make you look weak.. it makes you look stronger. There is no shame in admitting when you are wrong. Take a deep breath and relax, if you are defensive it is because you are anxious.
You will probably go through the stages of grief, which is normal. You tied supporting trump with your identity, when in reality it never should have been apart of it.
You will go through denial, and then the next you will try and reason and compromise, then you will be angry and what to lash out on thhe world...then depression , and then acceptance. It is okay to be angry and sad, those are human emotions.</p>

<p>TRUMP SUPPORTERS: It is ok to admit when you are wrong. It is a sign of intelligence and vital social skill.</p>

<p>lol. Funny how you decide that the only intelligent option is whatever you believe is correct. You are calling upon others to be humble while implying that only you have the correct answer.</p>

<p>Consumer confidence is the highest level its been since 2004, so most people are quite happy with how things are going in their day to day lives. Sadly you have bought into the propaganda of the mainstream media who is trying to divide this country. You have become a sheep. </p>

<p>You really need to take your own advice and admit that you were wrong about Trump. You made a human error and made hating trump a part of your identity when in reality it never should have been a part of it. Admitting you&#39;re wrong does not make you weak. You will probably go through the stages of grief, which is normal. You will continue to lash out on the world and then depression. But finally you will accept. When you are ready to admit you are wrong. I am here to talk. </p>

<p>What is the &#39;Consumer Confidence Index - CCI&#39; An index by the Conference Board that measures how optimistic or pessimistic consumers are with respect to the economy in the near future. The idea behind the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) is that if consumers are optimistic, they tend to purchase more goods and services. This increase in spending inevitably stimulates the whole economy.</p>

<p>This is exactly it. I came to this conclusion when I heard the enormous number and variety of guns he had in the hotel room. The only logical explanation as to why he would use over 20 different guns in the shooting would be to test them all on live targets for shits and giggles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They appear coincidental because they happen all the damn time. Literally every day there is a mass shooting in America. You, and many others, are looking to fill a narrative, and find connections and cover ups where there&#39;s only chaos, madness, a mental health crisis, and way too many high powered semi automatic weapons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure what you&#39;re trying to achieve by pretending there are less mass shootings in America than there really are. Downplaying their frequency or severity, or moving the goalposts as you seem to be doing, only helps to serve the weapons manufacturers and those who want even more guns on American streets. </p>

<p>As of October 7th, the day of the Las Vegas shooting, it marked the 273rd mass shooting in the U.S. in the 275 days that had passed so far in 2017. That&#39;s almost 1 per day. You can change the criteria by which we define mass shootings (generally accepted as 4 or more people killed/wounded in a single event), but I don&#39;t see why you would do that, unless you were trying to diminish the unbelievably high number of mass shootings in America.</p>

<p>There is no widely accepted definition of Mass Shooting. But the context of this conversation alone should tell you what type of mass shooting I was speaking on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do have an agenda, you want to connect these recent shootings to some kind of grand conspiracy &quot;because they just seem like too much of a coincidence&quot;. I said they&#39;re not a coincidence because they happen all the damn time. They happen so often in fact that people barely even care about them any more unless someone they know was involved.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re saying they don&#39;t happen that often because you&#39;re setting the bar for mass shootings at 4 or more deaths and I&#39;m saying that it&#39;s 4 or more people shot. </p>

<p>Can we agree that whether or not everyone in a mass shooting actually dies is kinda besides the point? And that America has a mass shooting event, where at least 4 people are shot, almost every single day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the one setting the bar.... the god damned Congressional Reseach Service is. You didn&#39;t even read their criteria. It is about more than the number of people shot/killed. READ IT. or do you rather champion Newsweek? </p>

<p>The type of mass shootings that I am referring to, as outlined by the Congressional Reseach Service, is not that frequent and is almost <strong>always</strong> preceded with something being exposed. </p>

<p>AND yes we can agree on mass shootings being too prevalent, but like you said, that was not the point. The context of the discussion was geared toward the mass shootings as defined by the Congressional Research Service, WHICH IS THE OFFICIAL U.S. DEFINITION. That Newsweek article has an agenda and its pretty obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And the point I&#39;ve made is that they aren&#39;t as common as you and newsweek try to make them out to be. Sure gangs shoot each other up and domestic violence sometimes has multiple people shot, but thats not what I, and the god damned Congressional Reseach Service are considering as mass shootings. The criteria they use is pretty clear, if you would read it.</p>

<p>Would it appease you, if instead of mass shooting I said terrorist attack/domestic terrorism? It shouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The definition you are using is a new and politicized one, specifically to make mass shootings appear more prevalent. The exact same thing they did with the definition of a serial killer. The <strong>fact</strong> is the type of mass shootings that I am referring to, as outlined by the Congressional Reseach Service, is not that frequent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You aren&#39;t being a dick, and I&#39;m totally not easily offended so we&#39;re good there. Honestly, I haven&#39;t kept up much with the story and my closest connection is that I was in Vegas on the same floor but at the new York new York just the weekend after the shooting. What makes me interested in it further? Really the way information came out seemed fucked up and to me didn&#39;t make sense. When at first nothing was found on or near him suddenly some notes with wind trajectory calculations on them and other sniper related notes happened to have been found right next to him. Sniper related calculations? Really? Why? He just opened up. At the distance and angle he was at those notes would have been useless. Then the authorities want to examine his brain. Why even mention this? It&#39;s an odd thing to say imo.  As well, to me there is little talked about as far as his past. I have my own life to worry about so as I&#39;ve said, I haven&#39;t kept up with it..As such, there are other details, none that aren&#39;t known or haven&#39;t been discussed i&#39;m sure. But, just what&#39;s been talked about on its own doesn&#39;t convince me that he had a motive not that he was necessarily alone. If I was investigating the case (in which case I&#39;d hopefully have much more information to go on) just knowing what&#39;s been made public, i&#39;d fortunately withhold any thoughts on the case until further details come to light. 
If you think the news is thourough, unbiased, and not under pressure from investors. Well I can&#39;t help you there.
So, let me ask you why do you believe after just one month that the shooter just snapped and wanted to kill people? The picture so far is that he did kill, but why?</p>

<p>Don’t you think they’d come up with a good motive and narrative if it was a cover up?</p>

<p>They told us 9:11 was achieved with bearded acrobat pilots overcoming US domestic defences, planned by a dialysis patient in a Pakistan cave.</p>

<p>Flight attendants were apparently making calls at cruising altitudes. We know this through the black boxes allegedly found intact- at crash sites that resembled controlled demolitions and in one case, a big ol hole in a field.</p>

<p>Good story right?

<p>A different president and we would have never heard about it - instead there would have been a wikipedia page about the Cuban attack that provoked a war with the US, and you would be call me a conspiracy theorist for saying it was actually a false flag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said it is proof of govt being good when it the opposite. The plan reached the final step before being denied. Like i said, if 6 had a president with less of a conscience, we wouldn&#39;t have heard about it and instead the official narrative would be that Cuba provoked the US into a war and I would be called crazy for saying it was false flag where no one died.</p>

<p>Look into some of the events that turned to be false flags: gulf of tonkin, lusitania, 911 to name a few. Northwoods is the only time they didn&#39;t go through with it that we know about. There are many more instances of them going through with it that we know about. Northwoods is affirmation of the great evil we know our govts are capable and willing to commit. </p>

The problem seems terrible when you take the numbers for face value, but when you zoom out a bit it&#39;s maybe not quite as bad as it seems.  </p>

<p>That being said, I actually do agree with you.  Gang violence and police thuggery are both huge problems.  But they&#39;re also problems that have existed since our ancestors first organized themselves into tribes.  Domination/authority and tribalism are pretty deeply engrained in us.  How do you propose we go about &quot;fighting&quot; that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t know. But refusing to take any actions hasn’t been doing us a lot of good. I don’t have a solve all, nor am I even involved in politics beyond talking online. </p>

<p>Well, like I said, in this scenario, every household/vehicle/person would be assumed to be armed. I’d say that’s a pretty big win for the 2nd. However, many, either through negligence or malice would have incidents. I also don’t want to take away sport shooting, or even hunting. Doesn’t leave much room for anything but rationed live rounds and easy access to “Rubber bullet” type ammo to help deter (not magically prevent all) fatalities over trivial stuff. </p>

<p>Guns have plenty of uses. I don’t like war and think most assaliants can be stopped without killing them, so yeah, I’m biased, but I have zero issues with game hunting and shooting stuff that’s not alive for fun. There not JUST for cowards, and leveling the playing field is a valid point. </p>

<p>I’m always more bothered by the kid who finds the unlocked weapon and kills their sibling or other innocent deaths due to neglect as opposed to the evil of killers with foul intent. Gun control wouldn’t stop a truly determined individual. Mandatory training might save a kiddo though, as well as less lethal rounds in more firearms. Which might flow over to less gang/passion shootings. </p>

<p>Of course, just like if we legalized all the drugs, there would be some chaos, and death as the idiots won’t wait long. </p>

<p>Plenty of people have weapons and the safety catches/training for responsible ownership, but kinda like the bad apples in law enforcement, most of the time it just goes back to the same (reasonable) fear of turning into a slippery slope of confiscation if they admit maybe there should be tighter checks/ restrictions on insanely powerful killing machines. This is why I think the bullets themselves need to be the change, but not so much as to nullify the point of the firearm. </p>

<p>I DO not support gun confiscation, and have recently become aware of just how much crime is simply possession of a weapon under weapon bans that really shouldn’t exist as they do. </p>

<p>Also of note, in my utopian fantasy here, there would be no artificial demand for crime, legalize drugs, prostutition, other “victimless” crimes regarding personal choice and freedoms. UBI and not for profit healthcare for all, alongside private options and the ability to choose whatever kind of whacky new treatment you want, so long as you sign the waivers. </p>

It doesn&#39;t change their situation. There is nothing stopping them from moving on to the next available option.  Guns are not physically driving people to do this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying gun laws are perfect in this country. They could certainly use some reform. I just do not think any sort of reform will prevent people from committing suicide. This is an issue with how mental health issues are diagnosed and treated in this country.</p>

<p>How much of the suicides, and senseless gun violence can be attributed to improperly treated (anitdepressants) or undaignosed mental disorders?</p>

<p>Have you? Set one thing in motion, move to the next. Idiots focused on a single action complain about bureaucracy because &#39;it slows them down,&#39; while those that can work within the requirements of the system move ahead. Single issue candidates in a political office often get nothing of value done, but get reelected once or twice since they have a popular idea amongst a portion of the population, this strategy fails over time however because people get frustrated with no results. Multi-issue candidates are generally the ones staying decades in congress because they can effectively start and maintain control of multiple requests, so when one part of one request finally goes through, they&#39;ve already started their next ten ideas.</p>

<p>Within reason, yes. No civilian on this planet needs access to tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition and the means to expend that much ammo in a short amount of time. No civilian on this planet needs 10+ guns. No civilian needs automatic or burst fire weaponry.</p>

<p>Some how other countries, even ones with fairly lax gun laws, do not have the issues we have, even when adjusted for population and land mass. We are unique, and never in a good way. Additionally those countries have somehow not turned into fascist nightmarescapes where you either suck off your nearest Inner Party member or have a rat eat out your eyes.  </p>

<p>Okay, and what are those real numbers in the end?  We have a country of a little over 320 million people.

<p>We live in a country of 320 million, and there is at least one gun out there for every person.  How are you going to close pandora&#39;s box?  </p>

<p><em>tens of millions</em> of people own guns.  They shoot guns.  They keep them in their closet or in their night stand.  They keep them around their kids.

But you <em>do</em> understand what a monopoly of violence is, right?  Do you <em>honestly</em> think our government, or any government, should/can be trusted with something like that?

<p>There is evidence humans are forgetful and we&#39;ve had advanced civilizations that have since disappeared. There is no evidence that a version of humanity (in its current form)has existed long enough to advance to the point we are at. This shows advancement. The entirety of the 21st century shows we are beyond the pale of the cycle of kings and empires; you like talking about pandora&#39;s box, modern society in its absolute and pure magic relative to the rest of known human existence is that metaphor, it cannot be put back without the species being completely wiped.</p>

<p>Are you talking about JFK?  And you do know where you&#39;re posting, right?  Nothing at all in the GCA of 1968 could have prevented a deep-state assassination, and nothing at all in the GCA of 1968 could have prevented what the official story said happened, either.  Nothing about any reactive gun control law could have actually put a stop to whatever incident that it is a reaction to.

It&#39;s hard to say because the US pop does have some serious fire power as you noted before. That&#39;s at least fair, posting gun deaths per 100k won&#39;t change any minds, it&#39;s so out of context. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah nothing will change minds it seems. People think that making laws that could help prevent mass shootings or reduce gun deaths = banning all firearms ever and ensuring tyranny. They also seem to think the law cannot be changed back if it does not work but they won&#39;t even try it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, be honest the laws never &quot;change back&quot; when they don&#39;t work. That just doesn&#39;t happen, and you have to admit it would be incredibly difficult to measure what exact impact a certain law has on gun deaths. Sometimes it has the exact opposite effect than intended. Yea, we can try, but some feel the cost is too great. </p>

<p>People in this sub only believe what they believe because it fits into what they <em>want</em> to believe. Not because it&#39;s the only possibility or that they have any kind of proof, only because someone else within their &quot;circle&quot; said it is true and it fits into their imagined truth.

    <div class="md"><p>We get a mass shooting or other attack at least a couple times a month. With all the whistleblowing and investigations going on of course there&#39;s going to be coincidences. </p>

<p>Why would they do this to distract from it? How is it distracting from it? How would one attack prevent anything from coming of it? If they are constantly capable of pulling this shit off with no one finding out why are they not competent enough to prevent leaks of  financial information or other mistakes &quot;they&quot; constantly make?</p>

<p>Some of these conspiracies requires &quot;them&quot; to be both incredibly, amazingly competent, and the most incompetent buffoons the world has ever seen at the same time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is so hilarious. The source was the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. They shared the data with ICIJ. Over 700 journalists from several highly acclaimed international newspapers worked on the data for over a year and published about it independently. But the fact that a charitable foundation connected to Soros has donated to ICIJ makes it all questionable in your mind? How did Soros via his donation make the journalists do their bidding, especially the guys from Süddeutsche Zeitung who obtained the data? Or from the Guardian? </p>

<p>I&#39;d be surprised if you could come up with even one remotely plausible explanation how that would work.</p>

<p>There are a great number of people who say such things, yes. However when it comes to actually acknowledging fault or blaming people, the general consensus is pretty clearly partisan.

<p>You seem to be missing the point; it&#39;s not just because there&#39;s a clear bias here.

    <div class="md"><p>I’d imagine the implication is simply that “he’s losing sleep over something”.</p>

<p>I suppose if someone knew enough about the PM to have intimate knowledge of this stuff, they could speculate as to what he’s losing sleep over, but seeing as this is anonymous post, I’d imagine that this is simply a way to establish his credibility for future leaks. By “calling it” before any detailed information comes out, he positions himself to be credible the next time he makes a prediction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah Kirurny, I have no problem telling you that I am not a genius. I just dont understand, still, even with the factions part. Hillary wins and they vote for Hillary again. I&#39;ve realized how little I know about Bernie Sanders, especially after these events, but I was of the belief that he hated Clinton. He has spoken nothing about any of this, and that still concerns me. So do you mean factions in terms of voting? Please don&#39;t get mad that you have to explain something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obvious concern troll is obvious. From day one Bernie said that his goal was to avoid a Trump presidency and that he&#39;d back the Democrat candidate, that&#39;s why he ran as a D in the primaries instead of Independent in the general.

    <div class="md"><p>Right so I&#39;ve no problem understanding Bernie wanted to prevent a Trump presidency, but he knew Hillary was getting the nomination. If it wasn&#39;t due to learning that he was to be boxed out, why did he run at all? To transfer his voters to Hillary? Because he absolutely could&#39;ve won the nomination, and he mustve believed that at some point. But even after it all, crickets. Again it&#39;s my speculation, but beyond some tactical ploy to prevent a Trump presidency I see a lack of integrity. </p>

<p>Hey man, I&#39;m not denying that that&#39;s the real cause either. I&#39;m not ruling out anything, but a false flag seems unlikely. </p>

<p>I&#39;m more pissed off and disillusioned with our cable news media than anything. The fact that they chose to ignore everything else and focus on the shooting is bullshit.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really simple. </p>

<p>First example:</p>

<p>Lets say I live in country A where tax rate is 30%. </p>

<p>I have a corporation in country B where there is 0% tax.</p>

<p>I travel to country C for a month to do some consulting work. </p>

<p>I invoice them from my corporation, and the MONEY STAYS in country B.</p>

<p>Now it is very important to note: I CAN NOT TOUCH THIS MONEY PERSONALLY WITHOUT PAYING TAX.</p>

<p>The second I use any of that money for personal stuff, I have to pay tax on it. </p>

<p>Second example:</p>

<p>I am a pro tennis player. I travel 300 days a year all over the world to be in tournaments.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in country A that has tax rate 30%.</p>

<p>After I go Pro, I move my residence to country B that has 0% tax rate. I have a house there. </p>

<p>I set up a company in country B or any other country I want. This company/account gets all my winnings and sponsership money.</p>

<p>I now use that company as a vehicle to invest in things, real-estate, other companies, etc etc. The company invests all over the world. </p>

<p>If I take money out I don&#39;t have to pay tax because I LIVE IN A COUNTRY WITH 0% INCOME TAX. </p>

<p>And why shouldn&#39;t I? Since I travel so much why should I keep my residence in country A that has 30% tax? I&#39;m never there anyway!</p>

<p>There a any number of more examples but perhaps you get the drift.</p>

<p>Yes it is called tax avoidance. But there is a big difference between  tax-avoidance and tax-evasion. One is illegal, the other is not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could care less about any of that. And yes, I read through it all. None of it matters. Absolutely nothing in there alleges that any law was broken, and that&#39;s what ultimately matters. If I take money <em>that I&#39;ve already paid taxes on</em>, and send it overseas - it&#39;s none of the US&#39; business any more. It&#39;s no different with any of these businesses either.</p>

<p>And it fucking boggles the mind how incomprehensibly stupid Progressives sound when they continue to bitch about Russia Russia Russia as if China, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Iran, India and other countries aren&#39;t also investing in US Tech/Bank/etc stocks. We&#39;re the most stable and technologically advanced Democracy on earth - of course wealthy businessmen are going to want to invest here. Fucking DUH.</p>

<p>People are just searching for reasons to be outraged. If you&#39;re doing 65 in a 60 and speed by a cop, and he doesn&#39;t turn his lights on and give chase.....do you voluntarily pull your car over, call 911 and tell them to send the officer your way? No? Then you&#39;re a fucking hypocrite for complaining about this.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like the laws - change the laws. I personally don&#39;t give a shit what you believe is and isn&#39;t &quot;ethical&quot;, especially when the opposite of &quot;ethical&quot; in most of these cases is utter stupidity and mismanagement. You have to be a fucking jackass to voluntarily pay 35% tax when you can pay 10% or less.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a nice idea to use the tools of capitalist finance to promote social good, but it also seems like a perpetual motion kind of concept.  For every dollar earned through globalist capitalism that&#39;s spent on some charitable cause, how many dollars of damage were done in earning that money?  I don&#39;t think you &quot;fix&quot; the damage of global capitalism with charity earned via the means of global capitalism.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I know, but this is where you get into the difference between ethics and legality.  I personally question the ethics of individual and corporations who engage in extreme tax mitigation strategies.  I think there&#39;s a point at which these companies want the benefits of the governments who protect their assets with intellectual property laws, trade agreements and enforce them in their court systems but they don&#39;t believe they should submit to the tax systems which support the aspects of government they want.</p>

<p>Sure, there&#39;s a separate argument about disagreeing with the government generally and making a point by not submitting to taxation in support of it, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what&#39;s motivating these high-wealth individuals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree and disagree.</p>

<p>I think this offshoring of money and investments makes <em>rational</em> sense.  If I suddenly won the $500 million powerball, I&#39;m sure any good wealth management person would suggest all manner of LLC-based investments, including offshore investments held in tax havens.</p>

<p>Where it bothers me is that it&#39;s one more tool available for the plutocracy to remain rich and push the tax burden onto ordinary citizens unable to shelter their own income from both taxation and political scrutiny.  It enables the rich to receive the benefits of government protections for themselves and their assets while evading the moral obligation to support these same governments.  They in effect become citizens of a meta-nation of wealthy individuals which extracts benefits from national governments while contributing nothing to them.</p>

<p>Why not keep that business offshore? (if it otherwise makes sense)</p>

<p>When the business makes profit, then it can pay out to the partners who each pay a different tax rate based on the country they live in. </p>

<p>Why shouldn&#39;t country B somehow be entitled to tax revenues associated with this business?  They are literally providing the organized civilization that makes this business possible.</p>

<p>What do you mean by &#39;actual&#39; business?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A business that does actual economic activity and is not a sham business, shell corporation or some other non-practicing entity with no real employees, customers or business transactions.</p>

<p>Your original description was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine you live in country A, and start a business in country B owned by you and your partners who are living in country C and D.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So does the &quot;business in country B&quot; actually <em>do</em> anything in country B, besides file articles of incorporation?  My interpretation was that it did actual business transactions, had customers, employees, etc, in country B and not just exist there on paper.</p>

<p>My position would be that <em>wherever</em> it did actual productive business transactions, that country would be entitled to some kind of taxation of that business for the reasons I stated elsewhere because the business consumes real benefits from the market in which it operates.  </p>

<p>If you sold widgets in Country E but said &quot;no, it&#39;s a country E business, we only pay taxes in country B&quot; and then decided that when some local sold knockoff widgets you wanted to sue, what right would you have to access their court system?  You&#39;re not a citizen, your business doesn&#39;t pay taxes to their government, why should they provide you any protection for your IP?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;the intelligence community&quot; in and of itself is a tricky term to throw around.  You&#39;re attempting to make it seem like a huge body of people have PROVEN something.  </p>

<p>But, back to the DNC funded operation, the intel community was using information provided to them by crowdstrike who was being paid by the DNC.  </p>

<p>These are simple facts of the matter.  It doesn&#39;t matter how many people say nice things about crowdstrike.  And again, this is simple stuff.  </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to jump through any hoops or put a tin foil hat on to consider that the DNC, a group we&#39;re seeing is corrupt beyond repair got exposed.  Then they hired a tech firm with anti russian ownership to frame russia for the breach, and they pushed it out to all the media outlets. </p>

<p>Simple stuff.  Nothing has been proven.  We probably wont&#39; see anything actually proven either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is probably the reason the royal family has traditionally not been involved in market investing -- it exposes them to the unseemly moral hazards of public finance, such as winding up owing a percentage of some awful business or being landlord to the same.</p>

<p>Many aristocratic estates went broke for the same reason -- they were really just large farmsteads that evolved out of the feudal system.  They were run extremely inefficiently and after a couple of centuries of high living, the fortune was gone, taxes were up and labor costs skyrocketed making the entire operation unprofitable, especially if ag commodity prices collapsed.  Lots married rich American heiresses in the late 19th/early 20th centuries for a cash infusion.</p>

<p>If you think about it, had the Royal Family started investing during Victoria&#39;s reign in the 1850s it seems like their fortunes would be immeasurably vast -- basically getting in on the ground floor of every major British business empire.  But I think they were barred for reasons of propriety from investing.  I think now the Royal Family is more or less forced to invest in market investments because their lifestyle isn&#39;t financially and politically sustainable strictly on official income provided by the state.</p>

<p>Most of the royal family&#39;s assets aren&#39;t personally owned by them, they are crown property, and even the ones they own outright (Balmoral Castle, Sandringham House) although private property are probably of such historical value in their own right they are unsalable.    If you liquidated the Crown&#39;s property it would add up to a huge number, but so much of it is beyond market valuation or derives market valuation based on historical value it&#39;s hard to say what it&#39;s actually &quot;worth&quot; in terms of currency.</p>

<p>That&#39;s like saying:</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take life too serious, you&#39;ll never get out alive.</p>

<p>I think every generation wonders about the future of the world at first and then lives their adult life in full comprehension that no matter what their world is going to end (sometime soon) and they will definitely die.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there is an end-game or grand plot connecting all the dots.  There are just a lot of people in the world looking out for their best interests because everyone knows their world is going to end and that no one makes it out unscathed.  </p>

<p>That brings &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; into context.</p>

<p>there are still some good people here, but looking more and more at what happens around the world, it makes you wonder, are people good, or are they just pretending to be good?</p>

<p>looking out for their own interest is basically labeling everyone selfish. I can agree with that if everyone would just come out and say it, but hiding behind a &quot;World Hunger Foundation&quot; or a &quot;Save the Whales Organization&quot; makes us seems hypocritical when the endgame is just a way for self preservation.</p>

<p>I rather you come out and tell me: &quot;look the reason why we buy oil from Saudi is because they have a lot of it and we can buy it cheap, and in return we give them protection and guns&quot; that&#39;s it, be clear at your intentions and I would be fine with it.</p>

<p>But there are so many people that live in this dream world and in lala land that can&#39;t comprehend that people are selfish.</p>

<p>You are watching a soap opera.  There is no way he could have even ran for office if they didn&#39;t have him in their pockets.  They want you to believe he is &#39;your guy&#39; because people with ability would actually do something otherwise, it&#39;s pacification.  They could have killed and smeared him long before he was elected.</p>

<p>The owners of the federal reserve are the unseen oligarchy of the USA, they have trillions of dollars, we are their slaves, they don&#39;t want you to know or think about this.  Their goal is white genocide, then total enslavement and mass genocide down to 500 million total population on Earth.  Whites and large populations are too difficult to control.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It isn&#39;t about you being white. There is no utility in addressing a problem incorrectly.</p>

<p>Biased perception on your part. The people running the world don&#39;t hate white people. They hate threats to their own power. If Whites were all poor and most of the world&#39;s middle class was Chinese they&#39;d be singing a similar tune about Chinese people.&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>The regime isn&#39;t anti-white. It is very much anti-middle class because strong middle class families produce educated potent offspring that can become challengers to the regime. It happens to be the case that most such people in the world are white, so white people may seem to be the target of their actions. That is missing the bigger picture though.</p>

<p>Mass immigration primarily serves to undermine the middle class; it is meant as an economic rather than genetic threat. There is also the added benefit of people generally having in-group preferences and the resulting increase in tension within a society that is easy to exploit for the regime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aka capitalism. The elite and rich brainwash the lower classes to believe in &quot;pull yourself up by your bootstraps&quot; and to look down on anyone poor because they are obviously just poor because they are lazy. You are indoctrinated that you must live to work and if you don&#39;t then you don&#39;t deserve anything. All while the elite and rich fleece society and sit on their mounds of wealth that they exploited from the masses because they &quot;earned it&quot;. The elite and rich despise socialism because it would break up their mounds of wealth, hence why people are beaten over the head about the evils of socialism and yada yada yada. We are brainwashed to be against things that are actually in our own interests because the elite and rich want to remain the elite and rich.</p>

<p>Ditto what I wrote above. Define socialism for me. Then give me examples of former and current socialist states/countries. States/countries where workers and the average citizen controls the labor and means of production.</p>

<p>Then we can delve into the difference between socialism, marxism, trotskyism, anarchism, social democracy, democratic socialism and communism. </p>

<p>Capitalism is contingent upon private property rights. It just simply can&#39;t be a &quot;free&quot; market. In fact, I find it hard to believe any market is actually free because it would seem they would all require some form of property rules.</p>

Private property is the norm and is heavily enforced by military and law enforcement (a central authority), the work place is the epitome of a dictatorship and is also managed in the manner of a central authority, and workers are squeezed of nearly every ounce of bargaining power available to them whenever possible such that the surplus of their labor can be extracted from them.</p>

<p>Why doesn&#39;t this constitute intervention? This is special pleading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because as I&#39;ve stated, a libertarian, free market system exists under the premise of enforcement of contracts, protection of private property, and defense of the nation. Thats what I&#39;m advocating the government should enforce. Anything beyond that is a breach of free market capitalism. That is my argument - which states that the United States - does not operate under free market capitalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there is a solution. And to that I mean that we&#39;ve likely outgrown our habitat and industrial civilization will not survive, and considering it takes exactly that to extract the resources and fuel we require to keep 7.5 billion people alive, any alternative seems like it will be an active selection process of genocide.</p>

<p>An alternative I think could have kept humans alive sustainably would have been any alternative that 1) doesn&#39;t require constant growth of production or consumption and 2) is self-aware enough to have the foresight to understand overshoot.</p>

<p>Less forethinking, I&#39;d prefer any alternative that doesn&#39;t suffocate my own capacity to build and preserve a community with other humans; no more inherently authoritarian governing bodies that suffocate our own individual capacities for building and preserving our own communities. They are a technology whose purpose seems inherently destructive to the kind of life I prefer. This latter alternative may actually still be possible today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I see what you&#39;re saying and appreciate the response, the &#39;community&#39; you speak of is inherently a centrally planned government, no? Not that that is a bad thing, necessarily, but there has to be clear limits on that central governments authority, as I think we both agree. A socialistic society would have overwhelming control of the central authority, a &#39;democratically&#39; socialistic society would be rife with corruption, as I think our current model proves (as we are still, laughably, considered a democratic nation). Limiting government powers, while still granting the bare minimum, is, in my opinion, the best solution. Our current government (assuming you&#39;re living in the US) is over-reaching, wields entirely too much power, and is corrupt. Speaking in the left-right false paradigm, the left believes that the government is corrupt and needs to expand, the right believes that it is corrupt and needs to be reduced. Unfortunately both parties are corrupt, and want to expand. So neither party represents the people. This is an example of an over reaching government. </p>

<p>As you and me both believe we need government (or community) for basic functions, but it needs to be extremely limited, and accountable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with you, schizo_costume (meaningfully or not) has raised an interesting question. What is moral? Who determines morality? In a purely free market system, force would have to be applied to protect property. Libertarians (like myself) would give government the power to protect property/enforce contracts, but is that not an intrusion in to the free market? (i&#39;m being argumentative only because this same question was posed to me and I couldn&#39;t answer it)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I come at this from an anarchist point of view. There would be no government to enforce anything including property rights. The idea that you don&#39;t own or have use rights to the means and product of your labor doesn&#39;t make any sense to me. So of course you shouldn&#39;t infringe on those property rights because it would be theft but &quot;enforcing&quot; that right would be impossible to answer because if it were &quot;enforced&quot; it would be by the individual in one form or another (I&#39;m not trying to get into the weeds of how &quot;enforcement&quot; may or may not be done because we could spend all day talking about it). It is also entirely possible that the individual may not enforce their property rights. I still think it boils down to the moral question of do you have the right or entitlement to take the fruits of someone else&#39;s labor? Is it moral to do so without consent?</p>

<li>1 - Private property owned by individuals with legitimacy granted by a government that respects private property.</li>

<p>It is saying far more than you seem to understand.</p>

<p>The &quot;constraint&quot; you speak of is actually a defending against the constraints that third party parasites want to impose on others without their consent.  </p>

<p>Nobody constrained you when they produced a widget using their own means of production.  The fact you do not control those particular means is the flip side fact of other people&#39;s plans not being constrained by you.</p>

<p>I was speaking from the perspective of a laborer who does not want you or anyone else stealing from me in the name of helping me.</p>

<p>Nice try though.  I also read the passages in Marx where he writes that economic science and civilized behavior is really just an apologia for bourgiosie class interests.  He, like yourself, could not refute the economists on the basis of logic and evidence, so he tried to convince himself that logic and evidence are artificial class interest drivers and are not to be trusted.</p>

<p>Hence, rather than address the arguments on merit, the tactic is to retreat into &quot;you are just speaking capitalist apologia.&quot;</p>

<p>Did you know that I am better off NOT owning Toyota than owning it?  If I owned it, given my experience and skill set, the company would go belly up, and I would not be able to live in a world with those cars and thus be deprived of ever owning one.</p>

<p>This may shock you, but wealth inequality under freedom of competition is not only not a bad thing, but a positively good thing because it is consistent with the undeniable, empirically confirmed fact of the human condition that humans are not inherently equally productive, intelligent, driven, or caring.  With the law of comparative advantage, it is a good thing that the most productive should under freedom of competition come to own more means of production.  More gets produced that way!  It is like the difference between putting a basketball in Michael Jordan&#39;s hands as opposed to my hands. </p>

<p>The individual consumers determine who gets the biggest slices by their consumption spending decisions.  </p>

<p>I did answer.  I answered by taking what you said, and not merely keeping it as useless talk, but instead I looked to the analogue of what you said in the realm of practical activity.  In activity, that is what you would be doing if the assumptions made that you have made the choice to reject individual property rights.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Because you are not being intruded on when others stop you from intruding.  The reason you would be an intruder is because prior to your action, there was no intrusion from either voluntary exchange party.  It is only with your action that violating consent arises.</p>

<p>Nobody is acting against your consent by using their own persons and property.  You do not own the world.</p>

<p>Private property is not &quot;imposed&quot; against you.  When a person steps foot on land not stepped foot on before, and builds a home, the house being occupied by the builder is not an act against your person or your property.</p>

<p>You keep talking about the supposed issue of there being a lack of consent from a would be trespasser or thief when they are stopped.  But them being stopped is the stoppage of an original act of non consensual activity.  The defense thereafter is not the original non consensual act.  </p>

<p>Capitalists don&#39;t steal from me, they pay me money in accordance with a contract I voluntarily signed.</p>

<p>The fact that total wages paid now tends to be less than total product sales revenues earned in the future is due to the existence of the time value of money, of time preference.</p>

<p>Nobody is stealing from me should I agree to sell my TV to them for $200 after which they turn around and sell it to someone else for $250.  That extra $50 is not mine.  The $200 I agreed to accept with the buyer, that is mine.</p>

<p>Except private property norms require enforcement regardless of consent. So it&#39;s not an answer to the question it&#39;s a complete ignoring of conditions of enforcement so you can say the question doesn&#39;t apply.

<p>You never once validly substantiated the enforcement of private property as constituting something other than 3rd party intrusion regardless of consent. You never explained what you meant by the marx comment. You just went on wild tangent after tangent to try and dodge and obfuscate. And the funniest thing of all is that your ideological boner for private property violates your very own conditions for what renders property legitimate in the first place. Look up primitive accumulation by dispossession, look up surplus-labor, hell..give a cursory glance at the activity of state and capital power disparities that manifest in forms of law formation and law-enforcement as well as military activity. All of that is in defense of capitalism and none of it is with consent in mind. None of it at all.</p>

<p>This is honestly total bunk dude. On paper, are there ways to fairly distribute wealth to all people, sure. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Besides socialism or some iteration of socialism, what is there? Name them. An economic model that would legitimately work and work fairly to everyone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you deal with the fact that humans respond to rewards - how does your government or whatever centrally planned entity you envision properly allocate wealth? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some socialists support some sort of central planning while others advocate denctralized/democratic planning where the general decides supply and demand democratically. What&#39;s left out is the profit motive, which is the lifeblood of capitalism.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think a human being needs a carrot hanging from a stick in front of his or her face in order for society to function and prosper, running away like a hamster on a wheel almost its entire life. </p>

<p>People would still work. Still get paid. Businesses would be owned and operated by the workers/people. The first stage would be capitalism evolving into socialism, slowly. It would be difficult for any socialist state/country to prosper on its own because for it to succeed it would have to have a closed economy and not trade with capitalist countries or incur debt in their currency because a socialist state/country entering into the international economy would be at the whim of the global market and its currency would have to go through the rollercoaster of value and value stacked against the dollar, for instance. It would quickly get sacked with debt and owe to capitalist countries and the worth of its own currency would plummet on the world market and its debt it dollars, for example, would just grow. A worldwide or near worldwide change would have to happen for socialism&#39;s foothold to take root and I think that will eventually be forced to happen given automation and future technological advances.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t advocate anything like what happened to the USSR. I don&#39;t believe in a dictatorial government that has power over the masses. The few should never rule the many. I believe in democracy, unlike the US&#39;s current representative republic, which itself is a sham.</p>

<p>Too often people conflate socialism—the economic model—with politics and the power of dictatorships because most states/countries that have attempted socialism either failed or were overthrown by the CIA. Stalin killed socialism in the USSR after Lenin died and Trotsky was excommunicated.</p>

<p>Why do we as a species need to be chained to the profit motive in order to prosper as a species? Can&#39;t we do better? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it the same for everyone? If so, where does the motivation to work come from. Is it merit based? If so, why do you believe central planners can determine merit based allowances better than a market can? How do you weed out corruption from the central planners? Honestly interested, if you have a link to a source that you feel adequately addresses these issues, that&#39;ll suffice too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is the US military and its various branches, essentially? Socialism. Every cent is taxes pooled together to pay these men and women to do a needed skill that we as an entire society need them to do. These soldiers don&#39;t get paid via the profit motive—their checks are paid for and signed by you and me and every citizen in the country. </p>

<p>Now widen that model that works for soldiers to every citizen. You just have to take away greed from the equation. </p>

<p>And I wouldn&#39;t know how exactly everything would work under an actual realistic socialist system because it has never truly happened on a wide scale.</p>

<p>I could get into the dynamics of money and how we shouldn&#39;t let our lives be ruled by sheets of paper with imaginary value but I always get yelled out when I do that. That would be pure communism though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;because socialism goes against human nature&quot; </p>

<p>I would say that&#39;s wrong. Before the feudal system and system of classes came up at the end of the stone age the people lived in equally (still small) societies, at least science has no proof that there was something like an elitist class. That was just a few thousand years ago and still today some tribes do life that way.</p>

<p>Also don&#39;t forget the more worse side of capitalism, the plunder of our natural ressources and with all the consume hype the always growing mountains of waste we produce.</p>

<p>A good concept of socialism defines itself not by prohibiting individuality or individual property, but it should tkae care that it&#39;s not to the disadvantage for the rest of the society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes indeed it had/has something to do with survival, but the whole point is that the whole community got it&#39;s benefits from it, and not only a chosen few or your benefits depend on which level of the society you are, at least not as much as it does now or it was within the feudal system.
Seizing the means of production is clearly not the alternative for everything, but some things like infrastructure, medical supplies, education should be kept under control by the society and not by some private owners.
I would also go that far to say that the state/society should hold at least a level of control over the ressources/production for the main sources of food.</p>

<p>Socialism is no different then the stone age and the first men and tribes. The individual tribes were a microcosm of socialist societies—self sufficient and without the exchange of money and without the profit motive. The tribe took care of itself, always. Then the individual tribes would trade with each other. Pure communism. Then as humans have advanced so has greed and the accumulation of wealth by the few over the many. Kings and Queens and feudalism gave way to what we currently have. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/%7Ecottrell/socialism_book/calculation_debate.pdf">This paper offers a reassessment of the socialist calculation debate, and examines the extent to which the conclusions
of that debate must be modified in the light of the subsequent development of the theory and technology of computation.
Following an introduction to the two main perspectives on the debate which have been offered to date, we
examine the classic case mounted by von Mises against the possibility of rational economic calculation under socialism.
We discuss the response given by Oskar Lange, along with the counter-arguments to Lange from the Austrian
point of view. Finally we present what we call the ‘absent response’, namely a re-assertion of the classic Marxian
argument for economic calculation in terms of labour time. We argue that labour-time calculation is defensible as a rational
procedure, when supplemented by algorithms which allow consumer choice to guide the allocation of resources,
and that such calculation is now technically feasible with the type of computing machinery currently available in the
West and with a careful choice of efficient algorithms. Our argument cuts against recent discussions of economic
planning which continue to assert that the task is of hopeless complexity.

    <div class="md"><p>No capitalism does not require a state, and not only that, but pure capitalism is incompatible with states.</p>

<p>The belief that states are a creation to defend capitalism is another Marxist lie.</p>

<p>Private production of securi and defense.  Google it.</p>

<p>Property is not a purely legal construct.  There are implied rules for property in any society.  There is no such thing as a society without a system of rules for who gets to do what with means of production.</p>

<p>He capitalist class does not rule, the violence class rules.  Socialism and states are in the violence class because they are founded on and require perpetual violence of the aggressive sort, against the producers of wealth.  Socialist &quot;representatives&quot; are necessarily unproductive parasites who use coercion to compel producers what to do, instead of the producers deciding what to do.</p>

<p>Socialism is inherently tyrannical.  It is not even a positive system.  It is merely the negation of individual property rights.  Unmitigated and naked violence is the necessary ingredient in order to ban private property for everyone.  A centralized police force is required to enforce a universal system of denial of private property.  Otherwise in peace people will act capitalistically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The establishment of ownership of land for development has not always existed. Land was not owned in hunter-gatherer times. And furthermore, under modern theory of what gives one rights to property, actual infrastructure development is needed, which has certainly not always existed. At some point, someone drove a metaphorical stake in the ground, declared property as their own, then maintained their claim through violence, either implicit or explicit. I am referring of course, to private property, which is distinct from communal and personal property, where communal property is owned by a community and personal property refers to things meant for personal use/consumption. Things like houses and toothbrushes are personal property, but things like factories and farms are private property. Under socialism, private property would be transferred to communal property such that factories and such would be owned communally by either those who provide labor for them or the community as a whole.</p>

<p>The notion of private property is rather young, actually. If you want a solid empirical example of a society without private property, many primitive societies operated entirely within the confines of communal and personal properties, such as the Seneca Iroquois. The notion of private property doesn&#39;t even make sense at all if you look at hunter-gatherer societies. Private property is only present in societies with a legal notion that an individual can indeed own and derive wealth from something that used by many. The philosophical justification for this was really only hammered put around the 17th century. This had a massive influence on how laws regarding the rights to private property in liberal governments formed, hence why it is entirely a legal construct. Lockean conceptions of natural property right are based in false appeals to nature, which Smith corrected for, but Locke&#39;s influence still remains culturally. There is no right to private property beyond that which the state deems legal and there never has been. Socialism only rejects the notion of private property, not communal or personal property. You can still own things, you just can&#39;t have unilateral ownership of things other people use and derive wealth from it. </p>

<p>The establishment of a private entity for providing violence is only meaningful in the sense that said violence is used to enforce a set of rules. Even in the most fractured case, a capitalist society in the absence of a conventional government would still end up simply being a collection of microstates. The capitalist mode of production in inexorably bound to the institution of private property and the ability to enforce it through violence. While not governments in our modern conceptions of various nation-state governments, such a body that creates and executes laws that govern society is inevitably a government.</p>

<p>Your conception of the violence class is frankly moronic, since social order as well as social revolution has always been maintained  and fueled through the threat of violence one way or another throughout history. Capitalists are indeed the ruling class, this has been empirically proven by Gilens and Page, if you want a solid statistical model for the modern United States as an example. But it is also pretty obvious considering that the modern governments founded on the principles of liberalism were quite literally constructed by and for the emerging capitalist class following bourgeois revolutions that ended the feudal era. People from the capitalist class have always held the majority power in guiding policy in liberal states.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the capitalists are not the &quot;producers&quot;. Labor produces value. It&#39;s also pretty laughable that you think democratic ownership of the means of production is inherently tyrannical. You do realize that full employee ownership in a market system still falls under the umbrella of socialism, right? The notion that the abolishment of private property, an institution that hasn&#39;t even always existed, needs a central authority to be ensured, is also absolutely moronic.</p>

<p>Thinking the capitalist system rewards merit is also entirely ridiculous. With private property, capital, and inheritance, it&#39;s very clear at a glance that socioeconomic class is tied more to circumstance of birth than actual merit. And that isn&#39;t even considering how education and health are strongly correlated with the class you are born into. Indeed, the single greatest predictor of your socioeconomic class is that of your parents. Capitalism still produces very clear social and economic stratification that is easily statistically verified. A moron born to a billionaire tycoon will far far better than a genius born in a meth lab the vast majority of the time. It&#39;s still a genetic lottery, just like the feudal system before it.</p>

<p>Its pretty clear you&#39;re incredibly ignorant with regards to what capitalism and socialism actually are in addition to history.</p>

<p>Do the people/workers own the means of production in Venezuela or does a dictatorial government? Last I checked if a state/country doesn&#39;t even meet the very definition of socialism then it therefore can&#39;t be socialist. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in a government of the few having total power of the many. I don&#39;t believe in the government—the select few—having total or even quasi control over the means of production within a state/country. That&#39;s not socialism to me. That&#39;s the thing people like you don&#39;t realize—socialists aren&#39;t a hegemony.

<p>Is this your personal blog or are you going to hit me with facts and knowledge of socialism? Ah, you want to tie an economic model to government tyranny? How about I lay the slaughtered Native Americans, all the slaves over 200 + years and the millions dead Vietnamese and Iraqis and more at the feet of capitalism? Ah, you wouldn&#39;t like that now would you? Yet it&#39;s a two way street. I can list the evils of capitalism for days. We can play that game—child labor during the industrial age and Jim Crow racism. Capitalism at work! I&#39;m sure those people who were born into the bonds of slavery and died in those same bonds throughout the 1700s and 1800s in the US would like to have a word about grand old capitalism. </p>

<p>Yes, the profit motive based off exploitation of other humans for profit and greed. It amazes me people like you champion capitalism but don&#39;t understand what it in its purest unfettered form—laissez faire capitalism—would do to the US if realized. No regulations—the market decides everything. You want to humanize capitalism by giving it the trappings of socialism like a minimum wage, labor standards, social security, food stamps and worker&#39;s rights via unions. Yet if capitalism was given its full potential that same innate human greed that you speak of that would cause socialism to never work would wreak havoc on society and led to a modern day version of Kings and Queens and peasantry. The business and corporations would be the kings and queens and feudal lords and the masses would be peasants. </p>

<p>I&#39;m confused because in socialism there wouldn&#39;t be anyone deemed <em>poor</em> as we currently have with capitalism. </p>

<p>Ah, you must have fallen victim to libertarianism. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t have true unfettered laissez faire capitalism precisely because it&#39;s too harsh. In true survival of the fittist capitalism there would be no minimum wage or labor laws and the market would dictate everything. Everyone and everything would be at the mercy of the wealthy and elite who play Wall Street like a gambling table at the casinos. We would all be peasants given scraps because if nothing to there telling these businesses and corporations to do better for their workers then why would they do better for their workers? I keep hearing about how socialism can&#39;t work because of human nature and by human nature they mean greed and the accumulation of wealth. Why stops the greed of the few who own the means of production in a true laissez faire capitalist system? It would be nothing but a modern day version of Kings and Queens and nobleman and the masses would be peasants. Most companies don&#39;t give a shit about their workers now, I can&#39;t imagine what things would be like with unfettered capitalism. I shudder to think such a thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When WWII was fought over capitalism, then i wonder how so many german industrialists got profit from that war. Well there was a big nationalistic part of it, but the whole production of goods was still in the hands of the capitalists except when you were jewish then your property got seized.</p>

<p>Regarding your other statement, in my ideal world you would only contribute when you participate and bring in some work, and i would push that so far that when you work better, harder, longer, in more dangerous areas or in a more qualified position then you should also benefit from that more than someone only doing the minimum, but not in such a way as it is nowadays. Well nowadays it depends more from were you come and how wealthy you already are or what ressourrces you have access to.</p>

<p>Well innovation and motivation might be a bit less perhaps, but if i could choose if i want to life in a world with smart phones and flat screens or in a world with &quot;normal&quot; cellphone but with no one starving to death, an affordable home, health care, education (also university) for everyone, i would choose option two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are conflating an economic model with the evil actions of a government that claims to have that economic model. Can I not then lay at the feet of capitalism the slaughter of the Native Americans, 200+ years of slavery and Jim Crow, child labor and multiple misbegotten wars that have slaughtered millions in Vietnam, Iraq and numerous more? The Great Depression and the Dust Bowl? Rampant racism unheard of in Russia? That&#39;s a two way street. </p>

<p>Capitalism into socialism and then eventual communism would be slow and gradually. It would have to be because of the taking away of the profit motive—we would all have to adjust and reeducate ourselves. It would be a different society, totally unlike the US, for example. </p>

<p>What gets you up out of bed every day to go to work? The fear of being broke and homeless? Not having a roof over your head and food in your belly? Now take away that fear but be given a choice of any job you want and the time to study and master those needed skills while growing up as a child.</p>

<p>Your view is that if human beings were automatically clothed and fed and given housing by everyone else in the society as a whole then there would be no motivation for anyone to do anything. They&#39;d just lay around and get fat and innovation would die. Which to me is a really vacant and cynical view of human beings and society. Poor people on welfare in the US are that way because they are trapped in the system of capitalism and their labor is worthless in a capitalist society where one has to jump through hoops to even acquire a job that pays barely enough to live off of and survive. We can do better. I have faith in humanity.</p>

I don&#39;t assume a wealthy person who doesn&#39;t labor, and instead lives on the labor of others...is any more predatory as the poor single mother who does the same thing via welfare. Sure, there are huge differences in quality of life, but that doesn&#39;t make one inherently bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither do I.</p>

<p>What I KNOW is that some people are in fact better than others.</p>

<p>I know this because the concepts of &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot;,  refer to all those possible outcomes, human interactions, etc, for a person&#39;s utility.  </p>

<p>In your quest to sound better than you really are, apologizing unnecessarily, on your soapbox saying I should feel guilt for knowing with every point in the infinite number that is my existence, that because different people have different ideas, it is absolutely the case that everyone is NOT equal, that in the same exact way that some ideas are in fact better than other ideas, so too by necessary logical extension, some people are in fact better than others.</p>

<p>I have absolutely no qualms with understanding and accepting the fact that there are in fact other people in this world who are better than me in a lot of ways.</p>

<p>Have you considered the possibility that you are virtue signalling like this is because you have narcissistic tendencies yourself and cannot tolerate others being better than you, so the reason you said what you said is to convince yourself nobody is better than you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve written four paragraphs trying to say some people are objectively better people than others. Instead all you actually wrote is that some people are better at different tasks.</p>

<p>In my years of being a robotics mentor, I&#39;ve learned it&#39;s very important to separate the task from the person. Every year we have people who are better at programming, assembling, designing, talking to businesses, fundraising, cheering at comps. But in terms of the robotics team, every student and mentor is an equal. We respect each other&#39;s fields and abilities, but if we had a mentality of some of us are better than others, our preformamce and enjoyment of the sport would drop significantly.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t virtue signaling with &quot;I don&#39;t believe in others being more equal than others.&quot; Merely I was pointing out that ESOP are entirely built in that premise. If you wanted to suggest a business model that was actually equal and something I support under capitalism, it would be cooperatives. No managers need to exist in them. They are about worker control over the workplace and self management. While I still have my critiques about them, they&#39;re a hell of a lot better than other top down forms most businesses use. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is enslavement. The rich don&#39;t think themselves equal to us; we&#39;re not people, we&#39;re sheep, slaves. They think they&#39;re superior to the rest of us and are thus &quot;entitled&quot; to what they have by blood and birth. They were put here on this earth to be catered to, and we are here to serve them. The rich are just royalty under a different name. Feudalism is far from dead in this world. </p>

<p>And yes on all your points, it is an easier life when you&#39;re rich, unquestionably. It is a happier existence when you don&#39;t have to worry where your next meal will come from. You want to take a vacation to some tropical paradise? You got it. You want a big house with a pool in a sunny location? Done. You need a life changing operation that most people can&#39;t afford?

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s to live a good life doing whatever you want while you&#39;re alive and passing whatever you have left to your children so they can enjoy the same. </p>

<p>Wealth also doesn&#39;t just mean access to material things, it means access to experiences otherwise unavailable to most people, like buying islands, rare works of art, trips to restricted places, access to secret information, etc. </p>

<p>In some cases, you can buy people or children and do with them what you will. Look at Jeffrey Epstein and his &quot;orgy island&quot;. Or someone like Harvey Weinstein who used his money and power to rape and extort countless actresses and models. </p>

<p>These people do these things because they can, because, given enough power and money, no one will stop them. Sure, they&#39;ll all die in the end, but they&#39;ll die having done things very few people have or will. It&#39;s about experiences. Anyone can buy a nice house or a fancy car, but very few have enough power and money to purchase an island they then fill with underage girls who cater to their every whim ala Epstein. </p>

<p>Also, some of these people are sociopaths. Some are mentally ill. And some of them are just in it to destroy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak for all rich people everywhere, but yes, vanity, I&#39;m sure, is a major part of it. They may not think so, but they&#39;re just people like you and me; some do it for vanity, others because it&#39;s fun, others because they think it&#39;s their right as a member of the &quot;superior&quot; race, and everything in between. Some are deeply religious and think their fortune is a sign from God. And some accumulate just because they can, because they&#39;re bored and want to see how far they can go. </p>

<p>Just like you and me, everyone has their reasons and beliefs and goals. Everyone is different, and no two people think exactly alike. There&#39;s no one answer that explains everything. Human beings are complex and sometimes do great harm unintentionally, as might be the case for many of these rich who genuinely believe they&#39;re superior because that&#39;s all they&#39;ve ever been taught. Regardless, they&#39;re doing great harm and need to be stopped one way or another. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where did this idea come from that once some form of wealth was acquired it couldn&#39;t be taxed more than once?  Property is taxed every year and in most cases, the property actually materially deteriorates over time while taxes nearly always increase, and property taxes are usually payed with income already taxed.  Most places have a sales tax paid on purchases, again paid with income already taxed.</p>

<p>IMHO, taxes serve two basic functions -- provide revenue for government operations and to serve as economic incentives/disincentives for specific economic and social goals.  The estate tax is mostly the latter -- to prevent dynastic wealth accumulation and avoid the creation of an aristocratic political class.</p>

<p>There are indeed some problems associated with estate taxes, such as passing family farms or family business&#39; to heirs without taxation that makes the economic entity being passed non-viable.  It&#39;s also questionable how successful estate taxation has been in preventing long-term family dynasties.  </p>

<p>I would guess that it&#39;s a less a problem with the estate tax as a concept than the politics associated with it.  The politics around it probably revolve around not reforming it to make the family business a stalking horse for eliminating it as just unfair, mostly to benefit the very rich.  It&#39;s probably also less successful in minimizing family dynasties because of the many other tax loopholes and avoidance strategies available.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would have guessed that, but every time the concept is discussed the official anti-estate tax example is always some family farm or small business that can&#39;t cash flow the estate taxes and has to sell off its assets, essentially rendering the enterprise defunct.</p>

<p>I actually know of a very similar example -- my wife&#39;s best friend&#39;s family owned the bank in their small town.  Her dad (who actually ran the bank until he died) was a savvy investor and owned a lot of assets, mostly farmland but some other business interests.  When he died, the mom became the non-managing owner, and when she died my wife&#39;s friend and her siblings inherited it all.  Anyway, they had to sell the bank to pay off the estate taxes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more complicated because I think at that point it wasn&#39;t a &quot;family business&quot; besides owning it and there were other assets involved in the estate, and generally the estate was large enough even after the asset sales that none of the survivors had to work again -- and this is just from some podunk bank in a podunk town plus accumulated assets.</p>

<p>Anyway, to the extent that this was a &quot;problem&quot; for them probably was just crummy estate planning.  The mom probably didn&#39;t do more than cash checks and sign forms from the accountant, and the kids never asked questions about the estate as long as the money kept coming in.  Had the kids worked in the bank, been actual shareholders, etc, I&#39;m sure they would have held onto it.</p>

The IRS is more than willing to work out terms to keep a family businesses intact and able to generate an income for involved families even if the parents did a horrible job setting up legal avoidance schemes. If they had their own jobs or businesses and didn&#39;t do anything to help manage the family business, then I have little sympathy for the estate being sold off to cover the tax bills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I forget the specific details, but I think the dad died unexpectedly and the mom who first inherited the business really didn&#39;t know anything about it.  The kids never worked in it AFAIK, so by the time mom died it was a giant cash machine to the kids, not a complex estate or business to &quot;manage&quot;.</p>

<p>Even if they did everything wrong, they still wound up &quot;rich&quot; by local standards -- two brothers don&#39;t work at all, own homes, snowmobiles, get new cars regularly, etc.  My wife&#39;s friend actually does work, but as a high school teacher, but she doesn&#39;t even need to work and they own a giant cabin, drive luxury cars, take big trips, etc.</p>

<p>Had the dad lived long enough, I suspect he would have managed the estate transfer better but I think it would have been best if family members had actually worked in it.  I think they could have done some kind of stock purchase setup that would have transferred the core of the business to family members.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just another example of how the wealthy exploit the legal system to stay wealthy and/or increase their wealth, which the &quot;Everyday Joe&quot;/&quot;Everyday Sally&quot; gets smashed for putting a &quot;zero&quot; in the wrong on their tax return (or something equally miniscule)...</p>

<p>Only some of these people actually broke the law, but virtually all of them are guilty of unethical practices - but nothing will happen to them.</p>

<p>Of course not!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So.. they seem to make a big deal out of Nicole Kidman is in the database.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty lame though, if you follow the [wikipedia entry}(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_and_companies_named_in_the_Paradise_Papers#cite_note-huffaus-42">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_and_companies_named_in_the_Paradise_Papers#cite_note-huffaus-42</a>) to an article it just says:</p>

<p>&quot;Actress Nicole Kidman and her husband Keith Urban are also named in the papers; The Australian Financial Review reported the pair registered a limited liability partnership in Tennessee in 2014. The company, Island 67 LLC, was then registered in in the Bahamas in March 2015 as a foreign company attempting to buy land in the country.&quot;</p>

<p>So she&#39;s trying to buy some land in Bahamas and does it via a corporation there. This is perfectly normal people, I mean what would YOU do if you wanted to buy some land there?</p>

<p>Jeeez...</p>

<p>They&#39;re sensationalising BS, like saying 500.000 entitites listed!! OMG! Yeah great, so it&#39;s just a company database. Doesn&#39;t say anything about legality of those corps. </p>

<p>Does the same bad shit happen under Socialism? You betcha.</p>

<p>So you&#39;ve shown ZERO practical difference between the two. &quot;Workers and average citizens&quot; will NEVER control the means of production. There will ALWAYS be a hierarchy involved. And when there&#39;s a hierarchy, there&#39;s the possibility of corruption. And where there&#39;s a <em>possibility</em> of corruption, corruption will occur. That&#39;s just human nature.</p>

<p>At least Capitalism is based on individual rights. I&#39;ll take those over fictional &quot;group rights&quot; any day</p>

<p>So why is Socialism better than Capitalism again?</p>

<p>We have the evidence of the ills of capitalism—the last 100 years</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The world has gotten incredibly better in the past 100 years on almost every level, from social to scientific. Capitalism has brought with it countless advances in medicine, sciences, transportation - you name it. Capitalism is about the freedom to start a company and run it how you wish. That leads to great things. Socialism is about giving government more power and control over the people, which is exactly the problem with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where did this idea come from that once some form of wealth was acquired it couldn&#39;t be taxed more than once?  Property is taxed every year and in most cases, the property actually materially deteriorates over time while taxes nearly always increase, and property taxes are usually payed with income already taxed.  Most places have a sales tax paid on purchases, again paid with income already taxed.</p>

<p>IMHO, taxes serve two basic functions -- provide revenue for government operations and to serve as economic incentives/disincentives for specific economic and social goals.  The estate tax is mostly the latter -- to prevent dynastic wealth accumulation and avoid the creation of an aristocratic political class.</p>

<p>There are indeed some problems associated with estate taxes, such as passing family farms or family business&#39; to heirs without taxation that makes the economic entity being passed non-viable.  It&#39;s also questionable how successful estate taxation has been in preventing long-term family dynasties.  </p>

<p>I would guess that it&#39;s a less a problem with the estate tax as a concept than the politics associated with it.  The politics around it probably revolve around not reforming it to make the family business a stalking horse for eliminating it as just unfair, mostly to benefit the very rich.  It&#39;s probably also less successful in minimizing family dynasties because of the many other tax loopholes and avoidance strategies available.</p>
