       Interesting, I tend to shy away from anonymous predictions, but looks like they did have insider info:

       Not really, I've been wrong in the past plenty and learned to operate on actual evidence rather than other people's  speculations... especially on a site that has so many various people with various agendas.  Also, believe is a strong word, I'm always open to ideas infact I have various conspiracy theories that discredit each other if obe of them was true.  But tell me more about the issues you seem to have with me, I'm all ears.

       Not blindly. You have to use your brain and see if it makes sense. Is it rational and realistic? Of course you're not bright enough to do this so you need evidence. Not to mention your low self esteem won't allow you to take a risk to accept something that doesn't have overwhelming evidence with giant red arrows pointing to one direction. Basically you are a weak sheep-minded person with low intellect and low self-esteem and I want stray away from you as much as possible. Just stop commenting on posts so I don't have to see your trash comments.

       That's like saying you want to shut off the judging part of your brain when you can't. You will always inherently judge in your head as a human being. That's why all humans have biases and prejudices even when they try not to be. You simply can't. But you pretend like you can because you are a low self-esteem coward.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason you're saying "oh I won't believe in it unless there's evidence" is so you can SAVE FACE and CODDLE YOUR LOW SELF ESTEEM. In reality, you already have the judgment in your head but you don't want to say it to look stupid in front of people. The problem is to smart people like me YOU ALREADY LOOK STUPID.

       ...I know, I know, it's because I'm a moron with low self-esteem and actually requiring evidence to entertain specific theories.  You should start a cult, if you can find people as dumb as you want them to be, I'm sure they'll believe in your BS thought process.

       It wasn't a prediction. Prediction would be a guess based on other info, like predicting trump will be impeached be a use of so many Russian connections. This was actual knowledge and information he had. Semantically and technically it was almost a leak.

       It's a prediction if he didn't know it was going to happen. He knew it was going to happen, hence why he had inside info such as their name and targets. His prediction was the date, as he did not know that. Also, and FYI, it was proven true to HIM--just not to us. That's why it wasn't a prediction because it was already proven true (just not from our limited perspective).

       Hilarious exchange. :) I was a little confused too, so I thought about it. If I see trains passing by every hour on the hour, but dont have a train schedule in front of me, I can make a "prediction" that the next train will also come on the hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if I have a schedule in front of me listing train times, it's no longer a prediction. I simply "know" when the trains are supposed to come, so if I tell anyone, it's me spreading info.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, it can be either a prediction OR leak depending on the source of OP's info. Since none of us know, the classification cannot be made definitely.

      <p>
       It's still a prediction by definition, also a prediction is still information that can be spread.

       A leak and a prediction have nothing to do with one or the other.  The like was today, the prediction was 2 weeks ago.  They gave us a heads up to keep our eye peeled and said when the leak was and who it pertained to, but it wasn't a leak of raw data, it was a prediction.

       People shouldn't be downvoting you. Truth should be revealed in all of its forms, but I was suspicious about the Panama Papers being a West-driven leak against its enemies (hence its Rothschild funding)... but given the recent events, the timing of the Paradise Papers isn't helping my initial assertion. Not to mention the "going to be released" (ie, giving a few hours of possible negotiations with certain players).
