    <div class="md"><p>Not blindly. You have to use your brain and see if it makes sense. Is it rational and realistic? Of course you&#39;re not bright enough to do this so you need evidence. Not to mention your low self esteem won&#39;t allow you to take a risk to accept something that doesn&#39;t have overwhelming evidence with giant red arrows pointing to one direction. Basically you are a weak sheep-minded person with low intellect and low self-esteem and I want stray away from you as much as possible.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s like saying you want to shut off the judging part of your brain when you can&#39;t. You will always inherently judge in your head as a human being. That&#39;s why all humans have biases and prejudices even when they try not to be. You simply can&#39;t. But you pretend like you can because you are a low self-esteem coward.</p>

<p>The only reason you&#39;re saying &quot;oh I won&#39;t believe in it unless there&#39;s evidence&quot; is so you can SAVE FACE and CODDLE YOUR LOW SELF ESTEEM. In reality, you already have the judgment in your head but you don&#39;t want to say it to look stupid in front of people. The problem is to smart people like me YOU ALREADY LOOK STUPID.</p>

<p>Haha, is this your shtick, go around crying about people who don&#39;t agree with your point of view or have actual standard&#39;s when looking at conspiracies? </p>

<p>...I know, I know, it&#39;s because I&#39;m a moron with low self-esteem and actually requiring evidence to entertain specific theories.  You should start a cult, if you can find people as dumb as you want them to be, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll believe in your BS thought process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hilarious exchange. :) I was a little confused too, so I thought about it. If I see trains passing by every hour on the hour, but dont have a train schedule in front of me, I can make a &quot;prediction&quot; that the next train will also come on the hour.</p>

<p>However, if I have a schedule in front of me listing train times, it&#39;s no longer a prediction. I simply &quot;know&quot; when the trains are supposed to come, so if I tell anyone, it&#39;s me spreading info.</p>

<p>Basically, it can be either a prediction OR leak depending on the source of OP&#39;s info. Since none of us know, the classification cannot be made definitely.</p>

<p>A leak and a prediction have nothing to do with one or the other.  The like was today, the prediction was 2 weeks ago.  They gave us a heads up to keep our eye peeled and said when the leak was and who it pertained to, but it wasn&#39;t a leak of raw data, it was a prediction.</p>

<p>The only reason you&#39;re saying &quot;oh I won&#39;t believe in it unless there&#39;s evidence&quot; is so you can SAVE FACE and CODDLE YOUR LOW SELF ESTEEM. </p>

<p>Haha, is this your shtick, go around crying about people who don&#39;t agree with your point of view or have actual standard&#39;s when looking at conspiracies? </p>

<p>...I know, I know, it&#39;s because I&#39;m a moron with low self-esteem and actually requiring evidence to entertain specific theories.  You should start a cult, if you can find people as dumb as you want them to be, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll believe in your BS thought process.</p>
