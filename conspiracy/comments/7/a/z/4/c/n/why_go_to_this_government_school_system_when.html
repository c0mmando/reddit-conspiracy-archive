       Just wondering if anyone else has had a change of perspective towards public education since the internet has become packed with info on many many topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was in school before the internet , but thinking back I wonder what difference it would of made, I think having this access to this much info would of allowed me to follow my own interests instead of a preconceived lesson plan full of information that I question now. Is what I was taught the truth? I don't think all of it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see being taught the basics like language, but that really takes about a year or so in early development to get that.  But after that why not have a system where the child can learn what they wanted? Kids are smart and know what interests them. And then later in years enter into the requirements to become that trade or profession?  Why do we have to pay for this?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a conspiracy too because I think the education system is dumbing down people anyway. Forcing us to participate in it in its current form ? It's teaching people to believe what they are told ,to get a grade. The people who have a genuine interest in any subject will find out what is know about it already. And some Kids aren't interested in all subjects so they are set up to be failures for lacking curiosity in some things. Looking back again I can see how much negative reinforcement and fear there was in not being a success.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short once I graduated I did something else that I liked. But I would probably be even better at it had I followed the passion naturally instead of being made to participate in many other things I didn't like or want.  So in that way school has confined free will into a preset group of choices and forcing you to participate against your will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Along with the laws associated with this that reinforce the idea of having to participate. Like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Compulsory education laws require children to attend a public or state-accredited private school for a certain period of time. There are certain exceptions, most notably homeschooling, but virtually all states have mandates for when children must begin school and how old they must be before dropping out."
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy here is what is the child being taught during those 'required years?'
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure homeschooling has been given a certain curriculum as well and timeline even though the child isn't in school they still get the education from the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm wrong and the education system is perfect and great now, let me know. But the thing I wonder, is this working, are we as intelligent and free as we can be? Does the internet make public school obsolete?

       It really is impressive to see response to an attack with such lightheartedness. It shows how much lower of a vibration hate is compared to joy, love, compassion.

       Love is better. Just like an hour ago I practiced bringing my heart energy into my third eye for a few moments. I felt it. Some would thing that is new cagey crap but it excites me to be in the heart more than in school.

       Great post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a teacher and one of the most ridiculous things I now see is the amount of time students are spending in school and learning the same things from year to year.
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet should change education, yet we still have schools not being properly funded with technological resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they were, schools could accelerate learning and truly make beneficial use of students' time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead old methods of teaching are being use on a generation that learns completely differently. Kids are not engaged, and school has become a place to babysit children.
      </p>
      <p>
       As always, I could further expand.

       :/ I will check it out. Education should always be at the top of the list of things to foster and grow. Not just cramming lists into minds and then quizzing them. There is more to knowledge then that. Like understanding why things work and how they do. Big picture stuff. But it seems like that's what gets lost in translation.

       Ran out of time yesterday. After I posted this I stumbled upon a video  released yesterday of a guy making the same exact message about kids getting indoctrinated and having no free will. Must of been something in the air.  ;) I keep coming back to that idea every now and then, and  I think if we could reform education it's a big step but government doesn't want to let go of the kids they worked so hard to steal from their parents.

       Oh, then I saw the Rockefeller quote about him creating the womens lib movement to create more tax payers and that they would then have control over the kids with both parents working.  He admitted that like he did every other nefarious thing he did. But that is a conspiracy, right?

       I think the public school system is obsolete in the modern era. It doesn't teach people how to think, it teaches them how to repeat. To recall information that has been processed. At least the public schools I've been too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system will change, we will begin to see a resurgence of homeschooling in this country for awhile, new private schools will be established. The public system will have no choice but to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can look at all the companies that profit off of education and begin to dismantle their monopolies. Point out the fact that most new editions of college texts are the same with minor wording changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are in a time were all things that are fishy should be exposed. I don't think the INTERNET has been the sole reason public school is obsolete.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way in which they teach is obsolete. Public school seems to be a system in which they can garner the perfect obedient workers. It helps to either stifle differentiating opinion. (peer pressure) It is meant to get you into a group think mentality. The whole time you are in school you have the administration putting you in check, you have your peers attempting to put you in check.  It is a way to cultivate societal norms for future generations.

       School is a prison. No free thought is allowed. Only conformity. I don't have the answer for what way would be better, though I'm sure with some time and resources one  could be presented. But it would mean that a shift in guidance, education and supervision would have to shift back to the parents and away from the state.

       What's a public school education cost these days? Some cities its more than $20,000 per kid per year!!! that's k-12  wtf.
      </p>
      <p>
       College is double that if you're lucky.
      </p>
      <p>
       So spending $100 to $400 per day on an education, when you can find for free online and teach your self 90% of what the system teaches you is crazy!

       Exactly. I think I immediately started to unlearn what I was taught right after I graduated, but i didn't unlearn the work week even knowing the Gregorian calender and economy are a Jesuit connection. Still have to play along to survive.

       Yea.. it's a complex issue because on one hand the government wants to babysit and on the other the parents need a babysitter.  So now we have to reform the economy so that parents are not put in this position.  I know my parents both worked full time and then get all sentimental later in life at not having spent enough time with us. By Then we were already put the through the school system and full of angst for having to do all that and they are burned out shells for working their whole life to be in debt.  I think this is the case for most city kids and their parents. The parents are as good of providers as the system and it's purposely done that way .

       It's the opposite, online you can learn as deep as shallow as you want. With books you only have what they put in there.

       Also, they have books online now :-o

       Indoctrination.  It also slows down the smarter people and dulls them.

       I was a product of the public school system and came away knowing very little of importance. I remember many days of watching movies in class because our teachers just wanted a break. Decided college wasn't going to be much better and began teaching myself computer programming and design. Fast forward to my early thirties and I'm self employed making good money. No formal education needed.

       We have the ability to learn on our own. In fact, I believe we can learn better and faster outside of the indoctrination machine of the public school system. My wife and I have two very young kids and we will be homeschooling them when they are of age. We want them to be free thinking and intelligent. Mostly, we want them to be the total opposite of these social media driven, self obsessed drones that society is molding our youth into today. I think public schooling is a part of the problem.

       Exactly. I think I immediately started to unlearn what I was taught right after I graduated, but i didn't unlearn the work week even knowing the Gregorian calender and economy are a Jesuit connection. Still have to play along to survive.
