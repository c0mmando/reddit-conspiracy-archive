    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Why isn&#39;t this sub booming right now?&quot;</p>

<p>Because a lot of our transient user base is fed up having to wade through bullshit like above. (Not because they don&#39;t see through it but because they&#39;re tired of dealing with it)</p>

<p>And most regulars that are aware of and want to discuss literally the biggest conspiracy of our time get shouted down and (visciously) attacked by &#39;totally legitimate&#39; conspiracy-hating conspiracists.
Our longer time users get a real kick out of it but are often drowned out by the constant vote manipulation and brigading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What from the OP isn’t proven aside from the Podesta claims? It’s interesting that you try to call facts BS while also saying that the “real users” here want to discuss the “biggest conspiracy of our time” (which I’m assuming means Russia collusion and not 9/11). Am I correct, or am I misreading what you typed?</p>

<p>ANTIFA didn&#39;t do anything on Nov 4</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Things like this is why the subreddit isn’t bumping, you can’t really count it as one of the things going on, Nov4th wasn’t an Antifa thing, refuse fascism was probably a recruiting front for RCP and Bob Avakian. People hyped it up but it wasn’t jack shit, the right wing fear mongers needed a boogeyman to sell to their audience and it was Jade Helm all over again.</p>

<p>Trumps twitter disabled for eleven minutes feels like a nothingburger to me. Like so what?</p>

<p>The dead guys, yeah suspicious but people at large took the LV massacre at the word of the msm. Saudi Arabia is big news, and those threads are bumping. Podesta in custody I suspect is a larp, but idk I’m not sure. Is his brother on the run from the law? Idk, he could be laying low from media attention or really getting treated. </p>

<p>Hollywood having a seedy back side, yeah it’s coming to light now but idk if the Illuminati sex cult angle is real, I think it’s due to empowered feminist women who aren’t going to be silent anymore and yes men speaking up too (against Spacey). The old boys club where people could use power to coerce sex from the powerless is getting dismantled because sunshine is the best disinfectant. It doesn’t have to do with party affiliation, Anthony Weiner (hue) showed that even in the 21st century democrats aren’t infallible. </p>

<p>Hillary was never not targeted, but I doubt she’s getting arrested unless something big comes out. Idk, but Uranium Obe doesn’t look like it has legs to me, just Benghazi all over again.</p>
