<p>Instead, just plant seeds. Post and ditch if you have to. You’ll be more effective as a spreader of truth and information helping those who are naturally INQUISITIVE and WANT TO LEARN.  To fight with people who are just going to call you crazy and laugh and scorn is a huge waste of time and your energy. You’ll never prove yourself right to them, and quite frankly that’s not even important. It’s not about us as messengers. It’s about the message. They’ll listen and research when they’re ready, But you already won by planting the seed. </p>

He said i was a looney conspiracy user who believes in crazy stuff, so the guy i talked with stopped the conversation we were having.

<p>The dialogue created can be quite informative, of other peoples level of understanding and willingness to learn. Some people aren&#39;t&#39; as stubborn when it comes to their opinions and or knowledge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a practice of temperament, if I so choose to debate people that retort with anger I might want to better understand why they are angry. If they use ad hominem it might not be intentional, I myself have done so without realizing.  If we simply disengage a conversation because we don&#39;t like the results or replies we won&#39;t be able to better understand those we speak with. Those that we wish would understand our point of views.</p>

<p>I think all to often we are quick to dismiss others over perceived shilling, when in fact it most likely is just somebody who has a set of beliefs different than my own. I&#39;d rather understand, I&#39;m not playing the who is right game. There is no right there is only perception.</p>

<p>You are expecting to get through to them,  and instantly bare the fruits of you laborer. Have you ever considered that the work you have done in the past has helped bring all the awareness that is here now, and the work you continue to do will continue to bare more fruit. Although you might not first be able to see the fruits of your labor you aren&#39;t looking in the right places.</p>

<p>I say you are doing a great job and I don&#39;t know you. But I&#39;m sure the effort you&#39;ve put out into this world has helped others awaken, and then they will go on to attempt to awaken others and they cycle will continue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just coming to realize this.  Plant the seeds, but step back and let them all bicker and just move on.  As time unfolds and connections are made, those seeds may still sprout.  I&#39;d say this happened to me regarding 9/11.  I heard all this conspiracy talk, but I was like, no way.  But a lot of the architectural talk about the WTC buildings, and controlled demolitions stuck with me.  Later I followed it up and realized you didn&#39;t have to be a mathematician to understand the basic arguments.  Basic physics.  Those building were controlled demolitions.  So those seeds planted in me long ago that I wasn&#39;t ready for did take root, and now I know I can&#39;t trust my government or media a single iota.  So thank you truthers for your work in putting it out there.</p>
