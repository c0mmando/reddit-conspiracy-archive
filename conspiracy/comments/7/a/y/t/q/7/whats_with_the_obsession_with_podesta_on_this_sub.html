       He's a major player we're aware of and have enough circumstantial evidence to make you raise both eyebrows.

      <p>
       Conspiracy is admittedly a web but the major one involves a global human trafficking ring in the highest parts of government/society perpetuated through blackmail and bribery.

       These kind of hedonistic luxuries are available to only the super rich and powerful and as such the same names come up often. Podesta, Epstein, Weinstein.

       Well, when one party wins every branch of government, the online propaganda machine needs a Boogeyman. Considering the controlling party has beaten Hillary to death it seems like continuing to blame her for all of the world's problems seems a little abusive. So rather than blame our new Hollywood president, it's Podesta or bust.

       Here's a few reasons why you keep hearing about Hillary:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         There's new details about her various scandals every day and there's a whole lot of scandals. Uranium One, the emails, Comey's investigation of her, the DNC rigging, possible issues with her laundering money to rig the DNC, etc.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         None of these scandals even feel like they were investigated, yet alone came to a satisfactory conclusion, which sparks more discussion.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Hillary does not know when to shut up. She's been on TV more in the last few weeks than when she was actually running. And not only does she not know when to shut up, she is honest to god my pick for the least likeable mainstream personality. Nothing is ever her fault. She has no seemingly original ideas. Anyone who disagrees with her is colluding with the Russians.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>

       There is no grey. Hillary Clinton is a known criminal. There's actual evidence that proves this. You seem to think that because she lost, it doesn't matter that she's a criminal.
      </p>
      <p>
       That just so happens to be the narrative the Democrats and the media have been trying to spin. You've let them decide for you who should stand trial for their crimes and who shouldn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       To those who don't just blindly parrot a narrative, the outcome of a political fight has little relevance to if you should be held accountable for your actions or not.

       It's because so many of his emails were up on Wikileaks... when  people go around connecting any dot to any other dot to form a conspiracy it is easy with Podesta and Clinton because we have been soooooooo many dots to play with.

       His emails were leaked. Also, he's a high level player in this political game. He was chief of staff for Bill Clinton, and Hillary's campaign manager. He's also a part of Podesta group, a massive lobbying firm. I could keep going, but basically we have more information about him in comparison to others.
