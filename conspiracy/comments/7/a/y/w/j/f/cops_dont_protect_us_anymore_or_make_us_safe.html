       You're better off handling the situation on your own before calling the police. If you were about to get stabbed by someone and the cops see a guy about to rob a corner store, they would go and stop the guy robbing the corner store before helping you. And a cop can do no wrong, they're above the law, nothing applies to them. So any harm they do to you will be completely justified. These past few years has made me intensely scared of cops.

       I would argue plenty scenarios exist where cops are a benefit to society. And I’m sure there are others that would argue the same. That’s not to say there are some bad cops or some situations where cops are worse to have around. But to claim in blanket like fashion negative things imo isn’t hitting the nail on the target

       I think you misinterpret me. I’m not talking about putin the man, I’m talking about putin the boogeyman. I’m not defending him in any way. I’m pointing out the next narrative shift in both sides being towards EVERYTHING is Russian boogeyman fault, as blaming every single thing in the Jews was wearing thin. The’ll still blame stuff on them, but putin is someone everyone can rally against to the ones who control the scapegoats of the week. (scapegoats of the week usually do bad shit, they just get credit for all of it instead of what they actually do. )

       Lmao, you're playing in to the medias hand. There are good people and bad people everywhere. Yes, cops are more predisposed to being power hungry Napoleans, but that doesn't mean they wouldn't help you. I know every single cop in my town by first name, and they know mine. They would go to all lengths to see if I was okay if I was injured. Quit being a pussy. Unless you're black. Then be afraid, I understand.

       Dude we have a blatant problem with the police abusing their authority in America....to ignore that is childish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most cops are on a power trip. The media wants us to continue to think they are all "good guys" so nobody actually says, "hey we have a problem with the police in this country".
      </p>
      <p>
       The TPTB need them, they want them militarized and ruthless to scare us and keep us in line. That's the whole purpose of a police force. That, and extorting money from us with ticky tack traffic violations and stupid court fees

       Don't be afraid, fear will get you no where. If there is a problem with police policies take steps to make sure they can't escape justice. Action is the only thing that will cause change. You fearing the police won't change anything. If you have concern bring them up. Highlight those policies and explain as to why they should be changed. Go to your local town-hall and speak with your community.

       Anything worth doing isn't easy. Of course it is going to be hard, but at the same time it isn't impossible. If you're scared that is a natural emotion, but remember police are filled with people. People can make changes.  It will have to happen within the police force and in the courts of public opinion. We can't just make police our enemy. They are our neighbors too.

       You should always be respectful and polite to cops, because you should not bet your life on the emotional maturity of a stranger with a gun who is SUPPOSED to be professional. Be smart, okay.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm assuming you're from the US. The fear of law and order and restitution makes this country as safe as it is, compared to say, the middle east or sub-saharan countries. So cops totally serve a purpose. Could you still be killed by one? Totally. Shit happens. It's clearly systemic. There's corruption there. There's miles of room for improvement in the way our police force operates to "protect and serve" the American citizens.  Owning a gun to protect yourself and your house is totally cool. Avoiding the cops as much as you can is a great idea. Buuut... their presence allows you to live the life you take for granted day to day. So there's that.

       Yeah I'm always nice and cool with police and I'm grateful that I live in a country that protects me, but at the same time fear from the cops shouldn't be normal. Look at Europe, they aren't afraid of their police and aren't afraid of getting shot by them. The cops in America are really intimidating and get off from being power hungry.

       I agree. I think the police in our country work under a system in place that doesn't punish anybody, doesn't have any third party oversight, and wants to protect itself first. Pair that with the majority of the force being 20-60 year old men (statistically the MOST aggressive demographic), the power trip of a gun, and the knowledge that you won't get in trouble, paid leave would be a vacation... And you have the lucifer effect in real life.

       on the macro level it seems the post patriot-act law enforcement institution has been corrupted by power, militarized with weapons of war and trained on bagdad style counter-insurgency techniques. however, the basic level of protection most people feel being able to call a number and have trained, capable and willing people come to protect you, or catch the offender through investigation is a service that on the whole persists. increasingly, cops are using their increased power unjustly, but the basic function deserves some degree of gratitude.

       You do realize the alternative to law and order and consequence is anarchy, and the most ruthless person with the most ammo will win. Sounds promising.

       This is food for thought and I appreciate your great response.  I just feel like I'd definitely be raped in a post-apocalyptic world with no government. And so far I haven't been raped with the status quo. So my justice warrior side says burn it all down, but my 401k and Alaska cruise booked next year side says let's all just relax.  I am one of the sheep.
