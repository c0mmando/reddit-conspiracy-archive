If you were about to get stabbed by someone and the cops see a guy about to rob a corner store, they would go and stop the guy robbing the corner store before helping you. And a cop can do no wrong, they&#39;re above the law, nothing applies to them. So any harm they do to you will be completely justified. These past few years has made me intensely scared of cops.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue plenty scenarios exist where cops are a benefit to society. And I’m sure there are others that would argue the same. That’s not to say there are some bad cops or some situations where cops are worse to have around. But to claim in blanket like fashion negative things imo isn’t hitting the nail on the target</p>

The’ll still blame stuff on them, but putin is someone everyone can rally against to the ones who control the scapegoats of the week.

<p>Most cops are on a power trip. The media wants us to continue to think they are all &quot;good guys&quot; so nobody actually says, &quot;hey we have a problem with the police in this country&quot;.</p>

<p>The TPTB need them, they want them militarized and ruthless to scare us and keep us in line. That&#39;s the whole purpose of a police force. That, and extorting money from us with ticky tack traffic violations and stupid court fees </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should always be respectful and polite to cops, because you should not bet your life on the emotional maturity of a stranger with a gun who is SUPPOSED to be professional. Be smart, okay.</p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re from the US. The fear of law and order and restitution makes this country as safe as it is, compared to say, the middle east or sub-saharan countries. So cops totally serve a purpose. Could you still be killed by one? Totally. Shit happens. It&#39;s clearly systemic. There&#39;s corruption there. There&#39;s miles of room for improvement in the way our police force operates to &quot;protect and serve&quot; the American citizens.  Owning a gun to protect yourself and your house is totally cool. Avoiding the cops as much as you can is a great idea. Buuut... their presence allows you to live the life you take for granted day to day. So there&#39;s that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;m always nice and cool with police and I&#39;m grateful that I live in a country that protects me, but at the same time fear from the cops shouldn&#39;t be normal. Look at Europe, they aren&#39;t afraid of their police and aren&#39;t afraid of getting shot by them. The cops in America are really intimidating and get off from being power hungry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I think the police in our country work under a system in place that doesn&#39;t punish anybody, doesn&#39;t have any third party oversight, and wants to protect itself first. Pair that with the majority of the force being 20-60 year old men (statistically the MOST aggressive demographic), the power trip of a gun, and the knowledge that you won&#39;t get in trouble, paid leave would be a vacation... And you have the lucifer effect in real life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>on the macro level it seems the post patriot-act law enforcement institution has been corrupted by power, militarized with weapons of war and trained on bagdad style counter-insurgency techniques. however, the basic level of protection most people feel being able to call a number and have trained, capable and willing people come to protect you, or catch the offender through investigation is a service that on the whole persists. increasingly, cops are using their increased power unjustly, but the basic function deserves some degree of gratitude. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is food for thought and I appreciate your great response.  I just feel like I&#39;d definitely be raped in a post-apocalyptic world with no government. And so far I haven&#39;t been raped with the status quo. So my justice warrior side says burn it all down, but my 401k and Alaska cruise booked next year side says let&#39;s all just relax.  I am one of the sheep.</p>
