<p>This could be the reasoning behind the extreme lack of transparency and leads me to believe both the FBI/LVPD are helping to cover from MASSIVE liability. Thoughts? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that’s kind of what I’m getting at. If MGM only owned the hotel then there would be an entirely separate entity to answer to (festival owners, property owners, promoters, the whole slew). With MGM literally holding all the cards it lends weight to the theory that it’s less a false flag and more a clusterfuck that MGM either aided in or allowed to happen and now is liable. </p>

<p>Who didn&#39;t know this already?</p>

<p>I think a lot of people didn&#39;t realize that MGM owned the concert venue.  Obviously people who live in Las Vegas would know because the venue was originally called the MGM Resorts Village.  But (for those who aren&#39;t from Las Vegas) MGM changed the name to Las Vegas Village a couple of years ago.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://lasvegassun.com/blogs/kats-report/2015/oct/01/mgm-resorts-to-renaming-las-vegas-village-las-vega/">October 1, 2015 -- No MGM Resorts: It’s now Las Vegas Village and Las Vegas Festival Grounds</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Turns out these “MGM Resorts” titles have been a little too, shall we say, narrowly focused.</p>

<p>Today the names of the wide-open spaces that host music and cultural festivals on the Strip are Las Vegas Village and Las Vegas Festival Grounds. Lopped is the MGM Resorts affiliation, although the Las Vegas resort company still owns both of those parcels.</p>

<p>But the change in name, leading into this weekend’s Route 91 Harvest Country Music Fest at Las Vegas Village, is to note the civic qualities of the multiday events in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>The one-time MGM Resorts Village is the same spot across from Luxor and Mandalay Bay on the east side of the Strip, but it is being titled anew to remind that the entire city can partner in this experience.</p>

<p>“We have changed the name because we have learned and believe that these venues, and the new Las Vegas Arena, have to be considered as community to be successful,” says MGM Resorts Vice President of Entertainment Chris Baldizan, who oversees both of those party plots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know that Sheldon Adelson, who owns The Venetian and The Sands, and is the #1 presidential campaign donor, owns the top news publication in Nevada (the Las Vegas Review-Journal)? He bought it (secretly) and then implemented a rule where nobody could write negative pieces about him or his BFF Steve Wynn. But they publish a lot of negative stuff about MGM, now more than ever. LVMPD have no control over that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is a good time for a Richard Feynman quote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You see, one thing is, I can live with doubt, and uncertainty, and not knowing. I think it&#39;s much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of certainty about different things. But I&#39;m not absolutely sure of anything, and there are many things I don&#39;t know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we&#39;re here, and what the question might mean. I might think about it a little bit; if I can&#39;t figure it out, then I go onto something else. But I don&#39;t have to know an answer. I don&#39;t feel frightened by not knowing things, by being lost in the mysterious universe without having any purpose, which is the way it really is, as far as I can tell -- possibly. It doesn&#39;t frighten me. [smiles]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We live in a reality where accurate and precise approximations are the closest we can ever be to objective truth. So just do your best and always stay skeptical but not jaded by suspicion.</p>
