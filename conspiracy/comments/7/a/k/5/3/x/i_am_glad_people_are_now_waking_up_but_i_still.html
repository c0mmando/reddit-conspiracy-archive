       I've been seeing on Reddit in other subs people commenting on how they're so shocked that Clinton could have done this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, seriously? Clinton had been involved deeply in politics since she came out of her mother's womb, and you don't think she'd have some tricks up her sleeve?
      </p>
      <p>
       She'd gotten paid by the world's wealthiest people, and you don't think she's got a corrupt bone in her body?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well I guess it's never too late.
      </p>
      <p>
       Welcome everyone who has recently woken up, this is going to be a long ride, and a very, very deep rabbit hole.

       As "The Hill" wrote today, not one of the national newscasts covered the Donna Brazile/DNC/Clinton story.

I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly, unaware that I was Chou. Soon I awaked, and there I was, veritably myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man.

       That's not true though. I watched MSNBC this Morning and they definitely talked about it. Joe was going on about how Mika kept calling it rigged at the time but she was talking to people who didn't wanna listen. Don't know how valid that article is..

       So he just decided to endorse the candidate who stole his campaign contributions, never gave him a chance to actually win, and went against everything he campaigned on? right. and if you read the email, which you didn’t, it clearly states he is.

       Yes and if he has dirt that messy then maybe you should rethink what you're arguing. If he truly held onto the ideas he proposed and lived it the best he could, blackmail would be ineffective as there wouldnt be any buxket to hold him over. But there is. That alone shoupd be enough for people to question howlegit he was.

       true, but couldn't it also be something really embarrassing? like a picture of him cross-dressing or something weird? 
But you are right when you say that he was controlled opposition. If he weren't controlled opposition he would have realized that he is being blackmailed and would have either dropped out or faced the consequences. He surely would not have made an "agreement".

       I think you're conflating two stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jane Sanders (Bernie's wife) sold a property that she inherited from her parents.  That was the money they used to buy the beach house.  There were discussions about the DNC providing Bernie with a personal private plane after he dropped out, but he rescinded the request.
      </p>
      <p>
       The leftover money from his campaign was partially used to set up "Our Revolution," part of it was used to help set up a progressive think tank, "The Sanders Institute," and some of it is still in a bank account and will likely be used to fund Sanders's Senate campaign.

       Burnie Sanders is an exception to the rule. I generally don't make campaign contributions. The only other I donated to was Obama, during the 2008 primaries, and only 75 bucks as far as I recall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama turned out to be too comfortable with the corrupt. I still think Bernie Sanders would have been an honest president. He probably would have been treated like Trump in many ways, but without the same reaction to it. Both candidates are disliked by the people secretly in charge, because they are independent intentioned. Their polices are wildly different, but they are both likely to do what they wish rather than what the are pressured to do.

       His first debate with Ted Cruz showed me that even absent Hillary he would have probably lost. Look up the clip where he tells a hair salon owner she can either provide healthcare or she shouldn’t own a business, regardless of the fact that she gives a good explanation as to why providing health care won’t mathematically work for her circumstance.

       It’s absolutely crazy over there. One dude said there wasn’t a “classified” stamp on an email that was leaked that had with one, r/politics is screaming every leaked email everywhere is fake.

       Hmmm...  It was over a year ago.  I just searched r/politics for "bernie sanders" and quite a few links came up.  I don't have time to go through them right now, but here are a few that might interest you.

       The left-establishment press has gone to amazing lengths in order to suppress, discredit and silence the revolutionary press. You've just seen why the constitution guarantees Free Speech and The Free Press. You've just seen what happens when the press gets too cozy with the establishment. You can see the establishment's continuing attack on the free, open, anonymous Internet.

       Why is anyone shocked that the DNC favored the lifelong Democrat over the lifelong independent? And it's not like Sanders didn't have a chance - he lost because he didn't have a broad base of support demographically.

       Well even without HRC rigging the primary in her favor, and doing her best to try and stack every odd in her favor, yeah it was an uphill battle for Bernie to begin with. The dude had views that were completely opposite of people like HRC and the establishment and had continually rubbed elbows and agitated democrats during his entire political career. He might have lost anyway, but doesnt take away from anything that HRC did.

       He was also out of lockstep with the majority of Dem voters when compared to Clinton. Clinton in almost every way was your prototypical Democratic voter, policy-wise. Sanders was a bit to the left of the center of Dems.

       You didn't even attempt to respond to this, is that because you don't have a response ready yet?  Bernie had the nomination stolen from him according to the DNC Chair at the time, any points you make about his affiliation mean nothing because the parties head literally admitted to rigging it for HRC.

       You're trying to muddy the waters by equating rigging with being at a disadvantage, cut that out we're way smarted than that here lol.

       Is that the same polling data that had HRC winning by 90 percent or more directly before the election?  If HRC had media feeding her questions and info, and literally brought media into the party to help her, would it not stand to reason the polls could be skewed in order to garner her support.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you'll likely not even consider it, but for anyone who doesn't support HRC the entire primary process was fishy and seemed forced, she was forced on democratic voted by herself via the party and failed horribly in the general because of it.  What's funny is most polls had Sanders beating Trump handily, a point many online "activists" seem keen to ignore.
      </p>
      <p>
       The saltiest truth from this ordeal wasn't that Russia got Trump into the white house, but that Hillary did with her forced and stolen nomination and the likability of hot gum on the sole of your new shoes.

         forecasters
        </strong>
        gave her a 90% chance of victory, which isn't crazy. Much more reasonable odds makers gave her around a 2/3 chance of winning (like 538 did).

         Pollsters

        were actually pretty accurate overall, especially with regards to the popular vote. The polls were not skewed - the results were almost always within the margin of error.

         The polls were not rigged - they were actually pretty accurate in the primaries and the general, but few wanted to believe them.

         Overflowing stadiums and city parks is not indicative of actual voting power. Older people and poor people (people who Clinton did really well with) don't go to rallies as much as younger, wealthier people do. But guess what? They all still get a vote. Rally support is not equal to actual voter support.

         The polls oversampled certain demographics such as landline owners on purpose to give fraudulent results.  The polls got both the primaries and the general wrong.  Their methods are out of date.

         To disregard the discrepancy in public support is intellectually dishonest to say the least.  Now you can say anything if you disregard observable reality.  You can make up any imaginary scenario where you rely on unobservable phenomena.

         They don't overpoll landline owners to give skewed results - they do it because that's the best we have available. And guess what? Pollsters know this! That's why they try to make adjustments based on demographics to attempt to overcome sample bias. It's not perfect , but it's the best they can do currently.

         Again,
         <strong>
          visible public support
         </strong>
         in rallies/events/public gatherings is
         <strong>
          NOT
         </strong>
         necessarily indicative of
         <strong>
          voter turnout
         </strong>
         , which is all that matters. Rallies are not scientific inquiries. Imagine that a candidate had Neonazi appeal. He might have great rallies where the same Neonazis showed up every time. But guess what? Come voting day most people are not going to vote for him, because most people don't agree with his views.

       All of this, literally
       <strong>
        all of this
       </strong>
       , is unscientific and irrelevant to actual
       <strong>
        voting power.
       </strong>
       You're falling victim to what you can see with your eyes and what you allow your brain to trick you into thinking is the entirety of voters, instead of realizing how silly and unscientific that thinking is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your line of argument is like saying, "I live in Wisconsin, and I've
       <strong>
        never
       </strong>
       seen a tiger. We all know tigers are made up. We know they're not real! Trust your eyes!" There is more to the world to what you can see right in front of you. Voters are everyone - not just the people who put bumper stickers on care, not just the people who go to rallies, and not just the people with signs on their front lawns. They're not even just the people who talk about their favorite candidate all the time.

       Polling data was obviously done on a state-by-state basis, but there's a lot more fluctuation in how states vote individually than how states vote as a whole. Since it's easier to gauge the popular vote, and since popular vote winners almost always win the EC, it's valuable to know how the popular vote will turn out.

       Let me ask you this. Why would Hillary Clinton risk losing support from would-be supporters by rigging a primary election if she didn't have to rig it to win?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a risk she had to take, because if she didn't rig it, she would not have won. And she did end up losing support among Sanders supporters for it. That cost her the general election.

       It's a pretty bold statement to say she wouldn't have won without rigging the election. How
       <strong>
        exactly
       </strong>
       did she rig it? How
       <strong>
        exactly
       </strong>
       did that impact the election? I'm not denying it was rigged and Sanders should have been given a fair shot, but I'm not convinced that the mainstream shoe-in wouldn't have beaten the outsider even if it was a fair fight.

       <p>
        Change democratic primary campaign finance rules by reversing an anti-corruption rule against lobbyist donations (I estimate this gave Hillary an extra around $100 million to work with during the primary).

        Rigged Nevada: Sen. Harry Reid, the former Senate Majority Leader and most powerful elected official in Nevada, as it later emerged, arranged a plan with owners of Las Vegas casinos, where many caucuses were being held, and other employers, to ensure Clinton would win. The Nevada caucuses were then rigged with massive voting irregularities such as casino owners orchestrating which workers would be allowed to vote and, in clear intimidation, openly monitoring how they voted.

       All of these things together have a measured effect on votes for Sanders during the primary. The usual talking point against this is "Yeah but Hillary won by over 3M votes". I'm sorry, but 3M votes is not as big a number as it sounds. There are over 200M registered voters in the united states. 3M is only 1.5% of that. I think it's more than reasonable to conclude that the measures taken by the DNC made the difference between Sanders winning and losing.

       Clinton was already advantaged (beyond the DNC) in the primary. She was the frontrunner primarily because she was in more in line with the typical Dem voters than Sanders was.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you're right - the South is largely irrelevant to Dems in the general. But that doesn't mean those Dems don't get to make their voice heard in the primary.

       I don't think you understand how primaries work. The DNC does not control the voting in every state. It varies. And you would think someone would notice (any one of the thousands of poll workers) votes being flushed down the toilet. It didn't happen.

       No, the polling was pretty accurate. The results were well within the margin of error. If I told you the result of an NFL game would be 29-27, but it ended up being 28-29, you wouldn't say that I was wildly inaccurate, even though the result was different than what I predicted.

       Speaking as a Trump supporter, I have no love for the Neo-Cons in office. I didn't forget that they tried to conspire against Trump the same way Hillary conspired against Bernie. I would love to see most of them get primaried.

       They usually downvote Trump supporters, usually upvote anti Trump comments, upvote anti Trump posts to the top of the sub, sometimes to 90 percent, but then they claim this sub is completely controlled by Trump supporters. They want to have their cake and eat it too.
      </p>
      <p>
       "This sub is T_D 2.0," debunked. Here are some huge anti-Trump threads that I found in this sub from a quick search. They go from 1,000 all the way to 26,000 points, sometimes
       <strong>
        over 90 percent upvoted.

       Liberals absolutely dominate the comments in this sub (not a bad thing),  then they pretend to be the minority and claim this sub is "overflowing" with Trump supporters. My favorite thing to see in this sub is someone claim "I know I will be downvoted by you Trumptards who control this sub, but fuck Trump!,"
       <em>
        upvoted to 356 points.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many different groups of people in this sub. Trump supporters, Clinton supporters, anti-Trump liberals, Bernie Sanders supporters, Trey Gowdy supporters, Ron Paul supporters, etc. Criticism of Obama or Clinton does not automatically make someone a Trump supporter. Exhibit A: Me. The people who upvote those posts are not necessarily Trump supporters. They are probably the same people who upvote posts criticizing Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this sub was "T_D 2.0," or "overflowing with Trumptards," or any other version of that claim, then anti Trump comments wouldn't be upvoted, and the threads I cited above also wouldn't be upvoted, especially to 90 percent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that there are many competing factions in this sub. I might be literally the only anti Trump user who admits this, or at least I'm not aware of any others. The rest of them just want to make everyone feel like guilty Trump supporters for participating here. They don't realize that they also participate here and are basically talking shit about themselves.

       I think the worst thing for me was realising that the media covers it all up. That was the worst, the most earth shattering discovery. Because it means that literally your whole conception of reality could be, likely is, complete bullshit. You have no idea suddenly, about anything in the world at all beyond your own sensory perception, because everything you thought you knew about the world 'out there' has been given to you by people you now realise were either being completely bullshitted themselves and too lazy or stupid or brainwashed to figure it out, or were deliberately lying to you. So you don't know what you can trust. That is so fucking difficult to come to terms with.

       Just wait til you start looking into things like human evolution theory and heliocentrism. If you think the media's lies and coverups are bad, you ain't seen nothing yet.

       Conscious thought.  We were dreamt into existence by ourselves.  You can experience evidence of this through meditation or psychedelics.  Everything is consciousness, your body is not solid,it is 99.99% empty space.  it is electromagnetic vibration and energy compressed into what the human brain perceives as physical matter.

       Actually, if you dig deep enough in the subject, you will come to realise there is very little to support this theory that is taught as being factual.  Much as I used to hold a lot of respect for Richard Dawkins and all his writings on the subject, today I consider him a gatekeeper,  a scientist elevated to the statute of "rock star",  mesmerising the upcomping generations to gobble up the lie of this horrible theory.

       I, uh, have dug pretty deep into the subject. Evolution is an easily demonstrable fact in rapidly-reproducing populations and in human guided development of I.E. dogs and cows. There is literally nothing about humans that makes us special as animals besides our large brains, which when placed next to the brains of chimpanzees and dolphins appear completely to be another logical step in development.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you accept evolution of all other creatures - As I said, a demonstrable fact - and simply believe that humans are somehow special, there's plenty of evidence to the contrary. If you don't accept evolution at all, you're probably not susceptible to evidence.

       Humans existed along side all the different primates/neanderthals.  Most of these species went extinct due to our polar ice caps being hit by meteors which created huge floods and decimating the food source for all living things. Humans lived through this and are rebuilding.  The pyramids are evidence for this a long with the megalithic structure all over the world with smaller, less sophisticated architecture built on top of it.   There is plenty of evidence that humans existed up to 200,000 million years ago.  It's a subject called forbidden archeology.

       Science has been controlled by the same secret societies that control politicians/medicine/banking/hollywood/agriculture/religion for a very long time time now.  The catholic church used to just straight up kill you, now they have to ridicule you or fire you.
       <br/>
       Rupert Sheldrake does a great job explaining why modern science has become a religion.

       200,000 million years? Maybe you mean 200 million? So next to the dinosaurs then..

      <p>
       There's simply no such thing as a transitional fossil.. Creatures don't have 'partially developed features'. You have wolves, dog-like wolves, wolf-like dogs, less wolf-like dogs, and chihuahuas and pugs. They're all separate creatures that are extremely closely related but that show clear evolutionary changes and they're all the fuck over the place. You have big cats, slightly less big cats, small cats that look like tiny versions of big cats and that hunt in the woods for survival, and somewhat domesticated cats that still have the instincts to avoid water, bury poop, and eviscerate prey. Evolutionary 'transitions' are all around you.

       Yeah sorry i meant 200 million years.
       <br/>
       What your talking about are adaptations.  A lot of those breeds of dogs were created through cross breeding and inbreeding wolves with each other.  There is no evidence of species changing from one species into another.
       <br/>
       I think it is insane to believe that all life on earth can evolve from a single cell through random mutation,  especially when you see the math behind all of creation.
       <br/>
       Why does nature follow strict mathematical patterns if it is all created by random mutations?

       It's not a false dichotomy. It is simply a theoretical framework that has the most evidence for it. If another theoretical framework had more evidence then it would become the dominant narrative. Take a look at theoretical physics. There are many theories in different areas that compromise the best representation of reality. Behind each of those are theories that are highly contested yet provide i slightly less accurate framework (for the time being). Until they are more robust they cannot be accepted as the leading theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       A healthy dose of skepticism is important but if you cannot come to a conclusion (even if incomplete just the best approximation with the available evidence) then skepticism is useless and you have no platform for the next leap forward or backwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if you want to talk about biases in research and forming opinions or the culture in academia that is a different discussion requiring different theories in a different discipline.

       I'd be careful with that one. While I personally do believe it is likely, the document being passed around as proof (linked by someone else here) actually contains the CIA denying that claim, not confirming it.

       Oh and just because you seem to be really intellectually lazy,  check out this Harvard study showing how the Media that you are claiming colluded with Hillary,  actually helped Trump and not Clinton.

       You literally have provided nothing.  The absolute worst email you could find was one involving journalists and dinner.  And you can't even explain what it so bad about that or why it's abnormal.  You honestly can't be so naive to beileve that journalists didn't have similar ways of gaining inside access to the Romney or McCain or Bush or Obama or Trump Campaigns can you?    Furthermore I showed you how this sort of inside access doesn't seen to have helped Clintons media coverage since according to the Harvard study the vast majority of her coverage was negative while Trumps was positive.  So yes,  you are being lazy.  If you'd spent the the time you spent snooping through my comment history and used it to educate yourself about what it is you are talking about first I wouldn't have to make fun of you.

       yea its a form of hypnotism.  I've known this stuff since around 2003, the tides are turning my friend, i don't think we have much longer to wait.  Also don't trust anything, read all sides of every story and come to your own conclusion until something lends evidence otherwise.

       Religion implies it's a choice of the individual. But we live in a society where our thoughts have been carefully crafted by the elites from birth. Good always trumps evil in the end, but it often takes time.

       I believe it's like a pride type of thing, where these people act like they are always the smartest people and thus never wrong. So they will instantly flip their stances and beliefs to suit they world views that they were always right.

       As much as everyone is waking up we could say that people are de-brainwashing. Once the propaganda, lies, and carefully constructed "programs" implanted in everyone's head unravel, (word-smithing, e.g. Patriot Act, Freedom Fighters, etc.) the citizenry finally sees what the truth is-a host of constantly repeated lies.

       If you're talking about 2020, then why wouldn't he? People who liked Clinton will probably support the next democratic candidate just so Trump isn't elected again. Very few people support Trump on his own merits, he was the anti Clinton candidate. Many people actually like Sanders and few people hate him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus Bernie doesn't have any outstanding charges of corruption, hacked emails, or anything else for Trump to rage about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling Sanders a communist would probably help his odds since the democrats want things like free health care and tuition.

       I loved the guy but it's hard to say. Would have made for some of the most interesting debates, that's for sure. An independent who ran as a democrat, debating a lifelong democrat who ran as a republican. Both outsiders to the Big Two parties. Super capitalist man vs. Democratic socialist man.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the election as a whole would have been a lot more respectable if Hillary lost the primary. It ended up being whatever your word is for Trump versus the classic turd sandwich politician. Weak as fuck in my opinion. Her platform was just an clumsy amalgation of ideas from corporate consultants that she slapped her name on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of who would win in a race between Bernie and Trump, we would still be where we currently are today thanks to our worthless ass congress. They don't get shit done. Might as well elect a monkey with down syndrome and have him drool on the desk for 4 years. Nothing gets done anymore without an executive order, thanks to the rich do-nothings that occupy all the seats. Bernie would probably get even less done than Trump with this current  batch of loudmouth hacks

       Yes. Easily. No contest.

       Majority of the states are gonna go Blue/Red no matter who runs. The reason Trump won is because he won all the swing states in the rust belt.

       I doubt that. I went from die hard Berner to a super trump supporter during the primary and the rust belt needed jobs. Trump promised that. Bernie had great ideas such as eliminating TPP but he didn’t deliver when it came to job creation. I agree I would have loved to see a debate between them.

       Nobody with half a brain thought Trump was gonna open factories again or revitalize the coal industry. People liked him because he was an outlet for their anger and dissatisfaction with the system. Really just upset with the way their lives turned out. But that's a tough pill to swallow. Anyway Bernie struck that same "it's not your fault" chord that Trump did albeit in a different fashion. Hillary just represented all the things people were pissed at.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the guy who literally lives at the top of a gold skyscraper in the middle of Manhattan is the more relatable candidate, I think we have a problem. Bernie absolutely would not have had that problem as he himself has gone through decade long stretches of unemployment.

       He would have criticized Trump's "jobs plan" in the rust belt and made his own version of it to garner support. Trump won because Hillary was and is the worst candidate ever. Bernie would have ran circles against him.

       Yes but to be honest someone who has not been the best with managing their own finances might not be the most qualified to run a country like America. I think he does represent a fraction of Americans but I’m very glad things turned out as they did. Trump is delivering on all of his promises and if you ignore the MSM and look at what’s happening economic wise around the country things are looking pretty good.

       If he had the full resources and support of the party establishment helping him the whole time instead of doing everything they can to torpedo his campaign and shoo-in a pile of fecal matter, I think so.

       I knew something was up when I'd see Bernie signs, and bumper stickers all day long. It wasn't until September that I saw my first Clinton sign. Not to mention the massive rallies Sanders had to Clinton. I truly believe there had to be vote fraud during the primary.

       I actually voted in the primary in my state for Bernie, and followed the other primaries very closely.  The shit was literally stolen from him and all the Berners knew it but with Sarah insufferable Silverman and their whole celebrity ilk they berated the complaints of rigging and the media all but ignored it, instead making the primary race seem legit when non-Hillary supporting constituents were all but screaming it was rigged.
      </p>

       After watching the convention I vowed I would never ever support the Democratic party again, what they did to the supporters of Sander's was totally wrong and imho should be illegal.

       It doesn't matter if corporate candidate
       <strong>
        Bern
       </strong>
       hard S. was frauded out of the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the crooks win either way, with any candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're all wasting your time to defend another politrickcian who would have pulled a Trump too, if he ever became president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anybody who is tolerated to advance the political ladder far enough to become a national candidate is in on the scam that is politricks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it, why isn't Sanders running full assault against the crooked DNC if he had any solid evidence or actual interest of exposing the alleged voting manipulation.

       I tend to agree with your assessment but I think Trump might throw a wrench into this equation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we believe that Trump is legitimately not involved in the Deep State, then we bypassed the blackmail club that allows presidents to be elected and now they are making him pay for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, if we believe that Trump is in on it, and it's all just for show, then you are correct that whoever is elected will bend the knee to get the job.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not convinced either way. Honestly I don't think we will ever know, unless someone suicides themselves to blow all this wide open with audio tapes of a Deep State meeting with juicy deets.

       I'm not a trump fan, but was definitely not a Hillary fan either. 
However, I really think trump wasn't in the equation for the powers that be. They put all the money in behind the scenes to get the media pushing for Hillary knowing she was in their pocket and all the power she had would be there's. 
Trump comes along and wins it, he not a good choice, but I don't think he tied to ghosts pulling the strings. So now they're fumbling. Hence why almost every media outlet has been bashing him and there is this falsified hate for him everywhere. 
They're doing everything they can to get rid of him.

       Not a bad thought. I've been thinking about that situation too.
      </p>
      <p>
       My only concern with that is the USGov would never be unprepared for something like this. They would have pulled out all the stops to bribe Trump. And it would've worked. I'm sure they can fake the worst kind of child porn or set something up just like Russia can.
      </p>

       So are we really going to believe that the NSA/CIA/FBI was not prepared for either side?

       I think it's dumb to make this kind of vow.  I'm going to pick the lesser evil if I'm in a state where my vote can make the difference between either establishment candidate winning.  If I'm in a safe state for either party, I'm going to vote third party.    Maybe it's just because I've been through quite a few of these elections, but I've come to find no matter who you support, there is going to be a lot of shady stuff going on behind the scenes.  I'm going to vote with the policy I support in mind.  And the Republicans are disastrous to the kind of policy I support. The Democrats are much lesser of a threat to that policy. You always have to balance pragmatism with principles. That's just life.

       I respect your feelings of betrayal, but there is evidence to suggest some sort of agreement between the Clinton and Sanders campaigns.

      <p>
       I grabbed this screenshot of one of the Podesta emails during the election. Is it a smoking gun? No, but I'm certain the election wasn't just "stolen" from Sanders. It would not surprise me one bit if it was purchased from him.

       I, too, was greatly let down that a "straight-talker" who declared that he would "go all the way to the convention and contest it if need be" would so suddenly get strong-armed by HRC.  Over time, I came to realize that he maybe didn't fully buy into the massive HRC / Clinton corruptions.  BS would have been steam-rolled by the Deep State element.  His eyes were not open to the very threat that took him out of the running.  Then afterward, he could have been vocal about these corruptions, but was not.  BS would have possibly been a Yuge let-down as Pres, allowing himself to get steered and led-around by a very devious &amp; persistent element.

       Damn you're right! Not one single Hillary bumpersticker until November.  Over the years I've seen bumperstickers for lots of lame candidates, like Gore, Kerry, Romney, but Hillary had no grass roots support at all.... and I live in California which is a super blue state. She was the complete opposite of a normal candidate - a default candidate that you had to vote for as opposed to someone you actually wanted to see in the white house.

       Kerry was the same as Hillary from what I recall. There were a lot of good people on the primary ticket and they produced an ultra wealthy stick in the mud. I actually liked okay him as SOS, he just wasn't presidential material. I even thought Hillary was a stronger candidate in many ways. How many times did the Dems push Mondale forward? The progressive arm of the party has never had the helm.

       I feel the same.  If people bothered to read the emails that wikileaks released, people would already know this.  They would also know that Donna Brazile herself gave Hillary the debate questions to give her a leg up against Bernie.  People don't want to know the truth.  The truth hurts.

       Why read all those emails yourself when you can go to any 3 letter news outlet and they’ll give you the details of what was in them!? In a serious note tho, not many people In this country give a shit about this kind of stuff. They’re all too weird about what Kim Kardashian’s wearing, and what reality Star is doing drugs not, and cat videos.... we’ve been successfully dumbed down. To the point that we can’t even have conversations and people agree to disagree, because “your opinion matters mores than everyone else!” And “fuck anyone who doesn’t agree with you, their either ignorant, dumb, or racists”

        I don't want to do it. None of us do. But we need to accept this, embrace it as an
        <em>
         opportunity
        </em>
        to put things (and perceptions) back where they should be. And then maybe we can finally, finally move the fuck on from 2016.

       Didn't even crack the 10k mark.  Most tops posts are get upwards of 40-50k, and that was the only post that got traction.  Your comment trying to clear their image is as genuine as Donna Brazile's attempts attempt to clean her name.

       It really is amazing how deeply embedded these narratives are inserted, and how ruthlessly people cling to them in the face of overwhelming evidence.
It still blows my mind how defensive people are of the official 9-11 story. 
I’ve been saying for the longest time there are two America’s: the one that believes what they were told by the media in regards to 911, and the other that sees through it all the BS. 
From my pov, this madness has been speeding ahead unabated since the GWB was shoehorned in as POTUS by SCOTUS in 2000...
Y2K did happen. Just not as we thought it would.

       That's the media. When you have more people talking about the hack then you have an army of people who blame a hacker while simultaneously not reading Wikileaks. So they don't see that it was the words of the dems themselves who handed it to trump

       They would still vote for her. They still want to impeach Trump for "his Russian ties" and have Hillary take the seat.

       As a democratic voter, I dont recall any of us being in denial that Clinton stole the nomination from Sanders. It was pretty agreed upon.
I voted for Sanders but once it was done and Hillary did whatever she did to take the nomination from him, there was no choice left.
Our vote had to be cast for Clinton. Its not that we supported her or even liked her. But I thought then and still think now that she is less corrupt and a less piece of shit than Donald Trump. 
People say you shouldnt vote based on the lesser of two evils but this past election proved you should

       Oh geez, you are really going to go with "this guy got arrested for laundering huge amounts of money from russia and conspiring against the US, then become Trumps campaign manager, but that was all before trump so theres no connection" line of logic? 
In trumps own words he is a huge vetter, expert at vetting, believes in vetting bigly. So he knew all about Manafort and took him on as an advisor.
If you think trump isnt in on this, its gonna be a rough 6 months for you coming up

       Kelleyanne Conway was the campaign manager for most of the campaign and the entirety of the general election.

       She is the first woman to lead a winning Presidential campaign as well.

       Manafort was fired 3 months in. And it's not like he suddenly appeared in politics.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Paul John Manafort Jr. (born April 1, 1949)[2] is an American lobbyist, political consultant and lawyer. He joined Donald Trump's presidential campaign team in March 2016 and served as campaign manager from June to August 2016. He was previously an adviser to the U.S. presidential campaigns of Republicans Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bob Dole.

       So you have the brother of Hillary's campaign manager indicted, and the fired Trump manager who is indicted.

       Hah, by that logic, Manafort has nothing to do with Trump, similar to how Podesta's have nothing to do with Hillary? Works for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiring against the US in what capacity? As Trump's campaign manager? Or for his lobbying work in the years 2002-2014? 
Why did Manafort work with the Podesta group during the years that he is currently being investigated for?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        And why does the indictment include NOTHING about Trump's campaign?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's not possible that Manafort and Podesta's were in contact with one another? I thought this was conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I wanted Bernie to win at first. And seeing what Donna Brazille is saying now is lining up with so much. She literally gave Hillary debate questions, only way she had any chance against Bernie.

       Manafort indictment has nothing to do with Trump or the campaign.

       Papadopolas plead guilty to LYING ABOUT TRUMP, but you knew that right?
      </p>

       The JFK docs literally prove that the CIA installs agents in the media. You don't think in the history of politics that a mole ever hired onto a Presidential campaign? Give me a break.

       Ok let me try to explain this as simply as possible. Manafort is charged with not registering as a foreign agent and conspiracy against the US.
The president of he united states hired this man. This means he is either an idiot with poor vetting skills, because Manaforts shady behavior was common knowledge, or he wanted to benefit from said shady behavior.
There is no way Trump is not implicated in a negative way. Either he is an idiot or he is complicit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now as far as Popadopolis goes. His activity is more directly incriminating. There is evidence that he and DT jr were actively trying to set up meetings with russian officials. And the campaign was receptive to those meetings.

       I'm sure Trump personally researched the decades of Manafort's work and made the decision himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump being an idiot is right in line with the media narrative, so why can't that just be it? He fired him upon the news going public.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Trump campaign making one bad vetting decision does not mean they colluded with the Russians.

       Manafort has ties to russia and was hired by Trump. Thats the relation. Wether trump was complicit in those ties will come out in the wash.
Plain and simple Trump hired a traitor to run his campaign and to think Trump didnt know everything about Manafort is laughable.

       How? Was Trump involved in Mena? Was Trump involved in Benghazi? Was Trump involved in rigging a primary, or pay-for-play? Does Trump have a long list of "suicides" surrounding his political career? Did Trump have a private email server specifically to subvert the safeguards surrounding the exchange of classified information?

       So it's OK to rig the entire primary process (because, otherwise she wouldn't have been the party's nominee) just to prevent this guy (your entire opinion of him is based largely on what you have seen the media report in the past year) from becoming POTUS?
      </p>
      <p>
       ...but you probably don't remember Mena, or Benghazi, or her term as Secretary of State (in which she resigned

       At the beginning of the last election cycle both parties were stupid, the R's pushing Jeb Bush and the D's pushing Hilary Clinton. Many Independent voters didn't want to see another Bush or Clinton presidency. Trump won in part because he was an outsider. Sanders probably would've won if he was a choice. I don't know, it's like the party in power chooses to loose to the other party on purpose.

       It's a loophole. Are we gonna give a pass to Hillary because she used a loophole instead of closing it?
      </p>
      <h1>
       Hillary and the DNC totally rigged the DNC so that Jim Webb and Bernie Sanders had no chance.
      </h1>
      <p>
       Let's move on to the Donna Brazille stuff that's confirming what we knew a year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       DNC was 25million in debt by 2014/2015.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary Victory Fund was a fundraising committee set up to fundraise for the Clinton campaign, the DNC, and 32 Democratic committees.
      </p>
      <p>
       FEC laws dictate you are only allowed to donate $2,700 direct to Presidential campaign, but the limits are higher for state parties and party's national nominee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary took the $2,700.
      </p>
      <p>
       She also took the $10,000 allowed to each of the 32 committees, and the $33,000 allowed direct to the DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       This money was then transferred into State parties, and then the money was transferred back to the DNC, over which Hillary and Debbie had full control over. Including the $8 million funding of the false Trump dossier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nice $350,000 pull right there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 32 States that had their money essentially stolen by law loopholes, now had far less money to fund their own state elections. Sacrifice for the greater good? It was her turn after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of all this, the states kept less than half-a-percent, 0.5%, of the $82 million that was eventually raised by the Hillary Victory fund.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corruption, money laundering, so glad she is far away from The White House.

       You know the full agreemant was released right?  And it turns out that Hillary Clinton didn’t rig the Democratic primary because the joint fundraising agreement between Clinton and the DNC only applied to the general election.  Also Bernie signed off on the same agreemant.

       It doesn't prove anything.  The topic was one that was obviously going to be discussed.  So even assuming Hillary was informed of the question before hand doesn't really mean anything.  But it's funny that this is literally the only bad thing you come up with about her.

       "A Washington research firm paid a former British spy’s company $168,000 for work on a dossier outlining Russian financial and personal links to Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign, the U.S. firm said in a statement on Wednesday. "

       As usual wikileaks is omitting the important parts.  The memo made clear that the arrangement pertained to only the general election, not the primary season, and it left open the possibility that it would sign similar agreements with other candidates.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the memo:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to violate the DNC's obligation of impartiality and neutrality through the Nominating process. All activities performed under this agreement will be focused exclusively on preparations for the General Election and not the Democratic Primary,"
      </p>
      <p>
       Nor does wikileaks mention that Sanders signed its own joint fundraising agreement with the DNC.

       Wow, yeah it’s a good thing we’re getting to the bottom of something that happened in the primaries of a candidate who lost the general election. Really important stuff. Maybe if you turd burglars would focus some of that socially awkward rage toward what ACTUALLY happened in the general election you might come up with something and actually be useful to society. 
But yeah, I suppose the John podesta / Hillary Clinton pedophile sex dungeon in the basement of a pizza parlor that doesn’t have a basement is WAAAY more important.

       Very few people followed this closely. They just assumed that the primary would be run fairly. The Dems are the good guys, after all.

       You know it’s really sad when a candidate who took control of the dnc, rigged the primary , launder money, pay 9 million for a fake dossier, green screened people and herself at rallies and etc. thinking “ I can win this” by deceiving people.

       What's more surprising is how little people really seem to know about both Hillary and Bill Clinton's long history of criminal scandals and behavior going right back to the beginning or the long trail of dead bodies that never lived to testify against them that they walked away from that were never mentioned again either before or after they encountered yet another one that would go down the same way. Just like no one ever mentions that Hillary, the Podestas, Comey and Alefantis are all originally from Chicago not to mention that Obama launched his political career from there too. Or the historical corruption and collusion between the Democrats who've always run the city and most of the State and organised crime going all the way back to the days of Al Capone.

       I agree. He seems to enjoy being the firebrand rank outsider and was just shepherding.  I doubt he seriously wanted the role of POTUS same as Trump. Too much work.

       So Hillary promised to help the DNC out of its debt by campaigning for them and in return she wanted full control of the DNC for her election. When they gave her the control she used it to steer all the money raised not only by herself but also other DNC agencies to herself and leave the DNC high and dry. FFS. That's a mafia move, right there.

       Bahaha a long ride? Election is over. This is very effective propaganda though. Even has the quintessential "reddit upvoting conspiracy" thread on the front page at the same time to make people think it's the other side doing that shit and not you. It is getting quite easy to spot here.

       Thank you my man, people that can't see she is one of the most corrupt fema... actually she's world class corrupt for any of the 64 genders, anyone who couldn't see that 10 years ago let alone since her secretarial debut I was convinced had their heads so far up their ass they could see what they had for lunch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just watch any of the videos where she's lying for 12 minutes straight for 100s of irrelevant things and it's very obvious she doesn't have a single honest bone in her body. She was pulling shady shit off literally her first job as a lawyer(before getting disbarred of course) and has had scandals every decade of her life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hilary had the DNC head over heels for her since 20 years ago people, fuck. That's why Pelosi is still on board too, because she brings in the dough and no one questions how. With Hilary it's obvious- she'll take money from every two bit dictator and Hollywood rapist that'll provide it. She doesn't care about women, international rights, her own '''''marraige'''', her or really anything but her power. Maybe Hubell and their daughter perhaps.  People that see more to her that that are delusional period.

       They usually downvote Trump supporters, usually upvote anti Trump comments, upvote anti Trump posts to the top of the sub, sometimes to 90 percent, but then they claim this sub is completely controlled by Trump supporters. They want to have their cake and eat it too.
      </p>
      <p>
       "This sub is T_D 2.0," debunked. Here are some huge anti-Trump threads that I found in this sub from a quick search. They go from 1,000 all the way to 26,000 points, sometimes
       <strong>
        over 90 percent upvoted.
       </strong>

      <p>
       Liberals absolutely dominate the comments in this sub (not a bad thing),  then they pretend to be the minority and claim this sub is "overflowing" with Trump supporters. My favorite thing to see in this sub is someone claim "I know I will be downvoted by you Trumptards who control this sub, but fuck Trump!,"
       <em>
        upvoted to 356 points.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many different groups of people in this sub. Trump supporters, Clinton supporters, anti-Trump liberals, Bernie Sanders supporters, Trey Gowdy supporters, Ron Paul supporters, etc. Criticism of Obama or Clinton does not automatically make someone a Trump supporter. Exhibit A: Me. The people who upvote those posts are not necessarily Trump supporters. They are probably the same people who upvote posts criticizing Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this sub was "T_D 2.0," or "overflowing with Trumptards," or any other version of that claim, then anti Trump comments wouldn't be upvoted, and the threads I cited above also wouldn't be upvoted, especially to 90 percent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that there are many competing factions in this sub. I might be literally the only anti Trump user who admits this, or at least I'm not aware of any others. The rest of them just want to make everyone feel like guilty Trump supporters for participating here. They don't realize that they also participate here and are basically talking shit about themselves.
