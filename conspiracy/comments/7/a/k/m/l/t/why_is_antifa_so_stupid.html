<p>*<em>The hallmark of Liberty according to whom?
*</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ron Paul outlines why private property and privacy are essential to the preservation of civil liberties.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy is the essence of liberty. Without it, individual rights cannot exist. Privacy and property are interlocked</strong>. If both were protected, little would need to be said about other civil liberties. If one’s home, church or business is one’s castle, and the privacy of one’s person, papers and effects are rigidly protected, all rights desired in a free society will be guaranteed. Diligently protecting the right to privacy and property guarantees religious, journalistic and political experience, as well as a free market economy and sound money. Once a careless attitude emerges with respect to privacy, all other rights are jeopardized.</p>
