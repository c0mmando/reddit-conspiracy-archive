    <div class="md"><p>What he&#39;s doing on Twitter is assuring that nobody in the public ends up impartial...which is the point, as he&#39;s running a re-election campaign. He&#39;s not <em>really</em> trying to take his (lifelong friends) the Clintons down. He simply wants the world to know they are corrupt idiots and that the DNC is a corrupt organization. While both true, he&#39;s ignoring the legit investigation channels and recs he has at his disposal, probably because he knows no real laws were broken, just a ton of unethical behavior. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right that Trump technically oversees the Department of Justice, but traditionally there&#39;s been an understanding that the DOJ has autonomy from direct presidential control. It&#39;s also understood that a sitting President should not use his powers to punish his political rivals. That kind of action, while technically within Trump&#39;s power, would likely be seen as an abuse of office (or &quot;high crime&quot;) and lead to his impeachment. Even Republicans don&#39;t want to set that kind of precedent.</p>

<p>In fact, presidents are usually very careful to not accuse anyone of a crime, even when the criminal&#39;s guilt is obvious, because that can be seen as obstruction of justice (i.e. the president using his clout to sway any potential juries). Making that accusation without hard proof is also a high crime; it&#39;s impossible to sue the POTUS for slander, so if POTUS knowingly slanders someone, this is an abuse of his power.</p>

<p>Trump isn&#39;t the first POTUS to be aware of, or believe in the existence of, serious crimes committed by a political rival. We now know that President Obama knew about the Trump campaign&#39;s communications with Russia, but chose not to do anything about it -- including even publicize his knowledge -- for all the reasons above (plus he was probably pretty sure Clinton would win). Lyndon B. Johnson knew that Richard Nixon had illegally interfered in Vietnam peace talks to gain a political advantage, but Johnson took that secret to his grave; the public didn&#39;t know for decades.</p>
