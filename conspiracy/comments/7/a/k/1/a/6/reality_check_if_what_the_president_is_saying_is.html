       Lately there have been a lot of threads about how Clinton broke various laws and is guilty of collusion.  If that is true, why hasn't Trump directed his Department of Justice to press criminal charges against her and her team?
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, tweeting about her guilt would/will make it harder to actually prosecute and attain a conviction later, as her defense attorney can claim his statements led to an unfair trial.

       Do you honestly think that Trump tweeting about it helps prosecute a case when it goes to court?  It taints the jury, and the defense attorneys will be able to argue this successfully.  Congrats Donald, you cucked yourself.

       Trump's twitter is his direct connection to almost all of his voting base, considering how shitty the media has been since before the election. When he tweets about these things, he is speaking to his base (which is completely fair).
      </p>

       Also, he is acknowledging that he and his administration are seeing these things. He's just not going to overstep his boundaries.

       Depends. Hopefully they would find impartial parties on both sides. Also, following somebody on Twitter doesn't mean you are compromised and drink the kool-aid; plenty of people follow Trump purely for the laughs.

       What he's doing on Twitter is assuring that nobody in the public ends up impartial...which is the point, as he's running a re-election campaign. He's not
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       trying to take his (lifelong friends) the Clintons down. He simply wants the world to know they are corrupt idiots and that the DNC is a corrupt organization. While both true, he's ignoring the legit investigation channels and recs he has at his disposal, probably because he knows no real laws were broken, just a ton of unethical behavior.
      </p>

       Same could be said about the bulk of the Trump/Russia investigation, to be honest.

       He controls the judicial branch.  He can direct his Attorney General Jeff Sessions to arrest her and charge her with the crimes he is accusing her of.  And if Jeff Sessions can't or won't do it, he can fire Sessions and find someone to replace the AG with someone who will.

       Excuse me I made an error.  I meant Department of Justice, which is an executive branch department.  The DoJ is who brings criminal charges against people, the Judicial branch conducts the trial.  There is nothing stopping the DoJ of leveling charges against Clinton.

       I definitely do, she's probably one of the most malevolent people I've witnessed in my lifetime.  That said, if Mr. Trump wanted the justice department to indict her, why hasn't he?  He can direct others to investigate but the impetus and burden falls on the justice department, not the executive.  If the justice dept cannot make a charge stick they will abandon.

       but if he did that, what would the media turn it into? 'Trump is taking over Washington DC' 'Trump is purging the true patriots from government' 'Trump is trying to install himself as the next dictator'.... It wouldn't be reported or represented fairly.
      </p>

       The best play by Trump is to let these people do their jobs and keep his hands clean. He cannot compromise the optics due to the media. He has to play it safer than we would probably want him to.

       He's speaking to his base. Do you think people who support Trump listen to the MSM for what Trump is doing lately? Twitter is his mouthpiece because the media is completely and utterly compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you saying a president shouldn't speak to his citizens directly? How would you propose he do it differently?
      </p>

       Remember - Trump won the election with the mainstream media more or less calling for his head. He doesn't need them.

       According to WaPo: "...unlike other executive branch agencies, the Justice Department traditionally enjoys a measure of independence, especially when it comes to individual criminal investigations. Government lawyers have long sought to enforce a clear line preventing White House officials from influencing specific investigations or prosecutions to ensure such work is not politicized."

       Well, yeah. President Trump is challenging all sorts of traditional governmental norms. That action also had some pretty severe consequences, not the least of which is that it led directly to the appointment of Mueller.

       He is probably a gate keeper. Like the MSM, he will only address these topics when it reaches a point that, if ignored, would give away the whole charade. Nothing will come of this because it’s all a big show to buy the deep state time for containment/damage control.

       You're right that Trump technically oversees the Department of Justice, but traditionally there's been an understanding that the DOJ has autonomy from direct presidential control. It's also understood that a sitting President should not use his powers to punish his political rivals. That kind of action, while technically within Trump's power, would likely be seen as an abuse of office (or "high crime") and lead to his impeachment. Even Republicans don't want to set that kind of precedent.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, presidents are usually very careful to not accuse anyone of a crime, even when the criminal's guilt is obvious, because that can be seen as obstruction of justice (i.e. the president using his clout to sway any potential juries). Making that accusation without hard proof is also a high crime; it's impossible to sue the POTUS for slander, so if POTUS knowingly slanders someone, this is an abuse of his power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump isn't the first POTUS to be aware of, or believe in the existence of, serious crimes committed by a political rival. We now know that President Obama knew about the Trump campaign's communications with Russia, but chose not to do anything about it -- including even publicize his knowledge -- for all the reasons above (plus he was probably pretty sure Clinton would win). Lyndon B. Johnson knew that Richard Nixon had illegally interfered in Vietnam peace talks to gain a political advantage, but Johnson took that secret to his grave; the public didn't know for decades.
