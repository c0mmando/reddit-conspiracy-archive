<p>Assuming that they are legit and or even released to the public, the ballistic/autopsy reports will paint a much clearer picture of what happened...and from where.

<p>i.e. - GSR on Paddock, blood spatter analysis from Paddock&#39;s &quot;self-inflicted&quot; GSW, ballistics reports from victims vs the weapons used, etc.</p>

<p>To me, the way Paddock&#39;s body was shown, in those leaked photos, seems sketchy. The placement of that rifle/bipod over his leg, the location of the pistol &#39;supposedly&#39; used to kill himself, and the blood on his shirt. It all seems.........wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this was immediaty what I looked at when I saw the pics. The shell casings on top of the blood. Thought about it and it&#39;s possible. You&#39;d sure think at least spatter would be on them though. I&#39;d like to see that evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>the clean shell casings ON TOP of the blood pool under Paddock&#39;s head</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The casing are already on the ground prior to the shot in the chest.  Man falls down, gun goes flying (the blood trail is odd to me, unless responding officers kicked the gun away from his body), then blood begins to leave his mouth as is consistent with a center mass GSW.  How do you expect gravity to work?  The blood that pools up is magically supposed to the climb over the casings defying all laws of gravity?  It soaked up the carpet UNDERNEATH the casings.  That is why those casings would not have blood on them.  If the scene was tampered with and a casing was covered in blood you&#39;d assume that the rifles were shot after Paddock was dead and the casings bounced on the floor after ejection from the rifle.  Then you could conclude shots were fired by somebody else for sure and that would leave a huge hole in the single shooter narrative.  I&#39;m actually glad that LVMPD/SWAT didn&#39;t kick around casings when they arrived.  We&#39;d have more of a shit show on our hands than we currently do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The position of the body dictates that he was already lying on the ground when he “shot himself.” There was no ‘shot to the chest’ by the way. He died of a single “set-inflicted” GSW to the head. More than likely, through the mouth. At that angle, it is impossible, due to physics, for the gun to be where it is in the picture. However, it is true that the police may have kicked it away, as is standard procedure for securing a suspect. </p>

<p>You saying something about a GSW to the chest reminds me of another point. How the hell is there blood on his shirt, almost center-mass on his torso? Strange, indeed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The blood is consistent with GSW to center mass. Not shooting himself in the mouth.  Especially if 8t was a .357 or a .38 Special round.  For one, you&#39;d have seen an exit wound pretty noticeable with a shot through his mouth.  Two, you would have seen a contorted face.  Third, there would have been brain matter present.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the position the photo was taken of his head, you would not have seen the exit wound from a self-inflicted GSW to the head (barrel in mouth), as he would be LAYING ON IT. He did not shoot himself in the chest. Anyone going to commit suicide doesn’t lay on the ground and point a gun at their chest. The appearance of his face/eyes IS consistent with that of a gsw through his mouth. </p>
