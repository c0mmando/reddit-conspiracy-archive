       Absolutely. I can agree with this. Why can't we see just one pic of him anywhere but in his room? I know, it's an "ongoing investigation". If this is their excuse, how do we have pics and videos of this NY attack? Is that case already closed?

       Alright. You buying the plane tix? Jk. In all seriousness I don't think anyone should go harassing the guy, he's most likely under some heavy pressure with the whole situation. Or he's fake. I just know that they're trying to tell us 2+2=5 and I'm just not feeling it.

       This is something that I have personally been waiting for. With the exception of 2 on the water towers, I've yet to even see any photos of bullet holes in the area.

      <p>
       Assuming that they are legit and or even released to the public, the ballistic/autopsy reports will paint a much clearer picture of what happened...and from where. But considering that they are pushing the lone gunman from the 32nd floor narrative so strongly, I doubt very much that we will ever see them, and if we do, that they will be legit.

       Anything having to do with forensics.
      </p>
      <p>
       i.e. - GSR on Paddock, blood spatter analysis from Paddock's "self-inflicted" GSW, ballistics reports from victims vs the weapons used, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, the way Paddock's body was shown, in those leaked photos, seems sketchy. The placement of that rifle/bipod over his leg, the location of the pistol 'supposedly' used to kill himself, and the blood on his shirt. It all seems.........wrong.

       So this was immediaty what I looked at when I saw the pics. The shell casings on top of the blood. Thought about it and it's possible. You'd sure think at least spatter would be on them though. I'd like to see that evidence.

        the clean shell casings ON TOP of the blood pool under Paddock's head

      <p>
       The casing are already on the ground prior to the shot in the chest.  Man falls down, gun goes flying (the blood trail is odd to me, unless responding officers kicked the gun away from his body), then blood begins to leave his mouth as is consistent with a center mass GSW.  How do you expect gravity to work?  The blood that pools up is magically supposed to the climb over the casings defying all laws of gravity?  It soaked up the carpet UNDERNEATH the casings.  That is why those casings would not have blood on them.  If the scene was tampered with and a casing was covered in blood you'd assume that the rifles were shot after Paddock was dead and the casings bounced on the floor after ejection from the rifle.  Then you could conclude shots were fired by somebody else for sure and that would leave a huge hole in the single shooter narrative.  I'm actually glad that LVMPD/SWAT didn't kick around casings when they arrived.  We'd have more of a shit show on our hands than we currently do.

       The position of the body dictates that he was already lying on the ground when he “shot himself.” There was no ‘shot to the chest’ by the way. He died of a single “set-inflicted” GSW to the head. More than likely, through the mouth. At that angle, it is impossible, due to physics, for the gun to be where it is in the picture. However, it is true that the police may have kicked it away, as is standard procedure for securing a suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       You saying something about a GSW to the chest reminds me of another point. How the hell is there blood on his shirt, almost center-mass on his torso? Strange, indeed.

       The blood is consistent with GSW to center mass. Not shooting himself in the mouth.  Especially if 8t was a .357 or a .38 Special round.  For one, you'd have seen an exit wound pretty noticeable with a shot through his mouth.  Two, you would have seen a contorted face.  Third, there would have been brain matter present.

       Still think he bit the barrel and pulled the trigger?

       From the position the photo was taken of his head, you would not have seen the exit wound from a self-inflicted GSW to the head (barrel in mouth), as he would be LAYING ON IT. He did not shoot himself in the chest. Anyone going to commit suicide doesn’t lay on the ground and point a gun at their chest. The appearance of his face/eyes IS consistent with that of a gsw through his mouth.

       Particularly, time-stamped communications between Campos and hotel security, Schuck and hotel security, and hotel security and police. I just can't comprehend how the exact shooter's location was known before the crowd shooting even began, yet police scanner audio indicates they still weren't sure what floor or room it was coming from until the shooting was almost over.

       Autopsies, incl bullets extracted.  From the autopsies a total of how many people were shot, rather than died in some other way, and the calibre of bullets. But we won't get that, because .... the Clark Country Coroners' office is 'locked down'.

       The missing muzzle flash.  The missing crack/bang.  How was .223 ammo from 450 meters louder than a rock band setup?  Basically an explanation for why no real bullets were fired.  Oh, and the fake victims like the twins too.
