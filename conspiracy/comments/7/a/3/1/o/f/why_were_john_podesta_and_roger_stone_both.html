<p>His brother is rumored to be indicted along with manafort... so John takes to twitter.  He invokes Pizzagate to attempt to discredit anything else people are pushing because, of course, pizzagate is just crazy made up bullshit accordign to alex jones?  </p>

<p>Is it a false claim? It isn&#39;t really proven one way or the other but for that one at least there are things that give us a certain degree of suspicion it was russia</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So stupid that anyone brings that statement up as being serious. You could argue it&#39;s an appropriate joke to make, but to take it as a serious call for hacking is ridiculous!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Claiming putin ordered his email hacked is absolutely a false claim.  It shows that He&#39;s full of shit.  He&#39;s attempted in the past to bundle his email hack together with the DNC emails, and they&#39;re entirely seperate incidents.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a well known meme that his password was weak.  His twitter was also taken over and they gave a shout out to 4 chan.  Probably some fucking kids somewhere fighting the great meme war of 2016.  Chance of being linked to Putin next to zero... </p>

<p>For him to try to say that it was putin with a straight face is telling of the origin of the entire russia narrative.  It&#39;s bullshit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We know he was set a spearphishing email, and we know that he clicked it, its possible his account was compromised other times or by other people, but the same account that made his bitly link also made ones targeting other targets of russia, I don&#39;t think that was a random person fighting in the great meme war back in march 2016. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t know how secure his gmail password was, just what his appleid password was, and wasn&#39;t his twitter taken over using that password we got from the emails? Not that it was guessed or brute forced.</p>

<p>Could it have been the russian?  Sure, there&#39;s a tiny chance.  Does he know it was the russians?  No.  He doesn&#39;t.  </p>

<p>So, when he claims that putin ordered his email hacked, or that his email hack was linked directly with the dnc breach, he&#39;s simply showing everybody that he&#39;s full of shit.  And that by extension the entire russia story is bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our government still says they have evidence that putin directly ordered the hackings and that the russians were behind podesta&#39;s email hack. I certainly think all that evidence needs to come out, but at what point is the trump administration responsible as well? If that narrative is complete BS they need to expose it. You&#39;ve still got Pompeo out there saying wikileaks is an enemy of the state and all that shit. There are a lot less explanations for the podesta emails than there are for the DNC ones, but I don&#39;t think a politician believing what the government tells him proves he&#39;s full of shit. The new administration has all the evidence used to make the claim russia was behind it, if its fake or spurious they need to come out and say it.</p>

<p>Is it a false claim? It isn&#39;t really proven one way or the other but for that one at least there are things that give us a certain degree of suspicion it was russia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Skippy was using gmail, so the chance we&#39;ll ever know what <em>truly</em> happened is pretty close to nil. </p>

<p>However, we have WikiLeaks emails that prove Skippy lost his BlackBerry in a Taxi. We also know he had his passwords in plain text in his emails. We also know two of his passwords were &quot;p@assw0rd&quot; (fucking really? LOL) and &quot;Runner4567&quot; (again, fucking LOL). </p>

<p>So, in your mind, what&#39;s the most likely scenario.. that the Russians would hack the gmail of John Podesta, someone found Skippy&#39;s BlackBerry, or someone just brute forced &quot;p@ssw0rd&quot;? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>the passw0rd one was what tech support gave him for his first login to a windows 8 computer, it wasn&#39;t a personal password. and &quot;Runner4567&quot; is hardly a great password but its unique enough that google would catch on if you were trying to brute force it. I think it is more likely he was phished than his account hacked into in a more sophisticated way, but that doesnt preclude that whoever made the bitly link was part of a russion op that also got colin powell and the IOC etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol keep on believing your delusions in spite of all the evidence to the contrary.   </p>

<p>When he tried  and failed to get NFL owners to fire players for demonstrating their first amendment rights, was that calculated work?</p>

<p>Every time he throws a fit at Kim Jong IL because he won&#39;t back down and trumps approval rating slips just a little more each time, is that calculated too?</p>

<p>When he gets into a twitter battle with gold star widows and calls them a liar, claims to have proof yet never reveals it and is called a liar by his own party, is abandoned by his own party, and likely makes the gop lose seats, is that all calculated too?  </p>

<p>Boy he must have something huge in mind down the road if he&#39;s going to come back from all of this.  Also, what makes you think this is all calculated?  Show me something that isn&#39;t delusional trump dick sucking.</p>
