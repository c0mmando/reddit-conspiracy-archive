       Even with universal healthcare you still have to pay it out in taxes. The US has the most expensive healthcare system in the world, by quite a wide margin I believe. The reasons for these high costs need to be addressed.

       Universal healthcare would address that issue. Look at drug prices in canada,UK,Germany vs the US. they are 3-5x more expensive at least. regulation is the only way to drive the cost down.

       "Free market,"  only means a seller controlled market free of consumer and labor protection.

       Free markets can work, and socialist programs can work. These two things are not opposites, they're not mutually exclusive. There are situations in which socialist programs make far more sense than letting the market run its course, and vise versa. If all you have is a hammer, every problem will look like a nail to you. Unfortunately, when it comes to economic policy, not every problem will be a nail. Sometimes you need a screwdriver. Different tools, as different problems require different solutions. You could address every problem in the world with a free market or socialist solution one way or the other, but you'd miss a lot of opportunities to more efficiently solve a lot of problems.

       I dig this reply. I'm not sure what to call the shit show we have right now in the health care system. It isn't free and it isn't really socialist. It's a hybrid shit show that is the worst of both.

       I'm going to expand on this. I think it's really weird, that in this sub of all places, people think it's a good thing to hand over everything that has to do with Healthcare over to the government.
       <br/>
       Set aside the economic arguments over it all, and think about all of the extreme horseshit the government has been responsible for over the last fifty years, bs that is exposed over and over again in here. How can giving the government complete control over Healthcare be anything other than crazy?

       I don't understand how people can square this.

       I don't believe the drug companies spend nearly as much money on advertisements in those countries (is it actually $0 since advertising isn't permitted outside the US??) for their drugs or lobbying to get regulations eased or removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while all these highly educated professional politicians and economists are totally confused on how to bring down the cost of healthcare I'm sitting here watching $$$$ thrown at pointless ads on TV from Pfizer etc and driving past these hospitals that look more like Silicon Valley tech campuses with huge fountains and marble everywhere and just shaking my head.  Am I taking crazy pills here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Much like the tax debate/student loan debate, the issue isn't the high taxes - its the inefficient manner which those tax dollars are spent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop all the drug ads.  Hospitals should be simple buildings with quality staff and affordable care.  I don't believe this would fix the problem on it's own, but for fucks sake its a switch you could flip today and start seeing an impact immediately.

       Actually regulation is the cause of our expensive drugs here in the U.S. If we added profit ceilings or drug price regulations on top of the cluster fuck that is our current host of pharmaceutical regulations, we'd just wind up killing the pharmaceutical industry and having to bail it out with more money we don't have. You could crash the global economy with that bad idea.

       Universal healthcare doesnt fix the problem that hospitals charge hundreds of dollars for ibuprofen or IV bags. Or that 30 secs with an emergency clinic doctor, just to get a subscription of antibiotics for an ear infection, will cost $1,500+.

       Force government to fix these issues first, then talk about universal healthcare. Throwing more money into a corrupt system doesnt incentivize them to operate more efficiently or honestly.

       Why shouldn’t health services and products be treated like any other service or product? Food is another necessity but we don’t need a universal food system to ensure people get fed. The government intervenes more in the healthcare market than any other, so you can’t blame the market for the costs. Blame the tax code. Blame medical licensing. Blame tort laws.

       I agree with you our current system is busted and untenable, but so is the NHS. The debt and spending of the welfare states in Europe in not sustainable either it just spreads the costs onto taxpayers.

       No, a lot of it is the fact that healthcare is actually expensive as fuck in America, and that's on healthcare facilities, physicians, pharmaceuticals, government agencies, and litigation practices. Insurance companies make as much money from malpractice insurance policies as they do from healthcare insurance policies. Pharmaceutical companies have a lack of competition because of regulations barring international competition, and a hijacked FDA designed to keep development costs too high to invite domestic competition. Healthcare facilities are forced to provide excessive care to avoid being sued, which ties back into our legislation on healthcare litigation. The whole system is fucked top to bottom. The health insurance scam was designed to keep the insanity going. The war on drugs made plenty of safe and cheap drugs completely illegal, opening up room for pharmaceutical companies to make zillions off of peddling slightly safer, patent-able versions of those drugs. Before all this bullshit compounded on itself, we had fee-for-service healthcare which worked just fine. You'd go to your doctor and spend less than $10.00 in today's money for some cheap marijuana to treat your headache. Why, because it worked, and it was safe. Seriously the whole fucking industry is completely fucked and insane from top to bottom.

       Drug prices would be capped and insurance companies would have to be competitive to be who the government contracts with. We'd save about 50% of what we already pay by paying a specific tax and would remove deductibles.

       The ACA and universal healthcare are not the same thing, and not really a step in the same direction. How prices are capped and companies made to be competitive is different from country to country, and we should probably have an honest discussion about which systems work, and which ones don't, so we can create a system from scratch that learns from the mistakes of other countries.....
      </p>
      <p>
       ....but we won't. This is because doing this wouldnt benefit insurance companies, or pharmaceutical companies. It would benefit most of us, but there isnt a powerful lobbying group for most of us. Also we have propaganda that tells dumb people that universal health Care is socialism, and socialism is communism, and communism is Stalin killing millions of his own people, and then he's gonna take your guns, and put you in jail for saying merry Christmas, and black people aren't going to stand for the national anthem at football games, and you'll be forced to speak Spanish, and be gay transexual vegans and all these horrible things, all because we adopted a more cost effective healthcare plan.

       Companies aren't particularly efficient either. Really, humans aren't very efficient. The government gets a bad rap for being inefficient because it's not as susceptible to change as the market, what with income being derived not from consumers choosing to buy a product, but from citizens being forced to pay taxes. You've got to wait for election day to change a government program, but you can topple a corporation over night when you boycott. In my experience, corporations can be just as idiotic and inefficient as government organizations, and they can stay in business for decades and centuries.

       Not only do other nations do this, the US does it, too. Medicare and the VA, while both have their problems, are able to greatly reduce costs precisely because they can bargain with a very large patient base.

       I pay the equivalent of about $50 a month in tax for healthcare, that's for everything, no matter what happens, no deductible. Prescriptions are all a flat $10 and if you need more than one per month then you just pay $15 a month for all your prescriptions, whether you have two types of meds per month or two hundred per month. I don't get why Americans are so against it. It's not like you're prevented from taking out private insurance as well if you want to.

       Except our high healthcare costs are only partially (and very marginally) because of our private insurance companies. If I had to pick one thing to pin as the cause of our expensive healthcare, I'd have to pin it on our legal system. It is easier to sue doctors in America than in any other country in the world. Likewise, physician costs in the U.S. are more expensive than in any other country in the world. It's because doctors and hospitals need to carry expansive malpractice insurance, which is incredibly expensive. It's a good idea to protect people from shitty doctors, but in America it goes well beyond that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second major source would be how excessively profit oriented our healthcare industry is. Facilities are not just built to be functional, they're built to be beautiful, luxurious even, and to have the most excessively top of the line equipment. Expensive treatments and procedures are recommended far in excess compared to other countries. This is as much a result of an effort to make money as it is to protect against lawsuits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next you have the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries. Big pharma basically has monopoly in our drug market. Domestic companies have no international competition thanks to the FDA. Medical tech companies are subject to regulations designed to protect consumers that really just protect physicians and healthcare facilities from litigation through excessive quality control.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing these sources of inflated costs all have in common is excess, which should come as no surprise to foreigners. What can us Americans do? The industry is unanimously going forward in this direction of excess. It's not like you can change it, there's no competition you can go to that isn't ridiculously expensive for these same reasons. The culture of excess in healthcare here is uniform.

       you forgot to mention that  so called R&amp;D premium costs are due to financial analysts baking in the losses once the patent expires and generics flood the market. They try and milk the most out of a patent.

       Strawman. You really think pharma that OWNS a patent for so long is going to keep costs low because...reasons? NO! They are going to keep it as high as possible for as long as possible due to profits. Just look at Epipen and even stuff like PrEP...inflated costs  only because of patents....

       The situation is that we need to remedy the insurance industry and get money out of politics. I'm not necessarily for single payer blindly, but the root of the issue is the large pharma lobbyist groups

       One thing is certain, if they can only hold the patent for say, five years, the costs will certainly be inflated. You could just increase the length of the patents and put into effect profit ceilings on the industry.

       Because the litigation itself is expensive as fuck, and even if a consumer thinks they can get $100,000 instead of $300,000, they'll still sue, because they know they'll win. A lot of tort reform is just about making the payout cap smaller, not actually making it harder to win.

       Not true. Just spent time tonight volunteering at a welfare food distributor. It was nice helping people out. It was disappointing packing up a lot of foods that I myself can’t afford. But I’m sure you know all about this from your extensive experience of helping others.

       I really doubt that amount you would pay in taxes would exceed what most people on the US pay on a monthly bases currently. Why do people always bring that up like it's an issue? I'd be happy to pay taxes for health care instead of $300 a month for a $1000 deductible insurance.

       According to polls, most people in most countries with universal healthcare seem to like it. I guess the added wait times are better than choosing between treatment and unescapable generational debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anectdotally speaking, I'm in the military so I get government healthcare and you're right the waiting times can be longer but  not 3 months longer (if they can't serve you in 30 days you get referred out in town for free). My wife and I had a difficult birth for our son, that without government healthcare would have cost us upwards of 6 million dollars, but instead we didn't have to pay a dime. I couldn't imagine having a new child and having to be saddled with that kind of debt. So I'm very grateful for my government healthcare, and wish others could have it too.

       I'm fine,  I have benefits, but  also am compassionate.  I understand that not everyone is as blessed as I am.  Things are complicated my dude,  my little brother is an electrical engineer,  grew up in one of the most industry rich locations in the entire country, and he still had to find work in Maryland rather than Texas.  skills or not,  a bunch of people struggle to afford healthcare.  Hell,  I struggle to afford heath care,  cant get it for my wife because I would be spending more on health insurance than rent,  and I have a good job with benefits.

       She is a stay at home Mom.  I have it,  the kids have it with chip,  but to add my wife would take my premium from almost $400 a month to almost $1000 a month.  More than rent.  Its a scam,  and a ludicrous one at that.

       the current congress has had ample time to pass legislation, but hasn't been able to and the current president seems more worried about sabotaging Obama's legacy than keeping insurance costs down for average Americans. I think there's a bipartisan solution to be found and the current bipartisan bill would go a long way but I find it incredibly disappointing that the political party who's been unified in calling the current system broken couldn't come up with a way to fix it

       This current bill (obama care) is a republican plan from the 90s with acceptance of pre existing conditions tho lol.

       Also 4 or 5 “gop’s” (not really they are definitely lobbyist) have blocked it. That changes this month when we get to the polls. Lol.

       It’s just now coming up on a year bub. The reason our premiums are high in the first place because they had a master plan of wealth re distribution. They succeeded so far.

       Do you think it's fair that someone that is in good health and works pays a lot more for insurance with high deductibles than someone in poor health that lives off of government aid?

      <p>
       Also do you think it fair that a healthy, 20 year old that works at a company pays the same amount for health insurance as the 60 year old that smokes. is overweight, and has a heart condition?

       Obamacare is not the answer. If our government wanted a healthcare system that benefited the people we would have one. Unfortunately, Obamacare only benefits the poor and the insurance company's.

       Not really. Just making a case against American Health Insurance the way it is now and has been for quite awhile. If it was real insurance and just covered unexpected illness and accident than it would be closer to what insurance actually is supposed to be and it would be much more affordable imo.

       Actually, that's called catastrophic health insurance, and it was awful. The laws were changed because they were selling that and calling it

       No, it isn't. Life is inherently unfair and pretty horrible for some people. It's sad but true.

      <p>
       Is it fair to take people's money against their will? The "Government" didn't give you anything they didn't take. Whether that's fair or good or positive is up to interpretation, but the fact remains.
      </p>
      <p>
       Requiring insurance companies to offer insurance to sick people and subsidizing the costs destroys insurance. It's like passing a law that says you have to give someone homeowners insurance after their house burned down. Sooner or later, homeowners insurance companies will be bankrupt. And then no one gets homeowners insurance because it's a guaranteed loss.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obamacare either was designed to fail (what I believe) to pave the way for a single payer system (which I'm not opposed to) or legislators and executive branch members don't understand basic economic principles (possible, but unlikely).

       No, I'm not a "healthcare economist" because that's not a thing. I have studied economics and have a degree in accounting. Legislating that businesses engage in activities to cause them to lose money is know as a "perverse incentive" and will eventually cause them to go out of business. I'm sure even someone of your intelligence level can understand the concept.

       Yeah, not going to get into semantics over titles and degrees, but sure, I'll give you this one. What I meant is that economics principles are the same across all concentrations or areas of focus. You don't have to be a "healthcare economist" to understand fundamental economic principles.

       Much more relevant would be an understanding of insurance policy (of any type or industry) than the specifics of healthcare. But I guess keep bringing up irrelevant info and obfuscating your argument. You really got me; good job buddy.

       I can see that but I don't think that's the case on the open market? I certainly know people less "healthy" than me who pay more but I figured that was age/position related. Does the gov subsidize businesses to even out the cost, or does it just get distributed to the other employees?
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly don't know, and I've always just rolled the dice when I was unemployed cause that shit is expensive for sure - that's why I appreciate my employer provided insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
       All things considered I'd rather not have insurance tied to my employer since I work in a volatile industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't it be a nice kickback for corporations to not pay for that shit (or pay less)? Seems like if we called it a corporate tax cut everyone could be on board.

       To be fair, smokers pay a shitload of taxes on their smokes, that allegedly go towards health care costs for the country. The fast food junky blob with nonstop health problems eats up lots of health care, and their mind bogglingly unhealthy habits are not taxed. Young fat people have massive health problems, compared to the relatively health problem free young smoker.
       <br/>
       Fat people have health issues all through their lives. If a smoker gets lung cancer at 60 years old, they will still rack up less costs than the 60 year old who has been fat as a house their entire life.

       I'd prefer that the United States politicians didn't sell out the US citizens out to rake in lobbyist money from the corporate insurance profiteers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can go to multiple foreign countries as a US Citizen &amp; get way better healthcare IMMEDIATELY than I can in my own goddamn country where I am mandated to pay in &amp; get denied payment 50% of the time for Primary Care Doctor visits.

       Well we are on platinum level &amp; pay a fcuk ton of money every month. United Healthcare has denied payment on 2 out of 4 total Primary Care doctor visits for yearly checkups.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you call there customer care number you are put on hold for 2 hours until you eventually get to leave a voicemail from a rep that never calls you back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus it takes a week to get into the Primary for an appointment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had same day service &amp; paid cash twice in Mexico &amp; Russia with beautiful German &amp; Swiss medical equipment &amp; intelligent doctors for 
multiple day stays in a nice hospital for UNDER $1000 USD.

       United Healthcare is breaking the law then. I suggest reporting them to whichever body governs insurance in your state. And you can also sue them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would you have a platinum policy? Those don't ever seem to make much sense when you can get a mid-range deductable plan with an out of pocket cap. A bronze plan has a 13k max out of pocket. That's probably less/month if you actually max it than your plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our healthcare has huge problems and the ACA is far from perfect. But its far better than what proceeded and and certainly better than that piece of shit Congress tried to pass. Its totally fixable with some adjustments, but the ruling party can't do that for purely political reasons. It sucks, but here we are.
      </p>
      <p>
       And bear in mind healthcare costs rise every year and have for decades. Its hard to know exactly what piece of it is responsible for what piece of the premia.

       The New World Order for brainwashing the public into thinking that modern medicine based on vaccines, invasive surgeries, and pharmaceuticals is the key to health.

      <p>
       The reality is that our air, food, and water supply have been systematically poisoned, and for the most part people are too concerned with their fantasy football team to bother researching what they can do to improve their health.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop eating meat and dairy, don't drink tap water, don't get vaccines, and get off your ass and do some exercise a few days a week. And if by some chance you do still get sick, you have a multitude of herbal medicines that can cure your ills. Go see a naturopathic doctor instead of a big pharma shill in a lab coat.

It's also conveniently forgotten that they originally wanted to include a national opt-in group plan that would have very likely had much more reasonable rates for everyone.

       Obviously it's always been cheaper to not buy health insurance. Also was cheaper to buy shitty health insurance that didn't cover hospital stays. The whole point of any sort of insurance is to have it before you need it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for getting pills, that sounds like a completely separate issue, one that could probably be solved without upending the entire health insurance industry.

       Trump is NOT a republican. He just had to have a party to win. This isn’t a pro trump statement even tho on a lot of things I’m pro this administration and their current decision for the most part. Still some things I do not like.

       But you're implying it got better. Sure it sucked before Obamacare, but at least you didn't have to worry about paying a bullshit fine for not having insurance, or being price gouged like crazy to pay for all the subsidized care. It 'sucked' before, but price point is a part of health insurance, and it got a lot worse after the ACA. Options also got worse.

       <em>
        even with tax increases

       , which would also have ensured
       <em>
        everyone

       had health coverage and not only that but independent of employer (meaning workers are no longer chained to shitty jobs because they can't afford to lose their health care...). If only.

       Oh wait, we did have a candidate like that, woops. Funny how the two we ended up with

       want to continue enriching the pharmaceutical and insurance industries at our collective expense....

       I know you're talking about Bernie Sanders, but Trump did praise universal healthcare systems multiple times during the campaign and beyond even. He even said that the government should pay for it, everyone would be covered, and we'd save a lot of money. He wasn't really supportive of the idea obviously, but Clinton didn't expose his bullshit either. Probably because she also wasn't really for single payer (it will "never ever come to pass" according to her) and she didn't want to even have that fight.

       Trump has praised universal healthcare and even advocated for it at times, and has also said he doesn't want it and it would never work. He's just a salesman that tells people what they want to hear.

       If you're suggesting Fox News esque "The government will have death panels!" type hysteria, I just want to point out that people are
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       being denied healthcare, only through the abstraction of being priced out of it. People are already going years without seeing doctors for easily treated conditions simply because they can't afford it. These
       <em>
        same
       </em>
       people are then costing you money anyway when they inevitably rush to the emergency room, rack up medical debt they can't pay (which will be more expensive for a
       <em>
        treatment
       </em>
       than for
       <em>
        preventative
       </em>
       care) which inevitably passes cost on to you as our for profit insurance and pharmaceutical companies adjust costs. If you don't want to "pay for other people's health care" you should probably drop your (private) insurance coverage anyway because
       <em>
        that's literally the point of insurance
       </em>
       . The only difference is, it being privately owned, profit is skimmed off everything for shareholders' exclusive benefit, and there is an economic incentive to fuck people over for profit if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't even going into how fucked up it is that the majority of "decent" health coverage in the US (except for people who already get medicare...) only receive it through their employers. Frustrated at your job? Welp better hope you don't have a medical condition that necessitates frequent health care because you're fucked if you just up and quit. From a (left)-libertarian perspective, how free can you really be under such a system?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the recent push for religious legal exemptions on benefits, what happens when your employer decides they don't want to cover something? Good luck friendo, hope it's not a necessary treatment.

       I didn't think he had a chance because I knew from the very beginning exactly what he was up against. A global oligarchy in partnership with various bourgeois instruments of the "deep state" i.e. the CIA et al. Kinda hard to stand against what amounts to literally all the money in the world when you're relying on $27 donations. Ya know, for not being a leader he did pretty well considering the circumstances.

       The real conspiracy is the fact Obama took a republican healthcare plan from the 90's, let the insurance companies rework it, added a mandate and liberals defend it because it allow pre-existing conditions.  Dennis Kucinich called it out when he voted against it the 1st time, it's a bail out under a blue cross.

       The other conspiracy is what Obama told Dennis on a airforce one flight to get him to change his mind, or the fact that health insurance isn't really insurance anymore.

       Yes, Obamacare is far from perfect, but what Trump is

        doing

       <p>
        The nonpartisan office estimates that average premiums in the health law marketplaces
        <strong>

       They already predicted premiums to go up 25% this year, so, I guess I'm not sure if this is a bias angle against Trump or not (not a trump supporter, just know most stories have a bias against Trump).
      </p>
      <p>
       10/01/2016:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Monthly insurance premiums for popular plans on HealthCare.gov are rising by 25 percent on average next year, according to government data. But the increases will be more dramatic in certain parts of the country, especially for consumers not receiving subsidies, the numbers show.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nowhere has been harder hit than Arizona. Take somebody living in Phoenix, where the cost of the premium for a benchmark plan is
        <strong>
         growing by a whopping 145 percent to $507 a month in 2017
        </strong>
        when compared to this year, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which tracks how premiums are changing in some major cities.

       Yup, I noticed, and my point is 'I'm still not sure if there is a bias being put into it'.  If last year it was announce there were premium hikes (some as much as 145%), even though we were told Premiums were going to go down years ago, it makes you wonder how fucked up the system is to begin with.  Yes, Trump is to blame for not guaranteeing the subsidies for the Insurance companies, but how much of that hike is because of Trump, and how much is because they were already going to go up?  I don't exactly trust the MSM to paint an unbias picture, hence why I question it.

       I'll be downvoted to hell but I'll say it -- health insurance is a scam if it covers 'pre-existing conditions.' Insurance companies need to be able to mitigate risk or else they'll go out of business. What's the point in even having health insurance if you can just wait until you're extremely sick or injured to get a plan, and then use it for a fraction of what it would've cost out of pocket? Who pays for these kinds of people? Well the people who actually live day to day and pay for yearly health insurance, that's who. Price gouged to living hell to pay for a broken system. It's fucking dumb.

       You shouldn't be downvoted, insurance by definition is essentially a group of people pooling their money together against to protect themselves from something.  It's almost like a group bet.  You should read that last link I have, health insurance isn't insurance any more.

       As an aside, health insurance shouldn't be used to pay for things you WILL need. Why would a doctors visit be included by an insurance program?  I will go to the doctor every year. Why can't I just pay him for the visit? As you have alluded, health insurance is supposed to cover unforeseen medical costs.

       Trump's healthcare plan had a nice compromise. Anyone who went without healthcare for a year or more would be considered higher risk and would consequently lay 33% more in premiums for one year, at which point they would be moved back to the standard risk pool.

       It's because private health insurance will always be at odds with the governments goal of having a healthy population due to the profit incentive. True, private insurance would only cover the rich, healthy portions of America. So the question is, do you want health insurance or health coverage?

       The goal of the government is not healthy citizens.  It’s tax revenue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cigarettes are known to cause cancer. It’s well documented. Yet they remain legal.  Why?  Because each year the government increases the taxes on cigarettes. They could ban them outright, but then they’d lose that tax revenue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is marijuana so popular with state governments now?  Because of tax revenue.

       Because we live in a mostly free country. The high taxes on "sin" items is to encourage you to not use them. It barely works and ends up just extracting extra revenue from people that do, a cynical person might see that as getting the extra tax revenue in advance of them dying from their unhealthy choices, I think it's more that taxing "sin" items is an easy political score.

       If it’s a free country, why do we have to wear seatbelts? The answer - most likely because it reduces insurance costs and hospital costs and healthcare costs.

       Sorry not OP just chiming in with my 2 cents (worth as much).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure whether the gov cares about our health but they do care about us paying taxes and sick people are bad at that (dead people are debatable).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think taxing cigs is just the middle ground. I'm sure someone somewhere ran the numbers to maximize net tax revenue adjusted for health consequences. Setting the tax right where it'd maximize returns. Can't kill the tobacco industry though cause they're providing money too, a second factor to consider in the equation. Dunno if those results were used but I'm sure they were calculated.

       It's a scam to enrich private insurance owners by mandating everyone in in the pool but denying payouts. You call their "patient helpline" &amp; you literally get put on hold for over 2 hours until they let you leave a voicemail &amp; no one ever calls you back.

       Exactly.  Insurance isn’t there to help you.

      <p>
       Why do we require auto insurance?  Because if you total your car, the bank wants to get paid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Homeowners insurance - if our house burns down or whatever, the bank wants to get paid.
      </p>
      <p>
       And health insurance?  Well the government can’t deny you basic healthcare in an emergency, so they mandate that everyone gets it.

       Insurance exists for whoever

       I had a cousin who was pregnant and she signed up for Obamacare. You'd think she was the one whose house burned down, and was gaming the insurance company, right? Well, she added up her monthly payments and her deductions for 12 months. It cost just about the same as it would to deliver her kid out-of-pocket at the hospital.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's also quality: If she were to deliver at the crappy hospital down the road (where homeless crack addicts go in the middle of the night) she would've saved $400 and had medical interns be the one to deliver her kid.
      </p>
      <p>
       What she
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       didn't know was how many doctors opted out of marketplace insurance. She'd see online that they'd cover united or blue cross thinking she'd be fine... only to realize that there were two separate substrates of the insurance: market, and private. They usually only covered private.

       All for-profit insurance is a scam. For the individual, you're basically gambling and betting that something bad will happen. Can you imagine going to a casino and putting down 500 bucks bet on a roulette table that you'll get deathly sick? For the company, they're motivated to refuse to pay out for anything if possible. Their ultimate goal is to take money from people repeatedly without paying anything out. Neither side of this deal seem very good, smart, fair, etc.

       Instead of fixing the huge price gouging and price collusion problem in big pharma and the health industry, Obama forced everyone to buy insurance to cover the possibility of paying those prices. And he hid part of the cost with subsidies.

       People further down are calling for socialized health care and believing a fantasy that the government will work against the healthcare industry to lower the costs. Why would they do that?

       They would do that simply because people are calling for it, and their elect-ability could potentially depend on it. I refuse to believe that the voters here can not successfully mobilize to force politicians to nationalize healthcare when it's already been done in so many other first-world countries

       I’ll use mine as an example
      </p>
      <p>
       I was charged 36 dollars for a single blood glucose test strip.
       <br/>
       The hospital used the SAME EXACT strip as I use at home 
I can walk into Walmart or Target with no insurance and buy a pack of 100 for about 30.
       <br/>
       The charge at the hospital does not include administering the strip.  That is listed under a separate part of the bill.

       I used to work in a hospital and helped a bit with billing when we were short in IT department.  It's all the Insurance Companies faults.  We'd bill out $25,000 for something that cost the hospital $10,000 to do in hopes that we'd get $5,000 in reimbursements.

       Did data entry for a dentist. Same shit. It was a small office but holy hell every insurance companies has some many specific (to them) rules about how to bill and shit like that, and there's a million fucking insurance companies. People thinking this is somehow more efficient are morons. The USA spends more (as a percentage of GDP) on healthcare than anybody else. Profit incentives don't belong in health care on a moral basis, and it's not even working on an economic one.

       That's by design. The insurance company pays $5,000- that's $5,000 deduction on their taxes, because they lost $5,000. But it's also a $20,000 deduction for the hospital, because they didn't get the $25,000 that they charged. Everybody profits, nobody pays taxes.

       The difference between your glucose test strip and theirs is that theirs is made in a facility that meets the standards of excessive medical technology quality control regulations-regulations that are very expensive to keep up with. Seriously, the tools used by physicians to practice healthcare are so meticulously created, you'd think they were made in automated factories on a space station and shipped down to earth in a space elevator.

       This is not correct. Medical devices and supplies, specifically glucometer test strips are not made in different locations or facilities based on end use be in hospital or in an out patient scenario at home. Same exact strip. Might be a different brand, but not one you couldn't yourself go switch to for the same price.

       Idk if the test strips in question are or not, I was using them as an example since it was mentioned in the comment, but medical devices and supplies are absolutely manufactured completely differently for consumer use and medical use, with different quality control standards.

       Again I think you are missing my point. You are trying to say that strip actually costs $30 plus dollars. The fact is it costs the same as the one you buy at CVS.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example a roll of sterile gauze will be billed at say 20 dollars in hospital. 
An identical roll of sterile gauze can be purchased at CVS for 10 dollars
That same roll was purchased by the hospital and CVS by the same distributor. Whom they paid at best 3 dollars for. That's the problem.

       No I'm not. I don't even know what specific product was being discussed. I was using it as an example for the difference in the cost of heavily regulated medical supplies and consumer products. I didn't know if the person above knew exactly what product was being used. They did and I later corrected myself in reply to them. My point wasn't to claim I knew exactly why that specific product cost so much more.

       That does happen, often times though they aren't charging you for the supplies themselves, but rather for their overhead as a medical facility.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the time, however, hospitals are getting much higher quality supplies than what consumers are going to buy. You might be okay with $50.00 forceps, but a cardiovascular surgeon is going to have a $200.00 pair easy.

       You are not correct sir. I have worked in healthcare for over 15 years. I have worked in the supply side of it for 2 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       A forcep is a forcep in a hospital. The same ones they use for stitching and other procedures is the same one that is being used in an OR.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only point you might be onto is if the hospital had placed a bid out and it was filled by someone over charging for the items because they can. That's the way the government works. So even in that case if they are buying the forcep for 200 it's in actuality, the same one you can buy for 50. I assure you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now unless you have more experience in the industry then I, please just accept you are wrong and this is the reason we are getting screwed over. It's not that the equipment costs more. It's just not the case. And if it is it's due to overcharging by the bidders for service, because they can.

       Definitely a factor, no doubt. A brain surgeon is going to want quality equipment, though, whereas if you need forceps for at home use, you're going to get some cheap ass stuff because you're just dressing a cut or burn or something. Aside from being over charged by medical supply companies, you also have the exorbitant cost of the medical facilities themselves. It's a shit sandwich from the ground up no matter how you look at it, and there really should be a government agency responsible for helping keep costs down in this industry. Profit ceilings can help, but that wont' solve the problem. We had massive increases in healthcare costs even with profit ceilings on the healthcare industry.

       Obamacare was/is the same. "low cost insurance" is what is known as catastrophic insurance with huge deductibles-$3,000-$10,000. It's fucking horrible.

       For the younger crowd, PJ was an acid head, SJW, hippy, psychedelic comedy writer, who went full on right wing republican, cut his hair, and started dismantling the hippy era SJW mindset.
       <br/>
       His early work was quite edgy as fuck.

       When I was working I paid about ten percent of my salary into Britain's National Insurance scheme. Now I'm old and ill I get free healthcare. Simple, cheap, and (in theory) not for profit. It's called Single Payer, aka the National Health Service, and you really don't know what you're missing. Our government is trying to make our health system be like yours.  We are going to get rid of our government very soon.

       The president said he was dropping billions in funding of “Obamacare” thus defunding the program.

       So now American citizens pick up the difference in cost, no big deal its just business.

       Trump said from day one he was getting rid “repeal and replace” of the ACA, anyone who voted for him knew this was going to cost thenselves thousands more in health care costs, no big deal.

       I work for an insurance company, I pay about 350 monthly and my deductible is 3500. It doesn't make any sense to me, why is healthcare so god damn expensive? I don't even go to the doctor, I have several things I should go for right at this very second but I cannot afford it. I might be able to afford it if I didn't have to pay that 350 a month but alas, I must. I remember it wasn't that long ago that I was paying a little over $150 per month and I had low copays, most prescriptions were fully paid for and really the only thing I'd have to worry about would be major surgeries.

Plus I look at people who are not as fortunate as me when I comes to income and I know if I am debating it they aren’t even thinking about paying for it. I have a friend that makes 31k a year and his is just as expensive as mine. And he is 5 years younger than me.

       It would be 900$ if I added my spouse. Luckily he has coverage through his work. But to add me to his plan would cost us 1300$ a month. How did we get to this point. I am a consultant so I work 1099 for myself I used to pay 100$ a month before they started messing with it now it’s 5x’s that.

       I’m sure it’s a good plan cost  but it’s ridiculous amounts of money. Compared to what I paid 2017. Don’t get me started on what I paid like 5-7 years ago.

       Arizona here. I'm paying $1200/mo. for coverage of a healthy, no pre-existing conditions, family of 2 non-smoking non-drinking parents and 2 young kids. With a fucking $20,000 deductible. And I still pay $50 for co-pays AND they still limit me to 3 visits per year per covered person. Fuck Obama.

       I'm young, no idea about any of  this. So, is insurance mandatory and is it 500 a month for everyone? I'm in the military so my healthcare is way different. Damn all this sounds like shit. I don't wanna stay in the militRy but the healthcare in the civilian world looks like shit

       I don't take health insurance, 30 and haven't been to the doctor since 18. I had it briefly around 19-20. I just workout and don't eat like shit. I figure if something is aggressive enough it will kill me doctor or not at this age. Plus I worked in healthcare for 4 years and that made me want it even less.

       I use it maybe twice a year so I can either run the odds on a Illness and not get it or lose my life savings if I get an illness to keep my self alive. Catch 22. There needs to be a complete renegotiation of the costs associated with patient services. Have you ever seen what they charge for an aspirin in the hospital. Jesus.

       First off I do not make 100k
Second someone who makes 100k a year pays 35-40k a year in taxes so they don’t bring home 100k which I  sure you are aware of. I am saying that no matter what you make no one should have to pay such an extreme amount for basic healthcare coverage.

       It’s just really sad that we are treated like this in our own country. I would like to see some real statistics on how many people are actually covered in the US and by what means. I think the higher these prices get the less people are covered.

      <p>
       I don't believe the drug companies spend nearly as much money on advertisements in those countries (is it actually $0 since advertising isn't permitted outside the US??) for their drugs or lobbying to get regulations eased or removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while all these highly educated professional politicians and economists are totally confused on how to bring down the cost of healthcare I'm sitting here watching $$$$ thrown at pointless ads on TV from Pfizer etc and driving past these hospitals that look more like Silicon Valley tech campuses with huge fountains and marble everywhere and just shaking my head.  Am I taking crazy pills here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Much like the tax debate/student loan debate, the issue isn't the high taxes - its the inefficient manner which those tax dollars are spent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop all the drug ads.  Hospitals should be simple buildings with quality staff and affordable care.  I don't believe this would fix the problem on it's own, but for fucks sake its a switch you could flip today and start seeing an impact immediately.

       If you're suggesting Fox News esque "The government will have death panels!" type hysteria, I just want to point out that people are
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       being denied healthcare, only through the abstraction of being priced out of it. People are already going years without seeing doctors for easily treated conditions simply because they can't afford it. These
       <em>
        same
       </em>
       people are then costing you money anyway when they inevitably rush to the emergency room, rack up medical debt they can't pay (which will be more expensive for a
       <em>
        treatment
       </em>
       than for
       <em>
        preventative
       </em>
       care) which inevitably passes cost on to you as our for profit insurance and pharmaceutical companies adjust costs. If you don't want to "pay for other people's health care" you should probably drop your (private) insurance coverage anyway because
       <em>
        that's literally the point of insurance
       </em>
       . The only difference is, it being privately owned, profit is skimmed off everything for shareholders' exclusive benefit, and there is an economic incentive to fuck people over for profit if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't even going into how fucked up it is that the majority of "decent" health coverage in the US (except for people who already get medicare...) only receive it through their employers. Frustrated at your job? Welp better hope you don't have a medical condition that necessitates frequent health care because you're fucked if you just up and quit. From a (left)-libertarian perspective, how free can you really be under such a system?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the recent push for religious legal exemptions on benefits, what happens when your employer decides they don't want to cover something? Good luck friendo, hope it's not a necessary treatment.

       Actually regulation is the cause of our expensive drugs here in the U.S. If we added profit ceilings or drug price regulations on top of the cluster fuck that is our current host of pharmaceutical regulations, we'd just wind up killing the pharmaceutical industry and having to bail it out with more money we don't have. You could crash the global economy with that bad idea.

       Fortunately we don't need government run health care because everyone has more than enough money to pay for all the medical expenses we could ever have.

       I dig this reply. I'm not sure what to call the shit show we have right now in the health care system. It isn't free and it isn't really socialist. It's a hybrid shit show that is the worst of both.

       Obviously it's always been cheaper to not buy health insurance. Also was cheaper to buy shitty health insurance that didn't cover hospital stays. The whole point of any sort of insurance is to have it before you need it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for getting pills, that sounds like a completely separate issue, one that could probably be solved without upending the entire health insurance industry.

       Universal healthcare doesnt fix the problem that hospitals charge hundreds of dollars for ibuprofen or IV bags. Or that 30 secs with an emergency clinic doctor, just to get a subscription of antibiotics for an ear infection, will cost $1,500+.
      </p>
      <p>
       Force government to fix these issues first, then talk about universal healthcare. Throwing more money into a corrupt system doesnt incentivize them to operate more efficiently or honestly.
