       This is a meaning of the word "know" that I wasn't previously aware of.
      </p>
      <p>
       In particular, if you believe you "know" that yesterday's attack was a hoax, then you probably "know" that any attack is a hoax, before any other information comes in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me ask you - how long after yesterday's attack did you "know" that it was a hoax?  What information led you to that belief?

       Conspiracy theorists believe all attacks are hoaxes because they can't fathom people are organically evil, but rather they choose to live in a world where evil is centralized and can be pointed at with a finger, whether it's government, corporations or some nefarious underground elitist network.

       Who ever told you people are organically evil ? I was told by experts most people are incapable of performing these type of attacks. It takes ALOTTT to shoot up hundreds or thousands of people or run down a crowd. If you think otherwise so be it. But you are wrong.

       Approximately 10% of people are "organically evil".  10% of people are "organically good".  80% of people are basically muddling along - they're "mostly honest" but also "sorta selfish".  They wouldn't hold you up at gunpoint, but if $100 fell out of your wallet, they might well pocket it if they thought you wouldn't see it.

       Yeah just to clarify, I didn't mean people are inherently evil, but rather that evil can be anywhere, and come come up in isolated pockets, not always as a command from a higher up. You can just be a crazy dude that decides to act on their inner evil.

       Yes, of course.  I wouldn't be in r/conspiracy if I didn't think that some portion of these evil events were not as they seem, but a majority of the world is more or less as it appears.

       People sometimes just go nuts and kill a lot of people, just as they have for all recorded history.  Yes, three letter agencies do a lot of evil things too but most of the world is real.

       We know that our secret police have been doing exactly these kinds of things for years in other countries, and even training the dictatorial regimes they install to do it. It looks exactly like those, if you care to read any actual history. Do we "know". No. Do all signs point to synthetic violence produced for purposes of media spectacle and indoctrination? Yep. Do we have a clear motive (enhancement of the security state, diminishing the rights at home)? Yep.

       Har har har.  I am under no illusions about the evil of the United States, which is why I left last year for a significantly less evil country, and I'm never coming back.  That was a serious undertaking, and don't give me this "your daddy" crap, because I actually got up and did something about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, my disgust with the bankrupt policies of my previous home have not blinded me to the difference between
       <em>
        knowing
       </em>
       something and
       <em>
        suspecting
       </em>
       something.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when it comes to yesterday's terrorist act, no one has yet presented any evidence  (at least on this page, or on the news) that it's a hoax.  To believe that something is a hoax without
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       corroborating information shows that you really aren't interested in the truth or falsehood of your own beliefs.

       At the risk of over-simplifying it, if "ISIS" is blamed or really even mentioned, you can assume it is a hoax. Although I have not taken the time yet to analyze this event, I would already bet money that no one can produce any image or video that corroborates the attack narrative in any substantial way.

       Yeah because it reinforces the anti immigration narrative and government is doing everything it can to keep that angle going
      </p>
      <p>
       Why feed a narrative about a white guy shooting a bunch of other white people, it's not good for the govt agenda therefore they are not as forthcoming wth the details, they are hoping people forget

       Didn't say either one was fake, just one is being more marketed than the other. Trump just tweeted important information about how the guy got in the country. Where's the Paddock tweet with any info about his background?

       This guy gets it! You don't know how many people don't understand this. People, even in on here, are eating up the anti immigration thing. It's also very telling how trump tweeted this attack in 30 min while the Las Vegas took 5 hours

       No, the media relies on information coming from authorities. If DOJ instructs FBI to not give any more comments to anyone or limits their resources, they choke up any stories the media can have with this, and they'll move on to something else, like a terrorist attack in NYC. Media can rely on leaks but some will see that as fake news because of the anonymity of sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I put my tinfoil hat on, I could see this being a false flag operation gone wrong and theyre trying to clean up after themselves. This was possibly meant to frame antifa or fake a violent anti conservative movement, in order to continue pushing conservative agenda. Maybe security guard ruined the plan.

       They do but then you have to use anonymous sources, which I understand. But many use that as an excuse to dismiss the entire story. Trump said not to trust reports that have anonymous sources.

       Your guess is as good as anyone's.  My belief is that a very small number of people are privy to Paddock's motive, which they have known for some time but are not releasing.  This motive is probably nasty enough to inspire reprisal attacks or at the very least put lives in danger.
      </p>
      <p>
       The handful of congressmen and senators behind the bump-stock legislation were probably told "just let this whole thing fade out, you don't want Vegas staying in the headlines or the motive is going to come out and things will get ugly for everyone, but especially for you."
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a hypothetical, but if the people found out that Paddock was some kind of anti-Trump zealot or affiliated with ANTIFA, imagine the reaction on the right when 500 country music fans were shot up by a leftist
       <strong>
        AND
       </strong>
       their deaths and injuries were being used to attack the second amendment.

       I think it has a lot to do with the attention span of humans post TV and Internet, specifically social media, porn, and YouTube. Everything is at your finger tips at all times so big scary monsters like Monsanto take too much time to even understand, then formulate a body of people with the goal to spread awareness and then decide an action to take and then persue it. Its too much for Joe schmo who has 3 kids and 10k in debt.
Again, perhaps by design, but i don't think humans are capable of that complex of civilization design.

       I've read convincing research that dairy and meat products cause cancer. And that quinoa has all the necessary proteins your body needs. That you can reverse diabetes with a plant-based diet. I'm basing this off of nutritionfacts.org which reviews thousands of papers a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are these facts true? I don't know. One thing I do know for sure is that no one gives a shit. Most likely even the people here with the tinfoil hat to suggest aliens landed couldn't wrap their head around not consuming another species milk every day. The food pyramid engrained into us at birth, that's the real conspiracy.

       Honestly it's hard to say what causes cancer and doesn't when it's all loaded with cancer causing (causes tons of other shit too like Chrone's Disease) pesticides and herbicides.

       First of all, fuck you.  Second of all, everyone here are after one thing.  To seek the truth.
       <br/>
       You may think that everyone who questions the "Widely Accepted Truth" are sane and everyone else are crazy.
But you should know that people who have questioned the "obvious truth" in the past are who we remember now.  Don't be so confident.  You could be wrong you know.

       I think.. well I'm hoping he meant to reply to who you replied to. Doesn't make sense if his response is to you. It kind of doesn't sound totally off when applied to the one above you.

       yeah I kinda couldn't agree with this more. that was my initial thought when this was happening, I live in NYC too so it's been a big topic of convo and tons of people contacting me asking if I'm okay. Like yeah I wasn't biking on the fucking west side highway in the middle of the day on a Tuesday, but I could die at any point from big Pharma funded addiction. or Monsanto shit being sprayed on all of our food for capitalistic gain, like you're suggesting. Any of this shit is more damaging and a much bigger killer than one guy mowing down 8 people.

       I don't think you're being entirely fair...
      </p>
      <p>
       For example under Saipov you list that we know where and when he rented the truck, but you don't mention that we also know about several stores where Paddock bought guns,
       <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/las-vegas-shooting-stephen-paddock-gun-shop-manager-bump-fire-stocks/">
        including one
       </a>
       that sold him a rifle just days before the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Saipov you say we know he had a paintgun and a bb gun, but under Paddock you don't mention that we know he had 24 guns in his hotel room, that 12 of them had bump stocks, that he had handwritten notes on where to aim, etc... You say we know the exact route Saipov took, but you don't say we also know when Paddock checked in, what room he stayed at, the car he drove to the hotel, etc. You say we know how Saipov got into the country and what mosque he attended, but I think we also have those answers for Paddock (he was born here, and none).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's apples and oranges really, but I think the only thing you can honestly say we don't know for sure about Paddock is why he did it.

       So in your opinion, we know just as much, if not more, about Stephen Paddock than Saipov?  Are you saying we are more sure about the personal details of Paddock, one month after the incident, than Saipov?  Are you sure about this?

       Yeah just to clarify, I didn't mean people are inherently evil, but rather that evil can be anywhere, and come come up in isolated pockets, not always as a command from a higher up. You can just be a crazy dude that decides to act on their inner evil.
