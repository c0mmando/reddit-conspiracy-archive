<p>Folks,  this is a tulip mania.   At first blockchain was a novelty,  an invention with some intrinsic value,  but folks,  there are now dozens of blockchain currencies to chose from,   and more will be created out of thin air.

    <div class="md"><p>Currencies are here to stay.    State or non-state,   electronic or cash,  even precious metals.    Currency is like language.    Its a tool for exchange.   Once you have a tool,  you don&#39;t usually scrap it unless you come up with a better one.</p>

<p>On the other hand,   languages,  means of exchange,  they are abstract,  they only have the meanings and values people agree to at any time.    You cant drive on a map or eat a word or a coin.    In the non-abstract world,   value has immediate ties to reality,  not derived ties as in words and other means of exchange that are not the &quot;thing&quot;.    Food,  air,  water,  shelter,  clothing,  transportation.     Keep yourself grounded man,   and whatever baseball cards the world wants to value today or tomorrow,  remember,  its nothing more than a convention.    New conventions have that extra sex appeal though.   Go for it!</p>

<p>Every time you bring up paypal you&#39;re only showing how much you don&#39;t understand cryptocurrency. They&#39;re so fundamentally different that I don&#39;t know where to begin.</p>

<p>So... no investing in other non-tangible services? No facebook? No Google? Hell the finance world even figured out how to make houses into non-tangible goods so they could fuck that up too. Just because something isn&#39;t as tangible as a sandwich or an acre of land doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s worthless.</p>

<p>Yeah, it sounds like you just fear change and I&#39;m sorry you feel that way but the rest of us will continue moving into the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No,  to be honest,  I don&#39;t know of a single friend who is into it,  but then my friends aren&#39;t into tech or investing all that much,  we are more into art,  conversation,   gardening stuff like that.    </p>

<p>What got my interest was that Jamie Damon was having a spat with Goldman Sachs on the matter.    Yeah,  I read Zero Hedge,  so that&#39;s what got me looking into it.    I had heard about it a long time ago and it never made any sense to me except if someone thought it would be handy on that website they shut down for trading in controlled substances.    </p>

<p>Prohibition seems to have been one of the driving forces for cryptocurrency,   but it turns out prohibition doesn&#39;t work,   and also that the feds can track cryptocurrency.    So,  outside of the nifty but readily available secure payment mechanism,  I chalked it up to a ponzi scheme in private hands instead of in the hands of the federal reserve.    Time will tell,   but its been a rather informative day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In your edit, you actualy prove the exact opposite.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>people say bitcoin has inherent value as a secure payment mechanism, but so does paypal or any number of banks who have online payment mechanisms</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Listen up, when you own bitcoin, in your wallet, you OWN it. nobody can get it for you. How much value can &#39;paypal or any number of banks&#39; can have, if they decide that they simply want to BAN you from using their service. What if they freeze your accounts ? </p>

<p>When the gouverment wanted to shut up Wikileaks, they ordered the banks , and paypal, to stop their services with them. And guess what? They were &#39;saved&#39; by bitcoin. Bitcoin is a permisionless system. There&#39;s no authority to tell you if you can or CAN&#39;T use it. Or to take it away from you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the recurring cost to society of maintaining this bitcoin farce is probably in the millions of dollars a day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you see how that gives it value? There is some WORK behind it. It is not created out of thin air. Not to mention, that that is also what keeps it safe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Compare that with the cost of paypal, or cash, per transaction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are comparing a payment system, with a store of value/possible payment system that is permisionless/unforgable with a FIX AMOUNT that is already known(so no inflation).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wall Street is a huge owner!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are just getting in the game. And even if that would be so..If I need something and I have to pay 100$ for it, I&#39;ll buy 100$ worth of bitcoin and send it to destination. (maybe 101$ cause of the network fee). So it dosen&#39;t matter if they crush the price, or up the price, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there are now dozens of blockchain currencies to chose from, and more will be created out of thin air.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, and many more could/would be created. so? Nobody says you should use it. or put money/faith in it.  If the kids around the block use bottle caps as currency in their games, Will you be mad on them? No.  But does it have any value to them? Yes.</p>

<p>In the end, value is abstract.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so to spend it you have to pay the price of conversion, conversion to a government sponsored fiat currency!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but imagine one day, if the currency settles up good, you will start seeing goods priced in bitcoin directly, not conveted to some fiat. Yes, it sounds like a huge, ridiculous dream, but, bear in mind, Bitcoin has been here for only 8 years, almost now it starts to pick some ground in &#39;the game&#39; and some big bankers are already terified of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Folks, this is a tulip mania</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds familiar, is your last name Morgan ?</p>

<p>The title &gt;Look who is buying bitcoin and why?</p>

<p>That is your just opinion. I for one, have quite a few years using it, actualy using it, not just for speculation. And it has made wounders for me, as regarding to moving funds arround.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll take my mathematical based currency anytime over some paper that some corupt gouverments says: here, this is the real deal. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s ok, by your tone, you are either a shill, or just in shock.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>its a modern day tulip mania in every way, suckers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Love it when trying to talk to somebody online, and their argument ends in &quot;suckers&quot; . Says a lot about your education, therfore, your vision. I&#39;m sorry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So could you.    And you probably did.    People made that kind of money on Enron too,   until they didn&#39;t.    </p>

<p>The rationalizations for Enron or any other ponzi are priceless.   Funny how when the bubble pops,  those are so quickly forgotten.    Greed gets replace by fear.    Its rather bipolar.</p>

<p>And notice,  you price the gain of hundreds in a day,  not in dozens of eggs,   not in gallons of gas,  but in dollars.    </p>

<p>In the meantime,  I have enough eggs and gas thank you,  without playing the casino.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Currencies are here to stay.    State or non-state,   electronic or cash,  even precious metals.    Currency is like language.    Its a tool for exchange.   Once you have a tool,  you don&#39;t usually scrap it unless you come up with a better one.</p>

<p>On the other hand,   languages,  means of exchange,  they are abstract,  they only have the meanings and values people agree to at any time.    You cant drive on a map or eat a word or a coin.    In the non-abstract world,   value has immediate ties to reality,  not derived ties as in words and other means of exchange that are not the &quot;thing&quot;.    Food,  air,  water,  shelter,  clothing,  transportation.     Keep yourself grounded man,   and whatever baseball cards the world wants to value today or tomorrow,  remember,  its nothing more than a convention.    New conventions have that extra sex appeal though.   Go for it!</p>
