       I understand that there's omissions that make it seem like this all originated in 2016, when in reality Page was on the radar since 2014. But weren't the actions of the FBI DNC, and DOJ like extremely unethical? Some people have said that hey if the other side is Trump and they are going to fight dirty then you have to fight fire with fire, I understand the sentiment but I think that's reckless thinking. It just seems like there should have been full disclosure about the funding and sourcing of the material as well as the various conflicts of interest. Is it really a nothing burger, am I missing something?

       That's not the same as saying it was the only evidence. If it confirmed other pieces of evidence they already had, then it still could have been instrumental.

       I'm willing to accept the possibility that the dossier contains something that connects with other intelligence that alone wasnt enuff for a warrant but together was substantial enuff for a warrant. That would explane mccabes statement.

       Exactly that huh? Emphasis mine:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        How do we know
        <strong>
         <em>
          the dossier was the only piece of evidence that justified a warrant?
         </em>
        </strong>
        Not knowing that question alone, makes the memo itself worthless.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The verbatim relevant quote from the memo:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Furthermore, Deputy Director McCabe testified before the Committee in December 2017 that no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Just to help you out is the definition of "exactly":
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        without discrepancy (used to emphasize the accuracy of a figure or description).

       This almost seems like a sort of bait, though I know that's not how Nunez means it. If/When Trump responds to the assertions (without facts) in this memo and performs yet another minor version of the Saturday Night Massacre, they'll be an outcry.

       At this point no matter what Trump does in this situation it will be highly scrutinized. If he doesn’t respond there will be cries of “not even Trump believes
       <em>
        the memo
       </em>
       ”, and if he says something people will claim “Trumps attacking the FBI/DOJ for investigating him”. There’s literally no where for this to go for him and it will be proven in the next hours/days.

       Trumps SOU made me squirm at times yet it seemed authentic like he at least believes the shit he says I think for the most part.  Obama was a great performer but I don't care about that.  Hopefully someday Trump accidentally lets us know what really happened on 9/11.

       I didn't read the memo. But would anyone be surprised if it came out that these swamp creatures target citizens with illegal surveillance ? They clearly have a common narrative they are interested in maintaining. If you step to them on their territory they fred Hampton you or Michael Hastings you. They use obscure religious zealots born in to death cults to target individuals like George Webb. Who else has heard the story of the pizza gate researcher who found cp on the comet ping pong servers. Who do you think the guy that got arrested in a gili suit in his bushes was? Why do we have former military industrial complex guys locking there entire family up in their bedrooms?

       I think it's premature to call it a nothing burger (also, just a personal note, I
       <em>
        hate
       </em>
       that term), but I think a lot of people are disappointed (for lack of a better word) with memo's contents. Considering this is entirely one party's spin, it just doesn't reveal the kind of thing they were claiming it would.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's premature to call this a nothing burger until more information, such as the Democrats' rebuttal, comes out. Right now we have less than half the story, really - but even that half is less dramatically horrible than they made it sound.

       It doesn't matter what it proves. What's important is what people think it proves. Clearly many people believe this memo proves guilt on the part of several democrats and FBI employees. Democrats have to respond to that. I'd really like them to just let Wray respond though. He's a Trump pick, so it'd be especially impactful for him to publicly respond.

       Less of a nothing burger and more like a Schrödinger's burger. It's a one-sided accusation that could have potentially omitted lots of things or taken them out of context. However, if it is true and there are no major omissions, then it is certainly NOT a nothing burger.

       You know, I am seeing a refreshing amount of real discussion in the comments about posts re: the memo.... even people who disagree usually or who disagree about larger political issues are getting along pretty well, either agreeing that there's more to this story while also not making this memo ignorable and/or respectfully discussing when they disagree.
      </p>
      <p>

       Its hypocritical and misses the larger picture.   Leaving aside the omissions and differing takes on the memo itself, the US state security agencies have been spying on politicians since the 1930's.  It's a long running issue that's only gotten worse with the exponential expansions of unaccountable mass surveillance in the 21st century. Nunes, the guy who released the memo, voted a few weeks ago to allow the NSA to spy on US citizens without a warrant and without legal recourse.  The FISA court, which conservatives are claiming was abused by using bad information to get a warrant, authorizes warrants in 99.97% of warrant applications, so it's not like there's any high bar there.  The fact that the public figures whining the loudest about this are generally the ones who've spent most of their careers defending the unaccountable surveillance state indicates this is nothing more than narrow partisan hypocrisy.

       That's what they are saying because they hope you don't read it and find out that government spy agencies are used to undermine elections.

       most people are lazy, TPTB knows this and relies on this. most wont even read the memo but instead just read people's comments

       Because it's touted as this Earth-shattering exposé when it's just a
       <em>
        memo
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it. It's a fuckin
       <em>
        memo
       </em>
       . And it's not even a bit-partisan, well-sourced memo with citations and corroborating evidence. In addition to that, it was made by
       <em>
        Devin Nunes
       </em>
       .... Devin Nunes. It's not even
       <em>
        close
       </em>
       to a credible, respectable person. It's fucking Nunes.... He was literally on the Trump transition team.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally. The memo doesn't even say anything new. It's literally no new information. The republicans have been hammering these talking points for by months. So why the heck are such old accusations being treated as "oh my gosh! This is HUUUUUGE"??
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same shit that's been pumped out by conservative media for months. It really feel flat for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole thing might as well have been an email from the RNC. That's the level of credibility it has.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think critically. Would you say it was huge if it were written by Rahm Emmanuel or Nancy Pelosi??? People can't honestly be this gullible. Not unless you were just seeking out to have you confirmation bias comforted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole "oh my god this huuuge!!!!" cried honestly just sounds desperate to make this memo into more than it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       It literally has even less substance than I expected. It might as well have asked me to donate to the RNC at the end cuz that's what it basically was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who was sincerely seeking the truth today is/should her massively disappointed.

       That's not the same as saying it was the only evidence. If it confirmed other pieces of evidence they already had, then it still could have been instrumental.
