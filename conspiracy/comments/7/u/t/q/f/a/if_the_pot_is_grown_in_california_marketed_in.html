       I love seeing conservatives say how awesome state's rights are when it comes crazy gun laws allowing people to own tanks and whatnot. Then when it comes to pot they flip their shit.

       I'm not aware of any prominent conservatives saying people should be allowed to own tanks. Most of the fights are about things like Washington DC virtually prohibiting ownership of firearms, or the right to get a permit to carry a firearm.

       Same comment to the other guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       11 states have laws on the books that state federal gun regulations don't apply to guns manufactured in their state. In Wyoming they're selling it as the ability to own any weapon you can dream up. Many pro first amendment (vast majority are conservatives) champion this cause and state's rights. Yet also love that Sessions is going to war with states trying to do the same with marijuana.

       Like, what? Did someone say you can own a literal tank in Wyoming? Or smaller things that are illegal under federal law, like machine guns?
      </p>
      <p>
       Marijuana legalization has pretty strong support, and federalism in regards to marijuana policy has even stronger support. I certainly don't support prohibition and am not going to defend other people as if identity politics were anything other than mind control.

       whatever the fuck you want man. I dunno, what kind of sweet machine gun tank mobile do you want? You want a rocket launcher on there? A laser for killing sharks? Ask some 6th graders to give you some ideas, they usually have pretty sweet drawings of these kinds of things.

       Well, Sessions even said “if the government wants me to not enforce the laws they need to change the laws.”
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a reasonable stance IMHO.  If people don’t want weed to be illegal, Congress
       <em>
        alone
       </em>
       has the power to alter the Federal Laws!
      </p>
      <p>
       The second amendment is
       <em>
        not a good comparison
       </em>
       because it is a Federal Law that they are legal due to being in the constitution, yet states are allowed to enact other regulations.
       <em>
        These are debated as they should be but there is not any overreach outside of the defined legal framework.

       Yeah.  The constitution also states that you can have nukes!  Arms is a general term meaning weapons and armor as written.  I wouldn’t test it though.

       Not necessarily. Some accepted legal definitons of "arms" around the time that the constitution was written can include the idea that arms are offensive or defensive equipment more on the scale of people. In the Heller decision Scalia even references one: "...Timothy Cunningham’s important 1771 legal dictionary defined “arms” as “any thing that a man wears for his defence, or takes into his hands, or useth in wrath to cast at or strike another.” 1 A New and Complete Law Dictionary (1771)..." You can make the argument that if this was what they had in mind then vehicle mounted weapons that someone simply mans are covered while something beyond that scale like nuclear weapons may not be. The term is often used more in reference to this now as well. People may be more likely to group nuclear weapons as large scale ordnance, or something separate like that.

       That is interesting.  Although it does leave open the possibility for mini nukes that are rpg propelled...

       Seems like playing semantics but it also makes valid sense.  On ships and such of the day, were cannons and torpedoes not referred to as arms?  I am not sure, I know the word comes from personal weapons like swords or armor, but the distinction is blurry.

       You're probably right about the first part. There's not really a clear line at which something ceases to be man operable and becomes some WMD, really. You kind if need to go by feel and reason to think out each scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cannons and the like probably qualify since they're simply manned by a person, hell you can wheel them round if you want. I see them on a ship being like a gun on a land vehicle.

       You can have fully functional tanks, F/A18s, Predator drones, etc.  It's just prohibitively expensive for 99+% of the population.  Of course, it's considerably cheaper to build your own, but then we run into a case of r/shittytechnicals

There are some of us who don't make our decisions on what we think is right and wrong straight down the party lines.  Straw man arguments like yours aren't helping anything either.

       How is it a straw man agrument? 11 states have laws on the books that state federal gun regulations don't apply to guns manufactured in their state. Many pro first amendment (vast majority are conservatives) champion this cause and state's rights. Yet also love that Sessions is going to war with states trying to do the same with marijuana.

       That argument, and states rights, ended with the Civil War.
      </p>
      <p>
       Texas is unique in that it joined the US as an independent country, not a territory, and in the agreement to join Texas reserved and was granted by signature, the right to leave the US of it wanted to.  (I have heard other states have similar clauses but I will focus on the one I know).  That right and agreement ended when the Civil War did.  By treaty, the Union had no rights to invade Texas or force it to rejoin.

       If the 10th amendment was meant to be “ended”, wouldn’t Congress repeal and the States ratify it?  A war treaty doesn’t single-handedly ratify the Bill of Rights.

       Being a southerner I was lectured my entire life about how ridiculous states rights arguments are. We fought a war over it etc.. 
I have always said it would be interesting to see states rights under a different circumstance that doesn't involve slavery.
Why hasn't the Federal government sent troops into these states that are clearly committing treason (according to the Union argument)?
Overall glad to see states rights become popular among people of various political beliefs particularly big government types. The irony is thick.

       Even if they allow unincorporated counties to exist, the crux of the argument is that an arbitrary "government" should have no business in personal affairs, and if someone wants to prevent it at the federal level, it doesn't make sense to not do the same at the state level. Anarchism is a term akin to conspiracy theorist. It's been bastardized and vilified because it's a dangerous idea to people that want power. If we are all mature individuals, we can govern ourselves in accordance with respect and don't need some extraneous body that is susceptible to corruption. I'm talking about each person individually governing their behavior, like the Buddhist way of right intention, or the Christ like way of love, or the humanist way of being a good fucking person.

       Human history unfortunately proves this all wrong.  Buddha and Christ both achieved their status through suffering at the hands of others.  Humanist reality is that suffering is a majority of life.  We fight so our kids don't have to, we fight today so we can enjoy tomorrow.  It's oxymoronic but we fight so we don't have to fight anymore.  Government is an attempt to civilize this process in hope that we can skip a fight or two and reduce the amount of suffering caused by the necessity of fighting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of the willingness to be governed is tied into the willingness to fight.  If you have two groups and both of them are equally lethal then they are less likely to fight and more likely to negotiate.  If one group is pacifist and the other is lethal as soon as there is competition over resources the lethal group with slaughter or oppress the pacifist group.  We are the children of mad men and very quickly will resort to violence when challenged.

       You can believe what's right or what should be all you want, but the legal reason is that the Federal government has a tenth amendment.  If you want to make an argument that the states should have a comparable law, that's a valid point but not really part of the discussion.

       California has right around 1/3 of the nation's welfare and assistance benificiaries, it has more debt and unfunded liabilties then all but 6 of the other remaining 49 states, it doesn't contribute to the defense of the nation at the same rate non-Californians do, and lastly, the Congress can make drug laws, as evidenced by the fact people are in federal prisons in that very state, due to what's commonly referred to as the Supremacy Clause.

       He's right. But there is Supreme Court precedent that directly contradicts it:
      </p>
      <p>
       "An Ohio farmer, Roscoe Filburn, was growing wheat to feed animals on his own farm. The U.S. government had established limits on wheat production based on acreage owned by a farmer, in order to stabilize wheat prices and supplies. Filburn grew more than the limits he was permitted and was ordered to pay a penalty. In response, he said that his wheat was not sold, so his activity could not be regulated as commerce, let alone "interstate" commerce (described in the Constitution as "Commerce...among the several states"). The Supreme Court disagreed, stating that, "Whether the subject of the regulation in question was 'production', 'consumption', or 'marketing' is, therefore, not material for purposes of deciding the question of federal power before us...[b]ut even if appellee's activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce and this irrespective of whether such effect is what might at some earlier time have been defined as 'direct' or 'indirect.'"

       Actually that is an interesting case because the argument for why it was interstate was because by growing wheat for his personal use he isn't buying wheat on the market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that the government was subsidizing wheat, but to prevent the market from collapsing (due to everyone switching to wheat and growing as much as possible) they put a cap on how much a single farmer could produce.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically they argued if everyone were to grow wheat for their personal use no one would purchase wheat on the market thus still destroying the market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since there is no ability to export wheat to a different state at this time I'm not sure if the same argument would work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would be fascinating to see it argued in court though.

      <p>
       It still satisfies the effect on interstate commerce that allows the federal government to regulate it. Because weed in one state could be sold to others there’s an effect on interstate commerce meaning it falls within the fed’s legislative authority to outlaw it. The supremacy clause means federal law trumps state law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wickard/Filburn gives almost limitless authority to the feds to regulate anything that could possibly have the smallest effect on interstate commerce. That’s how the feds could prosecute a gas station robbery with the Hobbs Act despite their lack of general police powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think pot should be deregulated country wide but the feds have grounds to regulate it.

      <p>
       Perhaps. The court and country is very different than when that ruling was made. I would typically agree but I believe carrying weed across state lines, even if both states have legalized it, is still a felony charge.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe It currently isn't possible to sell weed in different states legally.

       Basically the Wickard v. Filburn argument. Sorry, the federal government already wrapped it's gross claws around plants grown and used in the same state under the idea that they somehow can be considered interstate commerce since the lack of purchasing them from the greater out-of-state market affects that interstate market. Why? Because the constitution says that the federal government regulates interstate commerce.

       True, it will get stamped down with that clause. I can see the Pacific states taking this as far as they can though. Washington, Oregon, and now California have legal weed, and Oregon has said they'll fight it. Also Washington's AG is already showing a fight to the trump guys.

       If he understands the Constitution so well, then why doesn't he sponsor a bill that legalizes pot at the federal level?  Then Sessions can't do anything about it.  When I see all these Congress members complain about this stuff I think, why don't you do your fucking job and change the law?

       That is the point.  Cali state tax is crazy before adding Fed on top of it.  Cut out Fed tax and become self sustaining.  Cali is one of the few states capable of doing this.

       Was the electricity used in manufacturing created in California. Where any federal dollars used on the interstate (yes) in transporting the supplies? Was any of the fuel used in the trucks that shipped it from outside California? If any of this is yes, they work their logic into the fact that they have regulations. A hotel is deemed as interstate commerce because it is on a road. Messed up logic.
