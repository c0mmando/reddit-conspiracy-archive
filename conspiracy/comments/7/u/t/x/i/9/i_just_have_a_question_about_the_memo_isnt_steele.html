<p>But basically, I know there is the whole &quot;Russia Election Meddling&quot; narrative/investigation, with both sides arguing/debating whether or not this is true or false.</p>

<p>However, now with the Memo out, and Steele being an ex-MI6 and an admitted Trump hater (according to the quote to Bruce Ohr in the Memo), and him getting paid by Clinton (via a lawfirm) $160k.</p>

<p>Couldn&#39;t this be considered factual British Election Meddling?</p>

<p>You have no problem talking for others when it comes to the pee tap 4chan dossier thing. Trust me. You are WRONG. I was all over this sub and r/politics when the 4chan theory arose. Most Trump supporters claimed the ENTIRE dossier was made by 4chan. Don&#39;t believe me still?

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m basically looking to see if anyone can layout the timeline and information from the WH&#39;s perspective that is more comprehensive, logical or convincing than yours. I haven&#39;t seen one that comes close.</p>

<p>The narrative shell game is in full speed right now, it&#39;s funny how clean and readable your outline of events are.</p>

<p>All these other responses seem to eventually relay on, &quot;because they are Trump haters!&quot; as their base level foundational legal evidence that should discredit everything.</p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;m worried. I can totally handle Trump being found free of collusion and corruption, despite everything that seems to point in that direction, but is anyone here pushing the WH narrative prepared to handle the guilty truth if it comes to that? I honestly don&#39;t think there is a chance in hell, other than a handful of users that I&#39;ve seen show a willingness to allow skepticism within their own views. And the same goes for the left, if everything comes to light and it turns out that the Russians were just really good at an international propaganda campaign that deliberately only appears to be involved in the Trump campaign without ever crossing any legal boundaries? I just don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>The British Empire controls Hillary Clinton, so they worked with her and Steele to create the dossier to try to undermine or remove Trump from office. This is because Trump was opposed to the Anglo-American project known as ISIS to build an oil pipeline, and because Trump did not want to antagonize Russia which these oligarchs see as their most direct threat.</p>

<p>Fusion GPS paid Steele to do research on Trump and his connections in Russia. Steele is a British citizen and former MI5 agent.</p>

<p>Do you now understand the difference between what the DNC/Fusion did and what the Trump team did? Accepting aid or attempting to accept aid from a hostile foreign nation isn&#39;t legal. It also isn&#39;t very good if said aid is hacked emails. Paying for the services of a foreign citizen isn&#39;t illegal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol how&#39;s that NOT collusion - that&#39;s direct paid help from the Russian government, doesn&#39;t matter who the intermediary is. Who&#39;s to say those Russian govt sources weren&#39;t instructed by Putin? </p>

<p>It&#39;d be like if Don Jr. met that Russian lawyer, and if she was employed by the Russian government, and then paid for intel.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what crime specifically for just &quot;collusion&quot; but this would obviously act as evidence for umbrella charges of criminal conspiracy and treason.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a politico article explaining how just &quot;collusion&quot; could possibly be criminal: <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/12/what-is-collusion-215366">https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/12/what-is-collusion-215366</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, if Donald Trump Jr. sought “dirt” on Hillary Clinton from the Russians, he might be charged with conspiring to violate the election laws of the United States, which prohibit foreign nationals from contributing any “thing of value” to an electoral campaign. The opposition dirt is at least plausibly a thing of value. And to the extent that the Trump campaign aided, abetted or advised the Russians (or any other hackers) about what would be most useful to steal from the Democrats or how best to enhance the impact of their release, they may well have violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.</p>

<p>this is what i&#39;m thinking, depends what&#39;s in the actual dossier, too bad some Hacker named Anon cant get it out for the world to see. Really depends on that.</p>

<p>If you think about it though, that Dossier can say whatever it wants. It could have one credible thing, like Carter Page having Russian connections/businesses/etc, and the rest can be whatever you want it to be. But since they won&#39;t reveal what&#39;s in it, it basically exists as a sort of pandora&#39;s box, with Steele then leaking bits and pieces to the media. The media doesnt have it verified besides &quot;Anon source said&quot; and then when the hits the airwaves, it makes it look and sound like its giving credence to the dossier.</p>

<p>It could really be all bullshit besides Carter Page</p>

<p>What we do know is that in the middle of a contentious campaign for the presidency, Democrats paid Fusion GPS to dig up dirt on Trump.

<p>No, they re-opened the investigation because they were forced to by threats from people outside the FBI leadership (agents or possibly another agency like NSA) that they would be released otherwise. And there is now proof that they covered for that pervert Anthony Weiner.</p>

<p>And why do you trust that guy? Because you want it to be true? He has no real credibility and a cult following of #theresistsnce edgelords who will believe anything related to Trump and Russia.</p>

<p>The real conspiracy theory here is that that the NYPD were the only ones to see the emails on the Weiner Laptop which contained some nasty things. The FBI was blackmailed with this information to either investigate Clinton Again or release the truth which no one wanted.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t deflect shit, that was my first comment to you here. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t lump an agency as big as the FBI into one category. It&#39;s so huge you&#39;re going to have people supporting many different points of view. Also, they aren&#39;t a political organization for the most part. They&#39;re just fucking cops at the end of the day. This politicizing of the FBI lately is a joke.  </p>

<p>&quot;Plain old opposition research&quot; is not used in FISA court proceedings. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s be clear here. The FBI did not use FISA 702 here. They alleged that Carter Page was acting as a foreign entity based on the fucking Steele dossier, which then justified surveillance of the entire Trump transition team. That&#39;s how they perjury-trapped Flynn. </p>

<p>The ENTIRE Russian narrative is a farce created by Fusion GPS, foreign intelligence personnel (Downer, Steele, Millian) and the DOJ. </p>

HRC and DNC took over funding after Trump won the GOP nomination. I&#39;m not commenting on whether it&#39;s above board or not, but I do believe those are necessary details.

    <div class="md"><p>You bet! One more thing to consider - the memo is centered around the surveillance of Carter Page. Carter Page was a shady banker in Moscow for decades and was first interviewed by the FBI in 2013, well before the dossier was created. It seems an interesting strategy to release this as a defense of Page or Trump because Page&#39;s history is public and it shows Trump made some pretty interesting hires to his campaign. It leaves me asking why someone like Page, who has been described as &quot;pro-kremlin&quot; by the president of Euroasia (a company Page briefly worked for) would be hired by Trump in the first place.</p>

<p>I know some Brits because I am a welder and we have quite a few who come here on work visas. About 12 male Brits that I personally know, are all for Brexit and have been discussing rise in Nationalism in U.K, and across Europe, and 3 of their wives I met also all of them pro-Brexit.</p>

<p>The Dems choosing to blame Russia instead of acting to reform or even abolish the Electoral College is kind of telling that they don&#39;t actually want fair elections.  </p>

<p>Also, demonizing Russia manufactures consent for war budget increases when America should actually be pushing to improve relations with Russia for the good of the world.</p>
