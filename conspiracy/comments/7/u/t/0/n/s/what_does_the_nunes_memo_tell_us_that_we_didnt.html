       I've gone through the thing a few times and tried to note information that appears new to the public. It's somewhat pointless to mention what the memo neglects to include (the fact that Carter Page was previously considered a target of Russian intel back in '15, for example) so I'll just stick to what's actually in here.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Assertion that Steele's dossier spurred the FISA warrants issued against him.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Assertion that FISA applications did not mention the fact that DNC/Clinton campaign hired Steele via Fusion (is this required to be included in such a matter?).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Assertion that the FBI stopped working with Steele because he himself was the second-hand source of two press articles (YahooNews piece of Page's trip to Moscow, Oct 30 Mother Jones article on the dossier's existence). Steele appears to have been trying to get the dossier info out in the press, and it appears Nunes' crew in House Intel did not want any of this information out prior to the election. Which would conceivably include the fact that an FBI investigation of the Trump campaign was ongoing at the time.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Steele continued to work with DOJ official Bruce Orr, who's wife actually worked with Fusion back then. The lone quote in the memo is from Orr, who claims Steele passionately insisted Trump should not become president. Of course, it doesn't mention
         <em>
          why
         </em>
         Steele held this position, which leads the reader to believe it was simply political bias, when it could be based on the fact that Steele was finding out troublesome things through sources and truly believed the Trump campaign was compromised in some way.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I think that's it. Lemme know if I missed anything. We can keep hemming and hawing about things we already knew and have debated for months, but this new (although evidence-free) information and assertions are the meat of this memo, and things to consider moving forward.

       No, not really.  It was all a scam to get Trump under surveillance.

       Also, a FISA court is the United States
       <strong>
        Foreign

       Intelligence Surveillance Court.  Carter Page is an American citizen, as are the others that were put under surveillance.

       Page is an American citizen, so they have to demonstrate probable cause every 90 days to renew the surveillance.  They clearly lied to the FISA court, which is a huge, huge problem.  Omitting material facts is the same as lying in the legal world.

       Oh, yes.  I agree with you on that.  Everything needs to be released.  When the government is involved in criminal behavior, then they should lose the ability to classify documents to cover up said criminal behavior.

       The warrant was for Carter Page, but then the expanded it to conduct surveillance on many others.  They illegally broadened the approved surveillance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the shared the information acquired from the illegal surveillance with the Democratic party.

       Carter Page admitted to being Male-1 in a Russian Spy ring that was broken up in 2015

       IIRC the FBI placed microphones in notebooks containing financial documents that the Russians were not supposed to have.  These Russians then had a conversation with the microphone on the table between them and among many items discussed mentioned Carter Page and discussed the possibility of "recruiting him".    Im not so sure recruiting him means spy shit. they may have wanted him to do a job that wouldn't be illegal  if Carter was employed to do the same job by an American corporation.

       What I really want to know is how, if Carter Page has been surveilled for 12 months and a subject of investigation for 15, has he not been indicted if Trump Russia Collusion is valid?
      </p>
      <p>
       He’s literally the smoking gun and he’s free and not indicted. There’s clearly much more that needs to be revealed, but Carter Page not being indicted to date, makes Trump Russia Collusion seem like it maybe doesn’t have such solid footing.

       He wasn’t even charged with any wrongdoing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the man who supposedly has been in bed with the Russians and orchestrated Trump’s victory by way of collusion....had previously helped the FBI catch 3 Russian spies? Why would Russia continue to use, assuming they had successfully recruited Page in 2013, a guy who screwed them and got 3 spies arrested? They can’t simultaneously be masters of espionage and stupid enough to rely on a guy (that screwed them the first chance he got) a second time.
      </p>
      <p>
       And regardless of what happened in 2013, he’s been surveilled for 12 months and investigated for 15 in the current probe and they’ve turned up nothing on him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I’ll concede perhaps there’s a sealed indictment, but he was on tv with Chris Matthews as recently as October 2017. If he was indicted he’d be barred from publishing anything to the media or appearing on tv to field questions. That was a whole thing with Manafort just a few months ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is there’s nothing on Page from the current probe and he’s now confirmed to be the smoking gun. They had 12 months of continuous surveillance and he’s not implicated. That’s not a good look for Trump Russia Collusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now perhaps they picked up leads on others, we know from the memo that’s how Popadopalous was implicated, but he’s only implicated on a process crime so far.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just the Collusion angle doesn’t look good, that’s all man.

       Ok, I wasn’t trying to be combative, just kinda logically going through my thought process given peripheral information on the people involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not taking the memo at face value, I’m just glad they didn’t redact names of people or entities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reporters and officials now know exactly where to go to start demanding, firm, on the record answers, ideally supported by actual documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the memo is legit, that should be able to be corroborated.

       If it’s bullshit, that too should be easy enough to demonstrate.

       Well, it confirms what we all suspected.  It makes it official instead of it being wild speculation.

       Sure.  It is the NWO globalists, who happen to be Democrat or Republican.  Just because a member of Congress is a Republican, it does not mean they support Trump.  McCain, for example, is both a Republican and NWO globalist, and he was against Trump.  I hear he has been turned now, for various reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is more of a Nationalist, who pretends to be a Republican.  It was the only way he had a chance of winning the election.

       But they didn't fund the Steele dossier or have anything to do with the one we have been talking about.  There were two separate ones and in fact, I think their has was talk about Fusion GPS leaking the republican dossier.

       That's not at all what your link says. Do you have anything to substantiate your claims? I've never heard this version. (I swear my tone is not as argumentative as I fear it sounds - I'm genuinely open to learning more about this possibility and would be thankful to you if you could give me somewhere to learn more.)

        “All of the work that Fusion GPS provided to The Free Beacon was based on public sources, and none of the work product that The Free Beacon received appears in the Steele dossier,” they said. “The Free Beacon had no knowledge of or connection to the Steele dossier, did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steele.”

        The Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee retained Fusion GPS to research any possible connections between Mr. Trump, his businesses, his campaign team and Russia, court filings revealed this week. Working for them, the firm retained Christopher Steele, a respected former British intelligence officer.

       None of the work that was performed for the free beacon was in the Steel Dossier, The Steel Dossier wasn't started till after the DNC &amp; HRC started paying Fusion GPS.  They are two separate things, but hey, don't take my word for it and keep acting like the Free Beacon paid for the Dossier that was handed to the FBI.

       Release the Schiff memo and lets see what their argument is. Then release the FISA memo so we can decide for ourselves.

       Nothing. This memo is just a collection of right wing talking points we've heard for the past year:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         It highlights the fact Steele Dossier was funded by the DNC and Clinton campaign, while conveniently leaving out it was initially funded by the conservative website The Washington Free Beacon
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It claims the Steele Dossier was crucial in obtaining the original FISA warrant on Page, plus additional renewals. Only one problem: Carter Page's first FISA warrant was issued in 2014. Unless the dossier, which was created in summer 2016, can travel back in time, that's BS.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It claims Christopher Steele was fired from the FBI for an unauthorized disclosure to the media his relationship with the agency. However, in his testimony to the Senate committee, it's shown that he cut ties with the FBI because he was frustrated with the slow progress of the investigation.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They claim Strzok was reassigned for "a clear bias against Trump and in favor of Clinton," yet we know this week Strzok supported re-opening the Clinton investigation, and
         <em>
          he helped write the letter that was sent to Congress on October 27.
         </em>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They accidentally admit it's Papadopoulos information, not the Steele Dossier, that triggered the FBI investigation in the first place.

       They don't become unimportant, but this omission does show the bias of the memo and casts doubt on further claims below. That, by the way, could have been avoided if Nunes released the underlying information like people called for.

      <p>
       Yes, but the claim is that the Steele dossier was crucial in obtaining these warrants when we know he was being surveillanced as far back as 2014. That means they had additional info to believe Page was a Russian agent. This, too, can be cleared up by releasing redacted versions of the FISA warrants.

      <p>
       This isn't the FBI's opinion, this is Nunes claiming the FBI fired him. I'd say Steele's testimony carries more weight since by law you are required to tell the truth to Congress.

       before the election. And as I said above, regardless of the Steele dossier, the FBI already had outside information to warrant Page's surveillance.

      <p>
       We can all agree that the underlying FISA appications should be released, but it is entirely ridiculous to claim that Nunes should have just done that instead. It's such a manipulation to argue that.
      </p>
      <p>
       How much resistance has there been from people worried about "national security"? Now it is obvious that nothing in this memo comprimises national security. Do you really think the FISA applications would just be released without noise? It would be so much harder to get people on board.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the public will be DEMANDING that the applications will be released. This is purposeful. This is the first strike in what will be more to come.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Senate has a similar memo, and the IG report will be released soon as well. You can continue to shout into the wind if you would like.

       You forgot the first to release the dossier was Buzzfeed, and other other news agencies had the dossier for months, but did not release it because it couldn't be corroborated.
      </p>
      <p>
       So news agencies have a higher standard for verifying information than the FISA COURT.
      </p>
      <p>
       Political opposition research, which the FBI admitted research into it was in its "infancy" at the time of the FISA applications, was used for a FISA warrant.

       No. You're leaving out the fact that the dossier was not verified whatsoever at the time it was used to secure FISA warrants, and the fact that it was political oppo research was also left out.

       Do you not find the memo itself to contain spin, considering how much context is left out? I don't think the DNC/DOJ look great in light of this, but Nunes has a long way to go to prove his claims.

       The DNC is trying to spin this to prove Republicans funded the dossier.
      </p>
      <p>
       While a conservative newspaper started the research via FusionGPS, they did not find anything or publish anything. The dossier only came out after Steele was paid $160K by the Clinton campaign and DNC.

       So the goal of the memo is to prove deep state levels of corruption. Which I mean is like C- level of evidence. I just was expecting a little more. This might be a small step to Seth Rich, but it also seems shallow. Easily malleable, and over all even a little over dramatic...

        That, by the way, could have been avoided if Nunes released the underlying information like people called for.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       We can all agree that the underlying FISA appications should be released, but it is entirely ridiculous to claim that Nunes should have just done that instead. It's such a manipulation to argue that.
      </p>
      <p>
       How much resistance has there been from people worried about "national security"? Now it is obvious that nothing in this memo comprimises national security. Do you really think the FISA applications would just be released without noise? It would be so much harder to get people on board.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the public will be DEMANDING that the applications will be released. This is purposeful. This is the first strike in what will be more to come.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Senate has a similar memo, and the IG report will be released soon as well. You can continue to shout into the wind if you would like.
