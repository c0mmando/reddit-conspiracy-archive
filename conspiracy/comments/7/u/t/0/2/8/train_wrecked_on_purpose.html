       Found this randomly posted.. anyone know if any of its true?
      </p>
      <p>
       "CONFIRMED: THE CONGRESSMEN ABOARD THE TRAIN WERE SUPPOSED TO BE IN SESSION. THEY WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HEADED TO A "RESORT" THAT DOUBLES AS A DOOMSDAY (COG) FACILITY. Adding to the credibility of the theory they were fleeing a threat is the fact that they had family members aboard the train, including children that should have been in school.
      </p>
      <p>
       OVERWHELMINGLY PROBABLE: THEY RECEIVED DEATH THREATS OVER THE MEMO, AND WERE HEADING TO A SAFE PLACE WHEN THEY WERE STOPPED BY A STAGED "ACCIDENT"
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the story, which is all now 100 percent confirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       A majority of Republican congressmen who voted to release the Fisa memo, which exposes an enormous amount of deep state corruption, were on an escorted train when they were supposed to be in session, with all roads closed ahead of the train (for security reasons) and the train receiving helicopter escort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite all the roads being closed, the train hit a garbage truck while going 70 mph. The front wheels of the front engine derailed, but the rear wheels stayed on the tracks. With all the roads closed for security reasons, the only way the garbage truck could have gotten in the way of the train would be if it was done intentionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even some Congressmen are now saying the accident had to have been staged, and that it was an attempt to kill a large number of congressmen who voted to release the memo. Large numbers of deaths would have occurred if the train did derail, (as planned) but with the will of God it mostly stayed on the tracks and none of the cars or engines tipped over. If that had happened at 70 MPH the results would have been devastating.
      </p>
      <p>
       HEADS UP: Rogue factions in the United States government are attempting a violent coup with "plausible deniability. Fortunately only minor injuries happened, but having this end up being minor defies all probability, it was supposed to be a disaster and it was definitely, without question, not an accident."

       I bet if these congressmen who were on the train held a mass press conference to tell the world that the train was derailed as an attack by the Deep State (or whomever), the MSM would probaby cover that press conference.

       Surely at least some of them are brave enough to shine a light on this if it’s true.
