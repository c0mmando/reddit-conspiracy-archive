       I freaking love traditional check out. I have the world's worst line karma- guaranteed, the person in front of me will have three items with no price tag and an out-of-state check. Because of this, I end up feeling the need to apologize to the folks behind me and that leads to the most interesting conversations! Two of my good friends are people I met in the checkout stand actually.

       I don't think alot of people realize the implications of this new AI we're seeing and how many well paying jobs can be wiped out, not just truck drivers and cashiers.  For instant

       I legitimately believe we're going to see a massive economic collapse within the next ten years because of AI. No one is paying attention to it, but it's going to replace jobs for an incredible amount of people - drivers, cashiers, assistants, paralegals, etc. Replacing drivers alone would be enough to really shake the economy.

       It'll create a handful of jobs, but nowhere near enough to offset the number lost. I don't think we should slow down technological progress at all. I do think we have some problems we'll need to solve along the way. We're going to reach a point in the very near future where we have more workers than jobs.

       It will continue to accelerate and snowball. I work in the tech sector and I help create and maintain automation in my industry. When I started this biz 20 years ago, there were approx 750 employees. We've automated and streamlined over the years. We're doing more stuff, and now we've whittled the workforce down to 37 people.

       Between the automation and the student/auto/housing loans, let alone all of the QE &amp; derivatives market, we're in for a world of hurt coming our way.  I personally think TPTB are propping it all up for the next 10 years as they being in AI &amp; automation, and once they are comfortable that's when the depopulation program will come in.  In the mean time, they're going to keep letting us singularity is 30 years away, but I tend to think it's either here already or just around the corner.

       That’s not true.  Stagecoach whips (drivers) were a real thing. Stagecoach was the most affordable means of traveling long distances before the automobile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, as train travel decreased after we acclimated to automobiles, there were many engineers who found themselves unemployed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be different but it’s still the same concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference between now and then is humans are not keeping up against technology.  It is advancing too rapidly.  We’ll acclimate again but it will be slower and will mostly benefit the 1%.  That’s why I believe we need to seriously start looking into Universal Basic Income. The machines are going to replace a vast majority of our jobs (even professional) so we have to have a plan until we figure out what humanities new roles will be in the work sector.

       I think it's a great idea to be conscious of how you vote with your money. I do not use automatic checkout unless it is the only thing available (grocery late at night), and in each of those circumstances, if I have time I will provide feedback at customer service.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's amazing how many times I'll be waiting and someone will walk by and point to the automated check-out. Moments like this are excellent for elevating consciousness by explaining your position; people tend to be first taken a bit aback and then quite receptive ('Wow, I never thought about it that way,' kinda thing).

       Once Wal-Mart goes chashierless I'm going to take my business elsewhere. 1-4 items fine but not when I have a full basket. We only have a Walmart and food Lion in our small town. Food Lion is on the other side so I end up going to Walmart more to save a few minutes.

       The havoc self checkout causes at the CVS near my work is astounding.  People with a cart full are bogged down behind someone with two carts full and a complete inability to scan their stuff.  The other fun point is there are four stations, but two are typically down.  CVS has at least three people, one roving to help people who can't cope, one who is over 21, and another free ranging.  As this store is on Michigan Avenue in Chicago I am sure there is at least one person watching for shoplifting as well.  All of this was much easier handled by having the four people on registers.  I can't imagine what Wal Mart will be like with people ringing up 4 foot tall bags of generic cheese puffs, 40 cans of ravioli, Dr Scholl's foot odor spray, and pruning shears.  Good luck.

       My sister asked me about the people I was going to put out of work, when I was studying computers/software. My answer was that I was going to ensure that I had a job, writing software, rather than focusing on some job that software might eliminate.

       Technology and automation will eliminate jobs. It's best if you get a job in those areas instead of the areas that will be eliminated.

       I'm not against it. Everything will get worse because we are in the last cycle of the catur yuga, Kali yuga(four seasons of the universe...we are in the "winter" phase). Everything is naturally getting fucked up so the cycle can restart. I'm just saying, you can't avoid suffering and enjoyment. It comes on its own accord.

       Lol using the word unproven just further shows how little you understand about mysticism. It's not an empirical subject matter. Consciousness is beyond the senses and mind...therefore to use an empirical process is literally backwards.

       Just because we can't scientifically measure/define consciousness right now, doesn't mean you can talk out of your ass and package it like facts. Especially when the conversation was totally irrelevant. If you do this in real life, people hate that shit. Just letting you know

       My only counter to this is that previous disruptive tech tended to cause new jobs to be created that humans were needed for. Automation is the final step as it is something that replaces us. I personally just see it as a step in human evolution to get us to a pursuit driven society instead of a money driven one

       Who is going to service those machines? Who is going to write the code for them? Who is going to produce the silicon and memory for them? Who is going to produce the screens? There are still jobs being created even when others are automated. Just like everyone at Blockbuster lost their jobs but everyone working on Netflix and Amazon prime got a job they wouldn't have had if Blockbuster still had 80% marketshare. I think automating all the low skill, minimum wage jobs is a great incentive for people to actually learn useful skills rather than being content running a cash register their entire adult life.

       I think you're missing the point. Let's stick with your netflix/blockbuster analogy. You seem to get that netflix was able to do away with the brick and mortar store and the person that you interacted with in favor of a website that you interact with. At its height, blockbuster employed 84,000 people. Netflix employees about 4,500 people. So, right there, you have 80,000 people out of a job. But this is the typical displacement I was talking about. Typically, technology that just makes jobs easier to do, makes things more efficient, etc, will reduce jobs in one area but the displacement tends to make a rise in other areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what I think you're missing is the next step. The next step is automation. Automation replaces the human need. Those 4,500 people at nexflix will soon be able to be reduced to next to nothing because of ai and automation that can do what they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your last sentence kind of confuses me because I agree? Low wage/low skill jobs will be the first to be replaced, but automation is coming for every job. The amount of humans that will be needed will be so insignificantly small as to be zero - I'm not saying there won't need to be like one or two system admins or something, what I'm saying is that since 99% of the population will be replaceable, we will have to start shifting our ideas about what we have to do individually as a society.
      </p>
      <p>
       My hope beyond hope is that we get to some point where to pursue knowledge or interest for most of your time while the robots do all the hard labor. I think we might have to have some hardcore civil unrest while the unemployment numbers skyrocket first, but bring it on. Skipping the self checkout lane is only delaying the inevitable and making my checkout take longer.

       Why slow down what has already begun? So you're helping the last few people clinging to their wage slavery income to hold on to their shit cashier job for a little longer? I actually try to go the opposite. The sooner we automate everything and get to that critical point of everyone being out of a job and about to be at each others throats is imho a crucial step to fixing the problem and freeing ourselves from correlating time and effort to money. Universal basic income and/or the removal of wage slavery is dependent, in my mind, on automation. Technology is supposed to free us from labor. Automation is the end goal - the people it displaces won't have new fields to go into as previous technology advances had done but it has the potential to snuff out wage slavery entirely

       That’s not true.  Stagecoach whips (drivers) were a real thing. Stagecoach was the most affordable means of traveling long distances before the automobile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, as train travel decreased after we acclimated to automobiles, there were many engineers who found themselves unemployed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be different but it’s still the same concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference between now and then is humans are not keeping up against technology.  It is advancing too rapidly.  We’ll acclimate again but it will be slower and will mostly benefit the 1%.  That’s why I believe we need to seriously start looking into Universal Basic Income. The machines are going to replace a vast majority of our jobs (even professional) so we have to have a plan until we figure out what humanities new roles will be in the work sector.
