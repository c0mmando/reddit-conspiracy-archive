        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Our moon is the weirdest object in our solar system.  First off, it is in a near perfect circular orbit around the earth, something that is very, very rare in the whole universe.  Whereas the other planets have tiny moons orbiting them (relative to the size of the planet), our is MASSIVE in relative size.  It is more than a quarter the size of earth. <a href="http://www.jgiesen.de/moons/index.htm">http://www.jgiesen.de/moons/index.htm</a>  This is <strong>gigantic</strong> in so far as moons go.  Our moon is the perfect size and the perfect distance from the earth to cause a perfect eclipse.</p>

<p>The moon never rotates from our perspective.  In other words, we always see the same face of the moon even though it is orbiting the earth and in turn, the moon and the earth are both orbiting the sun.  It’s almost as if someone planned it that way.  Hmmm….</p>

<p>There are many scientific evidence that suggests the moon maybe hollow.  This is not wild speculation or a conspiracy theory.  The moon is lighter than it should be. The moon&#39;s mean density is 3.34 gm/cm3 (3.34 times an equal volume of water) whereas the Earth&#39;s is 5.5.  Experiments have shown that the moon reverberates like a hollow sphere when struck. <a href="https://www.sciencechannel.com/tv-shows/nasas-unexplained-files/videos/why-does-the-moon-sound-hollow">https://www.sciencechannel.com/tv-shows/nasas-unexplained-files/videos/why-does-the-moon-sound-hollow</a>   Hell, even PhD’s are claiming that it could be made of metal and could be hollow. <a href="http://www.woowoomedia.com/phd-says-the-moon-is-older-than-earth-and-is-made-of-metal/">http://www.woowoomedia.com/phd-says-the-moon-is-older-than-earth-and-is-made-of-metal/</a></p>

<p>Now if all this weirdness hasn’t convinced you that the moon is not what you think it is, I don’t know what will.  So, then what is it?  Could it be an observation deck?  Could it have been placed there on purpose to secretly observe how life developed and evolved on earth?  Could our planet be just a one big biological experiment?  Could the aliens have planted the seeds of life on earth and setup an observatory deck to see how it develops?</p>

<p>Let’s just ditch the idea that the moon landing was a hoax.  I know some people are passionate about this, but for the sake of this article, let’s just ignore that theory.  So if we went to the moon multiple times from 1969 to 1972, why are scientists now saying “we don’t have the technology to go to the moon.  We had it in the 60’s but we don’t anymore.”  Huh?  Say what?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16MMZJlp_0Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16MMZJlp_0Y</a></p>

<p>Just WTF?  How could we have the technology in the 60’s but we don’t have it anymore?  </p>

<p>Why is there suddenly a layer of deadly radiation called the Van Allen Belts that would kill any astronauts leaving the earth’s orbit today, but didn’t kill them in the 60’s? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDBBUwdyz4I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDBBUwdyz4I</a> </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt</a></p>

<p>The answer lies in the fact that there are countless evidence that the entire moon landings from start to finish were carefully observed by alien entities.   We have photos of objects floating above the astronauts as they walked on the moon. <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/610270/Final-proof-THREE-separate-UFOs-seen-watching-moon-landings-in-new-Nasa-photos">https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/610270/Final-proof-THREE-separate-UFOs-seen-watching-moon-landings-in-new-Nasa-photos</a>  Heck, even good ol’ Buzz Aldrin admitted seeing something while on the moon. <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/space/buzz-aldrin-describes-his-encounter-ufo/">http://www.iflscience.com/space/buzz-aldrin-describes-his-encounter-ufo/</a>  We even have videos of astronauts trying to contain their shock as they notice strange objects above them while they were on the moon.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27viO7GCVfw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27viO7GCVfw</a>  </p>

<p>So what does all this mean?  Yup.  Gonna say it. <strong>The moon landings were accomplished with the assistance of aliens</strong>  Call me crazy because even I think it is.  But this is the only explanation my tiny mind can come up with to answer all of the mysteries listed above. </p>

<p>Why would they do this?  Well, I’d imagine that too many questions were being asked about the moon.  If people started noticing that the moon is a big ole spaceship, the aliens would have a problem with the ongoing secret observation of our development on earth.  So they assisted NASA in getting to the moon so they can walk around the surface like children and report back to the ignorant earthlings “Yup, the moon is just a rock”.  LOL.  </p>

<p>But things are a changing.  Our technology is advancing rapidly.  They’re not gonna be able to keep it a secret much longer.  We will reveal the truth about the moon very very soon. (I hope)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it does what a good conspiracy theory should - it apprehends an inconsistency in a public narrative, and offers an explanation that is found at least mildly credible by a non-negligible subset of those who view or consider it. </p>

<p>It may not offer much tangible proof, but that&#39;s not really at all a necessary condition for qualifying as a decent theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What inconsistency?</p>

<p>Everything OP mentioned is irrelevant to his &quot;argument&quot; or just plain not true.</p>

<p>For example, the moon does <em>not</em> have a perfectly circular orbit, it does <em>not</em> have perfect eclipse (close but not quite), tidally locked planets are common and aren&#39;t an argument in the slightest, and the Van Allen belts have been debunked a long time ago.</p>

<p>What explanation? It&#39;s unrelated garbage that&#39;s redundant at best and straight up wrong at worst, only fooling people that don&#39;t actually know anything about the moon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s all fair too.  Idk what van Allen belts are, but it does certainly seem fishy that we &quot;went to the moon&quot; fifty years ago and then no one else has since.</p>

<p>The parts I find credible in the original post are the &quot;government(s) cooperating with ETs to disguise something fishy about the true nature of the moon&quot;.</p>

<p>I know tidal locking is a pretty common astronomical phenomenon.  And some of the other stuff in the post probably has innocent explanations too.  But still...</p>

<p>There has to be some reason why no one ever re-visited the moon, if we even did in the first place.  Alien observatory on or in the moon makes plenty of sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Setting up a base of operations, other than the ISS, for interplanetary exploration seems like a good reason to me. A solid structure, planted on an orbiting body, outside the immediate gravitational pull of the planet would allow us to launch more missions for far cheaper.
The idea that we can&#39;t get back there with the tech of today when we supposedly did it in the 60&#39;s with what amounts to the processing power of a modern calculator is insane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We could utilize the solid terrain to build massive storage bunkers for all sorts of things. Depending on the natural resources available up there we could refine &amp; utilize the lunar soil as well. Another major advantage would be having the body of the moon itself acting as a short of shield against random, stray projectiles.  </p>

<p>Then again, if the moon truly is a massive base for viewing the evolution of our species, maybe the materials to build the facility came from Earth? Perhaps that space they created while gathering materials is the area from the Hollow Earth conspiracies I&#39;m seeing pop up on this sub from time to time? It would be an easy way to load &amp; unload cargo UFO&#39;s sight unseen if they were able to do so from underground. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This kind of stuff is why I keep coming to this subreddit. You presented the post in a coherent manner and supported many of your premises with links. Thank you for posting this.</p>

<p>The problem that I have with the moon being an observation post is the size. It&#39;s way bigger than necessary (our satellites do the job pretty well and are much smaller) and it&#39;s so big that it would screw up observation (us seeing it and its affect on the tides influence development). Perhaps something else is going on that would be supported by the issues you&#39;ve raised?</p>

<p>With a giant moon, sure it&#39;s easy to notice even by the first eukaryotes who were moved by tides, *but even when evolution and development reached the stage where we could visit it, it&#39;s too big to &quot;cover.</p>

<p>This statement is why you&#39;re saying it&#39;s been debunked?  &quot;These so called Van Allen belts, where the Earth&#39;s magnetic field collects solar radiation, would be dangerous only if people were to hang out there for several days. The astronauts whizzed through in a matter of hours, and received a radiation dose similar to an X-ray. &quot;You can pass through quite safely as long as you don&#39;t linger too long,&quot; Millard says.&quot;</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t the Discovery Shuttles go past the belts?  Hell, let alone a monkey.  I don&#39;t think the belts are debunked personally.  </p>

<p>Good thing science doesn&#39;t care about your opinion, they have been debunked, period. Opinion doesn&#39;t come into it.</p>

<p>The Van Allen belts affect astronauts the same way any other radiation would but it doesn&#39;t kill them and it definitely isn&#39;t impassable as many ill+informed conspiracy theorists claim without proof.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Apollo missions marked the first event where humans traveled through the Van Allen belts, which was one of several radiation hazards known by mission planners.[31] The astronauts had low exposure in the Van Allen belts due to the short period of time spent flying through them. Apollo flight trajectories bypassed the inner belts completely, and only passed through the thinner areas of the outer belts.[25][32]</p>

<p>Astronauts&#39; overall exposure was actually dominated by solar particles once outside Earth&#39;s magnetic field. The total radiation received by the astronauts varied from mission to mission but was measured to be between 0.16 and 1.14 rads(1.6 and 11.4 mGy), much less than the standard of 5 rem (50 mSv) per year set by the United States Atomic Energy Commission for people who work with radioactivity.[31]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe when the aliens set up this experiment that they have been watching through the moon, they were (relatively) less technologically advanced and the moon is incredibly outdated technology, hence its size. I mean, they would have had to set this up millions of years ago and presumably the moon would have to be an entire, complete ecosystem for lots and lots of beings. Maybe they realized it wasn&#39;t perfect (the tides and it being conspicuous), but it was the best they could do millions of years ago and decided the experiment/surveillance was worth it.</p>

Stopped our future missions, and also sent ufos to disable our nuke sites as a deterrent to future aggresion towards them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Apollo missions marked the first event where humans traveled through the Van Allen belts, which was one of several radiation hazards known by mission planners.[31] The astronauts had low exposure in the Van Allen belts due to the short period of time spent flying through them. Apollo flight trajectories bypassed the inner belts completely, and only passed through the thinner areas of the outer belts.[25][32]</p>

<p>Astronauts&#39; overall exposure was actually dominated by solar particles once outside Earth&#39;s magnetic field. The total radiation received by the astronauts varied from mission to mission but was measured to be between 0.16 and 1.14 rads(1.6 and 11.4 mGy), much less than the standard of 5 rem (50 mSv) per year set by the United States Atomic Energy Commission for people who work with radioactivity</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Van Allen belts are only an issue if you plan on staying in this zone for a long time. If you just pass through them in a reasonably shielded spacecraft, your risk of developing cancer won&#39;t be increased significantly. It&#39;s also possible to avoid the Van Allen belts with the right trajectory. The Apollo missions didn&#39;t fly through the inner belt and avoided the more radioactive zones of the outer belt. I&#39;m really surprised that the Van Allen belts are still brought up by people who don&#39;t believe that going to the Moon is trivial.</p>

<p>The only reason why we can&#39;t go to the Moon currently is because we haven&#39;t built the necessary rocket and spacecrafts. That&#39;s also the reason why the Russians are flying American astronauts to the International Space Station.</p>

<p>The Orion spacecraft will be able to fly humans around the Moon and the construction of the first manned version just started. Put it atop a big enough rocket that&#39;s safe enough to launch humans and you can send anyone to the Moon. Political will and money are the only factors holding us back.</p>

You need more people in the &quot;yes&quot; category, and you need them to be so far &quot;yes&quot; that they think it should take a priority chunk of spending.  NASA has been gutted in recent decades.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA">Have a look here</a> or I can sum it up for you.  Their highest budget increases were during the moon craze.  The late 60s were high times for NASA, up to near 5% of total federal budget.  Then we hit the moon and it started dwindling down to under 1%.  They got a boost bump at the end of Reagan&#39;s presidency that put them back up over 1%, but they started chewing them down again after that, with current spending being only 0.47%, lowest it ever was, and next year&#39;s proposal is less than even that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and there is public perception that NASA&#39;s budget is much much higher than it actually is.  Most people would tell you that NASA has 10% or 20% of the federal budget, not 0.5%.</p>

<p>We&#39;d be in fat city if it ever got back to 1%.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is that the military space budget (what we know of it) may equal NASA&#39;s budget.  Presumably they use it for earth intel observation, orbital weapons platforms, black ops, and space superiority (destroying other nations&#39; space weapons platforms, or learning about their spy satellites).  But the truth is, we don&#39;t know a lot about the military&#39;s space program beyond the non-classified parts of their budget accounting.</p>

<p>The other side of the coin is that NASA is doing more with less. Instead of spending something on the order of $half a billion for a space shuttle launch to bring supplies to the ISS, it can be done by a private company for less than 20% of that amount. It&#39;s less dangerous because it&#39;s an unmanned robot capsule (SpaceX Dragon).  It&#39;s reusable so the price will continue to go down.  And they are developing private capabilities to fly US astronauts.</p>

<p>The ISS is currently a waypoint.  The next few years will show developments to the Earth-Moon Lagrange point.  NASA is developing plans to put a station there.  Then it is looking strongly like they will ask a private contractor to develop plans for a lander. Then return humans to the surface of the moon. Then develop a moon base.  That will be interesting because of the presence of water at the Aitken basin on the south pole of the moon, combined with &quot;peaks of eternal light&quot; for solar production. If it never gets dark, you don&#39;t have to worry about 2 weeks of cold and dark and no solar production.  That makes a base easier.</p>

<p>Practice and investing in new technologies. It used to cost something like 50,000$ to get a kg to space decades ago. </p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t &quot;shelved&quot; because we don&#39;t go to the moon, I guarantee people are working on it. Look at the EM drive and the proposed space elevator. Going to the moon for now is irrelevant.</p>

<p>Do you expect this technology to just spontaneously arrive one day? Do you think computer advancements are driven by time and not effort toward a goal?</p>

<p>If you want to run a marathon do you practice or just assume one day down the road youll be ready? </p>

<p>There is nothing to lose going back to the moon besides money, thats my point. That was my original point, I have no problem investing money in this problem with the knowledge that down the road these investments in science will provide us with a better platform for space travel. </p>

The Moon would be a great outpost for operations. Who gets there first and prepares all the logistics and infrastructure (Nasa, Esa, Roscosmos, Cnsa, etc.) is gonna have all the benefits commercially speaking. We&#39;re talking about trillions on resources probably and they have to be already planning it if they want to  be &#39;on time&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well fairly common for our solar system, though I believe we know of exoplanets that are tidally locked but I don&#39;t know how they can ascertain that.</p>

<p>Within our solar system satellites that are tidally locked include:</p>

<p>Phobos, Deimos</p>

<p>Metis · Adrastea · Amalthea · Thebe · Io · Europa · Ganymede · Callisto</p>

<p>Pan · Atlas · Prometheus · Pandora · Epimetheus · Janus · Mimas · Enceladus · Telesto · Tethys · Calypso · Dione · Rhea · Titan · Iapetus</p>

<p>Miranda · Ariel · Umbriel · Titania · Oberon</p>

<p>Proteus · Triton</p>

<p>Then finally pluton and chiron which are tidally locked to each other.</p>

<p>Yes. That&#39;s why the nice shiny lunar module isn&#39;t big enough.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You can&#39;t see an individual building from space, but you can see where cities are, if a marker is too difficult than a lunar station on the surface would eventually be big enough and have other uses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope you are right about finding a definitive answer due to technological advances, I spend too much time thinking about what the moon is and isn&#39;t.  I would love to believe the moon is the heart of a conspiracy but it seems too involved.  I can&#39;t imagine that in the context of the universe we are at all unique, significant, or worth the time of whatever an alien is.  At best I would consider us one of so many civilizations we would merit little if any interest.  </p>

<p>When we found we had mice in our garage I spent $40 at Home Depot on traps and when I failed I hired a pest control company.  Some legitimately brilliant minds share your theory, so I absolutely have to consider it, but I believe if is some sort of observation post it is long abandoned.  Maybe some civilization hired a contract worker to set up this &quot;mousetrap&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of the documentaries I&#39;ve seen about NASA and space travel make a really big deal about how we went to the moon with technology no more powerful than a calculator. So, surely with the technology we have now, we should be in the stars by now? So why aren&#39;t we? The argument they give of the technology not existing anymore is ludicrous. </p>

<p>My personal belief is that we did go to the moon, but what we saw on TV was faked. There are beings on the moon who didn&#39;t want us there and most likely told us not to go back. There&#39;s no way NASA would let that knowledge go public, so the footage was faked. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t get why we&#39;re not on Mars by now at least and although I respect NASA for getting us up there, they are lying through their teeth about what&#39;s up there and what they know.</p>

<p>I personally think that there IS a point to building rockets, space craft etc. We&#39;re sending telescopes and satellites up there all the time and landing craft on mars and the moon so it&#39;s obvious that humanity is still keen to see what&#39;s up there and to reach the stars, so why aren&#39;t we doing that? </p>

<p>Because whatever is up there really doesn&#39;t want us to. </p>

<p>Just my opinion, really. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The closest star is 4.25 light-years away while the Moon is merely 1.2 light-seconds away. Have you seen the size of the rockets that took us to the Moon? We simply can&#39;t go to the nearest star with the same kind of technology that took us to the Moon, the rocket would have to be unfeasibly massive and it would take millennia.</p>

<p>We still have to resupply the International Space Station on a regular basis because we aren&#39;t able to grow all of our food in space and recycle all of our air and water.</p>

<p>Moreover, the human body starts falling apart when it&#39;s in space for extended periods of time. A multigenerational spacecraft would present so many challenges on that front.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll have to learn how to fly at a significant fraction of the speed of light if we ever want to visit a star other than the Sun in a reasonable amount of time. To achieve this, we need to have an engine that can stay lit for years and then we&#39;ll have to point it in the other direction to decelerate.</p>

<p>We didn&#39;t lose the technology to go to the Moon. We use that technology every time we launch a satellite. We use it aboard the International Space Station. Going to the Moon is trivial. Pack enough supplies, put them atop a large enough rocket and you&#39;re good to go. Any computer can calculate the trajectories. Money and political will are the only factors that hold us back. Developing, building and testing a huge rocket that can carry humans safely is insanely expensive.</p>

<p>NASA isn&#39;t lying about anything. That&#39;s silly. It&#39;s the most open agency in the US.</p>

<p>So if we went to the moon multiple times from 1969 to 1972,

Huh? Say what?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The technology to go to the moon isn&#39;t a simple thing, like a corkscrew or a coffee maker, that you can invent once and then use forever.</p>

<p>We could build an Apollo capsule today with not too much problem. That&#39;s the easy part.</p>

<p>The Apollo program was an ecosystem... tens of thousands of people working across multiple industries. </p>

<p>Astronauts.</p>

<p>The people who ran a training program for the astronauts.</p>

<p>The people running the launch facility. The team that knows how to work the vehicle that drives the rockets onto the launch pad. The people working at the company that build the custom vehicles to drive the rockets onto the launch pad.</p>

<p>A worldwide network of radio receivers, so that we could receive broadcasts from the astronauts 24 hours a day even when the moon was on the other side of the Earth.</p>

<p>That vast ecosystem is what has been partially lost. We could do it again.... but we&#39;d need to rebuild that ecosystem. Currently, that&#39;s the kind of undertaking that costs many billions of dollars per year and a commitment of many years. </p>

<p>Also remember: the last time NASA engineered a vehicle for manned spaceflight was in the 1970s when they designed the space shuttle. What do you think those engineers are doing today? Yeah, they&#39;re retired or dead. That&#39;s another reason why a lot of this stuff would need to be relearned by the current generation.</p>

<p>The apollo was not very safe and we haven’t been working on developing a ship to go and land on the moon so we would be starting from scratch.</p>

<p>Another issue with using the old design is that the moon lander was extremely hard to fly and the astronaut almost died while practicing on earth.</p>

<p>We would have to set up communications and go through extensive training with thousands of people.</p>

<p>It definitely wouldn’t be as hard but it would still take a long time and be very difficult.</p>

<p>Real reason we don’t go back is probably because it costs a shit ton of money and there is no real reason to go back. We went for political reasons</p>

A satellite shielded by 3 mm of aluminium in an elliptic orbit (200 by 20,000 miles (320 by 32,190 km)) passing the radiation belts will receive about 2,500 rem (25 Sv) per year (for comparison, a full-body dose of 5 Sv is deadly).

<p>Astronauts&#39; overall exposure was actually dominated by solar particles once outside Earth&#39;s magnetic field.

Apollo flight trajectories bypassed the inner belts completely, and only passed through the thinner areas of the outer belts.[25][32]</p>

<p>That&#39;s what tidally locked is. Mercury is tidally locked. Iirc many of Jupiter&#39;s moons are tidally locked. It&#39;s common.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And your point is?  Tidally locked planets and moons are possible no doubt.  But how common are orbits of an object that is 1/4 the size of the host, with a near perfect circular orbit with the center of the orbit at the origin and is tidally locked at the same time?  Like I said, if all the things I listed that&#39;s weird about the moon is not going to convince you, nothing will.  Take care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s the point? Hundreds of posts saying &quot;this is why and that is why bla bla you don&#39;t understand science bla bla&quot;  They don&#39;t get my original post&#39;s intention: that the moon may have a purpose for being there.  Imagine a boulder on a road.  You can make tons of deductions about the boulder, how it behaves, how it&#39;s shaped, what will happen if you kick it, etc.   But you will never know for sure if it rolled there or if someone placed it there.  All the critics seem to be missing this point and instead choose to attack my iq.   Lol.  I understand tho.

    <div class="md"><p>So 58 degrees mean you&#39;ve seen the back of the moon?
The fact that the moon is tidally locked makes it absolutely certain that it wasn&#39;t placed that way? How is that so? A falling ball behaves precisely as dictated by physics. But does that physics also tell you who dropped the ball? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve linked to every theory I mentioned including the hollow moon theory and the Van Allen problem.  It is your right to not believe those links but what makes you say I didn&#39;t do the research? Did I make up those theories? Are those links dead?  Nope.  </p>

<p>The only conjecture I make is that the moon could be an observation post and that we had help getting to the moon.  If you don&#39;t like it, I don&#39;t have a problem with that. Why do you have a problem with me? Did you have to pay money to read my post or something? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe we have visited the Moon a few times. Some photos are fake because it&#39;d be too troublesome to hide things from the originals(back in the 60s/70s) and some are real. You could even say all photographs are fake, but we definitely went there.</p>

<p>The reason I believe that is because if we hadn&#39;t gone there back then, we&#39;d be trying to go there today, and other nations would be going trying as well, so something definitely happened to keep humans away from the Moon (at least missions we are aware of).</p>

<p>Now, like you said, the reasons keeping us away from there are kinda vague, and IMHO could have political and spiritual explanations, but the Moon is definitely inhabited by some folks, humans or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting post! The idea of the moon being an observation deck reminded me of a series of videos I watched a few months back of an interview with an alien abductee. In <a href="https://youtu.be/OPpjQCc79HQ">this video</a> (relevant part to the point I&#39;m making is from 11:35 onwards) he talks about his pre-birth memories of being on the moon and observing earth from there and talking with an alien about his feelings on incarnating here.<br/>
The whole series of videos is fascinating and definitely worth a watch! There&#39;s 3 and the other two should both be in the suggested videos of this one. I don&#39;t wanna spoil much, but he describes how after a series of abductions he began to remember aspects of existence before life and how the aliens are keeping tabs on humans and watching how souls evolve and such. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am old now and all my life I accepted the idea that asteroids created the craters on the surface of the moon.  And why wouldn&#39;t I think that.  They taught us that since he first day of school.</p>

<p>I started thinking about these craters and the explanation science gives us and there isn&#39;t very much logic behind that theory.  If the moon does not spin then the face of the moon that always faces us should not have craters from being hit by rocks.  Unless the universe is throwing curve balls using giant rocks, a straight projector would mean that these rocks would first hit Earth as Earth is much larger.  If the projector of being hit by giant rocks came in at an angle then the craters would look different than they look now.  The craters would show one side pushed up further than the other.  From my understanding the craters are pretty much uniform..</p>

<p>Also I have to think about where the asteroid belt is located.  Asteroids are located between Saturn and Jupiter and we call that universal real estate the Astral Belt.  That&#39;s a pretty good distance from Earth.  Also these rocks are very much distant from the others.  They only look like they are close to each and jumbled because of the distance we see them as.  And, just like everything else within our universe, these rocks spin in an orbit similar to all other bodies.  Why has asteroids stop hitting our Planet or the moon as often as science tells us it did when we were much younger in the scheme of the universe?  Have things calmed down?  Are most of the asteroids in a more permanent position where they don&#39;t collide as often as they use to?  </p>

<p>So what caused these craters?  I saw something in our physical world that looked like what could have happened (of course on a much more smaller scale).  I was cooking rice.  When rice gets to a point of losing much of it&#39;s water (and the water level is just below the surface of the rice) small craters appear on the surface of the rice.  Which means to me that the craters are made from the loss of water (vaporizing) and it&#39;s the internal tempatures that are rising to create a surface on the rice that shows craters.  The craters are the result of heat trying to escape but is trapped until it finds a defective place on the surface of the rice.  Perhaps this is also the way the craters were made on the moon but on a much larger scale?</p>

<p>Any way, I must be missing something that science tells us that would explain how asteroids are responsible for the moons craters.  But I am getting a bit suspicious that it&#39;s easier to explain something away using theories that sound good but have no evidence that holds up to scrutiny.   </p>

<p>Also, if an asteroid, big enough to eave mass damage to the surface of the moon, hit the moon, wouldn&#39;t it also have the potential of spinning the sphere (the moon)?</p>

<p>IDK.  Does anyone else know that something I missed to explain this theory?</p>

<p>The far side of the Moon is tremendously more damaged than the side that&#39;s facing the Earth.</p>

<p>The Earth and the Moon were getting pummeled in the infancy of the Solar System. Our atmosphere ensures that most asteroids burn up before they hit the ground and when they hit the ground, erosion makes them disappear after a while. On the Moon, each asteroid leaves a hole and each hole remains intact for millions of years. Neil Armstrong boot prints are still intact on the Moon. The ones he made on the Earth disappeared completely within days or weeks.</p>

<p>There are fewer asteroids hitting the Earth and the Moon today than during the formation of the Solar System because billions of years of gravity cleaned the Solar System. The gas giants have been sweeping most of these rocks.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>First off, it is in a near perfect circular orbit around the earth, something that is very, very rare in the whole universe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thats the first misconception and its only the second sentence. </p>

<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Moon_apsidal_precession.png">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Moon_apsidal_precession.png</a></p>

<p>The moons eccentricity is 0.05 which means it has a 5 degree difference between its major and minor axis. For the record this is more elliptical than Earth, Venus&#39;s, Titan or Venus.  </p>

<p>Triton is actually the most circular orbit. It has an eccentricity value of 0.00002</p>

<p>As for the sizes its all relative. The moon isnt massive compared to other satellites in our solar system and isnt even the most interesting. Its an interesting fact but we have a very small sample size. </p>

<p>I mean Uranus has almost 30 moons and its smaller than Earth, thats cool but doesnt mean much. Jupiter has 60+ moons also cool but again kinda meaningless. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moon never rotates from our perspective. In other words, we always see the same face of the moon even though it is orbiting the earth and in turn, the moon and the earth are both orbiting the sun. It’s almost as if someone planned it that way. Hmmm….</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tidal locking is actually pretty common. Every &quot;large&quot; moon in the solar system is tidally locked. </p>

<p>Hell Mercury is tidally locked to the sun. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are many scientific evidence that suggests the moon maybe hollow. This is not wild speculation or a conspiracy theory. The moon is lighter than it should be. The moon&#39;s mean density is 3.34 gm/cm3 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The moon isnt even the densest satellite in the solar system, that title belongs to IO. So its actually very dense if we compare it to other satellites. </p>

<p>According to the current theory the Moon was the result of an impact with Proto Earth by something the size of Mars. The impact knocked off a large amount of the mantle which is basaltic rock (primarily) and not much of the much more dense core the Earth has. </p>

<p>The density of the moon is very close to the density of the Earths mantle which is almost exactly 3.34. The moon is the Earths scalped leftovers. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Experiments have shown that the moon reverberates like a hollow sphere when struck.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which again is what we would expect to see. Also be careful taking Armstrong&#39;s words literally here, its not ringing like a bell because its hollow. Its ringing like a bell because its almost completely absent of any water in the stone. </p>

<p>When a quake happens on Earth all the liquids in the mantles and lower act as a dampener or shock absorber.  Since the moon is just dry stone the quakes will last a very long time not burning energy with liquids causing it to ring like a bell. Not because its hollow. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hell, even PhD’s are claiming that it could be made of metal and could be hollow. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Im not going to address everything brought up by Huntlet but there are a few errors with his write up. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>we don’t have the technology to go to the moon. We had it in the 60’s but we don’t anymore.” Huh? Say what?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think thats a Petit quote?</p>

<p>The entire quote in context is about the Saturn V rockets, we dismantled all of them :( </p>

<p>Unfortunately building another one isnt as simple as bringing up the schematic and making the parts, the businesses and factories that made those parts are out of business or making other things. It would take a while to rebuild and there isnt much interest to rebuild 50 year old designs. </p>

<p>Also this is an old quote with SpaceX and other private companies filling the void the NASA left we are getting back to creating and designing systems that could get us to the moon. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just WTF? How could we have the technology in the 60’s but we don’t have it anymore?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We dont have the current infrastructure to build one. It would take time, a Saturn V rocket has over 3 million specialized parts. Americans dont really care enough anymore, the space race is over. Its sad</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is there suddenly a layer of deadly radiation called the Van Allen Belts that would kill any astronauts leaving the earth’s orbit today, but didn’t kill them in the 60’s?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kinda deadly, the astronauts who go through the belt experience about as much radiation as we consider safe for people who work with nuclear material. </p>

<p>Basically go through quickly and in the right spots to limit exposure. There is no evidence that those astronauts received any noticeable amount of radiation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My friend, I&#39;m not going to get into a debate with you. If someone offered me information that I was unaware of I would investigate it, do some research and come to my own conclusion. I will say that getting your information from skeptic.com is a step in the wrong direction. If you are happy to live your life with your head stuck in the sand why do you bother reading and participating on this CONSPIRACY sub? </p>

<p>How could I know that? Do you think that I would actually reveal the source of my information that pertains to the most sensitive and highest classified information that exists? Are you high? You are out of your element and I don&#39;t have a death wish. Go watch the documentary &quot;I KNOW WHAT I SAW&quot;, listen to the testimony of the eye witnesses, one of which was the governor of Arizona. ( I&#39;ve met the director James Fox, he is the real deal, a man of talent and integrity.) There were two events that night at different times. The second event was a military flare drop meant to distract weakminded people from the actual events earlier that evening. Once you establish the size of the craft, how it looked and behaved, then it is impossible to attribute it to any known conventional aircraft. That is your starting point. Then you throw away everything you know about known technology and you start asking smart questions and you will be on your way.  </p>

<p>Remember this post, this day, my words the day you and the rest of the world come face to face with the truth. I for one  look forward to that day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you make of some of the other UFO things?  In the images there are definitely ways that light refracts from camera lenses (I have made fake “ufo/ghost/fairy videos by being outside in the dark with a candle behind me and moving my camera at the right angle to make it look like a dancing ball of light) and the triangular shape <em>certainly</em> indicates reflection/refraction from a round shape like a wide angle lens.  <strong>however</strong> there are many videos from the NASA files that show lights pretty clearly outside the windows moving with no source discernible in frame and in multiple speeds and directions...  I don’t know what they are but I have not seen a convincing debunking.  Light reflecting doesn’t behave like that with different and changing brightness and randomly different paths and speeds when the camera is moving slowly.  Curious to hear another skeptic’s take.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree mostly with you, but differ on your conclusion.</p>

<p>The moon is totally bizarre and out of place in every way you stated.</p>

<p>Let me add that various moon probes and anyone who&#39;s seen the far (back) side of the moon knows how strange it is.  There are at least several tower like structures, maybe mountains, very strange.</p>

<p>The Clementine Moon probe, LROC and Zond 3 all took famous pictures of the back side of the moon. Clemetine&#39;s are my favorite.  The public pictures show massive and poor editing, smudges, copy/paste and even let some things slide which show buildings, domes and massive towers as high as 4 miles.  Later the public Clementine photo browser was edited again to clean up the poor job and hide it.  I remember using the original photo browser online many years ago and seeing buildings, massive ones, in the photos.  Some of these shots are still available online in private archives.  the ZOND 3 picture for sure is out there still and some crazy LROC pics.</p>

<p>Neil Armstrong was a very quiet and reserved man. He said that aliens warned us to stay off the moon, and they were under constant observation while they were there.  He also said they ships they had were very large and menacing.  The Apollo astronauts heard strange music in space around the moon.  They said so many cryptic things implying alien evidence.  Private radio operators that listened live to the Apollo transmissions that were censored for the public heard them speak of aliens and ufos on the moon watching them.  Some of the transmissions speak of tunnels, which only very recently are we hearing about officially from NASA.  There is so much more in these transmissions and deserve some research.</p>

<p>In contrast to your conclusion I believe the Apollo missions played out mostly as the official story described.  I think the presence on the moon and in space was present and observed but did not interact.  There is a massive amount of evidence of moon buildings, and ufo presence on the moon surrounding the Apollo missions and later probes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It never actually said he saw a structure and there is no one with any proof they saw any alien or life form. If we went at all, and that transmission is legit from the moon...it&#39;s more likely that his surprise was more about the shape of the earth or something about space in general he did not expect...as they say &quot;we know&quot;. </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t they erase something like 40 rolls of film that were not viewable to the public or something, I cant remember ...but it&#39;s likely they are hiding something. There are also videos of people saying we&#39;ve never left earths lower atmosphere so who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>perfect circular orbit around the earth, something that is very, very rare in the whole universe. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first argument you make is already a dumb lie, the moon&#39;s orbit around the earth is less circular than a lot of other orbiting bodies in the solar system</p>

<p>Not only.it is not &quot;perfectly&quot; circular but most other big bodies in the solar system have an orbit that is <strong>more</strong> circular, that&#39;s not &quot;very very rare&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>our is MASSIVE in relative size. It is more than a quarter the size of earth. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/earthmoon.png">See the scale for yourself</a></p>

<p>When you say &quot;a quarter the size&quot; do you mean the radius, the equatorial circumference, the area of the visible side or the volume? Be more specific please</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our moon is the perfect size and the perfect distance from the earth to cause a perfect eclipse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only in some rare cases, most of the time the moon is slightly bigger or slightly smaller cause, despite what you said, moon&#39;s orbit is not circular</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moon never rotates from our perspective. In other words, we always see the same face of the moon even though it is orbiting the earth and in turn, the moon and the earth are both orbiting the sun. It’s almost as if someone planned it that way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s called &quot;tidal lock&quot;, it&#39;s one of the most common phenomenons in the universe and easily explainable by physics, not some big alien conspiracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now if all this weirdness hasn’t convinced you that the moon is not what you think it is, I don’t know what will. So, then what is it? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep, such weirdness, a bunch of lies about the moon&#39;s orbit, vague arguments about it&#39;s size and this weirs inexplicable phenomenon of tidal locking. That&#39;s all very weird, i guess the only explanation is <del>fairies</del>aliens.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So if we went to the moon multiple times from 1969 to 1972, why are scientists now saying “we don’t have the technology to go to the moon. We had it in the 60’s but we don’t anymore.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The industry responsible for making the saturn 5 was dismantled, now they only make other kinds of rockets, lacking the technology don&#39;t mean we lack the knowledhe, just that the production chains that we had in the 60s change to other thinga and if we wanted to focus on making mssive saturn 5 rockets again we would need to make new rocket and fuel factories.</p>

<p>Imagine an atari 2600, we still knows how they work and can theoretically make new ones, but we don&#39;t have atari factories anymore, so in a way we lost that technology unless we remake it from scratch.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is there suddenly a layer of deadly radiation called the Van Allen Belts that would kill any astronauts leaving the earth’s orbit today, but didn’t kill them in the 60’s?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The van allen belt was a well known phenomenon that was disussed a lot in the 50s and 60s, i guess you never read any scientific paper n the subject nor even read the wikipedia article on van allen radiation you linked, van allen (the guy) discovered the belt in the 50s</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The answer lies in the fact that there are countless evidence that the entire moon landings from start to finish were carefully observed by alien entities. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There isn&#39;t any evidence. The things you linked are too vague to be proof of anything, let alone proof of your wild claims of aliens observing us from their hollow moon base.</p>

<p>To just get three guys up to the moon required a skyscraper sized launch vehicle with a couple of small lakes worth of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.

    <div class="md"><p>The Van Allen Belts and the radiation dangers they presented were discovered and known in 1958. </p>

<p>There were also more recent incidents with both the space shuttle and the ISS less than 300 miles up where the people of board were being blinded by intense flashes of light due to the radiation from those belts hitting the retina of their eyes. That&#39;s why the ISS stays at a distance of only 250 miles above the Earth&#39;s surface. Any higher and you&#39;re entering the belts radiation field that as deadly as it is still protects the planet from constantly being bombarded by even more deadly cosmic radiation that travels freely through the Universe as well as harmful levels that are inbound from our own Sun.</p>

<p>When the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl went critical in 1986 the scientists and workers trying to contain the problem were desperate to find any extra protection against the deadly levels of atomic radiation that surrounded the entire plant. </p>

<p>Assuming that NASA had dealt with the kind of serious radiation that was known to exist in space numerous requests were made to NASA asking if the spacesuits worn by the astronauts couldn&#39;t be loaned to the people trying to contain the problem at Chernobyl.</p>

<p>NASA&#39;s reply was rather an astounding admission that the suits that the astronauts wore in space and on the Moon didn&#39;t actually have any kind of shielding or protection against radiation and so they couldn&#39;t be of any real use. </p>

<p>Make of that what you will added to the fact that no mention of what the levels of cosmic radiation must be beyond the Earth&#39;s atmosphere or on the surface of the Moon that the astronauts couldn&#39;t avoid being exposed to or how they would survive it during any of the lunar missions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The moon did not &quot;reverberate like a hollow sphere&quot;. It reverberated for <em>longer</em> than we would expect it to, basing our assumptions on how it would reverberate off of how the Earth reverberates. That could mean the moon is hollow, or it could be explained by the absence of moisture in the moon, which leaves little to dampen the reverberations between the low density rock. Interestingly however, there is little information available regarding the density of the moon rocks taken from our missions to the moon, and the information available states that those rocks tested were <strong>more</strong> dense than their earth counterparts. The rocks that are supposed to make up a majority of the moon, accounting for its lower density, have not been tested for their density, or if they have, I have never been able to find any information on them. I am in no way suggesting that this proved the moon is hollow, but it did pique my interest. The moon could be hollow, but the only support we have for that is that it reverberates longer than the Earth does is less dense than the Earth. Not a lot to go on IMO.</p>

Check out 2001 a space Odyssey ..
The computer is H.A.L. just a letter off from I.B.M. 
The moon landing was faked by Stanley Kubrick .. He was troubled about the secret he had to keep  and layed it into the background and certain scenes in the Shining by King.
Eyes wide shut was about the current state of Hollywood..  He passed away from a sudden heart attack 2 weeks after handing it off as ready.. some scenes were cut from the original.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love entertaining ideas like this just as a way to exercise the brain and keep an open mind, but a lot of your points are factually incorrect and those have been covered in many other replies.</p>

<p>This one, however:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just WTF? How could we have the technology in the 60’s but we don’t have it anymore?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would argue that our technology is much better, and that&#39;s precisely the reason <em>why</em> we haven&#39;t been back. There have been other probes, orbiters, and rovers sent to the moon since the Apollo missions, just not manned missions. We can send nearly any science experiment we want to the moon and other bodies without needing a human on board. Humans add a lot of cost and complexity. They can&#39;t be folded up to 1/3 their size and left dormant for the trip over. They require life support systems, and more physical open space to move around in. </p>

<p>With modern technology we can fit much more useful equipment and experiments in a much smaller and cheaper package, and those sensors and experiments can produce much more valuable data than a human can, in situ. </p>

<p>There&#39;s just no reason for the added cost and risk associated with sending humans back to the moon until we reach a point where it becomes a kick-off point for deeper space travel, a mining outpost, practice/training for Mars colonization, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;m diving in to this entire thing.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>First off, it is in a near perfect circular orbit around the earth, something that is very, very rare in the whole universe.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not exactly. 225,300mi X 251,900mi is not all that perfect.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whereas the other planets have tiny moons orbiting them (relative to the size of the planet), our is MASSIVE in relative size. It is more than a quarter the size of earth. <a href="http://www.jgiesen.de/moons/index.htm">http://www.jgiesen.de/moons/index.htm</a> This is gigantic in so far as moons go. Our moon is the perfect size and the perfect distance from the earth to cause a perfect eclipse.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, not really. The moon is 1.2% the mass of earth. Pluto&#39;s moon Charon is 12% the mass of Pluto. It&#39;s uncommon, yes, but far from unheard of.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moon never rotates from our perspective. In other words, we always see the same face of the moon even though it is orbiting the earth and in turn, the moon and the earth are both orbiting the sun. It’s almost as if someone planned it that way.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The moon is tidally locked to the earth. This is common in moons. Basically, it&#39;s orbit is the same as it&#39;s day.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are many scientific evidence that suggests the moon maybe hollow. This is not wild speculation or a conspiracy theory. The moon is lighter than it should be. The moon&#39;s mean density is 3.34 gm/cm3 (3.34 times an equal volume of water) whereas the Earth&#39;s is 5.5. Experiments have shown that the moon reverberates like a hollow sphere when struck.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, there is literally 0 actual evidence of this. The earth has a very large, solid metal core. The moon has a much smaller, metal core. It does reverberate when struck, but this is not indicative that it&#39;s hallow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let’s just ditch the idea that the moon landing was a hoax. I know some people are passionate about this, but for the sake of this article, let’s just ignore that theory. So if we went to the moon multiple times from 1969 to 1972, why are scientists now saying “we don’t have the technology to go to the moon. We had it in the 60’s but we don’t anymore.” Huh? Say what?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because there is no currently operational spacecraft designed to go past LEO. All the Saturn/Apollo stuff is long gone and lost to history.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How could we have the technology in the 60’s but we don’t have it anymore?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because we don&#39;t fund it. We could if we wanted to, but it seems that we don&#39;t.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is there suddenly a layer of deadly radiation called the Van Allen Belts that would kill any astronauts leaving the earth’s orbit today, but didn’t kill them in the 60’s?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t kill them today, and it wouldn&#39;t kill them in the 60s either. We took an optimized path through the Van Allen belts, but the astronauts were still pretty heavily exposed. <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7080RadProtect.pdf">Here</a> is an old document from the program that goes into it.</p>

<p>The difference now is that we are dealing with higher doses of radiation due to a change in destination. Also, we don&#39;t want to expose our astronauts to a ton of radiation. There&#39;s evidence that the Apollo astronauts have suffered late-in-life health issues due to exposure.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The answer lies in the fact that there are countless evidence that the entire moon landings from start to finish were carefully observed by alien entities. We have photos of objects floating above the astronauts as they walked on the moon.     </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have a very strange definition of &quot;countless&quot;.<br/>
Judging by the fact that coloring issues are present in all 3 of the photo examples (<a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/671/21691207812_800f35652f_k.jpg">note the blue and red in this one</a>), I&#39;m pretty sure those are camera artifacts.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heck, even good ol’ Buzz Aldrin admitted seeing something while on the moon. <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/space/buzz-aldrin-describes-his-encounter-ufo/">http://www.iflscience.com/space/buzz-aldrin-describes-his-encounter-ufo/</a>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, he didn&#39;t admit that. Read the article. He says right there that it was on the way to the moon, and that it was likely one of the 4 fairing panels that encapsulated the LM. Considering it was not too long after docking, that sounds very likely.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We even have videos of astronauts trying to contain their shock as they notice strange objects above them while they were on the moon. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27viO7GCVfw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27viO7GCVfw</a>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really dude? The 2 astronauts explain what it is right in the fucking video. It&#39;s not a UFO. Listen to the audio one more time.  </p>

<p>Yeah, so TL;DR: You&#39;re completely wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to teach middle school science.  The answer to all of your questions are pretty elementary.  Not to sound condescending, I love your curiosity, and of course, here I am checking things out on Conspiracy myself.  But I see most people are agreeing with you, and I feel I need to bring in a voice of scientific reason.</p>

<p>The fact that we see the same side of the moon is extraordinary.  Further, during eclipses it seems like the same size as the sun due to its distance between earth and the sun. Fascinating!! These facts are based on careful measurements from US and other country&#39;s scientists, and scientific interest in astronomy goes back thousands of years (see the Dogon of Mali).</p>

<p>You mentioned the weight of the moon, saying &quot;The moon is lighter than it should be&quot;.  These comments, like those made about bees being too heavy that they shouldn&#39;t be able to fly, are just incorrect.  The moon&#39;s mass, weight, and gravitational pull are just fine, and the numbers add up.</p>

<p>I had students come to me with these same questions, like the Hollow moon theory, and every year and spend some time pointing out how conspiracy theories are both useful and imaginative, but require a LOT of skepticism based on the repercussions in dismissing science and scientists who stood on the shoulders of other scientists, dedicating their lives to helping us better understand the natural world.  </p>

<p>I understand where people&#39;s distrust in science comes from, and I wish I had more time to go into it, but I just wanted to give my two cents that we can easily get to the moon, that we know more about the moon than what&#39;s under our own ocean surface, and the mysteries of the universe are still out there waiting to be discovered.</p>

<p>Whether there are alien moon bases and all of that cool stuff, who knows, maybe there is a cover up (maybe not, but I&#39;m wagering that&#39;s something we will never know, which is where some baseless conspiracy theories draw their strength- because it calls for proof of something that can&#39;t be proven).  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have enough info.  But in terms of our natural satellite, what it&#39;s made of, and its conditions, that one is pretty much in the bag scientifically.  Feel free to message me if you still have questions or want to chat :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point that extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence, and that no matter how many scientific facts there are, some people will choose to forever say &quot;but it could be aliens&quot;.  There is too much evidence that answers all of your questions, including why the moon is &quot;the way it is&quot;.</p>

<p>Not to knock your intelligence, but do you fall into the &quot;Flat Earther&quot; camp? Again, I cannot say enough on here how I am not judging you, and I&#39;ve had discussions with people on this very subject that are likely much more intelligent than I am.

    <div class="md"><p>A few things:</p>

<p><strong>The Van Allen belts can be bypassed by a polar shot into space.</strong> This is the method by which they say Apollo did it.  (Draw your own conclusions about it, just know that it is inarguably <em>possible</em> to do so.)</p>

<p>There are many fishy things in lunar and space walk videos, look up Space walk underwater evidence. Don’t know if it is totally convincing but it is compelling.  If the moon landings <em>were faked</em> the “UFO”s are just boring old studio lights or something similarly mundane.</p>

<p>Also, why does <em>everyone</em> seem to assume that UFO’s would be <em>manned!?</em>. By every probability, if UFOs are extraterrestrial, they would be automated just like our own space probes and likely sent all over the universe to observe things.  I don’t doubt alien life or intelligence, I don’t doubt (fully) extraterrestrial UFOs, I <em>greatly doubt</em> any living alien has ever visited earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How many times does US claim to have landed on the moon? </p>

<p>Why is there exists on limited amount of proof today that we landed on the moon less times than we actually have? Seriously I am starting to think that we only went to the moon once and those who have gone are dead due to deadly effects of space travel without complicated shielding technology. First moon landing could well and truly have been faked, as currently they just &quot;lost&quot;  footage, destoeryed footage, lost data for landing sites, or cant find landing all the landing sites? How stupid is that? The most important human accomplishment in history just sort of gets mishandled like trash. Just way too many questions regarding the whole process, far too many inconsistencies to believe that official moon story is all there is to it. They are def hiding things, probably because its so fucking dangerous outside our planetary safety that going out into space is a task that a little more complex than to just shoot capsule that lands.  POint is science is precise, there are record keeping going back to ancient egypt and greece and athens, yet they expect us to believe that something careless has happened to a good portion of scientific documentation needed for such events. Yeah oops, we just sort of dont knwo where the landings are, but we have images of one or two of the sites? But not all other them. Definitely not the original one, the most important and significant one.  Or am I wrong?</p>

<p>There is nothing on the moon worth going there for. There are lots of speculation, and until we have multiple sources cross referenced its all pure speculation. The question also becomes about price, it costs to much to invest into the moon even at this time, as the tech just isnt there. So even if we start sending landers and drones and people onto the moon, there is no commercial application just yet, and wont be for decades. So its pointless investing time into it. Its not going anywhere just yet. But point is, until RUssia, China and others go to the moon, and confirm through their data, we really dont have a legitimate way of knowing the truth. As atm its a single source, and a bunch of rover data. </p>

<p>Lastly, hollow earth hollow moon, who cares right? Goes back to the point that either our understanding o the universe is still ongoing endeavor, and we dont have the tech of space travel all this is speculation. Even to this day, popular science on astronomical and space data is glamorised. Reality it is just glimpses of light and its spectrum to determine whats outside our solar system. We are looking at the universe through a lenses of telescopes, we really are not seeing anything visually discernible, its all scientific data and artists interpretations.  Reality is humanity is still at such an early age, we have only had computers for less than 100 years. We just dont know. Speculation into alien involvement is fun and all, but realistically our own arrogance leads us to believe we are more than we are. and we are just stuck on this rock for the foreseeable future. </p>

Why even build a secret moon base and terraform a planet when you&#39;re just gonna cruise around in the open for anyone to see? If they&#39;ve observed us for thousands of years, seen our technological progression you would think, maybe we shouldn&#39;t drive around in our lighted spacecraft right next to these beings that just built a rocket and launched it into space and sent it a few hundred thousand miles to our base to investigate...?</p>

<p>Our moon is the weirdest object in our solar system. First off, it is in a near perfect circular orbit around the earth, something that is very, very rare in the whole universe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, that&#39;s not true. The moon&#39;s orbit is eliptical, and highly irregular.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/moonorbit.html">https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/moonorbit.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whereas the other planets have tiny moons orbiting them (relative to the size of the planet), our is MASSIVE in relative size. It is more than a quarter the size of earth. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s because our moon formed differently. Jupiter&#39;s many, relative-to-it-tiny moons, for example, formed from coalescing space dust as the solar system first formed. Our moon, however, is the remnant of a a collision between the early Earth and another planet.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://www.space.com/26142-moon-formation-giant-impact-theory-support.html">https://www.space.com/26142-moon-formation-giant-impact-theory-support.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our moon is the perfect size and the perfect distance from the earth to cause a perfect eclipse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s only true right now. The moon is slowly getting farther away from the earth (<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-moon-is-moving-away-from-earth-lucianne-walkowicz/">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-moon-is-moving-away-from-earth-lucianne-walkowicz/</a>) which means that in the past, it was closer. In other words, in the past, the moon was much <em>larger</em> than necessary for a total eclipse, and in several million years, the moon will be too far away for a perfect eclipse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moon never rotates from our perspective. In other words, we always see the same face of the moon even though it is orbiting the earth and in turn, the moon and the earth are both orbiting the sun. It’s almost as if someone planned it that way. Hmmm….</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That phenomenon is called tidal locking, and it occurs when a satellite&#39;s orbital period is the same as its rotational period. The moon does rotate, it&#39;s just that it rotates at the same speed at which it orbits the earth. Tidal locking is not at all rare. Pluto and Charon are tidally locked, for instance.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://www.spaceanswers.com/deep-space/what-is-tidal-locking/">https://www.spaceanswers.com/deep-space/what-is-tidal-locking/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are many scientific evidence that suggests the moon maybe hollow. This is not wild speculation or a conspiracy theory. The moon is lighter than it should be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing &quot;should be&quot; in science. Science is observational, not suppositional.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moon&#39;s mean density is 3.34 gm/cm3 (3.34 times an equal volume of water) whereas the Earth&#39;s is 5.5.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Density and lightness are different, tangentially related things, however, the Earth&#39;s moon is noteworthily the second <strong>most-dense</strong> moon in the solar system.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/20601/density-of-the-moon/">https://www.universetoday.com/20601/density-of-the-moon/</a></p>

<p>Not sure what the density of water has to do with anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hell, even PhD’s are claiming that it could be made of metal and could be hollow. <a href="http://www.woowoomedia.com/phd-says-the-moon-is-older-than-earth-and-is-made-of-metal/">http://www.woowoomedia.com/phd-says-the-moon-is-older-than-earth-and-is-made-of-metal/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anything <em>could be</em>. The moon <em>could be</em> a super sophisticated projected hologram. But proper scientific rigor demands we base our beliefs on what can be proven, not what is possible.</p>

<p>It also doesn&#39;t matter that the person cited in that article has a Ph.D. Someone having a position of authority or generally being smart doesn&#39;t mean that what they say is true. They still have to prove their claims. Check this out...</p>

<p>Now if all this weirdness hasn’t convinced you that the moon is not what you think it is, I don’t know what will.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hard evidence. &quot;Weirdness&quot; (which there really is none because I debunked all your claims) does not meet scientific rigor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, then what is it? Could it be an observation deck? Could it have been placed there on purpose to secretly observe how life developed and evolved on earth? Could our planet be just a one big biological experiment? Could the aliens have planted the seeds of life on earth and setup an observatory deck to see how it develops?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely. All of those things are 100% possible. But you&#39;d need to prove that they&#39;re the case. They&#39;re really fun to think about, and with such an imagination you may seriously want to consider writing science fiction. But again, you&#39;d need to prove any of those claims to, erm, prove them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let’s just ditch the idea that the moon landing was a hoax. I know some people are passionate about this, but for the sake of this article, let’s just ignore that theory. So if we went to the moon multiple times from 1969 to 1972, why are scientists now saying “we don’t have the technology to go to the moon. We had it in the 60’s but we don’t anymore.” Huh? Say what?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16MMZJlp_0Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16MMZJlp_0Y</a></p>

<p>Just WTF? How could we have the technology in the 60’s but we don’t have it anymore? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because transporting humans from Earth to the Moon is a specific undertaking that requires specific, purpose-built and expensive technology which doesn&#39;t last for decades. He wasn&#39;t saying it&#39;s literally impossible to go to the moon, he was saying we simply don&#39;t have an Apollo-like craft just laying around to use. That clip is short and out-of-context, and sometimes people like to use out-of-context clips to misrepresent others. Be wary of that. Unfortunately I couldn&#39;t find a full version of that interview in a few minutes of googling.</p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s a bit like asking &quot;why are cigarettes all of a sudden bad for you? Doctors in the 1950s used to endorse smoking, now they say it causes cancer. Why did cancer all of a sudden appear in the 1950s?&quot;</p>

<p>The Van Allen belt existed back then, we just didn&#39;t understand it as well, and to be frank, cared a lot less about the safety and well-being of our astronauts back then. Radition exposure increases your likelihood of developing cancer, but it doesn&#39;t happen instantaneously. The Apollo astronauts simply took the risk. They weighed the superiority of America over Russia as being more important than their own personal health. We care more about individual astronauts health these days, and have much less motivation to go anywhere outside of Earth besides the ISS. I mean, there&#39;s really no reason for humans to go to the moon right now, so why risk it? It&#39;s not worth the financial and health risk.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The answer lies in the fact that there are countless evidence that the entire moon landings from start to finish were carefully observed by alien entities. We have photos of objects floating above the astronauts as they walked on the moon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Floating objects are not evidence of aliens. There&#39;s a number of possible explanations. It could be time-travellers, Russians, psychics, gods, ghosts, a hoax, artifacts of the filming process. We don&#39;t know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heck, even good ol’ Buzz Aldrin admitted seeing something while on the moon. <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/space/buzz-aldrin-describes-his-encounter-ufo/">http://www.iflscience.com/space/buzz-aldrin-describes-his-encounter-ufo/</a> We even have videos of astronauts trying to contain their shock as they notice strange objects above them while they were on the moon. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27viO7GCVfw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27viO7GCVfw</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, UFOs are unquestionably real. But that just means &quot;unidentified flying object.&quot; If you gained flying superpowers and zipped around, and were picked up on an air traffic controller&#39;s radar, you&#39;d be a UFO. You need to prove that UFOs are aliens, it doesn&#39;t naturally and logically follow that UFOs <em>are</em> aliens. You&#39;d have to prove the existence of intelligent aliens in the first place, of course, which is a pretty big task in and of itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So what does all this mean? Yup. Gonna say it. The moon landings were accomplished with the assistance of aliens Call me crazy because even I think it is. But this is the only explanation my tiny mind can come up with to answer all of the mysteries listed above.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I hope you can see, I&#39;ve demonstrated that they aren&#39;t actually mysteries. There are also <em>many</em> possible explanations. Your inability to find others is due to your bad sources (the sites and Youtube channels you linked are very bad sources of information) and lack of extensive rigor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would they do this? Well, I’d imagine that too many questions were being asked about the moon. If people started noticing that the moon is a big ole spaceship, the aliens would have a problem with the ongoing secret observation of our development on earth. So they assisted NASA in getting to the moon so they can walk around the surface like children and report back to the ignorant earthlings “Yup, the moon is just a rock”. LOL.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you&#39;d need some massive proof to demonstrate that to be the case, and &quot;hmm, lotsa weird stuff about that moon&quot; isn&#39;t proof.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But things are a changing. Our technology is advancing rapidly. They’re not gonna be able to keep it a secret much longer. We will reveal the truth about the moon very very soon. (I hope)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, that assumes there&#39;s a truth to reveal, which you haven&#39;t demonstrated.</p>
