        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://foia.state.gov/Search/results.aspx?searchText=silsby">Here</a> are the Department of State documents that are concerning the Haiti child trafficking &quot;rescue&quot; mission.</p>

<p>The progression of events becomes clear in the titles of the documents of note: </p>

<p>Document 1: New Life children&#39;s refuge: Haitian orphan rescue mission</p>

<p>Document 2: Haiti prosecutors urge prison for US missionary (Laura silsby) </p>

<p>Document 3: (email from Huma Abedin to Hillary Clinton) Haiti drops kidnapping charge for missionaries </p>

<p>The New Life children&#39;s refuge &quot;Provide a loving Christian home-like environment for up to 200 
children, both boys and girls, initially focused on ages 0 - 10 years old, later expanding to include 
teens up to age 16&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case">Here</a> is the case details on Wikipedia. Some interesting things from the article: </p>

<p>&quot;On January 29, 2010, a group of ten American Baptist missionaries from Idaho attempted to cross the Haiti-Dominican Republic border with 33 Haitian children, most of whom were not orphans and had families.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the days following the group&#39;s initial arrest, Dominican Jorge Puello falsely portrayed himself as the group&#39;s lawyer. Puello later acknowledged that he is under investigation for sex trafficking in El Salvador and wanted in the United States for smuggling people across the Canada–US border.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is the team that went to Haiti: &quot;Haiti Team: Laura Silsby, Charisa Coulter, Carla Thompson, Nicole &amp; Corrinna Lankford 
Paul Thompsons Team from East Side Baptist Church, Twin Falls&quot;</p>

<p>I will be researching these names and organizations further, but this is a good start for anyone doubting the Laura Silsby child trafficking story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some information you may be interested in, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5gyceg/pizzagate_has_not_been_disproven_nor_publicly/dawdueh">old copy pasta</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I assume you&#39;re talking about <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3539">this email</a>.</p>

<p>First off, we need some context.</p>

<p>Pizzagate investigators cite <a href="http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf">this document</a> as proof that &quot;One of the first things the Clintons did when they took over the scene in Haiti was to have Bill get Laura off the hook.&quot;</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not true according to their own link. The linked document says:</p>

<p>Clinton brokered the release of all the missionaries, <strong>except for the group leader, Laura Silsby.</strong></p>

<p>Interesting non-essential side note, if you look at <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794247777756860417">this shameful, monumentally embarrassing tweet from Wikileaks</a> where they link to an early pizzagate thread on the_youknowwho, you can see the original formulation was that &quot;One of the first things <strong>Hillary</strong> did when she took over the scene in Haiti was get Laura Silsby off the hook...&quot; This has been edited to say &quot;the Clintons&quot; instead of &quot;Hillary&quot; because the linked 46-page document doesn&#39;t even mention Hillary&#39;s name. And besides, &quot;the Clintons took over the scene?&quot; The outcome for Silsby was determined by a trial with a judge and lawyers and testimony from the parents of the &quot;orphans&quot; and all kinds of neat non-Clinton-y stuff.</p>

<p>So what happened to Silby?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite Silsby’s stated intent to take the children over the border to an
unauthorized orphanage and her connections to human traffickers such as
Torres-Puello, the courts eventually dropped the kidnapping and criminal
association charges against her. Silsby was instead convicted under the
additional charge of organizing illegal travel, sentenced to time served (3
months and 8 days), and released on May 17, 2010. In the end, her sentence
was based on the least polemic charge against her. The pressing issue—whether
Silsby intended to deliver the children into trafficking rings
or grey adoption markets—was not addressed or resolved.</p>

<p>Rather than turning on Silsby’s actions, the decision in her case appeared
to turn on the actions of the parents. Judge Bernard Saint-Vil explained
that his decision was based on the Haitian parents’ testimony that they had
“[given] their kids away voluntarily.” Similarly, defense lawyer Jorge
Puello stated that the missionaries “willingly accepted kids they knew were
not orphans because the parents said they would starve otherwise.” Another
trial attorney for the missionaries, Aviol Fleurant, argued that “[t]he
parents’ testimony means no law was broken and ‘we can’t talk any more
about trafficking of human beings.’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More bombshells about the people who were &quot;trafficking in Haitian orphans,&quot; from the <em>same document.</em> Pizzagate investigators will never highlight or mention this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Americans denied any wrongdoing and said they had been trying to help children left orphaned and destitute by the Haitian earthquake. They said Puello had approached their relatives and church, offering his help.
It turned out that the children who were with the U.S. missionaries had living parents, many of whom testified they had voluntarily handed their offspring to the Americans in the hope they would be given an education and a better life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pizzagate theorists will point to a lawyer Torres to try to make Silsby and crew look worse, but just read this excerpt from an <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/fugitive-who-posed-lawyer-following-haitian-earthquake-sentenced-3-years-federal">ICE News Release</a> to put it all into context:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In early 2010, Torres surfaced in the Dominican Republic posing as a lawyer representing American church workers detained in Haiti in the wake of the earthquake in that country. <strong>Torres convinced a church that he was Jorge Torres Puello, an international lawyer and president of &quot;Puello Consulting&quot; in the Dominican Republic.</strong></p>

<p>Torres obtained a monetary retainer from the families of the detained missionaries and began representing himself to the Haitian court and international media as the attorney/spokesman for them. <strong>However, U.S. authorities recognized him as Jorge Torres when media reports showed images of the &quot;alleged&quot; lawyer wearing a suit and carrying a brief case.</strong></p>

<p>An extradition package was prepared and sent to representatives in the Dominican Republic. Torres was arrested, detained and extradited to the United States to face the 2003 alien smuggling charges in Vermont. He pleaded guilty to the charges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To sum up this Torres business, the dude faked his identity, offered his services (as in HE approached THEM), bamboozled the missionaries, pretended to be their lawyer until he got extradited.</p>

<p>So Bill Clinton was asked to go in and straighten this business out. Hillary Clinton emailed someone for details about the situation. There are so many leaps that have to be made here to get to satanic-pedo-ritual-sex-slavery ring it&#39;s not even funny.</p>

<p>And so, after all this, Pizzagate investigators go berserk over this <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3741">this email</a> &quot;where they are literally pricing how much it costs to transport children&quot; but <em>it&#39;s just a synopsis of a fucking charity organization.</em> Nothing more, nothing less. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contrary to reports in the media, the crowd sourced investigation labeled by some as &quot;Pizzagate&quot; did not begin with internet sleuths digging through the Wikileaks Podesta Files releases looking for pizza parlors and encoded language discussing humano trafficking. <strong>It began with the shocking discovery that Hillary and Bill Clinton provided assistance to convicted child trafficker, Laura Silsby, resulting in a reduced sentence for child trafficking</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t true. Silsby is the only missionary who Clinton <strong>didn&#39;t</strong> secure the release of. </p>
