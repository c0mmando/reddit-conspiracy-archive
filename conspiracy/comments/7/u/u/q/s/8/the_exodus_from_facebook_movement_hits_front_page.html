<p>SS: The Anti-FaceBook movement is growing. So much so that a post about 1 million users leaving FB in r/technology has made it to the front page of r/all.</p>

<p>Maybe there is hope after all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I left FB because it was unfulfilling.  Would put videos, pics, stories, etc on my wall everyday and barely any of my &quot;friends&quot; would comment on them or even click like.  It was like I was repainting this cool mural everyday on this giant wall which no one ever stopped by to say anything about it.  No one would ever respond to any comments I would post on other people walls or links.  Was like I was a ghost among &quot;friends&quot; from an online point of view.  A virtual life-support machine for slowly dying friendships.  Meh, cancelled my account 5 years ago.  Haven&#39;t looked back.</p>

<p>Reddit gives me way more online interaction with other people than facebook ever did.</p>

<p>The &quot;Thought and Prayers&quot; people would drive me nuts too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, family is one of the reasons I left FB.  I come from a very conservative catholic family.  My dad would constantly blast Rush Limbaugh all day long. Still does, only while watching FauxNews at the same time.   Use to share the same conservative Republican political views until I went to college and met my wife.  Have since flipped to more left sided view.</p>

<p>My sisters got all super butt-hurt when I posted some pic of Jesus mocking sick people because he couldn&#39;t treat them because they had a pre-existing conditions, this was back in 2010.  While the joke is pretty ironic, they didn&#39;t see that way.  &quot;How dare you use Jesus as an example of how awesome our healthcare system is!!!  We have the greatest healthcare in the world!!!!!&quot;;  While they constantly point at Jesus as to why they choose their draconian political views.  Took the side of &quot;Jesus wouldn&#39;t treat sick people with pre-existing conditions anyway cause they are a bunch of free-loaders who don&#39;t pay taxes like me!!!&quot;  Apparently irony and reality was lost on them.  That&#39;s when I realized Republican Jesus was not for me.  Also when I cut the cord to FB.  Still don&#39;t talk with my sisters over it.  They basically chose politics over family.  &quot;Now that you&#39;re a socialist liberal, we cannot talk to you anymore.&quot;  I still talk with my parents, just not my sisters anymore.</p>

<p>Of course, but this could be the start of something new, the young kids no longer watch TV/Cable, everything is YT/Netflix/Pirated, they are skipping a lot of brainwashing commercials.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t agree that social media as a genre needs to manipulate, but we’re currently in a weird time where we’re stuck in one modality of social media.  I think there’s certain aspects of social media that have a lot of value namely easy ability to create small amounts of content and the idea of a feed that brings content to you.</p>

<p>I think we’ll see a new form of social media pretty soon, one where we own the content we create and control how our feed presents us data.</p>

<p>Facebooks feed is the single biggest issue I have with facebook, moreso than censorship, bias or anything else.  It struggles mightily to have any idea of what I want to consume and is a big waste of time.  Youtube does a better job, but it also has a lot of flaws with it’s feed system.  I think the way Reddit aggregates like data into subreddits is good.  It’s not a good feed, but it filters out stuff that isn’t close to what I want to consume, but it’s biggest problem is astroturfing/paid shills.  Any new social media system will have to figure out how to negate astroturfing.</p>

<p>Mastodon and a couple other services are still on my list. I have this idea that you can segue off of vital services like facebook by &quot;mirroring&quot; your posts onto decentralized services. For example, say you write a little article about something you care about, put the first few sentences onto facebook, then include a link that offboards people to your mastodon profile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As sad as it is to say, I left all social media almost 3 years ago (probably too late still) but this is what my life has become.. people left and right asking if I saw this post on fb, that picture on instagram, the joke on twitter.. And I have to explain how I&#39;m a (crazy conspiracy theorist) non believer in these active forms of Mass Social Manipulation (MSM) and people actually treat me like I&#39;m an Autist or mental patient for not trusting the shit.. Granted I&#39;m 25 and most of my generations females are blind and just want to get their ass looked at as many times as possible, so not dating them really isn&#39;t a bad thing at this current time. But when I hear my uncle&#39;s talk about their times at my age of ravaging pussy and being overall social butterflies and trying to explain to them that that&#39;s an impossible task without compromising my self integrity to a horrible level is useless.. social media seems to be everything but what it&#39;s name implies, I walk around and hang out in public daily and not a soul notices or cares to talk to me if they can&#39;t add me on insta</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep... That&#39;s because most people are selfish and they don&#39;t see value in others if they can&#39;t get something out of them. In this case it is &quot;likes&quot;, which is attention on them.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s funny, too, because even if you have social media, your peers are rarely social with you still. Hanging out and doing something with someone has become so frustrating and empty, because everyone is just staring at their damn phones as you&#39;re supposed to be doing something together. Why don&#39;t more people see the problem with people pulling out their phones and checking it right in the middle of you talking to them? It seriously is an addiction. </p>

<p>Loan Shark Ads offering Euro 2,000 to 1,000,000 appeared on Facebook
Ads Image <a href="https://i.redd.it/3hcr8qqo2ud01.jpg">https://i.redd.it/3hcr8qqo2ud01.jpg</a></p>

<p>As you are probably aware, America and by its extension the whole world is being leeched on by a super parasite simply known as Money Mafia, or call them whatever you want … The Fed, Rothschild, Central Bank, Banking Cabal, Super Loan Shark.</p>

<p>How do they suck our blood?</p>

<p>Simple, they lower living standard of Americans (diluting the value of the greenback), by printing money recklessly.</p>

<p>How so? They charge interest on all currency printed in U.S. using the FED. And the interest is direct INFLATION. </p>

<p>(Currency printing can be carried out by the Treasure Free-Of-Charge just like JKF Executive Order 11110 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11110">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11110</a> - That&#39;s why JFK was assassinated?)</p>

<p>For example, they conspired with the power-that-be to add $ trillion of debt just to bail out financial institutions owned by them  during the massive 2008 Wall Street Bailout ... something we can never pay back in the next 100 years, assuming we do not add more debts</p>

<p>Unlike individuals and corporations, U.S. as a country can never go bankrupt, and American are enslaved to pay back the $ trillions to the Super Loan Shark with interest. Something cost them nothing to produce, the money was created out of the thin air. And as you are aware,  these crooks assume ZERO responsibility over the hardship upon Americans, and they are not accountable to anyone. The FED is the only private company operating ABOVE THE LAW. They are given diplomat status, they are immuned to American Law, yet they are allowed to take full control of American life American!</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t this absurd?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7v1847/more_evidence_facebook_is_conspiring_with_money/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7v1847/more_evidence_facebook_is_conspiring_with_money/</a></p>

<p><strong>Why do they want to kill off  cryptocurrencies?</strong></p>

<p>If Facebook is not a part of the Money Mafia, why do they allow Loan Sharks to prey on unsuspecting public, while killing all form of cryptocurrencies ads at the same time?</p>

<p>Interesting, <strong>Putin’s Banning of Rothschild Banks resulted in Russian Economy Booming and Foreign Debt Reduction by 75%</strong></p>

<p>Russia has reduced foreign debt by 75% making them the sixth-largest economy in the world by Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), with a $4-trillion GDP.</p>

<p>Russian Economy Booming Following Putin’s Ban Of Rothschild Banks
RT.com reports: Back in 1999, the Russian economy by PPP was worth only $620 billion. So, in the last 18 years, Russian economic output in these terms has increased by 600 percent.</p>

<p>Inflation rates have decreased from 36.5 percent to 2.5 percent by the end of 2017. The total value of assets of the Russian banking system has risen 24-fold to $1.43 trillion. Capitalization of the Russian Stock Market has grown more than 15-fold to $621 billion...

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Wouldnt we want to be in good relationship with Russia with stuff like this?</p>

<p>I mean, I understand the cold war, the spying, each side meddling in each sides business/politics, but I have been hearing and reading some books/articles that Putin is an anti-globalist, anti-NWO, anti-Soros type guy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m of the school that Russia is now forced to partner with other countries to hedge its bets considering the banning of the Rothschilds, so its going to be China, (B.R.I.C.S.) and they are working on buying/selling oil using an alt currency which can destroy or fuck up the dollar.</p>

<p>Wouldnt it be better for U.S. to side with Russia against China and against the rest of the Globalist system (Rothschilds/Zionist Banksters, IMF, Soros, Jesuits, Vatican, Royals) ?</p>

<p>This is great stuff. I&#39;m going to keep this saved and will post back later. I&#39;m actually writing a post (not sure if it&#39;ll be done today or tomorrow) about why I am no longer a Democrat as of 2 years ago.</p>

<p>The left has been infiltrated by cultural marxism, communsim, Soros/Rothschilds funding, globalism, and a whole bunch of other ideologies, which has had it a massive threat to America as you can see with the Clintons getting to deepstate to spy on GOP.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious to hear what you think we can do about these issues here in the states and if we are savable and can do something similar to what Russia did as well</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t agree that social media as a genre needs to manipulate, but we’re currently in a weird time where we’re stuck in one modality of social media.  I think there’s certain aspects of social media that have a lot of value namely easy ability to create small amounts of content and the idea of a feed that brings content to you.</p>

<p>I think we’ll see a new form of social media pretty soon, one where we own the content we create and control how our feed presents us data.</p>

<p>Facebooks feed is the single biggest issue I have with facebook, moreso than censorship, bias or anything else.  It struggles mightily to have any idea of what I want to consume and is a big waste of time.  Youtube does a better job, but it also has a lot of flaws with it’s feed system.  I think the way Reddit aggregates like data into subreddits is good.  It’s not a good feed, but it filters out stuff that isn’t close to what I want to consume, but it’s biggest problem is astroturfing/paid shills.  Any new social media system will have to figure out how to negate astroturfing.</p>

<p>Mastodon and a couple other services are still on my list. I have this idea that you can segue off of vital services like facebook by &quot;mirroring&quot; your posts onto decentralized services. For example, say you write a little article about something you care about, put the first few sentences onto facebook, then include a link that offboards people to your mastodon profile.</p>
