       where is it?  doesn't make any sense.  why are we not helping people avoid getting caught up in the machinery of war?  like giving them options other than the military?
      </p>
      <p>
       i get that there needs to be a defense force in the event that some groups do mobilize themselves militarily.  it's just a slippery slope.  to that end, what strategies exist to prevent the development of an unchecked military?  and why isn't this more prominently advocated for?
      </p>
      <p>
       edit:  do we need to put a cap on it?  maybe mandatory enlistment so that we maintain capacity (and don't create disadvantages in the cohort), but a cap on how big it all is at any one time?

       I think alot of it has to do with the money that flows from the MIC and every think tank connected to it. Which in turn creates what narratives are even allowed to be pursued.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at r//politics..basically a neoliberal propaganda machine..when's the last time an anti-war story that wasn't used specifically to attack Trump's personage made it anywhere on that sub? Meaning..they don't attack the actual premise of a possible war...that's never discounted as being necessary. Only Trump's handling of it is questioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       More proof that alot of users on this sub these days are given talking points they're not allowed to deviate from.

       Very true. I'm sure many of them saw the implications/possibilities when looking at Great Britain's tyranny through the use of their military.
      </p>

       The founding fathers knew they weren't going to be around forever and that all it takes is a generation or two for absolute power to corrupt absolutely.

       Same. Anti-war is my major thing. Unequivocally there is no reason for it. At least arguments
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       be made for fluoride, GMOs, vaccines, even the NSA, but war is tantamount to murder. But no one wants to hear it.

       Don’t pm him, he is trying to get subscribers to his paid vlog site and YouTube channel. He is likely John Le Bon and he wants $20 a month for his wisdom...
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of his ideas are based in a lack of understanding even basic physics and many of his free posts have no substance but shill his paid content.
      </p>
      <p>
       In one video he asserts missiles cannot fly in level flight because he doesn’t understand basic physics, is proven wrong in the comments, makes a video pretending to admit wrong and then concludes he should just keep his material behind a paywall. If you argue with him and show him equations and papers on missle flight/control he calls it drawings and theory. Show him videos of missiles in flight and they are doctored. His own theory is based on drawings, misunderstanding if basic physics and conjecture and it seems like the only proof he might accept is if someone strapped him to a missle and fired him from a fighter jet. Then when he got called out on it made another video where he pretended to retract his first video, then doubled down and decided it best he stay behind his pay wall.

        worse

       than we see on TV screens. The number of casualties are, at least. The full extent of the human suffering and deep-seeded hatred Americans have sown into these communities won't be truly known for years to come.

       It's a fallacy to believe that the anti-war movement of the 60's had anything to do with ending the war in Vietnam.
      </p>
      <p>
       It ended for the very simple reason that the US had run out of money to prosecute it. So much so that Nixon was forced to take the US off the gold standard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eight long years of protesting had virtually no effect at all besides getting the government to co-opt the mass media and prevent it from truthfully reporting any other horror shows in the future to keep that kind of a public reaction from ever occurring again. Ending the draft was another major step towards that same end.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is basically why there is no anti-war movement. It's not the same when people are unwillingly conscripted and sent to fight and die in an undeclared war or you get the real and graphic footage of the ongoing death and destruction on your evening news every night as it goes on.

       Your point of protests being ineffective is fairly accurate. Concerning the Iraq War though...where the draft was not in effect..there were still very large protests globally...that being said, it's obvious that politicians don't listen when it comes to this issue.

       see this is the thing - it doesn't have to be about being anti-military.  the military as an institution is actually a really good way for people to meet others from around the country.  it can be a really good learning experience.  and it's one of those things where people willingly collectivize to help the collective.  and it's a great way to learn discipline.  but, if unchecked, it's abused.  somewhere in the middle there is a balance that enables these collective efforts, and in turn helps the people involved more than it hurts.  i would like to see a public discussion around how to make that happen.

       right and the problem with that model is that they ultimately are the arbiters of who lives and dies and they're more or less unaccountable.  that model devolves predictably.  and they too will feel the effects of that devolution even though they may not see it or realize it.  but that's how it tends to play out.  hierarchy in general plays out like that.  and it's a hierarchy by virtue of the power imbalance - so it's inherent.  the other problem is that the fixes that hierarchy implements to handle outlying situations are typically conformist and this has a short term immediate benefit.  so it tends to appear like the fixes are working but over the long term they remove capacity.  really, a general education on how this design pattern plays out would help everyone understand it and avoid the smells that it's moving along those predictable failure modes.

       That's why there were so many bumper stickers in the mid-2000's that read:

       My opinion is that the anti-war movement has historically been pushed by the left.  Once Obama became President, they weren’t going to attack him for his continued involvement in a war.  Now that Trump is President, they are distracted by attacking Trump.   If Trump was more traditional candidate and not such a lightning rod himself, then we would see more pushing anti war stuff.

       I honestly think the restrictions that have been put on the press have a lot to do with the apathy. During Vietnam, pictures of killed soldiers returning home (

       ) were commonplace. Since the ban on showing soldiers' coffins, its harder for people sitting in their living rooms to conceptualize what's happening in countries far away.

       out of sight out of mind.  maybe to counteract military dogma there needs to be a press-corp created that focuses only on reporting military stuff that's explicitly outside of any military oversight?  that way you can leverage the checks of a free press and also enable more transparency.

       They annexed Crimea. They hacked the DNC emails, the Dutch watched them. The dutch caught them hacking the state department. They may have obtained all Obama emials They openly meddled in our election. How is that not provoking us?

       We're defining left and right differently. Most Democrats and Republicans are not hard right or hard left ideologically, and most people generally have had enough of the wars. Of course there are a lot of lemmings that will support whatever their party wants, but they are not what drives narratives. I was speaking to the activists, media, and policymakers. For example the left doesn't have anti war rallies anymore, they march around with pink hats. The Alt Right had an anti war rally when the Syria strike happened and the left shut them down.

       Crimea had a vote and they voted to become part of Russia. Also as far as I know Ukraine is not a US state, its not even a member of nato so how is it provocation against the US for them to align with the Russian sphere, something they have historically done? Every country attempts to hack other countries, should that result in a war? How did they meddle in our election? Please give specifics. We have missiles pointed at Russia on their border, should they start a war with us over this provocation or do you only care when the Russians do it? Also I wonder why you only seem to care about so called Russian meddling. Does it bother you that Saudi Arabia picked Obama's cabinet? What about the fact that China buys up our debt and leverages that for favorable policy? Does it bother you that 40 democratic members of the house and senate are dual citizens with Israel? Or how every presidential candidate must speak before Aipac (one of the largest lobbies in DC and its for a foreign state) and pledge allegiance to Israel? Perhaps you should ask yourself why you are prepared to go to war because of hacking that may or may not have happened when you don't even realize the massive amounts of control other countries already have. Could it be because its in their interest for you to direct your indignation towards Russia and away from them?

       This is why I consider them an act of war. What is the difference morally between blockading a country resulting in people dying because they cannot get supplies and bombing their supply lines within a country causing the same damage?

       I have been working on developing my own personal anti-war movement since 2003. I have actually had a lot of successes and sadly far too many failures. Mostly I post on Discus. You can find me at TruthDig if you are interested in it.

       The industrial Military Complex is huge and many either directly or indirectly benefit from it.  There is a Pro-War Narrative wrapped up in a Ball of "We make the world Safer"
      </p>
      <p>
       As for mandatory enlistment: History teaches us that Volunteer forces always fight better than Mandatory soldiers. There will always be a fight from within the Military to keep "Draftees" out.  The only time a draft would be instituted is in the case of an all out world war, and in that case, Volunteers would once again step forward to fill the Void.

       ultimately the people that make a career of the military need to be volunteers.  it has to self-select.  but in terms of self-selection for public service, i'm not so sure that's a good idea, because like all self-selected things it will tend to create an us vs them dynamic.  and that's fine for most things, but the military is a manifestion of power.  and if we create an us vs them dynamic re: power, that's a bad slope.  i'm personally not opposed to some sort of mandatory public service for everybody.  i think it would be a great bonding experience and it would help people not avoid the realities of how their systems function.

       I am against a mandatory Public service, unless there is an opt out for college. Or Collegiate Success.
      </p>
      <p>
       For some after high school, going 4-6 years of college and into the workforce is great, but that two year gap where they have to do something else would just stop many from ever attending college.
      </p>
      <p>
       The collegiate success Item would Be, you have to pass those two years or if you drop out then you still have your two years of public service to attend.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as I think everyone should be taught, self defense, self reliance, and basic gun safety.  Putting everyone into military service is a bad idea.  {Most of these are generalizations, but I hope you get the idea.}

       yeah and maybe not just limiting public service to the military domain is the alternative.  maybe have it be in other areas that are more amenable to what you're interested in.  the problem that mandatory public service addresses is ignorance of our systems.  when you're on the inside seeing how they actually work you can't live in ignorance.  so a lot of the bad patterns that get adopted and encourage a different class of people to evolve (who will suck it up but then use the crap they've had to put up with as a rationale for self-justification) - they go away.  it's our collective ignorance that hurts us.  so that has to get worked on.  it's not good, for instance, for the public and the police to have such a division of point of view.  that would tend to go away if you're forced to work in those domains for a little while.  not a long time - but enough to see how your systems actually work from the inside.  ignorance is the problem.

       marching does nothing.  you stop the war machine by removing its parts.  that means giving people other options than enlistment.  that means convincing people not to enlist.  without these acts protests are toothless.

       Your right, it's not for us to be anti military (at least enlisted). I think the public needs more oversight and not led into wars Willy nilly and without clear reason and sources. We have let them get away with too much. (Have you read Pat Tillman's story? Theory is he was killed (friendly fire) for being a celebrity willing to turn the gov in for lying about missions in Afghanistan.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Oversight actually is why everything is blowing up with the memo. We are supposed to have protections. Intelligence oversight is a huge deal and the government (only authorized personnel with a clear need to know and not a normal Intel Joe) can collect Intel on a approved person for 90 days and then all Intel has to be destroyed unless renewed. Laws are strict on it for our own rights. We need to stand up for those rights and the rights to know what our government is really doing and what is really going on.

       well that's true in general of everything we have going on.  a bunch of interwoven exchanges of energy, in a somewhat cyclical fashion, ostensibly done to keep people doing something
       <em>
        useful
       </em>
       with war as the mechanism to create swathes of destruction so that there's always something new to do (and to provide motive force in the directions of change desired, and as a "garbage collection" (in the code sense) rebalancing/accounting mechanism.  that's the idea of it and how it's being used.
      </p>
      <p>
       but what is it really accomplishing?  an ever faster pace people are accustomed to wherein they become more follower-y because they don't have the time to figure shit out from first principles on their own and they rely on other people's words for things.  this done to the point it becomes the only thing they know.  once you've lost the ability to think for yourself you then become a servant of others who tell you what to think.  that's just how it works.  ok fine.  people can have that life if they want it.  they get enough physical things i guess in return that it makes them happy.  but they don't substantively improve themselves or their knowledge.  and they aren't really adding to the body of collective knowledge.  they're just puppets needing to be distracted.  that's the end result.  a bunch of puppets moving faster and faster to someone else's dance.  eventually they'll breakdown.
      </p>
      <p>
       and they're not improving anything really.  they're just distilling whatever is commonly done in a weird drive to conformity because conformity is more efficient.  and abilities get lost in that selection mechanism.  they're breeding themselves into monocultures.  ok whatever.  if they want that they can have it.  i don't want it but that's my choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       so that's how that's working.  i personally am more interested in thinking about stuff and figuring out better models instead of this weird kinda human annealing deal to a local minima/maxima we got going on.  it's more fun.  it's more enjoyable.  and it's rewarding to come up with a better way to do things.  even just for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       and what this current system isn't doing is incentivizing people who are capable of original thought from wanting to manifest it in any way that contractually binds because of the pain in the ass created by taking on so many puppets to manage.  what a fucking pain in the ass that is!  why bother?  easier to just take care of your basic needs and maximize your free time.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think people can see the pattern if they're willing to see it.  yeah it's unpleasant i guess.  but it's less unpleasant than it is
       <em>
        different
       </em>
       if you're not freaked out by new ideas.  people are conditioned to be afraid of new ideas.  it psychologically hurts them.  and that's too bad.  because in the ever accelerating design (which nobody i've ever really met can handle the limits of...they're just not that superhuman..even the best) they will all break down.  and
       <em>
        things are lost
       </em>
       .  ideas and new realizations are lost.  i get that we've been here before and that we're recreating the wheel.  ok.  i just don't think we've figured out all the things we can figure out and we kill off capacity in this race.  who's got time for all that?

       Weren't anti-war protests a few years after the invasion of Iraq some of the largest ever? I didn't see much coverage of it on msm but have heard about them long after the fact. Much as I can't stand Cenk Yuger and Co. I gotta give them credit for reminding their audience of those massive protests from time to time. I only heard about the protests just a few years ago on The Young Turks podcast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the MIC figured it was better to declare victory in Iraq and kill Osama and then just say we are "advising" freedom fighters and helping build schools in hot zones and shit like that, than admit we are still waging war all over the globe more than any other nation has since WW2. Hopefully the anti-war activists with their heads screwed on straight meet person to person in real life and keep the majority of their business offline, IDK.

       I'd be all for a standing military and even some military interventions overseas if it was done start to finish with as much integrityand honor as possible. Shame really to have such a formidable military and have them get used up like paper napkins get used to wipe caviar off the dribbling chins of the sociopathic .1%ers.

       An argument that I've heard that sounds plausible is that the massive explosion of for-profit student debt is largely to blame for the death of youth protest movements in this country. It is particularly difficult to enact effective civil disobedience when you have 50k in student debt that you need pay pay off ASAP, because an arrest record ruins your future employment opportunities.

       Thanks! I can't take credit for it, but I'm happy to share it. It's stuck with me since I learned of it. It's some evil genius shit; get then roped into the rat race early, too busy chasing dollars and the distractions used to recovery from wage slavery to think too much about what's going on. At the same time you cut the legs out from under youth protest
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       extract even more wealth from them at the same time.

       see this is the thing - it doesn't have to be about being anti-military.  the military as an institution is actually a really good way for people to meet others from around the country.  it can be a really good learning experience.  and it's one of those things where people willingly collectivize to help the collective.  and it's a great way to learn discipline.  but, if unchecked, it's abused.  somewhere in the middle there is a balance that enables these collective efforts, and in turn helps the people involved more than it hurts.  i would like to see a public discussion around how to make that happen.

       I think alot of it has to do with the money that flows from the MIC and every think tank connected to it. Which in turn creates what narratives are even allowed to be pursued.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at r//politics..basically a neoliberal propaganda machine..when's the last time an anti-war story that wasn't used specifically to attack Trump's personage made it anywhere on that sub? Meaning..they don't attack the actual premise of a possible war...that's never discounted as being necessary. Only Trump's handling of it is questioned.
      </p>

       More proof that alot of users on this sub these days are given talking points they're not allowed to deviate from.
