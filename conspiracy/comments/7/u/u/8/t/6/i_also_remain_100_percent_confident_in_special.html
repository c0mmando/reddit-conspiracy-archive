       "It is important for the American public to know if the dossier was paid for by another candidate, used in court pleadings, vetted before it was used, vetted after it was used, and whether all relevant facts were shared with the tribunal approving of the FISA application.

       While this memo raises serious concerns with the FISA process, I have been and remain confident in the overwhelming majority of the men and women serving at the FBI and DOJ.

       I believe what he is trying to do is now put the task of proving that the FISA Warrant/Dossier/etc. were valid and on the up-and-up in Mueller's hands.   If Mueller can do that, then he has Trump.
      </p>

       Gowdy knows he can't and that the public will now be looking for this as part of his official investigation.

       That's what I believe about Mueller. He seems to a straight shooter who is just doing the task that has been assigned to him. He runs a tight ship without any leaks. The leaks about his investigation as far as I can tell always seem to be from the people being interviewed and he just keeps grinding on while being attacked. What his findings in the end will be we don't know.

       How is this a conspiracy? Are you alleging that Gowdy is one of them? I have noticed that, whenever he makes a lot of noise about something, nothing ever happens. And he does have a penchant for wearing purple ties. Hmmm...you could be on to something here.

       it's a matter of interpretation and I don't have my own take on it to share, but I do know that there are both people who see this as evidence of conspiracy as well as people who see this as a counter-argument against conspiracy.

       Gowdy is one of a handful of people who has seen the underlying classified intel that led to the memo ie the information on Carter Pages
       <em>
        repeated
       </em>
       FISA warrants - each warrant requiring
       <em>
        new evidence
       </em>
       that the warrant is justified.
      </p>
      <p>
       He saw the intel that led to the FBI opening a counter intelligence operation because of George Papadopoulos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gowdy knows Nunes is using the congressional apparatus to protect Trump and he knows justice will not be kind to these traitors. Hence his resignation.

       Serious question. Why was this removed by Rule 12? The context is the title and I made the context completely clear in the the multiple comments I replied to. Then I look at your history and it's all just copy paste removed rule 12. Is that just your catch all removal go to? I'm not trying to start shit here but conspiracy theories shouldn't be partisan. I like being able to discuss things here and don't want to be banned but that's a garbage removal. I'm always civil and don't crap on people I disagree with.

       Self posts here are expected to be more than one sentence.  There's a minimum level of effort that's looked for and your post didn't meet that level.  The "copy paste removal" is because when I remove a post I can select which rule to remove it for, and then it leaves a note in the thread - the note always looks the same.

       This is a garbage self post.  It would be removed 100 times out of 100 regardless of who the user posting it is.  Spend a minute or two fleshing out your idea or theory next time and there won't be any issue.

       Mueller has a solid reputation for integrity. I trust him to carry out an objective investigation. There must be congressional support against his being fired.

       There's no submission statement needed for non link submissions. I don't spam this sub with a bunch of bullshit. I just thought it was important that people heard Gowdy's statements. Why do you want this removed so badly?
