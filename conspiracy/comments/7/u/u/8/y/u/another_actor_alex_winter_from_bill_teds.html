        i really hope so too. im a survivor myself. it only makes me feel better by posting these things to help in some little way expose people.

        my dream is to see people in hollywood to actually be held accountable for their horrible actions and  taking children's innocence.

       My two nieces and my baby sister are victims of this Hollywood mess - I've not had a proof of life for my sister in many years. Found my nieces just as all the PizzaGate stuff was going south it put me face down on the floor and I was so very glad my roommate was here to help me thru the trauma.

       There's the guilt that is incredibly difficult to explain to others. That my sisters story echoes hundreds and hundreds of other victims, that were not believed.

       unless you been through it ,, it is difficult to explain. and frustrating.  im not really friends with my "best friend " anymore because she doesnt "understand me" and said i expected " something from her" i was like all i needed was a friend. not for you to neccessarily feel or expect anything from you.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         you just need  a friend. 
its just something thats unexplainable.
self love and a friend is a healer of its own.
im happy to hear that your roomate has helped you
        </p>
       </li>

         i hope victims start being believed.
but i do prefer the term survivors. because we are not weak.
we are strong (:
