<ul>
<li>i really hope so too. im a survivor myself. it only makes me feel better by posting these things to help in some little way expose people. </li>
<li>my dream is to see people in hollywood to actually be held accountable for their horrible actions and  taking children&#39;s innocence.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Hope you&#39;re doing well and that you practice good self-care as you go about the daily. </p>

<p>My two nieces and my baby sister are victims of this Hollywood mess - I&#39;ve not had a proof of life for my sister in many years. Found my nieces just as all the PizzaGate stuff was going south it put me face down on the floor and I was so very glad my roommate was here to help me thru the trauma.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s the guilt that is incredibly difficult to explain to others. That my sisters story echoes hundreds and hundreds of other victims, that were not believed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>unless you been through it ,, it is difficult to explain. and frustrating.  im not really friends with my &quot;best friend &quot; anymore because she doesnt &quot;understand me&quot; and said i expected &quot; something from her&quot; i was like all i needed was a friend. not for you to neccessarily feel or expect anything from you.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>you just need  a friend. 
its just something thats unexplainable.
self love and a friend is a healer of its own.
im happy to hear that your roomate has helped you</p></li>
<li><p>i hope victims start being believed.
but i do prefer the term survivors. because we are not weak.
we are strong (:</p></li>
