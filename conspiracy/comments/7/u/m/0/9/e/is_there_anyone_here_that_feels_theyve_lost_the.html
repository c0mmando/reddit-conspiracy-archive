    <div class="md"><p>The reason is more that when you&#39;re younger you&#39;re learning new things everyday. For older people life is becoming more monotonous and they&#39;re not learning so time perceivably speeds up. The way to combat this is to do something new every week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing slows time down as much as monotony and boredom and nothing makes it pass faster than something new, interesting, or exciting no matter what age you are. So that can&#39;t be it.</p>

<p>Older people have already seen and experienced far more and are usually the first ones to tell you &quot;everything old is new again&quot; or that &quot;there&#39;s nothing new under the Sun&quot; because by and large it&#39;s simply another version or variant of something that they&#39;ve experienced in their own past. </p>

<p>The costumes and backgrounds may change but the basic script is still very much the same for each generation as it progressively ages, pretty much sums that sentiment up. Trust me being old is a new experience all by itself, not always nice or expected but definitely new when it runs into you before you were ever ready to run into it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My entire adulthood has been spent studying life, mostly human life.  I value logic, reason and rationality when questioning what is happening around me.</p>

<p>There is also a part of me, which is growing stronger, that believes there are other &quot;forces,&quot; for lack of a better term, at work.  I have no idea what these may be- angels, deamons, extraterrestrials, interdimensional being, I don&#39;t know.  </p>

<p>I do have this feeling that something is going to happen this year.  Something tragic and terrible.  It&#39;s irrational and illogical, and to clarify I&#39;m not predicting anything. It&#39;s difficult feeling to articulate.   This super-blue-blood moon may have been an omen of what&#39;s to come.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know where you’re coming from, to give what you’re talking about a specific name and go into detail would diminish its power. People have spoke of the geometry of the earth and where certain lines in the earth conduct this type of energy. Stonehenge, the pyramids of Giza, and I believe D.C. rests on top of these lines. </p>

<p>These lines would have intersections and major junctions, but like any mathematical equation there are places where you can input information and change the pathways. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I am mad in love with how amazing the stuff we can see and do everyday is and just how unbearably tantalizing thinking about decloaking around a moon or exiting hyperspace through some portal around some exotic star or handcrafting entire planetscapes or writing these HGTG style epics is just fucking lit.</p>

<p>And then.. i see the shithole worldrun by retarded pedos we are forced into and knowing its all because some other dude has more problems then i do and cant get the fuck over himself so the whole planet has to tank.. because narcissism.. is just such an utter speechless existence.</p>

<p>Why would any God allow such a stupid existence honestly?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have reminded me of this conversation I had with an historian of science who worked at the Smithsonian.  It was during peak-weariness from the second Iraq war, when we were all sick of hearing about &quot;boots on the ground.&quot;  My thinking was, if we took all the money we wasted on that bullshit war and spent it wisely, we could be well on our to &quot;boots on the ground&quot; elsewhere- on some planet near Alpha-Centari or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought about what you&#39;ve said here.  It makes me curious if this feeling of tension, or whatever we want to call it, isn&#39;t a symptom of a sick society?  To me, our civilization seems to be broken and I&#39;m wondering if we&#39;re at the end stage of some cycle.  Society &quot;falls&quot; in order to heal itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that environmentally, our system is clearly broken, and socially the struggle between the haves and have-nots is a cycle. The environmental problems have only really become apparent fairly recently, while there have been predictors of doom for as long as man has existed. </p>

<p>I agree that we&#39;re in a key moment, which decides the future survival of our race. By &quot;moment&quot; I mean historically speaking, this moment probably began in the past few generations, as we realized we have the technology to wipe out human life on the planet (nuclear power) and I&#39;m not sure how much longer this moment will extend into the future.</p>

<p>Humans are pattern seeking machines; we see patterns sometimes where there are non. </p>

<p>I think part of the problem is simply the complexity of life today. All aspects of modern life are so complex that we have difficulty grasping the full details, and if we don&#39;t understand something, it may provoke some fear or anxiety. Surviving modern life involves accepting or at least surviving the pressures of modern society. </p>

<p>The standard of living of the average man and quality of life on the planet has probably never been higher. </p>

<p>The future is more complicated than ever before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very well said.  I believe our species with technology (I am certainly no Luddite) has cheated and stole from nature without consequence for too long.  IMHO there is a &quot;hard reset&quot; for human kind coming in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is some evidence to suggest that warming is accelerating faster than predicted. This is alarming for a number of reasons, one of which that a slightly warmer world, is a more humid world, and humans can&#39;t cool their cores very efficiently when humidity reduces effectiveness of sweating. The majority of the population may need to move away from the equator; increasing migration will increase conflict.</p>

<p>There is current research indicating that increased co2 in the atmosphere makes plants grow faster. It appears that plants are already impacted by the increase in co2, such that they have a significantly lowered amount of nutrients: protein, minerals, and vitamins are all measurably and significantly reduced already.</p>

<p>Another thing thing that concerns me greatly is that it appears much of our research has assumed that with climate change, our atmosphere would remain breathable. The majority of our oxygen is generated by photosynthesis; the majority of the planet is covered in ocean; the majority of the oxygen generation is via photosynthesis, by plankton/algae in the ocean. We may be killing our oceans. There is some evidence suggesting that the ocean is adapting, but there is also evidence that oxygen levels are dropping already.</p>

<p>It seems possible that the &quot;hard reset&quot; may be terminal to the human race.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, climate change (man-made or not), is a concern.  I especially agree with your point on the oxygen cycle.  </p>

<p>Also, as now that the majority of humans now live in urban areas, we&#39;re primed for a disastrous epidemic with a new microbiological pathogen.  Antibiotic resistant bacteria and how fast they&#39;re winning the arms race keeps me up at night, never mind all the viral and mycologic illness.  Prion diseases....those are the stuff of nightmares from a medical perspective....if ever a epidemic or pandemic from one of those...god help us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In early December things in the world seemed to be going toward a boiling flashpoint. Mainly NK &amp; USA, but then the next day all seemed to have been forgotten and no mention of the rhetoric from the previous Day.</p>

<p>Then in January we have the false missile alert and others  and things just seemed off, as if the world was trying to re-align itself.</p>

<p>If we are in a simulation, it looks like the world got destroyed twice or more in two months.  Now, there is some rhetoric but a helluva lot less saber rattling.</p>

<p>If we are not in a simulation, then some sort of outside force {Technological, Magical or Mystical} has needed to do something int he world and we were either put into stasis or a fugue state for an undetermined amount of time.  My best estimates put it at one day in December and Three Days in January. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because something is done and accepted by a lot of people doesn&#39;t make it any less a violent or cult like act. Cult behavior isn&#39;t something thats only practiced by the few. The fact that everyone goes along with it without questioning should tell you something. Our planet is knowingly being destroyed by the animal agriculture industry, obesity and heart disease are the top causes of death as these industries have trained us to sacrifice ourselves. These are just alternate perspectives of our society, family barbecues come with a cost that goes beyond what you see at first glance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definition of cult: A religion or religious sect generally considered to be extremist or false, with its followers often living in an unconventional manner under the guidance of an authoritarian, charismatic leader.</p>

<p>So this explicitly excludes most Hindus and Muslims. It&#39;s not like anything other than Protestant Christianity is a cult.</p>

<p>I agree that factory farming and the excessive sugar being pushed by big agriculture is harmful, I just don&#39;t see what that has to do with cults.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Murdering animals on a massive scale, destroying their habitat, destroying the planet we live on so very few &quot;leaders&quot; are able to harvest human energy as they become profit hubs relying on pharmaceuticals. What could be more unconventional, extremist and false than that?

Not everyone knows what sinister acts they are very much apart of, most people don&#39;t want to know. The secret to keep your cult in control, keep them dumb, fed and unquestioning.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for demonstrating mindless cult behavior. Your idolizing meat like a true koolaid drinker. Try eating raw or unseasoned pork, chicken. Find out how delicious it really is. I dare you. You&#39;ve been fed lies , we all have. That said, farm subsidies keep meat cheap. Funny how so many people on this board protest subsidies until they realize it comes between them and their primal need to buy bacon from a supermarket for pennies. It wouldnt be such a common staple here if people saw the real cost, the health cost, and the environmental cost.That&#39;s a conspiracy in itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meat tastes good when cook (and I&#39;ve heard raw beef is good too). Unseasoned chicken is good for health purposes. I will say that the corn subsidies do fuck our meat up a lot but overall we&#39;re better off with meat than without. Look at how feminine Indians and vegetarian men look. We need the protein from meat to be real men.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not pretending that factory farming is good for you but I don&#39;t think vegetarianism is a good alternative. I think a better one is to either get stuff from a local farm or hunt your own meat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish there was enough out there to hunt. I wish there were enough grassy fields to feed the animals. But there isn&#39;t. Animal farming is the top cause of deforestation in the rainforest. There isn&#39;t enough water to grow the crops to give to animals. The big real drought is coming. Natives were also very skilled in agriculture and also foraging. And when they hunted they didn&#39;t decimate. Big differences.</p>
