       fun fact: people think apocalypse means catastrophic world ending scenario. It actually means revelation of things kept secret, especially revelation of spiritual secrets. You can have an utterly massive apocalypse and not have anyone or anything be directly physically harmed. The aforementioned aliens appearing at the superbowl would even count if it was accompanied by some sort of earth shattering spiritual revelation.

       it's probably why MSM paints it as the end of the physical reality as we know it, the destruction of ourselves and our "things" programming into the masses to be fearful of "the end" or the Apocalypse thus pushing back the inevitable for mankind through ignorance and fear.

       The end of the Mayan calendar was never about the world ending (like Holly Wood lead people to believe - by design), it was an end of one age leading
       <em>
        into another
       </em>
       , with an the unveiling of universal truths, and a shift in human vibrations aligning with the shift in vibrations of the Earth and the cosmos.

       Trust me, if you go out searching for direct experience of the shit that's going on in the realms outside of what we think of as real you absolutely will find what you're looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make an earnest and persistent exploration of the matter with an open mind and your world may very well end up irrevocably altered. You have to decide to do it and figure out what exactly you're supposed to do on your own though. No one can actually 'prove' anything to you other than yourself.

       I'm actually referring to any one specific thing. That's what's weird about it. Think of it like some sort of bizarre spiritual version of the 'law of attraction'/'seek and you shall find' etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's 'something' out there, some people call it god, some call it jesus, some call it the universal mind you can call it ronald mcdonald for all it matters imo, but if you open yourself up to the possibility that 'it' whatever 'it' may be is actually a real thing that can and will begin to reveal itself to you in ways strange and mysterious if you have a genuine desire to encounter it and are persistent in your efforts to do so, 'it' will find you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The exact nature of how this goes down is not something I can describe because, it varies radically from person to person. The 'experience' appears to be perfectly tailored for each person in such a way that once you realize what exactly is going on you're left wondering whether you even had any choice in the matter to begin with, but by then it's too late to stop or go back. Your world has been changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry I can't be more specific, but we're talking about a being/essence/force here that is not directly amenable to description using the linguistic tools available to us at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       If for some reason you want a suggestion as to where to start here's my own unsolicited advice for whatever it's worth. Spend some time thinking about a hypothetical 'force' that may or may not exist. Maybe you cook up your own version of this thing inside your mind or maybe it's directly derived from what you think you know about the major deity of various world religions. Allah, christian god, yaweh, great spirit whatever. Assume that if it exists it's benevolent and has your best interests at heart, but that it's operating on levels and in ways you can't yet begin to imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next step is to find something you can do where you personally believe that if this thing is real, engaging in the specified action with perseverance will draw 'it' closer to you and begin a slow(or perhaps rapidly disruptive) process of it revealing itself to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, perform this action, persistently and with the intention that doing so will eventually lead you to an experience of some sort that will get the ball rolling. Keep an open mind and pay attention to the things inside you and in the world around you that begin to change. I can't guarantee you'll get results, but the only real 'cost' is the time/energy invested and maybe feeling silly and the 'payoff', like I said, is life altering.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my own case, I'd say it happened by accident, but that's only partially true. I'd been experimenting with fasting for health and weight loss reasons as a more or less atheist/agnostic type and had some odd experiences with some of my fasts that lead me to suspect that maybe there was something more going on with fasting than the physiological science angle I was going with. I decided to follow a proper old school style lenten fast last ear sans the whole christian prayer, church stuff, just the food restrictions and see what happened. I wasn't expecting anything in particular, I was mostly just curious and boy howdy was I not prepared for the wild roller coaster that I'd apparently bought myself a ride on.
      </p>
      <p>
       fwiw,  The 'thing' I'm talking about is much much weirder and stranger than anything you've probably been lead to believe. Jesus said 'seek and you shall find', the muslims have a saying 'take one step towards allah and allah will take two steps towards you'. I wouldn't consider myself either a muslim or a christian, but those sentiments are very much correct in my own limited experience.

       Just to let you know the first two paragraphs were enough for you to explain it. We share very similar thoughts on the matter. I Appreciate your efforts in trying to explain your feelings about it. Sometimes itâ€™s not an easy thing to put into words, but I believe if the person youâ€™re conveying it to is ready then they will understand.

       This isn't new age stuff. This is factual. It has to do with the Sun rising on the Spring Equinox. For the past 2,000 (or approx.) years, the Sun has risen on the Spring Equinox in the constellation of Pisces. It is moving toward rising in the constellation of Aquarius now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each astrological age lasts approx. 2,000 years. This is a proven thing. This is not make-believe new age stuff. This is astronomy.

       astrology is not related to reality either. we are not influenced by ad-hoc constellations or planets.  when it comes on celestial objects that are influencing us, we have the sun and the moon and the earth we live on and thats about it apart from an occasional meteorite impact i guess.  and before we go there, there are no aliens.

       Did you scroll and read where this is a fact? It has to do with where the Sun rises on each Spring Equinox. Yes, this is reality. It rises in a different constellation every 2,000 (or so) years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never said anything about this influencing us or anything. I'm just stating the fact that the Sun rises in a different constellation on the Spring Equinox every 2,000 or so years.

       There is a different between astronomy and astrology. Astronomy is studying and tracking the stars and planets (without saying they influence us). Sailors and Farmers used to do this (a long time ago). Sailors used the stars to know where to sail and not get lost on the ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ancient astronomers are the ones who noticed that the Sun stayed in each constellation for approx. 2,000 years.

       we're for sure at an inflection point.  i think how it turns out would depend on what certain actors do.  whether they want to manifest their power (which is likely, imo) and, if so, how.   i think it comes down to how short-sighted people show themselves to be.  we're being presented with information to direct our energies in a better way and we seem to be rolling up in a ball and hoping things go back to situations we think we understand.  this is the wrong response and one that will surely not go well for people.  but that looks like the trend we're on.  it's a trend that's basically a direct function of the level of conformity we accept in our mental window. and since we've built our system to tell us lies that make us feel good, and we're brought up like this, with a massive amount (almost inconceivably so) of learned helplessness we may just get our worst fears.  and that could be what some would consider the end times.  it's sink or swim time.
