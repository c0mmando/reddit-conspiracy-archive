They use to cover state surveillance, erosion of civil liberties and foreign policy all of the time, but now they seem to be for all of those things and rarely criticize Trump on those topics.  Just wondering if anyone else has noticed that as well.  </p>

But under Bush the anti-war, pro-civil liberties, anti surveillance movement was huge, but since Trump took over, there isn&#39;t anyone criticizing those powers.

<p>The Democrats haven&#39;t &quot;become&quot; oddly pro-war either, they&#39;ve been pro-war for years. Remember when Hillary Clinton helped Bush start the Iraq war with the support of Democrats in Congress? Remember when Obama took Bush&#39;s 2 wars and expanded to 7? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The left aren&#39;t anti-war, they&#39;re anti-what they perceive to be pro-American war.</p>

<p>There has been this strange ideology shift among the left where they&#39;ve adopted war on terror rhetoric. I first started noticing it during Libya and it&#39;s only gotten worse since them.</p>

<p>This is a perfect example of how brain dead they are:</p>

<p>The fact there are internationalist leftists swarming into Syria to aid a Pentagon backed rebel group that conquered 20% of Syria with white phosphorous, drones and depleted uranium is more proof of this &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; ideological stance the left have adopted</p>

<p>You also have to think that it IS a left leaning sub, so while obama was in office alot of things were acceptable to the left leaning sub. While now is got turned upside down onto its head. And too be fair. if even 20% of the articles there are true. I would be fucking furious.</p>

<p>They can’t discuss mass surveillance - it sucks and the Dems enables it. Expanding mass surveillance (they don’t need a warrant any more) was a bipartisan decision, as are all important decisions that hurt Americans and other people all over the world. </p>

<p>This doesn’t align with ther “m-muh Russia” narrative, because why would the Dems give warantless surveillance powers to Kremlin? </p>

<p>On war - dems and the goo are neicons and war-mongers, both. Obama was worse than Bush on press freedom and whistleblowers. </p>

<p>Socially, Republicans are right, Dems authoritarian left.</p>

<p>When it comes to foreign and domestic policy (thinks that actually matter) both are neoconservative, right wing parties.</p>

<p>It’s all a charade and people on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> are some of the dumbest, most gulible, yet arrogant individuals I have ever encountered. </p>
