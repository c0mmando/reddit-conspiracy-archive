       I personally think that r/politics is now designed to keep the anti-Trump hate going, but not focused on aspects the deep state doesn't want discussed.  They use to cover state surveillance, erosion of civil liberties and foreign policy all of the time, but now they seem to be for all of those things and rarely criticize Trump on those topics.  Just wondering if anyone else has noticed that as well.

       Right he was a "lefty" that ran more center furthering the prison complex and I thought the military but I could be mistaken.  Obama's was just more secretive and it felt like a continuance if not a ramping up of the Bush years with drone warfare.

       Bill was kind of like Obama imo, smooth.  But under Bush the anti-war, pro-civil liberties, anti surveillance movement was huge, but since Trump took over, there isn't anyone criticizing those powers.  You would a community that thinks Trump is a nazi would be worried about the presidential powers he now has, but seem to ignore them altogether.

       I guess there wasn't really anyone criticizing under Obama either except those that were paying attention. It seems like people just thought it all went away with the focus on peace prize, focus on pot, healthcare, and lgbt stuff.

       "The left" is just as anti-war as ever. The Democrats just don't make much effort to even
       <em>
        appear to
       </em>
       represent left issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Democrats haven't "become" oddly pro-war either, they've been pro-war for years. Remember when Hillary Clinton helped Bush start the Iraq war with the support of Democrats in Congress? Remember when Obama took Bush's 2 wars and expanded to 7?

       The left aren't anti-war, they're anti-what they perceive to be pro-American war.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has been this strange ideology shift among the left where they've adopted war on terror rhetoric. I first started noticing it during Libya and it's only gotten worse since them.

       The fact there are internationalist leftists swarming into Syria to aid a Pentagon backed rebel group that conquered 20% of Syria with white phosphorous, drones and depleted uranium is more proof of this "anti-terrorism" ideological stance the left have adopted

       I just went through the top 200 or so over the last year. there is alot of trump, but I would say about 10-15% are some of your topics.

       You also have to think that it IS a left leaning sub, so while obama was in office alot of things were acceptable to the left leaning sub. While now is got turned upside down onto its head. And too be fair. if even 20% of the articles there are true. I would be fucking furious.

       They can’t discuss mass surveillance - it sucks and the Dems enables it. Expanding mass surveillance (they don’t need a warrant any more) was a bipartisan decision, as are all important decisions that hurt Americans and other people all over the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       This doesn’t align with ther “m-muh Russia” narrative, because why would the Dems give warantless surveillance powers to Kremlin?

      <p>
       On war - dems and the goo are neicons and war-mongers, both. Obama was worse than Bush on press freedom and whistleblowers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Socially, Republicans are right, Dems authoritarian left.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes to foreign and domestic policy (thinks that actually matter) both are neoconservative, right wing parties.

       r/politics is owned by Democratic Party shills. Infractions on civil liberties are not on the Democratic Party's agenda. This is why these topics aren't discussed there, not to mention that shill mods actively ban the sorts of people like you or me who would be interested in it.

       If they want to talk about people rather than policy, maybe they should go to r/politicians. Then again, they're just bullshitting when they say that, making up an excuse to censor the content they don't want there.
