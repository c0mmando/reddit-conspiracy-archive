    <div class="md"><p>He is saying that it shows she has private positions that differ from her public statements.  That her actions do not match her words.  I don&#39;t think this is unique to Hillary at all.  And in saying her public and private positions thing, she finally told the truth.  Teh thing is that this truth is not owned by her and her alone.  Focusing on holding our politicians accountable for following through on the bill of goods they sell us on should be the focus, not solely Hillary.  Focusing on only Hillary is ignorant af and does very little to address the larger picture.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies... is a foolish idea. Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can throw the rascals out at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy. Then it should be possible to replace it, every four years if necessary, by the other party which will be none of these things but will still pursue, with new vigor, approximately the same basic policies</p>

<p>Trump wasn&#39;t aiming for the popular vote, he was aiming to win. And he did, by a pretty huge margin at 306-232, a whopping 74 votes. Trump is popular across most of the country compared to Hillary, he is just really unpopular in a few urban centers mostly.</p>

<p>It really is amazing that a year later so many Trumpians are still pushing the Bad Hillary narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but all crimes by our politicians need to be prosecuted and they need to be held accountable.  Giving out free passes just breeds more of the same.  Hillary does not deserve a free pass.  None of our politicians do.  We don&#39;t need to move on from Hillary at all. We need to hold her accountable, broaden our scope, and rid our government of a ridiculous amount of double talk and politicians that act in ways that are against the interests of the people they are supposed to represent.  NO FREE PASSES  You sound like you support people who act in ways that are outside of our best interests.</p>
