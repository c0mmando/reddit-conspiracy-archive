This would be a great quality of life change for the sub. It would allow users that just want to view UFO items a way to only view those items. It would give users that want to view political conspiracy stuff a way to view what they want. I have nothing against any current of previous mods but I believe that adding tags would greatly increase the quality of the sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d keep tech in there. A.I. for example would fall under that, and there&#39;s plenty of conspiracies relating to data collection. But then you gotta ask where the line gets drawn between particular tags, as that could then fall under &quot;deep state&quot;, which is a good one! I also really like &quot;parapsychology&quot; (as a potentially more fitting term for &quot;spirituality&quot; in some cases) and &quot;NWO&quot;/&quot;false flag&quot; and &quot;human experimentation&quot;. I think Zionism would fall under &quot;politics&quot; though... but depending on how deep you wanna dive into it then potentially &quot;occult&quot; (again, another example of how the lines between tags merge).<br/>
I think we should ask the mods to make a stickied thread for suggestions on tags. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s not a tenable solution. </p>

<p>Sometimes I&#39;m in the mood for one thing, sometimes another. Tagging would make accommodating this simple, hiding posts wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Or maybe I don&#39;t feel like manually sorting through dross, one mind poisoning biased headline at a time.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t think it would splinter the community, I feel that most users are interested in more than one flavor of conspiracy, plenty of overlap. If that assumption isn&#39;t true, then that means our current system is doing an even worse job of catering towards users&#39; wishes than I think. In the unlikely (my opinion) event that it does splinter the community, I find that preferable to divide and conquer. At least lively and productive discussion will be possible within the shards. </p>

<p>The solution you propose does not foster the facets of conspiracy that are currently being drowned out by politics/current events, while tagging would. </p>

<p>No one has the obligation to view an angle they don&#39;t wish to. Far more importantly, no one has the right to force them to do so.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see what is counterintuitive about what I&#39;ve said. I agree that everything is connected and everything matters. I also believe that freedom of choice is absolutely paramount, and that the truth cannot be forced on another but must be chosen for oneself, freely. </p>

<p>Further, I believe that vital parts of this picture are being underrepresented and drowned out in the current environment.</p>

<p>I think tags would neatly address all of this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble">filter bubble</a> is not when you sort information by topic, but when information is sorted by you agreement with it.  If we had [UFO] and [UFO - Debunked] tags, yes that would produce a filter bubble. However, allowing users to sort by topic will introduce something of the opposite effect; the idea is to spur lively debate and discussion <em>within</em> these topics, which are largely getting drowned out by political current events. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I say divide and conquer is the far more pressing concern, and this would cut it off at the knees. </p>

<p>No one has the obligation to view an angle they don&#39;t wish to. Far more importantly, no one has the right to force them to do so. As this place is one of the few locales on the internet where something resembling free thought can be found, those of us who value it are something of a captive audience. </p>

<p>From the other side of the argument, implementing tags would make it much easier for the angles that get drowned out by politics/current events to be focused on by those of us who care about them. This would result in a much more comprehensive mosaic of the whole picture. </p>
