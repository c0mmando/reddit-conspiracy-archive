    <div class="md"><p>The &#39;anonymous sources&#39; thing is both a powerful tool of journalism and simultaneously one of their weakest ones.  There&#39;s whole articles dedicated to helping people try to discern which one they&#39;re looking at.  In sensitive times like these when everyone is trying to outdraw each other at high noon, the indicators are nearly identical and it sucks.  Anonymous sources (or any other way to word the same thing, such as yours) can just be someone refusing to reveal a credible source so that they can use them again later, or it can be that the source is crap and revealing it would discredit the narrative.</p>

<p>Anonymous source - A secure informant -or- they have no clue who said it but had to rush the story</p>

<p>A number of people familiar with the matter - Subject matter experts -or- they were right here on this site, just reading unsourced comments on a subreddit</p>

<p>These days, it seems there&#39;s more poo-flinging than actual evidence on any one side.  Spin stories and rumor mills are taking control like everyone is the Mean Girl from high school and they&#39;ll destroy their targets by whispering shit to people in the bathroom.  No one wants to say it like that though, and being honest that what they&#39;re about to tell you was just some crap they heard somewhere without backing, well, that would shut down your responsiveness to it.  So the new (same old) fad is, &quot;I can&#39;t tell you who I heard this from, but it&#39;s like a really good person to listen to so you shouldn&#39;t question it.&quot;  </p>

Use of anonymous sources swings the ball back in favor of &quot;establishment&quot; media since the public trusts them more to use such sources appropriately.

It&#39;s not new either, I went back and briefly read over all their headlines over the past 100 years. Even back in the 40s, they were pushing propaganda for the US to go to war. Again in the 50d for Vietnam and Korea and in 2001 for the middle east.</p>

<p>Well, yeah, they can lose their jobs in that case. But since corporate media, by nature, has a lot of money behind it they can cover that up if they want sometimes. Or sometimes they can even just lie from the get go with full intentions to cover it up and hide the evidence so they can push an agenda. Then we get a conspiracy.  </p>

<p>That would be fine if they explained why the source is worth listening to. I don&#39;t need to know the name. But it would be good to know that the person has some actual official contact with the story and not just some random person. Something like &quot;An anonymous White House staff member&quot;, or &quot;an anonymous private investigator&quot;, or &quot;an anonymous member of law enforcement&quot;. Something to explain why this person is worth my attention. When they just say, &quot;...according to someone familiar with the story&quot;, I just assume they turned to some random colleague and said, &quot;Hey, you&#39;re familiar with this story, do you think he said &#39;shithole&#39;?&quot; That&#39;s not how it&#39;s supposed to work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t like the 100% anon sources and having to trust the journo on the quality of the source.  Part of this is because I had a job where I was privvy to secret/sensitive info, and saw the varying quality output of anon sources.  </p>

<p>Some reasons for the variance in quality:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;Telephone game&quot;.  People get information, but it&#39;s only part of the story as they only get the information for their group, and it&#39;s gone through several people/filters before it reaches them.  At a basic level it&#39;s correct, but much of the context is left up to speculation.    </p></li>
<li><p>Quid Pro Quo.  There may be information which is currently secret, but there is a high chance it will become public sometime soon.  Someone who is credible can leak the secret to journo for the opportunity to help shape the narrative, or perhaps trade the info for more favorable future coverage in some other area.</p></li>
<li><p>Hacked/Stolen info.  There can be attempts to subvert the stolen information by providing somewhat true information to press that is interspersed with details that can be proven fake.  Usually top notch press don&#39;t fall for it, but there is usually B-tier that will fall for it and it might gain enough traction to reach main stream.   If an anon can get the compromised info out first and discredit it, it can by proxy discredit trust in the true stolen information.  </p></li>
<li><p>Speculation.  Example:  Someone sees person A meet with person B.  Right after they see person A meets with person C.   They are 100% correct in seeing these people meet.  They then speak to others trying to ascertain why this might be happening, and maybe through corroboration generate some plausible scenario of what is happening.  So in this case there are facts with a helping of reasonable speculation.  That might be enough to get a story printed, but weeks/months down the road it might be disproven...but at that point the story is already long over and forgotten.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now in all these stories, knowing the job/department/company/etc would help me, as a reader, judge the credibility of source.   When it&#39;s something vague like &quot;familiar with the thinking of&quot;, I can&#39;t really believe it.     </p>

<p>Additionally, with any vague anon source there becomes the question of:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the anon actually risking by leaking to press?</li>
<li>What does the anon gain by giving info to the press?</li>
</ul>

<p>If an anon is legitimately risking their future livelihood, that probably lends credence to their story.  However, a political anon could be claiming great risk, while secretly having a lobbyist job waiting for them at any time.  </p>

<p>The journalists know who the sources are. They aren&#39;t just making people up. Every major story about this administration has been corroborated through many multiple sources before being published.</p>

<p>This is absolute 1) main stream propaganda and 2) verifiably false. There have been NUMEROUS stories published about the White House, this short year alone, that have turned out to be completely fabricated or out right lies. Hell, journalists have resigned for publishing stories that were not true. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to look very far to find a &quot;major story&quot; from this year that turned out to be false. There&#39;s literally zero truth to &quot;every major story has been corroborated&quot;. And if there <em>is</em> truth to it, and the stories are <em>still</em> false, then maybe the media has really bad sources and they should work on corroborating <em>them</em>. </p>

<p>Do I need to remind you of the blatantly edited video that showed Trump, seemingly, disrespecting fish (LUL) and dumping all the food... only to learn that the unedited version showed the Japanese PM doing it first? </p>

<p>But sure, the media only tells source and accurate stories. It&#39;s easier to believe that :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks! I&#39;m at work so I don&#39;t have time to go through all of them, but journalists being removed for unreliable reporting makes me more sure of a process which can&#39;t be 100% accurate.</p>

<p>And yes, a few bad reports doesn&#39;t instantly make me wary of any news report from an undisclosed source. Would the sources being named make the stories anymore accurate? I presume when a reporter for CNN is embarassed over his sources giving him a bum story, he probably stops using them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the process hasn&#39;t gotten better. There has been an extreme increase in faulty reporting. Not all of that is malicious, some of it is rush reporting to be first. But some of it is malicious. For instance, CNN spending 27x (give or take) more time talking about the false Trump/WikiLeaks story than they spent talking about the correction. </p>
