        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Has anyone else noticed this? Everything is &quot;women this&quot; and &quot;women that&quot;, more and more women in Hollywood are speaking up, more and more men in Hollywood are being accused of rape or sexual misconduct... but former child stars, especially males like Anthony Rapp and Elijah Wood, aren&#39;t talking much anymore. Hollywood is basically acting like Kevin Spacey was <em>the</em> guy being inappropriate with children and we haven&#39;t heard anything about it since.   </p>

<p><a href="http://instinctmagazine.com/post/alexander-polinsky-demands-scott-baio-speak-abuse">This website</a> even covers Alexander Polinsky&#39;s tweets about asking to get in contact with Scott Baio regarding the abuse Polinsky&#39;s suffered on the set of &quot;Charles in Charge&quot;. Funny how Baio wasn&#39;t in the news for <em>that</em>, but now that Nicole Eggert accused him of sexual misconduct he&#39;s all over the news.  </p>

<p>I think there&#39;s a whole lot more that Hollywood is covering up in regards to pedophilia. They&#39;re sacrificing the &quot;casting couch&quot; mentality and virtue signaling the shit out of it while jingling keys to get everyone&#39;s attention away from the pedophilia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah... These wierdo prefer first born kids.</p>

<p>There was a famous case here with a missing kid. The parents were playing softball and the kid disappeared. Right in front of everyone. </p>

<p>Well the dad was a minor contractor and within the year his company picked up several large accounts (unlike any others he ever had). He is now &quot;in the fold&quot; and very well off. Was it out of pity or something more nefarious?</p>

<p>Backroom deals are abound in these circles. From politicians to lawyers and judges to cops and business &quot;movers and shakers&quot;</p>

<p>Any sick fuck that allows this is as guilty as the people who directly commit the crime. </p>

<p>My wife works in child protection. Years ago a freighter was found to be smuggling in almost 20 kids into the city. They were put up at the juvenile detention center. </p>

<p>Well my wife noticed and said to me that what was odd is all the kids were cute. Try getting a couple dozen kids from anywhere and have them all be cute kids. A statistical anomaly for sure.</p>

<p>Anyway during the night they all disappeared. From the juvenile jail. Someone got them out. Several layers of security had to be bypassed. </p>

<p>Someone in our government assisted their escape. </p>

<p>Only two were ever located again and they were sex workers (slaves?) in the States. (This was in Canada)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My cousin was fire chief at the time. He had to shut down &quot;Porky&#39;s Palace&quot; and recieved death threats!</p>

<p>They excavated lots of his property and found 50 more DNA samples and half were male. But they still say he was a predator of prostitutes only. </p>

<p>Well his place was well known to be a <em>biker</em> hang out. And at the time of his arrest BC had one of the highest missing persons counts of twenty something males. </p>

<p>At the same time the RCMP&#39;s were given equipment to combat pot growing operations by the American govt. This included 2 FLIR cameras one forma chipper and one for a car. </p>

<p>The first use of this car mounted camera was to observe a backyard brawl in a ring at a known biker hangout. </p>

<p>&quot;Word on the street&quot; was guys were getting accosted by a gang who would pull up in a van and offer money to fight in a ring or fight these guys now for free. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t put 220# 6&#39; guys on milk cartons. But there were lots of them missing back in the day.</p>

<p>Long story long... Picton was a disposal service.</p>

<p>Picton had sold some of his property and they build a little subdivision on it.</p>

<p>Horror movie material... pig-eaten hooker ghosts disrupting your idyllic life.  The same time this was happening both Hannibal and Snatch came out. Both feature pigs as corpse removal story lines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t eaten pork since I was a child, but the Picton story confirmed it for me. The real gangsters just buy up funeral services. They&#39;re already driving bodies around and cremating them so it&#39;s just a matter of falsifying paperwork.</p>

<p>I moved to Prince George last year. PG is known for the high number of unsolved disappearances of women hitch-hiking on the highways. The genteel racism of liberals ignores this because they are mostly aboriginal women. Instead of subsidizing bus tickets for the low income and sick, the government has been running subsidized bus services to the reserves with the net effect of forcing Greyhound to reduce service even more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The kid was Michael Dunahee <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dunahee">wiki</a> There was an <a href="http://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/michael-dunahee-disappeared-25-years-ago-today">article</a> on the 25th anniversary of his disappearance. </p>

<p>It was his mom with the construction company (memory is the second thing to go they say!)</p>

<p>Victoria BC is renowned for its masonic numbers and for occult happenings. There are old tunnels built all under the city and the known entrances are all sealed up. </p>

<p>An urban explorer u used to know claimed he entered these tunnels where this kid was taken. We went there but it was all gated and locked up with security signs all around. </p>

<p>Blanchard Elementary, where he was taken, has been empty for years. </p>

<p>There were signs saying it was an ESL college but when I lived there I never saw a person or any activity. </p>

<p>There is <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=PDF+Freemasonry+and+Witchcraft+by+Lance+Owen&amp;amp;atb=v100-7__&amp;amp;t=cros&amp;amp;ia=web">Freemasonry and Witchcraft by Lance Owen</a> that mentions Michael and the occult. Link is to a search as it&#39;s a pdf</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/XDaVhSataM0">Victoria BC is steeped in this stuff.</a></p>

<p>One of the if not the architect of Victoria, <a href="https://theoldbailey.wordpress.com/2008/06/02/the-rattenbury-murder-1935/">Fransic Rattenbury</a> laid the entire city out like a square and compass <em>and</em> a pentagram. </p>

<p>Tunnels all over and castles at the points. All with Sequoia trees in the yards. </p>

<p>These people are purported to do some real shady shit once you get deep enough into it. </p>

<p>Many times I told my wife these tales should be leaked but there is a confidentiality clause and she would probably be the first in court. Definitely lose the job and pension.</p>

<p>We have moved to the island now but the stories aren&#39;t much different. </p>

<p>There was a mentally challenged mother in Nanaimo that killed her baby. </p>

<p>End of news report. </p>

<p>The closest they showed to the truth was video of the crime scene and police taking out large pots from her house. </p>

<p>She made chilli out of her baby.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah. My wife typed up the report. The woman confessed, in detail, the entire process. </p>

<p>From drunken debauchery to murders to the (detailed) rapes of babies there are many many tales that aren&#39;t told to the public. 
This province is only around 3 million as well. </p>

<p>Extrapolate that across the globe and I bet any given day there is sicker shit happening than has ever been in any movie. </p>

<p>Just hearing about them makes many get PTSD yet there are children witnessing or being part of these tales... it explains why so many people are messed up.</p>

<p>My wife worked directly under the founder of the youth psychiatric department, one quote that sticks with me was &quot;In 30 years not one person has been cured&quot;</p>

<p>It is only about controlling them. </p>

<p>The man actually died at his retirement party. Before he even opened his presents.</p>

<p>Alcohol amd drugs are a huge problem. And the fact the band pays them to have kids doesn&#39;t help. Some women are basically baby machines. 6-8 kids and most if not all in the system. </p>

<p>Several have a worker at the hospital to take the kid upon birth. </p>

<p>The social workers actually have a different set of guidelines on the requirements for an acceptable home for children. There are white kids removed that lives in better conditions than many natives that aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>I have heard stories that would justify Dexter going to town on them. If ya get my drift.</p>

<p>Honestly it&#39;s probably the most complex and powerful film ever made. Don&#39;t feel bad for needing multiple viewings, that&#39;s natural. I&#39;ve seen it dozens of times, and I&#39;m still always finding new stuff. The best way is to show it to other people. Don&#39;t explain everything, it will just overwhelm them. But tell them to point out anything they notice, I&#39;ve learned a lot about Kubrick from doing that.</p>

<p>i dont see anything that odd with the little girl in that scene? where does she end up at the end? from my perspective i can understand 4 mins of pure dialogue because it was the last lines of the movie, cutting away just for a logistical reason would have killed the intensity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotcha, thanks. So is it implied at some point that Tom and Nicole have to sacrifice their daughter to ‘get away’, as an exchange for Tom’s prying? Or are they both in the inner circle now? (They say at the end they are ‘awake’). I’ve seen it suggested that Nicole is distracting Tom at the end so that she can get taken, i spose this is a slightly different interpretation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but I think it just suggests a path they might have taken where the people took the daughter to keep him quiet, or display their ability to exert power over his life. . . it is not so much an alternate way to view the movie as it is mayba a cut plotline, one that would have made the films ominous overtone much less ambiguous. The movie suggests the lengths powerful people will go to keep secrets, but keeps its conclusions to itself. The mask on the bed, the two ways the girl could have died, but kidnapping? That would have made it too clear. </p>

<p>The fact that it ends on them saying they need to fuck always seemed to me a result of the marketing for the movie as being the &quot;sexiest movie of all time&quot; that they boxed kubrick into a corner he didn&#39;t want to be in. An interesting way to watch the movie is considering what kubrick knew about tom cruise personally, and the state of their marriage, performing the dialogue they do.</p>

<p>For some reason it is a meme that the parties involves trafficking and child sacrifice when the character that sells his daughter into prostitution isn&#39;t at the parties. </p>

<p><a href="https://dangerousminds.net/comments/classic_rock_conspiracy_theory_weird_scenes_inside_the_canyon">Weird Scenes inside the Canyon</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;David McGowan: Yes, I do believe that what you refer to as power networks, otherwise known as secret societies, are occult in nature. The symbolism can be seen everywhere, if you choose not to maneuver your way through the world deaf, dumb and blind. And I believe that it has been that way for a very long time...</p>

<p>Thomas McGrath: Tell us about Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon. What is this new book’s central thesis?</p>

<p>David McGowan: To the extent that it has a central thesis, I would say that it is that the music and counterculture scene that sprung to life in the 1960s was not the organic, grassroots resistance movement that it is generally perceived to be, but rather a movement that was essentially manufactured and steered. And a corollary to that would be that for a scene that was supposed to be all about peace, love and understanding, there was a very dark, violent underbelly that this book attempts to expose.</p>

<p>Thomas McGrath: How convinced are you by it and why?</p>

<p>David McGowan: Very convinced. It’s been a long journey and virtually everything I have discovered – including the military/intelligence family backgrounds of so many of those on the scene, both among the musicians and among their actor counterparts; the existence of a covert military facility right in the heart of the canyon; the prior connections among many of the most prominent stars; the fact that some of the guiding lights behind both the Rand Corporation and the Project for a New American Century were hanging out there at the time, as were the future governor and lieutenant governor of California, and, by some reports, J. Edgar Hoover and various other unnamed politicos and law enforcement personnel; and the uncanny number of violent deaths connected to the scene – all tend to indicate that the 1960s counterculture was an intelligence operation.&quot;</p>

<p>Another of the MKULTRA subprojects, Operation Midnight Climax, consisted of a web of CIA-run safehouses in San Francisco, Marin, and New York which were established in order to study the effects of LSD on unconsenting individuals. Prostitutes on the CIA payroll were instructed to lure clients back to the safehouses, where they were surreptitiously plied with a wide range of substances, including LSD, and monitored behind one-way glass. Several significant operational techniques were developed in this theater, including extensive research into sexual blackmail, surveillance technology, and the possible use of mind-altering drugs in field operations.</p>

<p>In 1957, with funding from a CIA front organization, Donald Ewen Cameron of the Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal, Canada began MKULTRA Subproject 68.[129] His experiments were designed to first &quot;depattern&quot; individuals, erasing their minds and memories—reducing them to the mental level of an infant—and then to &quot;rebuild&quot; their personality in a manner of his choosing.... <strong>Several of the children who Cameron experimented on were sexually abused, in at least one case by several men. One of the children was filmed numerous times performing sexual acts with high-ranking federal government officials, in a scheme set up by Cameron and other MKULTRA researchers, to blackmail the officials to ensure further funding for the experiments.</strong></p>

</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, this is so common in Hollywood that it&#39;s considered &quot;an open secret.&quot; </p>

<p>I highly recommend this documentary <em>An Open Secret</em> (on Pedos in Hollywood with testimony from stars, court cases, etc, 1:40:00): <a href="https://vimeo.com/142444429">https://vimeo.com/142444429</a></p>

<p>Several people are named, but more importantly, it explains why most stars don&#39;t name abusers for years, if ever, because it ruins their chances at a successful career. The documentary calls for people who have been abused to rise up and try to put an end to this. </p>

<p>Also see - &quot;Who Took Johnny&quot; on Netflix. It&#39;s a documentary on pedo rings in the government, child abductions, and the mechanics of coverup. It also goes through the history of child abductions and how the laws have changed over the years since Johnny Gosch was abducted. This is a follow-up doc on Conspiracy of Silence. </p>

<p>Why don&#39;t people speak up about this more often? There are a lot of reasons. Probably the biggest reason was revealed in an article on Harvey Weinstein (not a pedo, but still relevant to this). He used some really shady tactics to silence his accusers. </p>

<ul>
<li>Harvey Weinstein’s Army of Spies. The film executive hired private investigators, including ex-Mossad agents, to track actresses and journalists. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies">https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are also fears of being sued and spending too much money defending yourself in court if the man accused decides to take it to court. </p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Unfortunately California conveniently enough has a statute of limitations that prevents that from happening. Because if I were to go and mention anybody’s name, I would be the one that would be in legal problems and I’m the one that would be sued.&quot; <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/hollywoods-other-open-secret-besides-harvey-weinstein-preying-on-young-boys">https://www.thedailybeast.com/hollywoods-other-open-secret-besides-harvey-weinstein-preying-on-young-boys</a></li>

True story here - after watching Eyes Wide Shut with my old roommate, and doing some extensive research on the conspiracies surround it, particularly the Cult of Saturn and references to Saturnalia, masonry, etc. in the film, I wrote a LONG email to another friend, explaining how I was pretty sure the movie was an auto-biographical account of how Kubrick was exposed to all this shit in Hollywood and that Tom Cruise is the stand-in for Kubrick, with a lot of explanations of the stuff surrounding the cult of Saturn and everything.  </p>

<p>About a year later, I re-watched the movie with my girlfriend and wanted to find that email I sent my buddy. Looked through my Gmail, found every single email I ever sent him, going back years, except that one. I was perplexed, so asked my friend if he remembered it. He said definitely and searched his inbox for emails from me. Email wasn&#39;t there, even though he had emails from me going back years as well. We haven&#39;t changed our emails in years, so no address changes or anything. I don&#39;t ever delete things from my OUTbox (who does?) and am pretty organized when it comes to email. Wonder why it got deleted...  </p>

<p>tl;dr Gmail deleted a lengthy email I had to my friend explaining my research on the occult secrets behind this movie.</p>

<p>Nah, you&#39;re just making shit up.  As a huge fan of the film and conspiracy, this comment kind of infuriates me.  The film does touch on topics of secret societies, pedophilia, and a suspicious timing of Kubrick&#39;s passing, but the way you&#39;re recontextualizing it all rings really insincere.</p>

The small details like this, in a toy store of all places, really strikes me that Kubrick was alluding to how they are at the least grooming the daughter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The orgy scene in Eyes Wide Shut is probably the most important. The clothing and masks are Venetian, which was the <a href="http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/the-venetian-conspiracy/">headquarters</a> of the banking oligarchy until it started to shift to London in the 1500s. These orgies are absolutely real (Epstein&#39;s pedophile Island, for example), and are filmed to be used as blackmail in case anyone tries to double cross the oligarchy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kubrick is famous for his ability to form a scene using specific items or movements and breaking apart from the continuity to show the audience something more. For instance, the Shinning has tons of scenes which to a regular viewer would&#39;nt mean anything. But if you saw a certain coffee container and connected it with the company of the typewriter, you could draw a draw from the Shinning that there is a much larger story being told. One about genocide and mass killing. </p>

<p>Same occurs here in Eyes Wide Shut. Notice for how much attention the daughter requires for a single minute? Then after walking away towards a group of men, four minutes of dialogue occurs without a single word spoken to or from the girl. She&#39;s implied to be gone by the end of the scene. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like to believe that Kubrick was intelligent enough to create multiple universal truths within his work. By not directly showing a specific scene regarding sexual abuse or genocide, it allows the viewer to create their own story. Quentin Tarantino understands this style of story telling well. Create the beginning and the end, but allow the viewer to imagine how the two connect. Take pulp fiction for example; what&#39;s in the suitcase? Where is Marcellus Wallace heading towards the end? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to remember that with Kubrick nothing you are seeing on screen is accidental, every shot is meticulously planned. </p>

<p>Notice how when the girl walks between them, they both pay attention to her, patting her on the back, and she&#39;s looking up at them, unsure. Then watch as the girl walks away, husband looks away from her at wife, wife glances at the two men, and their is one final unsure look back from the girl, her face framed all around in black before she disappears. The wife is facing left at the end of the scene, and then there is a cut and she throws her head over to the right with a huge sigh, tearing herself away from what just happened, and she says &quot;maybe we should be grateful that we managed to survive&quot;.</p>

<p>Try rewatching the scene a few times and really pay attention to the symbolism and the hidden meaning in the dialog.</p>

<p>&quot;I felt like I was being tongued by someone who had just been given Novocain. I felt faceless, and nameless. I was just a warm body, and I was freezing cold. His fingers poked inside me like they had lost their keys in there. And then came the sex, and I use that word very loosely. His penis was so soft, it felt like one of those de-stress things that slips from your hand? So he was pushing aggressively into my thigh, and during this failed penetration, I looked around the room to try and distract myself or God willing, disassociate.&quot;</p>

<p>Obviously you had an opinion you wanted to share in regards to the Amy Schumer thing. Whether or not I believe in rape culture makes no difference. You had something you were prepared to say regardless. My opinion doesn&#39;t affect that. Now you&#39;re dismissing my request for you to share that opinion and just asking the same question again.  </p>

<p>If I say &quot;yes&quot;, what happens? If I say &quot;no&quot;, what happens?  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s treat this like a &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; book. First, my answer is &quot;Yes&quot;. Now turn to page 16. What does it say?  </p>

<p>Now, I decided I want to see the other option. Now my answer is &quot;No&quot;. Turn to page 23. What does it say?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s also amusing to see their limp response to Harvey Weinstein. Sure, he and Spacey were the butt of amusing quips at the Golden Globes, but did anyone take the opportunity to address the issue sincerely? Did anyone mention or honor the women who rebuffed Weinstein but still managed success, thus reinforcing the idea that you can in fact stand up for yourself and not be ruined or publically shamed? </p>

<p>No. Instead we got Natalie Portman make a cutting remark about the selected honorees for best director, and Oprah Winfrey once again placating the masses for self-enrichment, both of them taking the spotlight away from all the sufferers of abuse and putting a laser-focus on who they want to lift up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People have been trying to speak up for years and have always had their stories diminished or devalued by industry enablers and complacent law enforcement. Look up Bette Midler&#39;s interview with Barbara Walters, wherein she describes a horrific incident of being drugged and sensually abused by Geraldo Rivers and watch Walters completely wave it off. She was even harsher with Corey Feldman when he tried to speak up on The View. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not even suggesting that sexual abuse isn&#39;t rampant. What I&#39;m suggesting is that claims of abuse from certai groups and individuals are, in my opinion, being blatantly ignored, while others are being given an extreme spotlight. It is my conclusion that this act proves as a distraction from the actual scope of abuse going on within the entertainment industry, and in general, because it makes it appear that only certain groups are subject to abuse and &quot;white&quot; men are the perpetual abusers. I heard zero mentioning of Bryan Singer or Benny Medina, both of whom are powerful men within the industry who aren&#39;t &quot;white&quot; - hell, Woody Allen was there and no one busted his balls, and Roman Polanski&#39;s name apparently wasn&#39;t worth mentioning either.</p>

<p>I&#39;m noticing a pattern here as I&#39;m sure others have, at least regarding Hollywood&#39;s behavior at the Golden Globes and the overall effort by the media in general. Have you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I already stated that it wasn&#39;t just in Hollywood. I&#39;m just focusing on them because my primary example was the recent Golden Globes, and they are the loudest proponents of justice for women right now but ceaselessly protect, or refuse to call out, some of the biggest names in the industry who have been accused, instead merely boiling it down to two names: Weinstein and Spacey. Spacey and Weinstein ad infinitum.</p>

<p>As far as the people ignoring Woody Allen and Cosby, if you&#39;re seriously asking that question, just re-watch the and listen as the names I mentioned never come up. It&#39;s the <em>omissions</em> that imply this is a one-sided issue; that&#39;s the point i have been making.</p>

<p>Woody Allen was sitting in the main area with all of his colleagues, unashamed and unafraid because he knows nothing will ever come of the allegations against him. They even wheeled out Kirk Douglas and honored him, despite him being accused of the rape of Natalie Wood when she was a teenager. He was <em>honored</em> and his victim never saw justice. Doesn&#39;t that seem the least hypocritical to you? Doesn&#39;t it seem the least bit strange?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did I at any point imply that I don&#39;t care about women being raped or sexually assaulted? No.  </p>

<p>I just find it interesting that Rose McGowan essentially started the wave of calling out Hollywood sexual predators / rapists, and Corey Feldman started getting headlines about accusing Hollywood producers/actors of pedophilia, and what happened? Hollywood as a whole said, &quot;Ugh, fine... since Rose McGowan exposed us, she&#39;s out of the industry... but we&#39;ll all start naming people. And um... as far as anything else... we&#39;re good, right? Everything was addressed? Ok, cool. #MeToo!! #TimesUp! Fight for women!&quot;  </p>

<p>What happened to the pedophilia issue?</p>

<p>Pedophilia is pretty close to the top of the list of things that will always be suppressed, no matter what. It&#39;s one of &quot;the big ones&quot;. They&#39;ll eat their own before they allow the truth about that to get out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I understand where you are coming from on that part. Maybe the way it was worded before reflected something different. Sadly most people have short attention spans nowadays and Pedos are something most don&#39;t want to discuss, so they do try to move on. I like to hope that some in Hollywood are more active on trying to help fight Pedos like Ashton Kutcher and David Schwimmer, who I just found out has been part of a non profit that deals with sexual abuse victims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I&#39;ve been researching the Pedo M.O....
Growing up, I thought you may encounter these people in one of 3 settings: Boyscout leaders, Catholic priests, trying to lure you into their white van with candy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so much worse than that.</p>

<p>A lot of these dudes aren&#39;t &#39;pedophiles&#39; per se; they aren&#39;t attracted to children. They&#39;re sadists that are attracted to violence and domination/destruction of something innocent and powerless. The abuse is what sexually stimulates them. Since this is the case, we&#39;re talking about psychopaths...since we&#39;re talking about psychopaths, we&#39;re talking about people who take credit for other people&#39;s achievements, and acquire as many accolades as they can (because the psycho is better than everyone, and deserves to be recognized as such). So we&#39;re talking about high-functioning people, who are in very respectable positions, who then make their way to positions where they can abuse children with impunity. Who&#39;s gonna believe a pediatrician is abusing kids? A teacher? A chief of police? A judge? An attourney? A social worker? A child psychologist? The dean of a university? A politician? A DOJ cyber crimes division head? A daycare operator? A priest? etc.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s where these people go. They abuse under 4-year-old children because they can&#39;t testify in court. They all film each other horrifically abusing their own kids or other kids, and they all conspire with one another over these online networks where they share evidence of their crimes with one another and gloat about it.</p>

<p>Any place where you&#39;re going to have a position of authority over children, where supposedly only a respectable person could have such an authority....that&#39;s where pedo&#39;s flock to. They&#39;re everywhere. It&#39;s a much bigger problem than we ever imagined, and it&#39;s gonna keep happening to children the world over unless we figure out how to do something.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>So have men, so have children...  </p>

<p>But when you have accusations on both the women-victim and child-victim fronts and damn near ALL the focus goes to the women, that doesn&#39;t strike you as odd? It doesn&#39;t also strike you as odd that people practically argue about who should/shouldn&#39;t or can/can&#39;t add their name and say &quot;Me too&quot;?  </p>

<p>I had a couple of Facebook friends, unfortunately, who posted &quot;#MeToo&quot; when the movement started. They rightfully had people replying to them with words of encouragement and support. I, a straight white male, posted &quot;#MeToo&quot; as my status because I was a victim of sexual abuse as well. Damn near crickets.  </p>

<p>Who doesn&#39;t have a voice? Men and children.  </p>

<p>If men <em>do</em> use their voice, they&#39;re basically told by society &quot;well... people like you are most of the reason why MeToo was created, so we can&#39;t really feel that bad for you. Don&#39;t appropriate our movement and try to gain sympathy at the expense of ACTUAL sexual assault victims&quot;.  </p>

<p>Children are constantly threatened or constantly have their families threatened if they speak, so they don&#39;t use their voices. When they <em>do</em> use their voice, they&#39;re often told &quot;that&#39;s a VERY serious accusation, buddy... you shouldn&#39;t say things like that about people. That&#39;s terrible!&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry that you were a victim of sexual abuse. I think maybe the reason people don&#39;t respond is because they aren&#39;t sure what to say. They might not know if you just support the movement or if you&#39;re actually saying #MeToo 
I&#39;m not sure all the focus went to women, though. Anyway, I think the best thing is too support the idea of anyone who wants to talk coming forward.<br/>
As far as your own story you can tell it and find people who will listen. I think Facebook is pretty superficial, even compared to most social media. Reddit does have subs for it and you can discuss it. You could also tell your story on Facebook if you wanted to.<br/>
You&#39;re right that lots of children are ignored. Lots of times someone knows and does nothing. That has to stop. For example, Sandusky&#39;s wife should also be in prison. She knew what was going on. </p>

It&#39;s definitely a huge part of the movement these last couple weeks, and it&#39;s definitely also old news.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;m saying is... are we supposed to accept that these movements are designed to draw attention away from the pedophilia problem just because humanity has &quot;trouble absorbing child abuse&quot;? At that point, the movement should be #TooBad.  </p>

<p>I understand what your reply addressed, but I took it as you saying, &quot;It&#39;s understandable why the focus is on adult sexual abuse rather than child abuse... because child abuse hurts more feelings, so we want to stay away from addressing it&quot; and that we just kinda have to accept that fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1: It&#39;s not a matter of affording to be laser-focused on certain things. One subject had a spotlight thrown on it while the other has been damn near completely ignored.  </p>

<p>2: Obsessing over pedophilia? No. I have less than zero tolerance for pedophilia because I had a parent who was a pedophile and died in prison in 2016. I have no respect or sympathy for rapists, sexual predators, or sexual abusers... but even less for pedophiles no matter WHO they are.  </p>

<p>So to me, maybe it&#39;s personal... but it should be understood why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who exactly is ignoring and covering up? And don&#39;t just say &quot;the media,&quot; or &quot;the elites.&quot; Sounds like a strawman to me. I don&#39;t believe there is a grand pedophilia coverup with hundreds of people involved. It would take way too much effort to keep something that big secret for very long. For some reason people find it more comforting to believe in a secret cabal of untouchable pedophiles than to accept that instances of famous or powerful people turning out to be pedos are random and unconnected almost every time. Maybe it&#39;s easier for them to believe in a collective evil that can all be vanquished in one fell swoop than to believe in a designless and chaotic world where people are haphazardly revealed to be monsters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are plenty of people who are haphazardly monsters, no disagreement there. The point people don&#39;t think about here is why would there be a group of people involved with this? Do you think they all just have the same sick fetish? Doubtful. It&#39;s a small part of what many to be a much bigger conspiracy. It&#39;s pretty undeniable that if you do your research that a lot of prominent people are involved in the occult. They showcase this, it&#39;s not very hidden, even if they don&#39;t come out and say it. Plus historically and with survivor stories these two things seem to be very intertwined. Many people who survive this type of thing talk about prominent individuals being involved. More then just the Franklin cover up. The book programmed to kill goes over a bunch of cases. The movie detestable talks of first person accounts...Nicole Kidmans own dad died (or was killed) before standing trial of being involved in a sex trafficking ring with a ton of high level goverment off officials with over 60 witnesses. Besides governments there&#39;s an obvious Hollywood connection...look into jimmy salvile who abused something like 200 kids and people covered for him. The head investigator of the jonny goshe case refused to do anything about it at first, and later was found out to be involved in fraud. Even after he was gone police refused to speak to the main witness despite him accurately describing things he could not have known. </p>

<p>Then there was the dutroux affair, where another high level figure in Belgian went to jail for raping and then turtoring five girls in satanic ceremonies. They estimated around 60 little girls had been abused under his home a place where people came through and used the girls. Like other cases, they found a sound proof dungeon and tunnels. The justice misirty found a list of prominent people who abused the girls and refused to release it, never investigating any of them.
One of his friends rumored to be involved said in an interview later he was &quot;beyond the law&quot; and if they ever caught everyone involved the entire government would be shut down. Later the police were caught trying to cover up crimes and people involved and it ended in thousands of people protesting a new committee being imvolved.
(Guess who was put on the committee, even though they asked for foreign partners to not get involved....hillary clinton of course)</p>

<p>So it isn&#39;t a &quot;is there a ring&quot;... there are many rings, there isn&#39;t a &quot;is this happening&quot;... because it&#39;s already happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I completely agree in fact I was just thinking about this yesterday. This goes far beyond Hollywood. People always talk about unreported rape when most don&#39;t even occur as adults. I&#39;ve met so many women who have been molested as children and can&#39;t even comprehend much less come out and talk about it. I believe it happens far more than we think it does. The truth is that pedophilia and rape go hand in hand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m fascinated that people are just willing to let allegations be the new standard for conviction and wrecking peoples lives. 10 years, 20 years after any fact too.</p>

<p>I do think that there is a problem with a system that won&#39;t even question those allegations when they are made and I question the people who come forward after all these years when we know damn well that memories are a faulty thing and that consent and perceptions of what happened that long ago are quite lost.</p>

<p>Women - You are responsible for not &quot;feeling&quot; like you won&#39;t be heard. Go make your allegations to the cops.</p>

<p>Men- Try to act like gentlemen to the best of your ability. You all know there are leches out there. If you catch them in the act, support the woman involved in making her accusation to the police.</p>

<p>If we can&#39;t even follow these simple rules of how to live in society, then the whole movement is a sham and a joke. Worthless.
If we can get away from vague and get through these issues with men committing sexual assaults and women not saying anything for years because of imagined fears, we&#39;ll all be better off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude. This is a conspiracy board. The conspiracy here is that these people being named are so powerful they&#39;ve been able to suppress these claims against them for years. They still possess massive power, so even though it&#39;s an &#39;open secret&#39; that they&#39;re scumfucks, people are scared to come forward against them because there&#39;s still a powerful network of abusers in high places that can retaliate against them and ruin their careers.</p>

<p>What I&#39;ve learned with Weinstein is that, where there&#39;s smoke, there&#39;s fire. Make the accusation that someone is a pedophile is SUCH a huge allegation...I don&#39;t think multiple people make accusations like that wantonly. Occam&#39;s razor bro: if multiple different people accuse you of being a pedophile/rapist, are they all in some sinister collusion against you, or did you do that shit? You know you did that shit. If you ain&#39;t fuckin kids or raping people, no one is gonna say you are...and if they do, your innocence will vindicate you.</p>

<p>Literally the only people silencing famous people from speaking out are <em>other</em> famous people in their own industry. Society wants them to speak out. The public wants them to speak out.

    <div class="md"><p>Taken focus away from organized pedophilia, yeah.  Still had that doctor for u.s. Olympics although not strict Hollywood but part of the same machine imo.   </p>

<p>But yeah, all these women are coming out about mostly stuff that people TRIED to do to them and general harrasment.  Very few actual rape victims coming out.  Mostly unethical power use and assault....I mean still rape or rapey, but only heard one Weinstein story I think where it sounds like he flat out forced himself physically on someone and raped them and ofcourse the Coz.<br/>
Can&#39;t tell me none of the child Stars of Disney and Nickelodeon weren&#39;t raped or molested but nothing is coming out and they likely would be people connected to larger pedophile rings.  </p>

<p>People are still keeping their mouth shut about the more serious stuff because there&#39;s money to be mande still and powerful people still in control and also probably some level of embarrassment for the victims unfortunately.      </p>

<p>Basically I was pointing out how the media just change the topic every couple of months and it&#39;s like clockwork. They pick a talking point / theme and all of a sudden stories come out of nowhere for a couple months before they move on. </p>

<p>I like to imagine the MSM as one big magazine and every quarter they release a new edition based on their chosen story.</p>

<p>Honestly I think we could look at past trends and work out a very specific schedule to predict how long the stories are going to run for.</p>

<p>i don’t think these movements are taking any focus away directly. the media is responsible for that. but the media always does that. topics are talked about non stop for a couple of days on the news and then on to the next thing. remember that shooting in las vegas? yeah you know the largest mass shooting in american history?? it happened 5 months ago and everyone has forgotten about it. the news stopped talking about it altogether after about 3 weeks. i keep up with the news very regularly and there hasn’t been a single article about this deadliest mass shooting in american history that was committed by a white man with no obvious motive. the police were quick to declare the shooter acted alone, but had no idea why he’d even done it. i wonder if there is even an investigation going on, or if it’s just been swept under the rug like most everything else. </p>

<p>but i guess no one cares anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% this. True story here - after watching Eyes Wide Shut with my old roommate, and doing some extensive research on the conspiracies surround it, particularly the Cult of Saturn and references to Saturnalia, masonry, etc. in the film, I wrote a LONG email to another friend, explaining how I was pretty sure the movie was an auto-biographical account of how Kubrick was exposed to all this shit in Hollywood and that Tom Cruise is the stand-in for Kubrick, with a lot of explanations of the stuff surrounding the cult of Saturn and everything.  </p>

<p>About a year later, I re-watched the movie with my girlfriend and wanted to find that email I sent my buddy. Looked through my Gmail, found every single email I ever sent him, going back years, except that one. I was perplexed, so asked my friend if he remembered it. He said definitely and searched his inbox for emails from me. Email wasn&#39;t there, even though he had emails from me going back years as well. We haven&#39;t changed our emails in years, so no address changes or anything. I don&#39;t ever delete things from my OUTbox (who does?) and am pretty organized when it comes to email. Wonder why it got deleted...  </p>

<p>tl;dr Gmail deleted a lengthy email I had to my friend explaining my research on the occult secrets behind this movie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is TOTALLY intriguing and watching the sequence in that light--it did seem weird to me the couple don&#39;t even look at their kid for four minutes--totally reinvents the movie.</p>

<p>BUT....the source material doesn&#39;t have anything like that at all. Not to say Kubrick wouldn&#39;t change things up, he often did, but that would be a big change up, bigger than anything he&#39;d changed in any film prior. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who exactly is ignoring and covering up? And don&#39;t just say &quot;the media,&quot; or &quot;the elites.&quot; Sounds like a strawman to me. I don&#39;t believe there is a grand pedophilia coverup with hundreds of people involved. It would take way too much effort to keep something that big secret for very long. For some reason people find it more comforting to believe in a secret cabal of untouchable pedophiles than to accept that instances of famous or powerful people turning out to be pedos are random and unconnected almost every time. Maybe it&#39;s easier for them to believe in a collective evil that can all be vanquished in one fell swoop than to believe in a designless and chaotic world where people are haphazardly revealed to be monsters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like to believe that Kubrick was intelligent enough to create multiple universal truths within his work. By not directly showing a specific scene regarding sexual abuse or genocide, it allows the viewer to create their own story. Quentin Tarantino understands this style of story telling well. Create the beginning and the end, but allow the viewer to imagine how the two connect. Take pulp fiction for example; what&#39;s in the suitcase? Where is Marcellus Wallace heading towards the end? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but I think it just suggests a path they might have taken where the people took the daughter to keep him quiet, or display their ability to exert power over his life. . . it is not so much an alternate way to view the movie as it is mayba a cut plotline, one that would have made the films ominous overtone much less ambiguous. The movie suggests the lengths powerful people will go to keep secrets, but keeps its conclusions to itself. The mask on the bed, the two ways the girl could have died, but kidnapping? That would have made it too clear. </p>

<p>The fact that it ends on them saying they need to fuck always seemed to me a result of the marketing for the movie as being the &quot;sexiest movie of all time&quot; that they boxed kubrick into a corner he didn&#39;t want to be in. An interesting way to watch the movie is considering what kubrick knew about tom cruise personally, and the state of their marriage, performing the dialogue they do.</p>

<p>For some reason it is a meme that the parties involves trafficking and child sacrifice when the character that sells his daughter into prostitution isn&#39;t at the parties. </p>
