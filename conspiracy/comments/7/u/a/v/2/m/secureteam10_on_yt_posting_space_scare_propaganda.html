       Less than a year ago Steven Greer went on secureteam10 and warned about the government and media colluding to terrify people about some impending space event (perhaps even a mock Alien invasion).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was the recent controversy of the UFO intelligence program... as well as setting up a space defense agency (not sure of the official label).  Then there was the first interstellar asteroid (which may or may not have been artificial)..
      </p>
      <p>
       Now all of Tyler's videos seems to be titled something like;
      </p>
      <p>
       "MASS 'Event'...Just The Beginning?", "Something Is Wrong...", "Earth is acting strage", "Is something about to happen?" etc etc
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you scroll back several months none of them are like that.  5 months ago Tyler posted a video about people sitting outside his house day and night, 4 months ago he posts a video about being hospitalized in a motorcycle accident.  I swear if you just look at the titles before and after his hospitalization you can see  them start to change.  They go from more curious/ mystery/ interesting story type titles to "maybe you should be afraid" titles.  Then all the recent ones seem to be implying some "event" is coming.  All seems a little off to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit:
       </strong>
       To be clear, I'm not suggesting what he is posting is accurate.  I'm suggesting his titles have suddenly gone "scare tactic" and could be part of this false flag "space scare" Greer was warning us about.  Furthermore I mention the hospitalization because I always thought the timing of that was weird, being right after he posted about being staked out.  That is around when you notice the shift in titles.  Not saying it definitely means anything, just worth mentioning.

       I have the answer for you that you might now want to hear, because its simple and boring.
      </p>
      <p>
       You really want to know why the titles of the videos have changed recently from something plain and simple to outrageous and attenion-grabbing?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's because the outlandish, click-bait titles do exactly what they are supposed to do.   Produce clicks for the videos.   More clicks, more views, more money to the channel.

       He has done quite well for himself without click bait scare tactics.  His channel skyrocketed to over a million very quickly and his top viewed videos are not scary space event click bait.

       I would imagine that any video about aliens or alleged supernatural events would be sensationalist to you so what's the point?  You can't tell the difference which is why I asked people who aren't into this topic to kindly butt out of the conversation.

       If you judge this video based on the title, it looks sensationalist.  If you watch the video, he is actually debunking it.

       He did the same thing with Niburu or Planet X or whatever...  he's never been one of the "world is going to end" guys.  But it seems like his latest videos are creeping in that direction.  Again, you have to be someone actually paying attention to his channel to really see the change.  You aren't going to get it skimming through titles without actually having watched the videos.

       The clickbait argument is a cop-out.  It really doesn't address the underlying reason it occurred.  That's why he got testy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I brought up Elsagate is that clickbait for ad revenue was an argument that would make top comment often in those threads, but that obviously didn't countenance all the bizarreness: trademark/copyright infringement, coded comment sections, kids app issues, etc.

       I haven't seen Greer's warning, but I have noticed the same shift in secureteam10's content that you have. It's an interesting thought that this change has something to do with an outside influence. He has almost 1.3 million subscribers, and posts tons of original UFO sightings, so if someone wanted to hijack the "UFO community", secureteam would be the place to start.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, Tyler is a cool guy and I don't want to disrespect him or what he has built by speculating too much, as there is just no way of proving this theory. Could very well be that he just believes that this content is what's best for his channel right now.  Yes, he does have a pretty major influence on the UFO community, and mass hysteria is a real possibility for him to keep in mind (flat earth). However, I'm good with giving him the benefit of the doubt right now, as all YouTube channels go through ups and downs.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. - Thanks for the interesting post.  So sick of having to scroll through the political nonsense to find stuff like this,

       I would guess that this shift wouldn't be by choice.  I think the main tactic that is used to discredit or shift a persons thinking is drugging.  A hospital would be a perfect place to do this.  I think they just slip you something that alters your mindset (probably forever) to be more paranoid.  Look what happened to that "Kony 2012".  He became too influential way too fast and his message was too powerful.  Boom, went nuts and South Park immediately does an episode about it, "Jackin it in Sand Diego".  You can say it was the "pressure" but I don't buy that.  Establishment needed to tare that guy down, that is the problem with having movements with figure heads.

       Just my guess, but I think secureteam10 is a channel created by CIA or Pentagon for YouTube research trends, and pushing out information to the masses for disinformation.

       It's also really polished compared to other channels.  Not to mention his speaking style is right in line with all those "appealing to the masses" mega youtube channels.  He's not awkward at all, which is different for someone in that community.

       The alien hoax card will eventually be played.  Doesn't concern me when the hoax is perpetrated or who is in on it.  Maybe S10 and Greer believe, maybe they are part of psyop.  I just view both as a waste of time, since I'm firmly in the hoax camp.

       I like his videos, he tries to describe as much as possible, but its clear he doesn't understand and gets caught up in the mystery. He is just raising awareness it seems, people need to figure out their own journey before they have such negative anger towards someone who is putting puzzle pieces together...

       I never said you, apologies it came across that way.. I refer to the many people who just outright dismiss usually with an anger directed. Its quite bad when we push people down for asking questions, instead of asking the same.

       He's just one dude who gets emailed a bunch of stuff. I used to lump him in with ThirdPhaseofMoon, but nothing could be further from the truth. If he's sounding astounded with his titles it's because he

       astounded with the ramping up of material he's been getting. He's said so many times -- UFO sightings, strange weather reports, fireballs, boom sounds -- all on the rise. Would that freak you out? It would me.

       Or maybe he's just reacting to it differently.  That's kind of my point, he's always been so solid.. but now he's doing scare tactic type stuff.  He claims it's because of a genuine uptick but how the hell would we know that?  To me it looks like business as usual.  I hear booms outside of my house all the damn time it's called bored kids blowing shit up.

       Neat theory. Because who would be the #1 youtuber for the insiders to go to? And it's not like secureteam10 would be immune to big 'donations' or psychological tactics of coercion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two only possible scenarios:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Greer lied about future collusion and consequently the insiders have no interest in influencing media.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Greer told the truth and insiders went to secureteam10 at some point. Only likely moment has been pinpointed and defended convincingly in your post. The change in tone and mood of the content is the only change we can identify. And if it did coincide with his house being stalked by MIB type people, then it hits a sweet-spot between 'plausibly deniable events' and extremely unlikely sh**. I saw his recording of the car outside his home, and can testify that he was clearly shaken and worried about it.

       The alien hoax card will eventually be played.  Doesn't concern me when the hoax is perpetrated or who is in on it.  Maybe S10 and Greer believe, maybe they are part of psyop.  I just view both as a waste of time, since I'm firmly in the hoax camp.

       FYI - No, I didn't downvote.  I've not seen the utility in downvoting sincere discussion posts.

       I would imagine that any video about aliens or alleged supernatural events would be sensationalist to you so what's the point?  You can't tell the difference which is why I asked people who aren't into this topic to kindly butt out of the conversation.

       If you judge this video based on the title, it looks sensationalist.  If you watch the video, he is actually debunking it.

       He did the same thing with Niburu or Planet X or whatever...  he's never been one of the "world is going to end" guys.  But it seems like his latest videos are creeping in that direction.  Again, you have to be someone actually paying attention to his channel to really see the change.  You aren't going to get it skimming through titles without actually having watched the videos.

       The clickbait argument is a cop-out.  It really doesn't address the underlying reason it occurred.  That's why he got testy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I brought up Elsagate is that clickbait for ad revenue was an argument that would make top comment often in those threads, but that obviously didn't countenance all the bizarreness: trademark/copyright infringement, coded comment sections, kids app issues, etc.
