        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">46</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-01-31 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/RazorSprinter.html">RazorSprinter</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Less than a year ago Steven Greer went on secureteam10 and warned about the government and media colluding to terrify people about some impending space event (perhaps even a mock Alien invasion).</p>

<p>There was the recent controversy of the UFO intelligence program... as well as setting up a space defense agency (not sure of the official label).  Then there was the first interstellar asteroid (which may or may not have been artificial)..  </p>

<p>Now all of Tyler&#39;s videos seems to be titled something like;</p>

<p>&quot;MASS &#39;Event&#39;...Just The Beginning?&quot;, &quot;Something Is Wrong...&quot;, &quot;Earth is acting strage&quot;, &quot;Is something about to happen?&quot; etc etc</p>

<p>But if you scroll back several months none of them are like that.  5 months ago Tyler posted a video about people sitting outside his house day and night, 4 months ago he posts a video about being hospitalized in a motorcycle accident.  I swear if you just look at the titles before and after his hospitalization you can see  them start to change.  They go from more curious/ mystery/ interesting story type titles to &quot;maybe you should be afraid&quot; titles.  Then all the recent ones seem to be implying some &quot;event&quot; is coming.  All seems a little off to me.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To be clear, I&#39;m not suggesting what he is posting is accurate.  I&#39;m suggesting his titles have suddenly gone &quot;scare tactic&quot; and could be part of this false flag &quot;space scare&quot; Greer was warning us about.  Furthermore I mention the hospitalization because I always thought the timing of that was weird, being right after he posted about being staked out.  That is around when you notice the shift in titles.  Not saying it definitely means anything, just worth mentioning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have the answer for you that you might now want to hear, because its simple and boring.</p>

<p>You really want to know why the titles of the videos have changed recently from something plain and simple to outrageous and attenion-grabbing?  </p>

<p>It&#39;s because the outlandish, click-bait titles do exactly what they are supposed to do.   Produce clicks for the videos.   More clicks, more views, more money to the channel.</p>

<p>....or I could entirely wrong and we are all about to die and only some random Youtube channel knows about it and is trying to warn us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The clickbait argument is a cop-out.  It really doesn&#39;t address the underlying reason it occurred.  That&#39;s why he got testy.  </p>

<p>The reason I brought up Elsagate is that clickbait for ad revenue was an argument that would make top comment often in those threads, but that obviously didn&#39;t countenance all the bizarreness: trademark/copyright infringement, coded comment sections, kids app issues, etc.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen Greer&#39;s warning, but I have noticed the same shift in secureteam10&#39;s content that you have. It&#39;s an interesting thought that this change has something to do with an outside influence. He has almost 1.3 million subscribers, and posts tons of original UFO sightings, so if someone wanted to hijack the &quot;UFO community&quot;, secureteam would be the place to start.  </p>

<p>That being said, Tyler is a cool guy and I don&#39;t want to disrespect him or what he has built by speculating too much, as there is just no way of proving this theory. Could very well be that he just believes that this content is what&#39;s best for his channel right now.  Yes, he does have a pretty major influence on the UFO community, and mass hysteria is a real possibility for him to keep in mind (flat earth). However, I&#39;m good with giving him the benefit of the doubt right now, as all YouTube channels go through ups and downs. </p>

<p>P.S. - Thanks for the interesting post.  So sick of having to scroll through the political nonsense to find stuff like this,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would guess that this shift wouldn&#39;t be by choice.  I think the main tactic that is used to discredit or shift a persons thinking is drugging.  A hospital would be a perfect place to do this.  I think they just slip you something that alters your mindset (probably forever) to be more paranoid.  Look what happened to that &quot;Kony 2012&quot;.  He became too influential way too fast and his message was too powerful.  Boom, went nuts and South Park immediately does an episode about it, &quot;Jackin it in Sand Diego&quot;.  You can say it was the &quot;pressure&quot; but I don&#39;t buy that.  Establishment needed to tare that guy down, that is the problem with having movements with figure heads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neat theory. Because who would be the #1 youtuber for the insiders to go to? And it&#39;s not like secureteam10 would be immune to big &#39;donations&#39; or psychological tactics of coercion. </p>

<p>Two only possible scenarios: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Greer lied about future collusion and consequently the insiders have no interest in influencing media. </p></li>
<li><p>Greer told the truth and insiders went to secureteam10 at some point. Only likely moment has been pinpointed and defended convincingly in your post. The change in tone and mood of the content is the only change we can identify. And if it did coincide with his house being stalked by MIB type people, then it hits a sweet-spot between &#39;plausibly deniable events&#39; and extremely unlikely sh**. I saw his recording of the car outside his home, and can testify that he was clearly shaken and worried about it.</p></li>

<p>The reason I brought up Elsagate is that clickbait for ad revenue was an argument that would make top comment often in those threads, but that obviously didn&#39;t countenance all the bizarreness: trademark/copyright infringement, coded comment sections, kids app issues, etc.  </p>
