<p>As long as money is the driving force of our society, then self improvement, on a large scale, is impossible. We have more then 30 <em>centuries</em> (3,000 years) of examples to support this.</p>

<p>About 30,000 (give or take a few thousand) years ago the people of Earth were tampered with genetically. Prior to this we were the utopian type of race you are pining for. After this we turned into the evil, selfish war mongering society we have today. Money, in and of itself, is not evil. It is the <em>lust and greed</em> for money that is the evil. Some people think they are better than others and they further think that because of this they are <em>entitled</em> to more. Hence, the utopian dream you describe is just that - utopian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To the OP: Your mission statement is all very well and good. However, the general population, and by extension most of this sub, need the vehicle of divisive topics for the same reason they need religion. They need something to believe and something to belong to. This is why a poster get heavily down voted if the poster strays from the accepted narrative - regardless of truth. The majority of this sub don&#39;t want truth, they want to told they are right - corroboration. Tell them, with hard proof, that they are wrong and you get down voted. That is why politics is a natural here. In conclusion, your intentions are laudable but futile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, spot on.  I have had lengthy discussions with people, presented irrefutable evidence that their political alignment is bullshit, and hijacked by interests that care nothing about them.</p>

<p>In the end one of the most stubborn finally broke down and told me, &quot;I need SOMETHING to believe in.  If this is all bullshit then where the f do I go from here?  No where.  It&#39;s all just corrupted, and chaotic, and I can&#39;t handle that.&quot;</p>

<p>I respected him for at least admitting the truth, but found it a bit sad that he knew the truth deep down, and wasn&#39;t able to tear down false foundational beliefs.  </p>

<p>In the end choosing a party simply gives you someone to blame that isn&#39;t the real problem.  It&#39;s a defense mechanism for the system, and the real puppet masters IMO.  Unfortunately it works quite well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder what makes people this way in general. The fact that they need to belong to something. It&#39;s probably because we&#39;re tribal as a species.
