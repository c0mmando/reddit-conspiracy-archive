        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I  had a big set of run ins with moderators from the R/beer subreddit. well  i decided to post a TIFU for getting banned and being trolled by the moderators, but  it kept getting removed from the tifu site as well and i was told i cant use actual mods names or communications????</p>

<p>Why are they so secretive, why do they all band together, how many people are being treated like crap by mods and have banded together to keep anyone from talking about it?</p>

<p>Here below is a copy of the actual post on tifu before it was taken down and i was banned there as well.  Have you been banned and have a story to tell? dont hide it. </p>

<p>heres the full original post</p>

<p>So last night there was a post in the r/beer subreddit ( im a craft beer nut) abiut a brewery that posted a set of boobs with a tight sweater on them fastened in the middle by a button on twitter and the caption about it being the strongest button competition contestant.</p>

<p>Well Feminists went nuts over it evidently on twitter, calling it misogyny etc.
Well a male person posted this clip and went off on the brewery. About how shameful it was etc.</p>

<p>So one person posted that he didnt think it was that big of a deal, And the OP of that post went after him with all sort of backhanded reference to the guy being not normal etc.</p>

<p>And wanting to &quot;understand his type of person&quot;, etc. He kept using &quot;so you&#39;re saying&quot; followed by things the person never even came close to saying.</p>

<p>Well i had seen this person before do this as he has an agenda. SO in wanting to find out where he is coming from in his obvious SJW agenda, i ask if he was a Homsexual.</p>

<p>Just like that nice and polite, as i had dealt with other people who were homosexuals who would attack any male related industry.</p>

<p>Note* i did not use gay, nor any slang term or slur.</p>

<p>The OP posted back that he wasnt offended as there is nothing bad about being asked if youre a homosexual.
Well i woke up this morning to the message &quot; you have been banned from r/beer - signed Mod- LaurenEP
Well i immediately wrote to her to find out what i did to get banned.</p>

<p>I got responses like</p>

<p>SO i sent her back some texts calling her the thought police and part of the new nazi movement as she is silencing anyone who says something she doesnt like, regardless of its intent.
It went on for awhile and got gems like this</p>

<p>So i aksed for the names on the other mods so i could email them as she obviously wasnt cut out to be a level headed Moderator.</p>

<p>I then received this one.</p>

<p><a href="/u/hexxman007">/u/hexxman007</a>, the other moderators just wanted you to know that we (the beer mods) as a show of solidarity support your ban and regret that we can only ban you once. Cheers.</p>

<p>Which makes sense, i knew they would stick together and none of them had the balls to actually look at the situation objectively.</p>

<p>SO i decided to create my own beer subreddit, where people would be able to post ANYTHING beer related and say anything they wanted to about beer without fear of being silenced or banned. I called it R.beerfreedom and yes its up and i posted on the new subreddit promo page, along with asking for mods for the page for anyone to PM me.
Yes you guessed it the mods from R/beer all took this as a good time to troll me, including the Ever fun loving Lauren EP</p>

<p>I have a pretty lengthy reddit resume and would love to help moderate. I understand you are looking for mods, may I help?</p>

<p>Now i knew this was just stupid, but they started asking me about myself, what my interests wer etc. and the ever fun lvoing Lauren stated she knew all about me and what im doing with my life.
I informed her she did not know me, that i started playing guitar about a year and a half ago etc, well they decided to pick on the things i liked and asked me about my music and my guitars and for awhile i was enjoying the conversation and even mentioned i played out in my first gig last sunday.
Well one of the mods started asking about the band, I had even showed a picture of one of my guitars that had a bit of my wifes arm in the picture. Only to get,</p>

<p>you gotta any recordings of the band? i bet you guys are sick as shit</p>

<p>Finally after a good hour of back and forth with 3 or 4 mods, I realized the whole thing was just them trolling me.
So bad enough i got banned from my favorite subreddit, I fell for being trolled by Mods.</p>

<p>The good news is i had previously been contacted by a freelance reporter about a sub i created called redditbans. at the time i though it might be cool to have a sub where people could tell the stories about being banned from subs. (prophetic i know)</p>

<p>The reporter wanted to know if i had any stories with screenshots of actual stories of mods acting childish and insulting etc. Well i emailed him today and he is happy about this and is working on an online article about moderators and administrators on internet sites and boards acting badly.
The Mods even trolled me about this when i told them.</p>

<p>So TIFU by getting banned fom my favorite subreddit and STILL getting trolled by mods. as you see below.
Oh and they are even looking forward to seeing this post, as ive let them know it will be put up.</p>

<p>If you want us to unban you, why are you saying we can&#39;t? Just make us a deal that&#39;s worth our while.
What about, we unban you and you make us all mods on r/beerfreedom?
So TIFU by getting banned from my favorite subreddit and STILL getting trolled by mods. TL;DR.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Why come to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to whine like a little baby that you were banned from some other sub? You obviously pissed off the mod and/or a user or two. Before you respond with your version of some indignant rant about how hard done by you are, remember that the mods make the rules and <em>you</em> must obey them. Period! If you don&#39;t, you get banned. Don&#39;t cry here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and think you will get &quot;justice&quot;. It doesn&#39;t work that way. Deal with it and quit whining.</p>

<p>Yes, you <em>are</em>. It doesn&#39;t require Sherlock Holmes to see this.</p>

<p>Clearly you are in the minority on this. Someone disagrees. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>asking someone politely if they are a homosexual should not get you banned.</p>

<p>Yes, it <em>should</em> That is none of your business - ever. And it has <em>nothing</em> to do with <em>anything</em> that could possibly be said on Reddit. This is not a hate site or a dating site. Therefore asking someone if they are a Homosexual <em>is</em> a banning offense.</p>

<p>What I think about how the human race was treated 30,000 years ago is irrelevant. Citing that statement is just your way of showing how immature you are. This isn&#39;t a school yard. What you really need to do is to contact the site master Administrator and work things out with them - not complain like a little child here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

<p>If I asked most people what they thought the best part about Trump&#39;s SOTU speech what would they say? Probably something like &quot;He&#39;s a dumbass it probably sucked&quot;. The reality is that it was a call to unity an offer to meet in the middle something that the people claiming &quot;facism and racism&quot; are ignoring in there false sense of outrage that is all costructed through the wording the media provides (Don&#39;t believe me find 10 positively worded Trump articles not labeled as &quot;right wing propaganda&quot; and I&#39;ll find you 300 &quot;apocolyptic Doomsday&quot; predictions about him). </p>

<p>You choose your reality through your response to what goes on. Ask yourself this has more hatred ever created peace?</p>

<p>You can stick your head in the sand and deny what I am saying by calling me names like these mods did to OP or make up strawman or deflect all you want. But ultimately it&#39;s easier to fool someone than it is to show them they have been fooled. One day soon you will see what I mean but until then good luck to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reeeeddit originally did not have mods. AND the very first post on this site was a conspiracy post. How far it&#39;s fallen.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/309fuf/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver30/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/309fuf/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver30/</a></p>

<p>And yes. Most mods here have power across hundreds of unrelated subreddits. And they all communicate in private slack channels and private subreddits.</p>

<p>Most of them are punk ass twits who get off on the tiny amount of power they have. I&#39;m certain many of them are corporate or even state controlled through either account selling or receiving some kind of compensation. </p>

<p>There have been quite a few leaks about such things happening over the years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, so attempted doxxing and blatant blackmail/extortion.</p>

<p>They should give out free jackboots and swastikas arm bands on r/beerfreedom...</p>

<p>Do they not realize that why they have done is a 1000% worse than anything you did? Don&#39;t let it get to you. Narcissists like that tend to band together until they rip each other apart from the inside cause all of them feel as though they hold moral high ground. When in fact they just set the bar for malicious behavior..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of the mods of major subs are massive SJWs.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a combination of factors:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The thought policing mindset of SJWs lend themselves to be mods.</p></li>
<li><p>SA goons worked hard to infiltrate mod positions in reddit and wikipedia</p></li>
<li><p>JIDF, did the same thing goons did.</p></li>
<li><p>Admins side with SJWs in disputes and show a clear bias when enforcing site wide rules, this allows SJWs to take over.</p></li>
<li><p>Once in control SJWs always purge moderates as well as moderates cementing their control.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>It probably should be said that OP here has been by far the most argumentative and most reported user we had on the sub. What OP fails to realize is that this isn&#39;t an isolated incident, but a patter of behavior that lead to him getting banned. I hadn&#39;t been on reddit much the past couple days so when I came back to see a lengthy ban thread in modmail I saw the user and said to myself &quot;good&quot; before reading anything about the drama.</p>
