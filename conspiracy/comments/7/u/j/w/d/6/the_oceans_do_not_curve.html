       Wanna be Bill Nye the Science Guy? Let's do some science. Put on your funny lab coat(for authenticity) and let us begin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Experiment A:
Pour water in your cup. Observe how it behaves. Finds its 'level', correct? Takes the shape of the container. Cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Experiment B:
Pour water in your bathtub. Let it fill to the top. Observe how it behaves. Finds its 'level', correct? Takes the shape of the container. Cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Experiment C:
Pour water in your pool. Let it fill to the top. Observe how it behaves. Finds its 'level', correct? Takes the shape of the container. Cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Experiment D:
Go out and find yourself a pond. Observe how water behaves. Finds its 'level', correct? Takes the shape of the container. Cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Experiment E:
Go out and find yourself a lake. Observe how water behaves. Finds its 'level', correct? Takes the shape of the container. Cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of Flat on lake, confirming the above experiments:
      </p>
      <p>
       1)
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/XS6AaSL.jpg">
        Chicago Skyline
       </a>
       across the lake. Notice how buildings appear 90 degree straight up from ground. Brace yourselves for millions of complex theories or
       <em>
        metabunks
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       2)
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal">
        Suez Canal
       </a>
       and notice how it connects 2 major bodies of water with no evidence of curvature. Brace yourselves for millions of complex theories or
       <em>
        metabunks
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Experiment F:
Go out and find yourself an ocean. Observe how water behaves. Finds its 'level', once again, as expected, confirming the above, correct? NOOOOOO...it

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. I do not support the petri dish flat earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT1: I do not intend to insult anyone. For those being respectful: I respect you and I appreciate your effort and excellent character.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT2: I love when people claim they are something but do not present the evidence to support their claim (i.e. believe me, I'm an _______ , and I know what I'm talking about!
       <em>
        Parrot the mainstream
       </em>
       ... so is that not enough proof for you, stupid?!).
      </p>
      <p>
       Reality happens! Just because things fall to the earth, it does not imply that your theory (gravity) is the reason. It is your interpretation of facts and your model that I refuse to accept. It's 2018...your technology (advances exponentially, right?) should have left us without a shadow of a doubt about the shape/size of our home. The burden of proof is on you and your team with 50+ million a day budget. They fail you, and they lie time and time again, yet you're mad at me for questioning/doubting?

       How are you doing your "observations" exactly? Can you look at a table top or shelf and tell me with just your eyes if its perfectly level or not? You might want to use a level or something.... in the case of the ocean you are going to need a really long level.

      <p>
       1) There exists loons on both sides of the field. Have you heard some of the loons on your side? 
2) FE people do not all belong to one group. Some believe in petri dish dome or ice ring...some believe it is square...others do not assume a new model but simply reject the current model of NASA globe.
2) Just because you increase the size of the container, water will change its expected behavior? How do you call this 'Science'?

       Call it mental suicide or blind faith...or religion. That would be more honest. Cult of The Curve.

       Ok so how about compare it this way....
Put a micro organism 1000 times smaller than the tip of a needle - place that organism on a basketball.
      </p>
      <p>
       From that organisms perspective he will think the baskeball is flat because as far as he can possibly move in a day he never sees the curve.

       You are the tiny organism. Earth is the basketball

       I'm ex navy and now I work in aerospace for a gov contractor. Firing solutions, navigation, and in the past TBS radio coms all depend on accounting for the curvature of the earth. Yes I have seen people try to debunk this, but unless myself and everyone involved in any  use of these systems aboard every ship since before WWI has been the victim of the most elaborate ruse in the history of the world then earth is a globe. Its mathematically/scientifically provable beyond the shadow of doubt. Please note I am talking about actual math and science not your armchair "but muh eyes say this" science doesn't work like that.

       Do you see the issue here?

       Its pretty clear that what you are seeing isnt reflective of what the building looks like. Youre missing a lot of that building, also notice how "squat" it looks.

       This is indicative of refraction.  We can show it here with this image

       See this is the problem in engaging with FE people you hit the nail on the head right there. It doesn't matter what you say, what evidence you give them they will just ignore your points or call them fabricated. I said this in another flat earth thread a week ago. Even if I could bring an FE'er into space and show them the fucking globe they would say something like I hacked into their brain or put mini tv screens in their eyes. Its exhausting.

       I'm not afraid of updating and re-evaluating my perspective and point of view. I have been a photographer for quite some time now and I have conducted my own experiments and taken photographs that debunk a curve. It was my start into this idea. I use YouTube like anyone else; however, with caution. My reaction is a normal reaction to insults and arrogance.

       You can do this experiment on your own if you fly, or even driving. A mechanical gyroscope will maintain it's horizon level orientation regardless of how far you go. If we were dipping over a curve the gyroscope will show since it's designed to show off axis movement.

       What do you mean that when you drive you're following the curve of the earth? Are you saying because of the spin we keep in relatively the same space? 8 inches per mile squared is not too big for us to observe. And what does speed have to do with the curve?

       Massive bodies have their own gravity and smaller objects within a certain sphere of influence would have their orientation to where “down” would be towards the center of gravity unless their mass exceeds some point (dont know the exact term).  Thus the car follows the curvature... cars don’t sink on solid ground..
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that a gyroscope and traveling around earth would prove or disprove something is inherently illogical.   Comparing the relative orientation of a gyroscope (while rotating) against a significantly larger body would only work if you are able to travel around the larger body at a pace that exceeds the gyroscopes ability to “right” itself.   You would have to continuously spin the gyroscope for the duration of travel, which would require the gyroscope to be in a fixed position and would cause the inertia of the spinning mass to rotate with the vehicle because you don’t travel fast enough and the forces acting on the fixed position gyroscope through the vehicle would exceed the gyroscope’s inertia.  The link below presents a far better explanation than I do, see the third comment “Alignment of Gyroscope”.
      </p>
      <p>
       More on the gyroscope:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This also doesn’t account for the fact that a plane flies through turbulent air, typically flies with an upward angle of attack (couple of degrees), thrust, drag, etc...  cars experience similar forces when traveling.

       Circumference of Earth is 24900 miles... to have a single degree of curvature would require 69.16 miles.  Thus to observe the curvature you’d need to be able to see a large expanse of uninterrupted horizon to even attempt to prove/disprove curvature.

       Also the phrase 8 inches per mile squared is just laugh worthy on its own.  8 inches of distance per an area that is of a mile in size.  That could be any number of combinations that calculate out to 1 mile squared.   Thus it’s an unfounded term of measurement and can’t be used.

       My counter argument with 
Fire a gun (sniper rifles have had studied done, go use google or bing or whatever) in the direction of the rotation of the Earth  and the bullet will not travel as far as it would if you fired in the opposite direction of rotation.   The Earth’s rotation also affects the travel left/right when firing in directions that are not in parallel with rotation.

       Wind is created by heat transfer on a huge scale.
Small scale example, open a car door on a warm windless summer day, the heat within the car will still “spread” outwards until an equilibrium condition is met.

       I would take the Flat Earth theory more seriously if the people who were spouting out all their “facts” could back them up and actually use proven scientific facts to substantiate their claims, but instead I see crap like this where the OP boldly states his opinion and flaunts it as facts

       A mechanical gyroscope for the artificial horizon has no electronics for adjusting to "gravity". The artificial horizon is sensitive to every dip and climb the aircraft will perform and maintain the level regardless of the orientation of the aircraft, which is why it works. Gravity has no explanation in modern science it is introduced as some sort of magical inward motion of mass even tho electromagnetic forces defy it and makes more sense. Please explain to me how mass cause objects to pull towards it? I'll wait.

       Please provide sources... because right now you’re talking out of your ass.  You make a statement that you yourself can not prove yet the effects of gravity are evident..
      </p>

       You also didn’t bother to address my other comments because you know it disproves your narrative..

       Gravity is caused by a difference in masses.  A larger mass will attract a smaller mass.   Mass is the amount of matter within an object.   It’s been observed in space, see link below.

       Electromagnetic forces “defy” gravity by supplying an opposite force on the object.  If it truly defied gravity the object would no longer be affected by gravity and would just float off....   as soon as the electromagnetic field is left or is removed, the object that was floating falls towards the center of gravity of Earth.  And not to forget about simple physics... magnetic objects can be affected my electromagnetic forces, however non-magnetic forces would not.

       A horizontal gyroscope doesn't keep level to itself though, it keeps level perpendicular to the direction in which gravity pulls it. As you drive or fly, it will continue to keep a horizontal level, because the force of gravity is pulling straight done towards the earth below you.

       The earth is flat...I love how this sub will talk about lizard people and all kinds of far out topics but if you mention flat earth they immediately declare that it's bs. It's really easy to verify there's no curve. The picture OP posted is a great example. Get a good zoom lens and test it for yourself.  The curve is supposed to be 8 inches per mile squared. It's not there. It's flat.

       The difference between FE and all the examples you just gave (outrageous as they are) is that FE is actually disprovable and has been disproved many times in many ways. You cant really prove something
       <em>
        doesn't
       </em>
       exist like god, lizard people, or bigfoot can you? So things like that are actually fun to indulge even if far fetched. I would also argue that lizard people and the like are not really the focus of this sub and brought up far less (lately at least) than FE nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I saw a FE post once a week I honestly wouldn't care. Its become multiple times per day though and it always goes exactly the same way. Bunch of BS "experiments" done by know nothing people and posta of the same tired youtube videos with laughable arguments a child could reason past. Its boring and basically spam on this sub.

       On of the main things FE supporters claim is that Antarctica is actually an ice wall, and "normal people" can't go there. I know for a fact this is false. My sister has been to Antarctica, one of my relatives was the co-pilot in the Erebus disaster, and died there. Lots of New Zealanders have been involved with Antarctica in one way or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I guess evidence people can see with their own eyes only counts if it supports FE right?

       We can "go there" on limited tours. You're not allowed to
       <em>
        roam freely
       </em>
       , you get on a cruiseship (from either South America, Africa or Australia/NZ), you land at an icy land mass and look at coastal features for some minutes/hours and then go back to your cruiseship.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's militairy presence at Antarctica and there's tight security. Now you can argue: "it's because it's cold, because of insurance/risk policy, ppl could die, ..." which makes some sense, but that doesn't change the
       <strong>
        fact
       </strong>
       you're not allowed to freely roam Antarctica.
      </p>
      <p>
       Antarctica exists, there's known bases (McMurdo, ...), noone is disputing that. Sure people die/died there, none's disputing that either.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter if it supports FE or not, what matters is facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing with your eyes Antarctica (an ice mass
       <em>
        South
       </em>
       of every continent) exists doesn't prove the Earth is a ball. Nor does it prove a flat Earth. All it proves Antarctica exists, and noone here is disputing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how U can equate your sisting seeing Antarctica with her own eyes to flat Earth being bullshit...

         So the circumference of the Earth is 24,901 miles.  When picturing the horizon, you're thus alienating a two dimensional section that equates to a circle of equal circumference.  With 360 degrees in a circle, wouldn't that mean that you would need to use a horizon photo that covers 70 miles to show even 1 degree of curvature?  If so, then what is your 20 mile photo going to show, and a downward angle at that?

         the Suez canal doesn't curve?  I mean it would curve less than 2 degrees if my previous math is right, but how do we know it doesn't do that?  Has anyone provided a 120-mile-long rigid plank to see if it rests gently at points of equal altitude at both ends of the canal?

       Have you ever gotten in a car and drove East or wesT for several hours? Compare the time that the sun appears on the horizon to when it rose from your home. It is different. Why? Because the earth is round and the sun rises and different times due to the curve. So, are you saying the earth is a  curved flat surface or are you saying you have never driven a great distance?

       the earth is 85,345,714,285,714,285,714,286 times the size of a person. Take a ball and zoom in on the surface by 85,345,714,285,714,285,714,286 times then look at the horizon of that ball.

       If you are an honest, observant, detail oriented human being, you would download that video and import it into premiere pro or your favorite video editing software and play it frame by frame starting frame starting at 0:07 seconds. Notice how the curve changes over time (very fishy in my humble opinion). Also, let us ASSUME that this video shows us the actual curve of our planet at 0:08 seconds...what would happen if you panned the camera 45 degrees left or right from that same perspective....is your planet a McDonalds sign or some type of serpent sine wave?? lol Is that realistic? This video, to me, only proves that they are continuously lying and are afraid of ditching the fisheye lens; space X, NASA, JAXA, etc. Why????

       I didn't say they were actors. I said they are paid, just like actors are paid...to do a job. The only difference is, they believe it to be true and real, whereas actors know the reality of the situation (actually, some actors get caught up: look up

       ). Thumbnails is all these great engineers needed for confirmation of this great engineering task???!! How fast is the speed of light? How far is Mars? Why does it take forever to get a signal on earth near mountains, while they get immediate message from a hostile and far away environment such as Mars? What in the world....

       Yep.  We aren't on a spinning wet ball rocketing through "outer space."  Modern scientism has caused humanity to abandon their common sense in favor of mathematical constructs based on faulty assumptions and unproven theories.

       You can do this experiment on your own if you fly, or even driving. A mechanical gyroscope will maintain it's horizon level orientation regardless of how far you go. If we were dipping over a curve the gyroscope will show since it's designed to show off axis movement.

       The difference between FE and all the examples you just gave (outrageous as they are) is that FE is actually disprovable and has been disproved many times in many ways. You cant really prove something
       <em>
        doesn't
       </em>
       exist like god, lizard people, or bigfoot can you? So things like that are actually fun to indulge even if far fetched. I would also argue that lizard people and the like are not really the focus of this sub and brought up far less (lately at least) than FE nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I saw a FE post once a week I honestly wouldn't care. Its become multiple times per day though and it always goes exactly the same way. Bunch of BS "experiments" done by know nothing people and posta of the same tired youtube videos with laughable arguments a child could reason past. Its boring and basically spam on this sub.
