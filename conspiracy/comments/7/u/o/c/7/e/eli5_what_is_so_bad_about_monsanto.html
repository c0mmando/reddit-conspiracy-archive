       It's hard to sum up a corporate monster like Monsanto.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're trying to corner the world food supply with genetically modified seeds that won't reproduce, and which are bred to withstand large scale applications of petro-chemical herbicides.

       There's more, but those are the bottom line dangers.

       That case is
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowman_v._Monsanto_Co.">
        Bowman v Monsanto
       </a>
       . Bowman claimed the patent doesn't apply to him since he never agreed to the original seed contract by purchasing the seeds secondhand (meant for feed). The courts ruled that intellectual property protections (in this case the patent) still applies despite being a secondhand purchase. Bowman was hoping to get the Roundup Ready trait for free and lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       A analogous case would be buying a secondhand copy of Microsoft Office, making 1000 copies, then claiming the copyright doesn't apply since you never agreed to the original EULA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nope, Bowman thought he could skirt patent protection using the first sale doctrine and lost.

       Building on your points, I'll give it a shot:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The plants that come from their seeds don't reproduce on their own, thus subverting the ultimate drive of life itself to secure exclusive profit.
       </li>
       <li>
        They use their power to gain market share. They sue farmers who do not pay for their seeds, using high-powered courtroom gymnastics on vague and unverifiable grounds.
       </li>
       <li>
        They are ruthlessly monopolistic and either crush new competitors through similar means, or simply buy them out.
       </li>
       <li>
        As stated, their crops require regular treatment of petro-chemical herbicides and insecticides. Let this statement sink in: "Industrial agriculture of this nature causes us to, at minimum, bi-annually blanket the most fertile ground of our country
        <em>
         in poison
        </em>
        ." The harm yearly visited upon unfortunate residents of the "breadbasket of America" is incalculable. Residents include plants, animals, insects, humans, pets. Every living thing not specifically engineered to resist is harmed.
       </li>
       <li>
        The potential for this company to do good is astronomical, were they to loosen the iron-grip of the control methods stated above. Genetic engineering, as with any tool, can be used for good or evil.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       TLDR: This company could end world hunger, but they choose short-sighted, selfish profit. This company causes, encourages, and
       <em>
        demands
       </em>
       regular and incalculable devastation of nature for short-sighted, selfish profit.

       im not disagreeing with any of your information, only the conclusions you draw from it. its not money these people are after. honestly sit down for a minute and think about what solving world hunger means? more people. monsanto would have every economic incentive in the world to do it, they wouldnt even have to be altruistically motivated. they want control. think about all the upside to literally being a world wide hero, and yet they do all the bullshit you listed instead. they just want control.

       Considering I had already posted several links confirming you were exactly who I thought you were, I don't think I am conflating you with anyone else. I am especially sure now because I remember your idiotic obsession with calling people who disagree with your anti-GMO views anti-vaxxers despite the fact that despite the fact the anti-GMO movement and the Anti-Vaccine movement
       <a href="https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/are-anti-gmo-and-anti-vaccine-movements-merging">

        fact that many Anti-GMO groups are also Anti-Vaccine.
       </a>
       .
      </p>

       I understand that calling someone an anti-vaxxer is just a defence mechanism for you, but you are way off the mark.

       I think you have a serious problem with deflection.  I call you an anti-vaxxer because you seem to fit all the aspects of being a conspiratorial nutjob - deflection, calls to absurdity, doubling down on your ignorance, coupled with finding needless ways to insult anyone and anything that disagrees with you.

       Funny thing about this, is that I do have a couple dead alts. Every 4-6 months I ditch my old account and create a new one so nutters like you can't doxx me. So when I read this post, I thought "Oh congrats to him, he found one of my old, never in use accounts." and then I clicked your link...

        That wasn't even one of them

       It's funny, most people go with the shill gambit (

       ) when they lose arguments, but you are one of the few that goes with the "You're insane" argument in which you just make up a bunch accusations and call the user who proved you wrong crazy. This isn't the first time you've done it. Let's look at some examples:

       And that is just a sampling. I couldn't believe how easy it was to find examples. It really is your go to approach. Once proved wrong, you accuse your opponent of being a shill. When that fails, you accuse them of being crazy, insane etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's face it, your persecution complex is so strong you'll never see this, let alone admit to it. You will just continue in your concocted reality in which everyone who disagrees with you is either a shill or mentally deranged. And that is sad, but I am afraid there isn't much I can do to help you beyond pointing it out and hoping some day you come to your senses.

       To be honest you're right, i've just been hoping you were dangerous-to-society levels of insane because anyone of sane mind who actually spends day in and day out making this their very raison d'etre either must have quite a few screws loose, no life at all, or has serious mental illnesses that will manifest themselves sooner rather than later.

       Quite frankly your inability or just plain refusal to see this, whether it comes from loss potentialities, childhood trauma, abuse, drug use, alcoholism, is frightening at best.  But it's your life, your neuroses and childhood trauma.  Who am I to tell you how to best alleviate that?  I told you multiple times to get serious, professional help for dealing with your problems.  While your cognitive dissonance may not allow you to fully see the full severity of your mental illness it's not for yourself you need to get help, but for those around you you will inevitably be harming at best or god knows at worst.

       When you only post negatives about pesticides with which a GMO is designed to be primarily used with, yet have not said a word about the hundreds of other pesticides that are more harmful than glyphosate that are used on conventional and organic crops, your intentions become crystal clear. Where are your articles complaining about those products? Why just the ones associated with GMO's?

       No it isn't. It is clear you will forever fail to understand this but once again:
      </p>
      <p>
       You are only attacking companies that make GMO's and products that are used in conjunction with GMO's. 
To continue with your McDonald's analogy, it would be like saying you are against fast food restaurants but only going after Burger joints and not criticizing Subway or other fast food establishments. You are clearly against Burgers, and not fast food establishments.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how you behave with GMO's. You claim to only be against Monsanto and Glyphosate, but you don't criticize any of the other companies that produce far more harmful pesticides and you don't criticize these harmful pesticides...unless they are associated with GMO's. This is perfectly illustrated by your posts criticizing Dicamba, a pesticide you probably didn't even know existed until it became associated with GMO's.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, my words are likely to fly over your head, as it is clear you don't even understand how you've been manipulated to attack GMO's by pro-organic interests. Like I said before:

       Oh man dude, how many times do I and every other user on Reddit need to tell you that Anti-Monsanto =/= Anti-GMOs. Are they the only company making them? Did I miss the memo?

      <p>
       The hilarious thing is all you're doing is creating the opposite effect.  Since I know you spent days defending yourself in the Monsanto Shill thread, you of all people (if you can read) would know that creating this false equivalency and ramming it down people's throats just pushes them towards the other side.

       You forgot to clarify that Montsanto did not invent it, but they did produce ddt and Agent Orange. If I'm not mistaken both of these chemical agents have been used by Monsanto as part of crop management back I  the old days as well as the basis from which to create new weed killers.

       Right. Corporations over people's lives. Nestle is taking our water, and we need it. That's the point. They created the market. Bottling water in single use plastic and selling it to residents because wells are adversely effected by multinational corporations over extraction. Jfc there's enough woke people, we gotta come together. We all need clean water.

       I don't think they're nearly as bad as they're made out to be. Many of the most "shocking" stories about them are entirely made up. For example, that they sue farmers who have monsanto seed accidentally blow onto their crops. This has literally never happened. The myth appears to stem from a case where a farmer was worried that Monsanto MIGHT sue him if that happened, so he brought pre-emptive suit, which was thrown out and in which Monsanto said they had no plans to do that (and they never have).

       Yeah, I've been more interested in interacting with the new SS rule. It's made the sub a lot better, IMO. Anyway, I didn't say Monsanto wasn't bad. I said that some of the stuff that people bring up about them is not true. Am I wrong about the suing thing? If so, I'm happy to admit it.

       Sure, and I followed it up with an example. I don't think they're good, I just don't think they're as bad as people make them out to be because people use blatantly false things to make them out to be bad in specific ways. It's possible to make them look bad without resorting to lies.

       They are gaining enormous control of all food production, centralizing power to a easily corruptible place,  though many feel it's corrupted already.
      </p>

       Not  to mention, ongoing negligence and lack of accountability for sweeping chemical and agricultural developments that have made major negative impacts on people and the environment. From effects of chemicals developed for the use of Agent Orange, to what many believe has contributed to the falling Bee population.

       Many people are worried because of the sheer size of Monsanto. They have dominated the food chain in the US by using genetically altered seeds. They are also  moving into other agricultural sectors.
      </p>
      <p>
       In some ways, this has been very helpful. Farm output has improved with keeps prices generally low. However, studies and evidence on the ground suggests the altered seeds and associated chemicals used in the process might be harmful to people and the environment.

       Are they at monopoly level?  Trump's cut in regulations-- will this increase the risk of harm towards humanity?  (Trumper here.  But I like a medium ammount of regulation, been digging into the deregulations lately, and not finding any decent journalism on it. Democrats can serve a vital role in our democracy by analysing the potential harm from deregulating too far).

       Monsanto has upwards of 20,000 employees and is one of the four companies that control 80% of the seed market. So you could certainly make a case that they are a monopoly. In addition, there is a huge merger in the works with Bayer Corp that Trump and the European Union are reviewing now. So the company stands to grow much larger pending the outcome of that review.

glyphosate is sprayed at schools and in cities all over the US in addition to its use in agriculture.  they know it isnt safe but lie

       OK, so I have been in the trenches for a while against them. u/minorwhite if you are interested. All of these guys are continually lying about their own aggressive behavior towards farmers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every single one of them says that "no farmer has ever been sued for accidental cross contamination".  This is merely a technicality. I challenge anyone to open a lawsuit under that terminology. Due to a probably less than competent lawyer they won the case in the appeals court on this particular matter. Monsanto has and continues to sue the hell out of farmers for patent infringement.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the argument with the Circuit Court, Judge Kimberly A. Moore
calls them out for being and I quote here "extremely litigious".

       This entry explains why, and how much Monsanto stood to make. They even lifted pages from Monsanto's own website showing them displaying their efforts to other investors, including facts and figures on how much they could expect to get from various states farmers.

       As a sidenote, I am retired, and have decided to devote a significant amount of my time to refute this statement on reddit. I am not being paid by anyone to do this and no thank you, but I really don't want any. Anyways, this has really not come quickly as I am not a professional researcher, but the evidence does quite simply show that the issue is at the very least a much more significant issue. I would never blame another redditor for not pursuing all of this evidence and staying on them for as long as I have. Every single bit of evidence I have loudly proclaims these guys are being paid for their time on reddit. No one, and I do mean no one would do this much Monsanto defending without being paid for it. I have only chose this single issue out of hundreds of issues that Monsanto has been involved in, and I am quite busy. These guys are always on it, day in day out.

       Are they at monopoly level?  Trump's cut in regulations-- will this increase the risk of harm towards humanity?  (Trumper here.  But I like a medium ammount of regulation, been digging into the deregulations lately, and not finding any decent journalism on it. Democrats can serve a vital role in our democracy by analysing the potential harm from deregulating too far).

       So now not only are you insane but you are also a child. Clutching at straws and making up nonsense about crushing arguments.  I'm the one with the persecution complex now?  Crazy, cognitive dissonance, ignorance, spite and delusion all in one. I hate to repeat myself here but for the sake of the rest of us please. get. help.

       Glyphosate. Monsanto. Do you even speak English? The argument you're making is that if someone hates McDonald's they also hate French Fries. It's utter bollocks and you know it.

        I deflected nothing. I carefully explained how your behaviour is anti-GMO despite on the surface appearing to be only Anti-Monsanto and Anti-Glyphosate. I suspect the problem here is you don't even have the self awareness to understand that you are doing exactly what the Anti-GMO companies want you to do. Poor little lemming, doing their bidding without even understanding it.
