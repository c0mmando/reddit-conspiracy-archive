<p>I was reading posts in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> earlier when I noticed someone had posted the exact comment in multiple threads. Not entirely unusual but when I checked the users history I was blown away. Not only by the amount of times the user posted the same comment, but also the amount of time between posts. I&#39;m not certain, but doesn&#39;t that community limit users to one post every 10 min?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure what to make of it, probably a bot, but it&#39;s infuriating to see what Reddit is becoming. </p>

<p>Funny thing is that shit hole permanently banned me for &#39;spamming&#39;.

<p>Nobody cared the first time I posted it, so I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth trying. You can show people quotes like this of journalists conspiring in secret to either protect or hurt one side of politics, and most people just don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>These are journalists from NYT, WaPo, all of the usual suspects, and 99% of them are still working to this day, but most people will ignore it. If it&#39;s not damaging to Trump, they don&#39;t want to hear about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, this OP is a legitimate user with a voice and an opinion and has been &quot;timed out&quot; because they have gotten too many downvotes. That really means they don&#39;t want unpopular opinions or ideas being expressed, right?</p>

<p>Couple that with evidence of the confirmed shilling that has been supported in that sub, along with the botting (don&#39;t forget downvote bots and red-tag targetting,)- that leads me to believe that that sub is absolutely designed to extinguish any comment or post that goes against an accepted narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to put a time limit on people who can&#39;t reach a karma threshold. I understand why it exists, as a measure to prevent brigading or trolling from users that are not part of the community and as a measure to slow down outside spam but I think that if you participate in a sub for long enough, even if you get a lot of downvotes, you should not be limited in the amount of posts you can make. If you think about it, if someone is already getting downvotes all the time, then allowing them to post more often really isn&#39;t going to change anything and if they really are a spammer/troll/etc. then they can be banned from the sub by a mod.</p>

<p>There are a lot of rules reddit has that I don&#39;t like but overall you have to consider the fact that each sub works like it&#39;s own community and subject to the rules of those communities. While there are subs that seem like they should be neutral they&#39;re still modded by people who have their own agendas like any other sub.</p>
