       This is the full quote that was said. This is implying something and I don't mean his stupidity - I mean they are

       this may be the most hamfisted foreshadowing we've seen yet.  not your post - just this thing, right.  it really, really has a "hey look at me i'm actually this dumb, really, i really am" kinda vibe about it.  should be interesting.

        He's speaking of false flags

         I want a false flag event to occur that will allow me to rally the nation together.

         I'm gonna state the obvious and say that it's hard to pull a divided nation together without some catastrophic event that naturally pulls people together, but state it in a hamfisted way.

       First, he's not nearly stupid.
Second, without some sense of civic duty, I doubt he would have gotten into politics where he has become the most hated person in the country.
Third, there's a bridge somewhere missing it's troll, you better get back where you belong.

       Bush Jr. isn't stupid. He had these verbal brain farts that were hilarious and made him look dumb, but those around him have said he was pretty shrewd behind the scenes. Bad president and surrounded himself with the wrong people, yes, but not stupid. This isn't to say he's a genius or anything, but far from mentally impaired.

       Earlier tonight, just after the SOTU, I checked
       <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?ex_cid=rrpromo">
        Trump's approval rating compared to previous presidents in their first year in office
       </a>
       . What happened to George W. Bush's approval rating in September 2001 is pretty striking. That in combination with this line gives me chills.

       I feel like people today are more awake to the possibilities of false flag terrorism today and we're not scared by terrorism like we were decades ago. If 9/11 happened today, the media would probably treat it like they did the Las Vegas massacre: rapid cover-up followed by near complete ignoring of everything having to do with the event. They'd have a much harder time justifying a push for war like they did with 9/11 today. Hell, ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack in Vegas, but I saw NO ONE anywhere pointing to that fact as an excuse to justify ramping up war against ISIS. Yeah, more people were killed on 9/11, but it's still something. They had the opportunity to use this terrorist attack to justify pushing for things like gun control or more war, and they didn't.

       I agree we're generally speaking more aware and tend to question what we're told more, but I don't know if this makes any difference. Just feels we have become a very cynical society but too lazy to try and change anything.

       I just laid out a difference with a specific example. When 9/11 happened and a few thousand Americans were killed, they used that mysterious terrorism to justify invading multiple countries we're still currently occupying nearly 20 years later. When Las Vegas happened, they didn't use it. At all. Not to push for more war, and not even as a push for more gun control either. No authoritarian crackdown in response to the terrorism. Instead, they seem to have shoved it right down the memory hole. They don't want people dwelling on it when the narrative they construct is so obviously bullshit.

       Ah, but who says it has to be terrorism related? It could also be something like North Korea launching a missile at the US, or Iran attacking one of our ships in the Persian Gulf, or some similar event that would be justification for dragging us into war. People are less desensitized to direct acts of war than they are terrorist attacks.

       An attack on the country would bring the people together against a common enemy. The Las Vegas shooting was a single man, who had no organization to hate after he was dead. (Supposedly.) A attack from North Korea would give us a common enemy and be able to put us in then us vs then mentality.

       They could have used ISIS but we already are fighting ISIS. North Korea is increasingly becoming the enemy as seen from the tourist kid who died. That was clearly a propaganda piece with the parents but if it happened, it happened.

       China stated clealy back during Donald's and Kim's dick measuring contest that if NK was attacked unprovoked or was forced to a regime change it would respect their mutual defense pact. However, if NK struck first it would side with the US.

       It's an added deterrent to maintain the status quo which is beneficial for many countries in the region. A collapse of North Korea is predicted to overwhelm South Korea with refugees beyond the it's capability to deal with it. While China is better equipped to handle mainly due to country size, North Korea acts as a good buffer zone against Western influence on the Asian continent.

       My own view is that the country is pulling itself apart. Here's my theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you go back 30 years and look at who gets elected, a noticeable patter appears. Start with Bush I.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was a conservative who followed Reagan into office, best remembered for Gulf War I (Desert Storm).
      </p>
      <p>
       Reaction to Bush was Bill Clinton. Democrat. People liked him at the time, economy did well. Conservatives and liberals moved apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then came Bush II. Bush will forever be remembered as the 9/11 President. Highly polarizing figure. Most people really liked him or couldn't stand him.  Left and right move farther apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then came Obama. First black President. In his own way, a high polarizing figure. People either loved him, or couldn't stand him. Political correctness now advanced enough that the people who couldn't stand him expressed their true feelings online vs in public. Left and right move farther apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Trump. Most polarizing President in living history. Not even Nixon, during the height of Watergate, inspired the kind of media reaction that Trump has received.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no middle ground anymore. People totally forget their talking about the POTUS and focus on personality instead. It's no longer about left vs right. It's about past vs future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's huge appeal is based on keeping things the way they are, or getting them back to the way they used to be. Lot's of people want that because (for them) things used to be a lot better.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who oppose him the most are the ones who always call loudest for change. So ethnic minorities, women (esp. Feminists), SJWs of all types and young people in general (because young people are more accepting of change).
      </p>
      <p>
       People react by choosing sides and lining up against the "other side" instead of listening, questioning and learning. Instead of finding common solutions, people look for competitive ones. Political polarity wave keeps on getting stronger and stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
       If things continue in this direction much longer, something is going to give.

       The really important thing is the way people are going apart from each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's an old saying about how "A house divided  against itself cannot stand" That's not religion, it's a valid social observation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Substitute the word house for nation and it's just as true. Now think about the country you live in. What do you see... people coming together, or people moving apart?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what I was getting at with my earlier comment. It's not something that just happened recently. This is a process that has been underway for the last few decades.

       That why Obama was about dividing race, but that didn't divide in homes and communities already had that divide. Hillary and maybe the whole point if Trump (though I believe less and less he was complicit) was to divide us along gender lines, in our homes.

       Part of this is the increasing weaponization of the media on the side of one party or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       We used to have yellow journalism, but now it is much more sophisticated, consolidated, and coordinated and from the top down through a few government dependent monopolies, controlled by oligarchs.

       I think his support comes mostly from people who want change. That isn't young people. They do want change, but this weird superficial change. Those of us who hit our 2s in mid 2000s want a total change from the status quo.

       I've been thinking about what's going on. But not so close up. Think about looking at a forest for 30 years vs looking at a single tree for a single season.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're going to notice things that are real. You're going to notice things that are related, but different.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, you're right, there are a lot of people who want things to change. But what they want is to change things back to the way they were. Now  here's the genius part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who wants to change things even more from the way they used to be?
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare that to who wants to change things back to the way they used to be?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd argue that the people who want even more change are minorities, young people and people who generally feel like they could get a better deal than what they've got right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who'd like to turn the clock back? Mostly older people, probably white people in general, men, conservatives, Christians.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at people like this, there are two things they have in common. One, they tend to have more money and two, they're a bit more likely to actually vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       To repeat: In a conflict between past vs future, past has more $$$ and gets more votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if someone really stinks things up for the "Past Supporters" you should be able to get a rebound effect. "Change Supporters" will be energized by a common opponent. Next election I expect them to unify and show a lot higher result re: voter turnout/

       I don’t think anything will actually happen.  However, I do think if something were to happen at the super bowl it would rile up the American people like nothing ever before.  People would come together and fight whoever is blamed.  When I say people I mean the unaware “sheep” (hate that word) Americans.

       This is highly reminiscent of PNAC's statement that accomplishing their goals of middle-east invasions, etc would require something akin to "a new Pearl Harbor." Shortly after we had 9-11.

       It can be done, but too many people are absorbed by propaganda and lifestyles that make them chronically sick, tired, distracted, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it their entirely their fault they're addicted to such a harmful and imprisoning reality? Not really. But it is their fault if they continue to neglect their inner soul calling to break free and live differently.
      </p>
      <p>
       If more people answered their own call (hero's journey, anyone?), then we could all wake up without the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the event (spiritually speaking) is inevitable, which will notsomuch be a planned cabal event (though they'll probably try to utilize it for their benefit) but something much grander and more ancient than most people will acknowledge. In fact, it's actually already happening (evidence: more people woke and cabal resorting to desperate moves like Vegas).
      </p>
      <p>
       but enough of ramble. Trump admin knows more than they let on, and their cryptic hints are just letting all of us that already essentially know the same thing that the status quo BS reality is up.
