       Hillary paid foreign entities (including Russians) for "salacious and unverified" information about Trump - FACT
      </p>
      <p>
       That salacious and unverified information was presented to a FISA court while intentionally omitting its source and funding - FACT
      </p>
      <p>
       The surveillance warrant would not have been granted without the dossier, according to FBI Deputy Director McCabe himself - FACT
      </p>
      <p>
       Then FBI Director Comey himself, under oath, admitted the dossier was "salacious and unverified" even though he signed the forms authorizing its use in obtaining a FISA warrant - FACT
      </p>
      <p>
       It was concealed from the FISA court that the source of the Yahoo story used to "corroborate" the dossier was, in fact, the same compromised and fired Christopher Steele who wrote the dossier - FACT
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who thinks this memo doesn't show obvious wrongdoing by certain members of the DOJ and FBI is saying, explicitly, that these are the rules now, and if Trump and the RNC does it to his 2020 opponent its 100% allowed.

       This post is a response to all those who are saying the memo is a "nothingburger". Also, your comment barely touches the content of my post. So if you aren't a bot, please address my post. Because I feels like you're just trying to derail the conversation, you don't seem  real to me.

       The media didn't send troops to war with Iraq. The neo-cons did. Are you surprised the MSM reported the US government making a statement about Iraq having WMD's? What else are they supposed to be reporting? Three-legged dancing dogs?
      </p>
      <p>
       When it smells like a nothingburger, tastes like a nothingburger, and looks like a nothingburger, I don't know what else to tell you. If it had been anything to it other than a nothingburger CNN/MSNBC would be trying to deflect from it, and Fox would be ramming it in your throat. But alas it is a nothingburger.

       They did report the truth. The Bush administration said that they had found evidence of WMDs. That's what the administration said, that's what the MSM reported.

       The truth is that the Bush administration was being dishonest. How can you fault the MSM for that?

       If Trump hires a firm for opposition research, and they find actionable intel about his opposition's illegal activities, he has every right to bring it to the attention of law enforcement.

       While we're at it - it's also a fiction that Comey "admitted under oath that the memo was salacious and unverified" - or at the very least it's disingenuous. Comey admitted to having referred to SPECIFIC PARTS of the information that way - meaning, he said to Trump that some of the "salacious" parts were as of yet unverified. He then, in the same testimony, went out of his way to stress that much of the information in the dossier HAD been vetted and independently corroborated, and that a lot of what Steele compiled was information the FBI already had from multiple credible sources.

       How are you going to list things off as fact, and have your first point be false? I’m sure you’ll follow this up with “did you read the memo?” Ah yes, the memo created by the guy who had to recuse himself from any Russia investigation, and didn’t even read the FISA applications. I find this memo to be barely credible at best.

       If Trump had concerns about malfeasance, he could have requested an independent judicial review six months ago. Why didn’t he? It’s nothing but a half-assed, poorly written smear campaign, using the court of public opinion.
