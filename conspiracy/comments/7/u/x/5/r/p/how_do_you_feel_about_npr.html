       <em>
        maybe

       on some shows. I don't think I've ever heard someone from CATO go on NPR. And, for the record, those organizations have

       National Propaganda Radio.

      <p>
       I loved Car Talk &amp; Prairie Home Companion since I was a little kid.
      </p>
      <p>
       NPR is now mostly paid for by donations from rightward groups like the Koch Brothers &amp; it shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       NPR is programmed to sound like it's open minded &amp; kind of liberal, but it's a facade these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       They play off their old reputation &amp; propagandize mostly by omission/what they don't talk about.
      </p>
      <p>
       But these days they will outright run stories that are outright deep state propaganda about other countries &amp; non-establishment candidates within the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       I pulled financial support from NPR way back 2010 when they started running a series on what 'conspiracy nuts' believed about the Federal Reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was the last straw for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I only turn it on once in a great while to keep abreast of what the enemy is up to in propaganda these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still know my siblings listen to it through habit, but I can't support it.
      </p>
      <p>
       NPR is a perfect example of something that was great &amp; when we hit the Great Recession they lost a ton of financial support from listeners as people had to tighten their belts a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure the employees wanted to work &amp; corporate donations were the answer.

       I don't think I said they try to hide it. NPR tries to downplay that by constantly repeating that "NPR is supported by listener donations" over &amp; over.

       My father told me for years that NPR had an obvious slant. His lack of articulation and my cognitive dissonance paired together wasn't enough to make me question why it fucking mattered.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel really stupid. As soon as the idea clicked I went to see him and apologize. You really cannot know until you know. It's hard to wake up. Now I can't stand to listen to NPR. I can hear the (((agenda))) in every part of it. What stories they choose to cover. What stories they ignore. Who they interview. Who they don't interview.

       Something that isn't 50% ads.  And I think the lady that does the Supreme Court reports does a good job narrating the cases.  Most of the shows I like on the NPR stations aren't from them but from other public radio station companies, like PRI, WGBH, APM, XPN.

       Another CIA-controlled propaganda outlet, primarily appealing to center left people with above average intelligence who generally support the regime but want to feel as if they are getting deeper analysis of the real motivations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mostly false consciousness, NPR listeners are some of the most deceived people out there because they are so heavily invested in the lies and thinking they have a deeper explanation.

       Russiagate is a mind-virus that was multiplied by the simplified meaning of the term "resist" (also "resistance"), which seems designed and effective at killing curiosity in those who want to just "resist" Trump and have that token gesture be sufficient signal of virtue.
      </p>

       It seems to particularly infect people who listen to NPR, thinking NPR is reasonable, since sharing NPR links never gets you in trouble with FaceBook thought-police (and by that I mean your peers, not even the goons MarkZ hires).
      </p>
      <p>
       Share an RT or other non-MSM link that doesn't quite clean off the conspiracy angles, get shamed on fb by "reasonable thinking people" (who all still believe NPR doesn't mean "nice polite republicans"), and you'll avoid that shaming in the future.

       NPR has basically entrapped the new bourgeois, who then convince others who have even less time to wade through biased sources.

       I think for the most part their reporting can be solid. I was stoked on Amy Goodman of Democracy Now reporting on all the unjust drone bombings of the Obama era. Most of the leftist media refused to acknowledge the violence spread by a democratic administration so I was stoked to hear from a "leftist" journalist that denounced such violence and even reported it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was curious what NPR critics looked as trustable journalism.

       Loved it as a kid. Now, it's all subtle advertising and pushing a narrative. Maybe it was before, and I didn't realize it, but it in my memory, both public radio and television had independent and controversial stuff. I remember watching a documentary on mental institutions in the 50s, with my mom, sometime in the 90s. Naked men and abuse shown, uncensored. Public radio had more time for local politicians to talk and fucking awesome jazz and classical. Now, it's so overproduced and you hear Starbucks or Google Maps dropped into a story.
