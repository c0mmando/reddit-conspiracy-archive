    <div class="md"><p>Stole this from another poster:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The memo describes the process by which the government got a secret warrant under the law that governs the secret court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, for Mr. Page. <strong>The process, which is supervised closely by senior U.S. officials and a federal judge, required several layers of approval from top FBI and Justice Department officials.</strong></p>

<p><strong>At least two of those renewals occurred while Mr. Trump was president and at least one was authorized by a Justice Department official he appointed.</strong> A person familiar with the matter said that <strong><em>four separate federal judges approved the surveillance of Mr. Page, and all of those judges were appointed by Republican presidents.</em></strong></p>

<p>The memo is critical of Mr. Steele and notes that prosecutors in their application for the warrant didn’t explicitly state that he was working for a firm funded by Democrats. But the FISA application did disclose Mr. Steele was being paid by a law firm working for a major political party, according to a person familiar with the matter. <strong>Redacting the names of U.S. people or organizations who aren’t the subject of an investigation is a common practice in government legal filings,</strong> <strong><em>designed to protect privacy.</em></strong></p>

<p>If they waited until after the election was over, it wouldn&#39;t matter if they released it or not because she would already be President.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, the first one makes a lot of sense. To say that the FBI reopening the investigation into Hillary’s emails is what lost her the election is just flat out incorrect.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure she lost the election because she and her cronies <em>stole</em> the primary from Bernie, and then proceeded to run the worst campaign in the history of U.S. politics. It didn’t help her case that she is the walking definition of D.C. establishment, and to be honest, I think a lot of people like myself decided not to vote for her when she said “It’s <em>my turn</em> to be president”! Like, who the fuck in their right mind says something like that? This isn’t duck duck goose...</p>

<p>And you ask why they wouldn’t say anything about the investigation into Trump’s collusion with Russia? Maybe because the FISA warrant was obtained because Comey and McCabe signed off on it knowing full well that the dossier used to request the warrant was based on false information and completely fabricated. Maybe they didn’t want everyone to know they were spying on Trump and his transition team (you know, because it’s illegal).</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s actually not. The timing of it, and the margin she lost be shows it. If that letter had never been released, she would have won. There were obviously other factors, but to deny that is ridiculous.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Republican establishment treated Trump like a Pariah during the primaries,  leading up until the convention.  They treated Trump like a pariah so it is their fault he was surrounded by pariahs.  Remember Trump feared the establishment would try to steal the nomination at the convention so he had no choice but to hire Manafort.  Every republican with experience was on the never Trump train so Trump had no choice but to use Papadoplaos and Carter Page.  The Military Industrial Complex didn&#39;t like Trump so he ended up with Flynn and his coocoo son.</p>

<p>Outside of the Mercers who besides Trump&#39;s kids are actually loyal to him?  All these other people who are becoming states witnesses, or pleading quilty for plea deals, they aren&#39;t Trump people.  They are just people Trump got stuck with.</p>
