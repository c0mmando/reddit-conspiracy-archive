<p>No, you&#39;re continually repeating CIA propaganda about Russian collusion/hacking. There is a bill on the president&#39;s desk right now that would declassify a memo showing that this whole thing was an operation by British intelligence and the DNC to subvert the democratic process (i.e. treason).</p>

<p>Your whole comment history is the same exact low effort propaganda without a shred of support. Whenever you are challenged you imply that anyone disagreeing with you is a Russian agent. Fuck off. Blocked.</p>

<p>No one is going to waste time responding to this. It&#39;s an obvious time waster. If you believe Russians hacked the election, you haven&#39;t spent 10 minutes in r/conspiracy and you need to familiarize yourself with CIA propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah...US corporate media running Trump on television 247 didn&#39;t have anything to do with him winning. /s</p>

<p>The US media gave Trump as a presidential candidate UNPRECEDENTED access to the airwaves.</p>

<p>I travel cross country frequently...in 2015 the only signs for candidates you would see was for Sanders &amp; Carson. No Trump &amp; No Clinton as we entered 2016 you started to see Trump signs in a few places. Still No Clinton signs. Actually that&#39;s a lie ... I saw two.</p>

<p>One was a unsolicited bumper sticker from Clinton which everyone on our block received. The other was a bumper sticker on a car outside of Walnut Creek, California. Saw tons of Bernie stickers on East Coast &amp; West Coast with lesser numbers in the midwest but still outpacing both Trump &amp; Clinton by a large margin. In fact Ben Carson was outnumbering Trump &amp; Clinton as well.</p>

<p>We attended huge rallies for Bernie in 3 different cities. Trump was still not holding rallies &amp; Clinton&#39;s biggest rally was her campaign kickoff where she only had 5000 people in attendance. </p>

<p>The interesting thing is that at the first Sanders rally we sat next to people who were evidently field producers from corporate television &amp; they were openly mocking him even though he had a big crowd early in 2015.</p>

<p>I saw that same group at the 3rd rally we attended &amp; their position had actively changed. They only got coverage of the opening speakers &amp; maybe Sanders opening remark. </p>

<p>Then they left. When you would look for coverage that night they would mention it as a blurb even though at that 3rd rally there were 30,000 people in attendance &amp; it was still early in the race.</p>

<p>Then Trump starts holding rallies &amp; the media broadcasts the hour before....the entire speech which went on &amp; on &amp; 1/2 hour after he left the rally.</p>

<p>You can hardly find Clinton rally coverage....she was only blurb/short mention in the news with abysmally small crowds which Clinton&#39;s team said &quot;That&#39;s what they wanted was to connect with smaller groups!&quot;.</p>

<p>Those small groups were vetted for Clinton supporters. Anyone could show up to Sanders &amp; Trumps rallies.</p>

<p>Trump after a couple of months of 247 coverage finally holds a rally &amp; they don&#39;t get the same numbers as Sanders largest rally but of course media heralds the rallies as 
&quot;The biggest of the election season!!!&quot;.</p>

<p>When Sanders &amp; his supporters got white noised &amp; wifi mostly shut down (So people couldn&#39;t broadcast from their phones) how he was cheated at the DNC convention.</p>

<p>Team Clinton got caught bussing in craigslist people to the convention to hold Clinton signs.
They used white noise generators to shut down all the boos emanating from the crowd about the ongoing cheating.</p>

<p>When Sanders finally concedes the next day you see the corporate media critically pile on Trump where before they were tossing him softball interviews where he was just allowed to drone on &amp; on.</p>

<p>Considering it was in Clinton emails saying it was their plan to use their contacts in the media to elevate Trump &amp; Cruz into taking extreme positions so they could attack those extreme positions later....it seems a little disingenuous now to blame it on &#39;Russian Hacking&#39;!!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a single one of those shows that Donald Trump acted illegally or unethically in regards to relations with Russia. Manafort is the only one; even Flynn&#39;s conviction was just for lying to the FBI, he did not admit to, nor was accused of improper conduct with the Russians.</p>

<p>Wait till the Uranium One scandal gets properly investigated and you&#39;ll see how much of Washington DC was taking bribes from the Russians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you notice how you got downvoted just for asking questions? The account you&#39;re responding to is actively, in this thread, pushing CIA propaganda. They have also referred you to a giant list of trash purporting to show Trump colluded with the Russians. Doesn&#39;t sound very reliable, does it?</p>

<p>Actually sounds like someone trying to make you go along with what the CIA is telling you to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of things point to Russian meddling.  Nothing credible points to Trump.</p>

<p>Worth noting that the FBI has been on this 24/7 for 19 months, and they have nothing showing Trump colluded with the Russians.  Zero.</p>

<p>If even a fraction of this “proof” put forth by the internet lawyers and armchair FBI agents were true, Trump would be in jail, and not spiking the football after a successful first full year in Office.</p>
