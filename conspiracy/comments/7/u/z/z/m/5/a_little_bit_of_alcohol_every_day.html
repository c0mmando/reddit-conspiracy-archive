       I've noticed this lie popping up more and more. Could it be pressure from the legalization of marijuana?
      </p>
      <p>
       It usually goes like this: "Drinking [just 1 or 2!] glasses of [type of alcoholic drink] will [some health benefit, or just some statement that can't really be quantified, or a clinical effect of alcohol]"
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, we could believe that an army of passionate scientists are just constantly throwing themselves against the walls of our limited human knowledge when it comes to alcohol. So much so that we see published results of studies like this every month or so, usually with some yet newer, even better health benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or we could believe that there's just a shitload of alcohol industry money going into it. (My choice!)
      </p>
      <p>
       The recipe is simple: Get your user to sample the product, let the addiction do the rest. The drug dealer on the corner will give a free hit of a powerful product. The drug dealer making a commercial or publishing a study will aim for establishing a behavior and letting the addiction do the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       A free hit of heroin is going to hook a lot more easily. But the second drug dealer's strategy is going to hit a lot more people (and result in a lot more addiction, and destroy a lot more lives). The shady dealer on the corner and the alcohol advertising professional are the exact same menace to society, one just has better presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even know if this belongs here in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . The alcohol industry, mass fishin' for alcoholics through manipulation of mass media? It almost seems obvious to type it out. It's almost
       <em>
        what PR/advertising is
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do feel like we have a blind spot for alcohol. We laugh about the dubious health claims peddled by Big Tobacco in the 50s/60s, but then we eat this "a glass of red wine is great for your heart/brain/liver/lungs/teeth!" stuff right up.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, I'd like to just give alcohol a pass because it's "not that bad." But this "every day!" nonsense, read to us aloud by people in lab coats, it creates this fear of missing out ("Better get my glass of red wine today!") that, for some people, is going to turn into an addiction. And it makes all the other stuff people in lab coats are doing that much harder to trust.

       Distilled alcohol is obviously poison in high doses, but in moderate amounts I wonder how bad it can be. Before refrigeration, literally everything we consumed that contained sugar was fermented and contained alcohol- it is just a natural process. Even the orange juice in your refrigerator and the loaf of bread on your counter contain alcohol.

       I think the reality is that below a certain threshold amount, it doesn't cause harm and is relatively neutral. The problem is that threshold amount is much lower than most people would think, like half a drink or less in a four hour period, but the exact amount depends on the person. Any amount over that, which is just about always, you are doing some damage to your body. Also I don't believe the claim that it is beneficial in any amounts. There might be beneficial compounds in wine, but probably better to just eat a handful of grapes.

       It's weird.  Americans, who say alcohol and other vices are sooo bad for you die younger (and fatter) than any Asian country where booze flow freely, everyone smokes all day, and eat pork belly at every meal.   I'm convinced it's the sugar.  From living in the East and the West, the biggest difference I found was the amount of sugar consumed per person.

       During my last pregnancy, my eldest daughter and I, who was also pregnant, backpacked though Europe for almost 3 months. We literally ate anything we wanted- creme brioche for breakfast, croque madame for lunch, fried fish for dinner. We came back to the states crazy healthy and fit.

       It was literal. We spent our pregnancies backpacking. That doesn't mean hiking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, cute story- our babies ended up being born on the same day, without any intervention. Now we are planning an actual hiking trip with them on the PCH for their sixth birthday.

       Different things about Asian countries help them live longer. In China the diet has more fruits and veggies, and they drink green tea which counteracts adverse effects of smoking and alcohol.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Korea, they eat tons of veggies many fermented, which is extremely healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also eat less.

       Arsenic accumulates in your body, but your body also removes it from your system.  If you consume too much your body can't keep up and bad things happen.  You can take small amounts and be fine though.  Brussel sprouts usually has some amount in it, ground water can also.

       And brain. If one drinks too excessively before one's brain is fully "adult", one could end up never progressing much beyond the mental capacity of a teenager. The effects aren't nearly as disastrous (in moderation of course) once you're past that hurdle, but wouldn't you know it, the legal drinking age of nearly every country that allows alcohol consumption is
       <em>
        years

       I don't know if I agree. Human have been drinking alcohol for thousands of years. If anything our bodies have evolved to accept it. In certain points of history beer was what kept the humans from getting malnutrition. But just like our choices in food now days some are better than others.

       As far as I understand, the beneficial elements are in certain grapes. Yes, some small fraction of it is passed onto wine - but if that's the case, just go for the grapes man, or drink grape juice from those grapes.

       They do and I'm always suspicious, but I honestly have never found a study that convinces me that coffee is bad for you. Lately I've seen evidence that it is a good antioxidant, much like green tea.

       I've never had an addiction, not the type. But I drank shitloads of coffee and quit it a few years back and it was the best damn decision of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't feel cloudy in the membrane no more, less to no bowel problems, less acidic reflux, better sleep, overall just a different and healthier person.

       No one can tell me that coffee is good for you, it isn't even the caffeine because neither the occasional energy drinks nor my daily teas give me any of the shit that coffee gave me - and that despite having tried to alleviate the issues with decaf coffee prior to quitting.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one can tell me that roasted anything is good for you, especially not if that roasted something (like coffee beans) is full of fats.

       Damn it. I went to bed last night thinking I wouldn't have any this AM, woke up feeling lively and like I didn't need any. After I half hour, I missed the taste/ritual/experience and now I'm sipping 16 oz. of it.

       I wasn't able to stop until I did it cold-turkey, stopped buying coffee for at home and threw away/gave away all equipment for it and replaced the ritualistic coffee-drinking with tea initially, to break the habit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Took about a month until I felt... normal again. I had two coffees since quitting, didn't even like the taste no more and I think I never really did - it was mainly the smell that attracted me and the sugar and cream that goes into a Cappuccino or cup of coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the main thing is, you gotta want to quit and maybe have an intrinsic motivation to do so and this is true with any and all addictions.

       I agree, what people don't know is filtered coffee=good. unfiltered like espresso=bad. Espresso is hard on your body and heart, raises anxiety and stress levels. Filtered coffee greatly minimizes some of  the negative effects while keeping the positive. No more than 1 (2shot) espresso drink a day at the most, any more long term is just poisoning yourself. Filtered coffee, 1-3 cups in the am is probably fine.

       From ttat study:
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been discrepant findings on the association between habitual coffee intake and ischemic stroke. One study found that total coffee consumption was not associated with an increased stroke risk in men23 and another study found that coffee consumption was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke among hypertensive men who reported no previous or current smoking.24 However, others have reported that habitual coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke. In the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study of men, smokers who drank 8 or more cups of coffee per day had a 23% lower risk of stroke than those who drank fewer than 2 cups per day.25 Similarly, in the Nurses' Health Study, women who drank 4 or more cups of coffee per day had a 20% lower risk of stroke than those who did not consume coffee.26 These results are concordant with our finding of no increased risk among those who drink coffee regularly, suggesting that habitual consumption results in a tolerance to the acute effects of caffeine.18,19

       Yeah and sugar and milk (which is full of sugar) are common additives to a lot of peoples coffee. This results in some peoples coffee intake also increasing their sugar intake which could be one reason for a small increase in stroke risk.

       It does. And supposedly the more the better 4+ cups being good. Doesn’t agree with some people though. But generally it allows you to function on less sleep and eat less. Useful stuff.

       The coffee plant evolved to produce caffeine to kill off any bugs and competing plants in its area. It's not that it happens to contain something bad for you, it's that the poisonous aspect of the plant that exists for killing via a nerve agent is the exact thing we harvest it for (aside from flavour). A bug needs only a small dose to kill it, but a human needs a much much larger one, but we consume it on a much larger scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it will kill us but I do think it has adverse effects to mental health.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's similar to many other drugs such as shrooms. The part that gets us high is very much a poison, it is possible to take too much and have detrimental physical and mental results. I wouldn't do shrooms every morning, and I know it's a wildly different thing but I hope you see where I'm coming from.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be so quick to say it's as harmless as the arsenic in an apple

       "From liking to wanting
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody starts out intending to develop an addiction, but many people get caught in its snare. According to the latest government statistics, nearly 23 million Americans — almost one in 10 — are addicted to alcohol or other drugs. More than two-thirds of people with addiction abuse alcohol. The top three drugs causing addiction are marijuana, opioid (narcotic) pain relievers, and cocaine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Genetic vulnerability contributes to the risk of developing an addiction. Twin and adoption studies show that about 40% to 60% of susceptibility to addiction is hereditary. But behavior plays a key role, especially when it comes to reinforcing a habit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pleasure principle. The brain registers all pleasures in the same way, whether they originate with a psychoactive drug, a monetary reward, a sexual encounter, or a satisfying meal. In the brain, pleasure has a distinct signature: the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, a cluster of nerve cells lying underneath the cerebral cortex (see illustration). Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens is so consistently tied with pleasure that neuroscientists refer to the region as the brain’s pleasure center.
      </p>
      <p>
       The brain’s reward center. Addictive drugs provide a shortcut to the brain’s reward system by flooding the nucleus accumbens with dopamine. The hippocampus lays down memories of this rapid sense of satisfaction, and the amygdala creates a conditioned response to certain stimuli.
      </p>
      <p>
       All drugs of abuse, from nicotine to heroin, cause a particularly powerful surge of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. The likelihood that the use of a drug or participation in a rewarding activity will lead to addiction is directly linked to the speed with which it promotes dopamine release, the intensity of that release, and the reliability of that release. Even taking the same drug through different methods of administration can influence how likely it is to lead to addiction. Smoking a drug or injecting it intravenously, as opposed to swallowing it as a pill, for example, generally produces a faster, stronger dopamine signal and is more likely to lead to drug misuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Learning process. Scientists once believed that the experience of pleasure alone was enough to prompt people to continue seeking an addictive substance or activity. But more recent research suggests that the situation is more complicated. Dopamine not only contributes to the experience of pleasure, but also plays a role in learning and memory — two key elements in the transition from liking something to becoming addicted to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the current theory about addiction, dopamine interacts with another neurotransmitter, glutamate, to take over the brain’s system of reward-related learning. This system has an important role in sustaining life because it links activities needed for human survival (such as eating and sex) with pleasure and reward. The reward circuit in the brain includes areas involved with motivation and memory as well as with pleasure. Addictive substances and behaviors stimulate the same circuit — and then overload it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Repeated exposure to an addictive substance or behavior causes nerve cells in the nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex (the area of the brain involved in planning and executing tasks) to communicate in a way that couples liking something with wanting it, in turn driving us to go after it. That is, this process motivates us to take action to seek out the source of pleasure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tolerance and compulsion. Over time, the brain adapts in a way that actually makes the sought-after substance or activity less pleasurable.
      </p>
      <p>
       In nature, rewards usually come only with time and effort. Addictive drugs and behaviors provide a shortcut, flooding the brain with dopamine and other neurotransmitters. Our brains do not have an easy way to withstand the onslaught.
      </p>
      <p>
       Addictive drugs, for example, can release two to 10 times the amount of dopamine that natural rewards do, and they do it more quickly and more reliably. In a person who becomes addicted, brain receptors become overwhelmed. The brain responds by producing less dopamine or eliminating dopamine receptors — an adaptation similar to turning the volume down on a loudspeaker when noise becomes too loud.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result of these adaptations, dopamine has less impact on the brain’s reward center. People who develop an addiction typically find that, in time, the desired substance no longer gives them as much pleasure. They have to take more of it to obtain the same dopamine “high” because their brains have adapted — an effect known as tolerance.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, compulsion takes over. The pleasure associated with an addictive drug or behavior subsides — and yet the memory of the desired effect and the need to recreate it (the wanting) persists. It’s as though the normal machinery of motivation is no longer functioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       The learning process mentioned earlier also comes into play. The hippocampus and the amygdala store information about environmental cues associated with the desired substance, so that it can be located again. These memories help create a conditioned response — intense craving — whenever the person encounters those environmental cues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cravings contribute not only to addiction but to relapse after a hard-won sobriety. A person addicted to heroin may be in danger of relapse when he sees a hypodermic needle, for example, while another person might start to drink again after seeing a bottle of whiskey. Conditioned learning helps explain why people who develop an addiction risk relapse even after years of abstinence."

       Seems to be a lot of accurate facts in here but in what universe is cannabis in the top 3 with opiods and cocaine? Are they actually arguing that cannabis is more addictive than meth or nicotine? Also, meth is more addictive than cocaine... which is less addictive than nicotine... so... what is this nonsense?

       fav quote of wine drinkers "One glass of wine a day has LOADS of antioxidants!"
      </p>
      <p>
       reality: Pomegranate and acai juice both have multiple times more antioxidants than wine... without the dumbing down effects of alcohol!

      <p>
       also, a handful of blueberries has more antioxidants than a glass of wine.

       many many stories on it. NOT so unbelievable when you realize the dairy and meat industry has one of the largest lobbys. the "Milk is good for your bones" was just a propaganda campaign, same as "flouride is good for your teeth"

       If you want to keep your insulin high, never enter ketosis, and never promote autophagy you are correct eating three +times a day is ideal.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is likely far healthier to feast + fast than to graze all day.

       Eggs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stopped caring about them a while ago, but for ages eggs flip between being good for you and terrible for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think Big Egg is behind it.

       What I think it is, is similar to the "Mommy needs wine" meme.  And this extends to marijuana.  People love x.  Doesn't matter what x is.  So naturally there will be people telling them that x is super bad for them and there will be other people telling them that x is pretty good for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter.  Unless it's like meth or heroin or something you never hear about someone using in moderation, it's probably fine in moderation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wine has antioxidants and lowers stress and slows your heart rate, but so don blueberries and naps.  Marijuana is an anti-inflammatory and appetite stimulant.  But so is cumin (taragon?  It's in curry) and naps.
      </p>

       It's all people justifying their vices.

       Idk if he's saying there's big egg in the sense that there is big tobacco. But it's pretty reasonable for the poultry industry to have an interest in studies saying that eggs are good for you. Also, you'd be surprised how much influence an industry can have. Just look at big corn.

       At some point it came out that he egg industry had been playing games with data, I am sorry to say as I like eggs, but eggs turned out not to be good for health, egg industry paid for scientists to tell the opposite.  It was a few years ago now, will try to find the stories.

       Egg, butter, meat. I personally stuck to a high fat diet-as close to zero carb as possible, and lost about 30 pounds. Also had tons of energy, ny mood improved, and my thought patterns seemed to become clearer and less "hazy".  Eggs,butter, avocado, all did wonders for me, and I'm not part of any type of "big egg" sponsorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend cage free eggs where the chickens are allowed to eat insects and seeds, if you can affford it. They taste 100% better than the alternatives.

       Alcohol is the number one thing that allows a significant portion of the population to come home every night and tolerate the fact that their day just sucked, the talking head on TV is full of shit, and shit is getting visibly worse pretty much wherever you look.  It is a vital part of the status quo despite being horrible for you.

       Thing is, the nature of addiction is not totally down to the substance alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I live a fairly good life sober, I've tried many drugs and had much alcohol in my time, even a hell of a lot of cigarettes. Not once was I ever addicted to these things. They were just a passing fancy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have had friends though who just cannot stand being sober. They don't want to exist in their lives and just party as a form of escapism. Those people I don't know if I've ever seen them sober, and if I had it didn't last long ( or they were always on something milder, maybe it was weed. cigs or drink ). Some of them too came from really tragic backgrounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's been studies to even show this, that addiction also comes from social factors just as much as it comes from the substance. This is generally why most addicts are from lower class backgrounds. There are addicts in the higher classes, but they've got their own reasons for escaping reality.

       I have noticed that the US is full of masochists that demonize everything that provides even the smallest amount of joy.

      <p>
       Because of this, it is difficult to get an objective answer on alcohol.

       It is a war that will end up being a giant stalemate. Everyone needs a vice and alcohol is pretty much all there is for many.

       The largest force at work in these stories are the PR departments of the universities that find this research. When you see headlines like, "A glass of wine may be great for your health" or "Multivitamins are useless", those are the product of university public relations departments trying to draw more money, not the alcohol industry.

       Alcohol is indeed poison for the body and mind. I find it very anti-psychedelic. I'm 37 years old and have drank I think ten times in my entire life. I feel extremely healthy, zero depression, lots of motivation, and I get comments all the time about looks and also memory retention. I remember things. All I do is a little weed, a little caffeine, and I've been influenced by psychedelics.

       It's not a about alcohol, but rather beer and/or wine.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's because they both contains pretty valuable anti-oxidants, vitamins and minerals.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's true: one glass a day during meals means that you will never get a booze, but you are getting all the other beneficial substances.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my country (Italy) it's almost mandatory to have a bottle of generic red wine on the dinner table and simply drinking a glass or 2 max.

       I fail to understand how a glass of booze each day would benefit someone, regardless of the marginal "nutrients" found in it. If anything, a more likely scenario would be 1 drink a day turning into 2 or 3 drinks a day, followed by 10 a day, and so on. A little booze everyday has a higher likelihood of turning someone into a addicted mess over any positive health benefits.

       when you introduce a mind altering substance everyday it creates dependence and tolerance... even if you managed to keep it to just 1 a day you can still become dependent. if one was to abruptly discontinue that 1 drink after months of daily dosing, you could expect some form of withdrawal.

       I'm curious if there isn't something in the other direction. For instance, when it was first said that a moderate amount of wine might be good for you everyone said it was because of the antioxidants in the fruit. Then it was said that beer, which as far as I can tell wouldn't be good for any other reason, had similar effects. I'm wondering if it doesn't have something to do with depressants in general, as long as there isn't some trumping reason that makes them bad for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stress is bad for you, even in normal functioning amounts. What cortisol does when produced as a result of stress, as well as what stress does to your cardiovascular system in general, is awful. I wonder if any general depressant that can tone that down could be good for you in a way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, I can imagine a way that alcohol, marijuana, and other lighter depressants could be good for some people. But please stay away from the benzos, opiates, etc.

       I agree, what people don't know is filtered coffee=good. unfiltered like espresso=bad. Espresso is hard on your body and heart, raises anxiety and stress levels. Filtered coffee greatly minimizes some of  the negative effects while keeping the positive. No more than 1 (2shot) espresso drink a day at the most, any more long term is just poisoning yourself. Filtered coffee, 1-3 cups in the am is probably fine.
