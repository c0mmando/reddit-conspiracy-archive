<p><a href="https://jackpineradicals.com/boards/topic/is-carter-page-an-fbi-informant-who-wormed-into-trumps-campaign/">https://jackpineradicals.com/boards/topic/is-carter-page-an-fbi-informant-who-wormed-into-trumps-campaign/</a></p>

<p>Is Carter Page an FBI informant who wormed into Trump&#39;s campaign? As far as I can walk the cat back, the beginnings of “Russiagate” may have been FBI surveillance of Carter Page during a 2013 meeting with Victor Podobnyy, a Russian “Junior Attache” to the UN in NY. U.S. intelligence had Podobnyy under human and electronic surveillance as a suspected Russian SVR intelligence operative, and the FBI had recorded a conversation in March of between Podoobnyy and a second Russian agent discussing his attempt to recruit Page as an asset.</p>

<p>According to court documents, in January 2013, Carter Page first met</p>

<p>Podobnyy at an international energy conference, and later that year Page provided information about the U.S. energy industry to Podobbny. But, this is where it only starts to get really interesting.</p>

<p>In a letter published today by CNN, Page informed a US Senate committee that shortly after he met with Podobnny in 2013 he was interviewed by federal agents in June, 2013 and that he became a cooperating witness in the federal investigation and resulting 2015 prosecution. See below, and .pdf linked at <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/08/politics/carter-page-russian-official/">http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/08/politics/carter-page-russian-official/</a></p>

<p>Indeed, a court document in the 2015 trial of an SVR officer confirms that Page was indeed interviewed by two FBI Agents about dealings with Podobnyy. Carter Page is referred to in the Affidavit as Male-1:</p>

<p>On or about June 13, 2013, [FBI] Agent-2 and I interviewed Male-1. Male-1 stated that he first met VICTOR PODOBNYY, the defendant, in January 2013 at an energy symposium in New York City. During this initial meeting, PODOBNYY gave Male-1 PODOBNYY’s business card and two email addresses. Over the following months, Male-1 and PODOBNYY exchanged emails about the energy business and met in person on occasion, with Male-1 providing PODOBNYY with Male-l’s outlook on the current and future of the energy industry. Male-1 also provided documents to PODOBNYY about the energy business.
Having cooperated with the FBI in a counter-intelligence operation and later as a witness in the 2015 trial of a Russian intelligence officer, it seems implausible that Page could have been a willing secret agent of the Russians at any point thereafter. More likely, he was playing out a role assigned to him, perhaps under duress, by the FBI. Page was apparently sufficiently trusted by the FBI that he was allowed to travel to Russia several times before and after the Bureau busted the Podobnny cell in September 2014. [See FBI Affidavit for the Prosecution, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/2015_0126_spyring2.pdf.%5D">http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/2015_0126_spyring2.pdf.%5D</a> It should be pointed out that Page was never charged as an accomplice.</p>

<p>In addition, bear in mind that Page was never a paid Trump staffer and claims he never met Flynn and never had a single meeting with Trump. In fact, Page appears to have insinuated himself into the Trump campaign suddenly in early 2016 when it was short-handed without persons with direct foreign experience. He seemingly emerged out of nowhere. A biography in Newsweek portrayed him as something of a mystery whose role in the campaign is unclear, as is how he managed to gain nearly instant access as a junior foreign policy advisor to Trump: <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/carter-page-fbi-surveillance-us-presidential-election-russia-donald-trump-583066">http://www.newsweek.com/carter-page-fbi-surveillance-us-presidential-election-russia-donald-trump-583066</a></p>

<p>Reporters who went foraging for information on him during the race for the White House found little. Within Trump’s team, no one seemed to know who hired him, or what he did for the campaign. Among U.S. businessmen who had worked in Russia, and the Russians they had worked with, few knew Page’s name. In a scathing Politico article about Page, an unnamed Western investor in Russian energy told the author: “I can poll any number of people involved in energy in Russia about Carter Page and they’ll say, ‘Carter who? You mean Jimmy Carter?’”</p>

<p>What’s notable here that seems to have evaded previous notice is that instead of being a Russian agent of influence, Page at the time he spang briefly into a prominent role within the Trump campaign in early 2016, was already an FBI informant, something the Russians would obviously know. This becomes even more crucial later that summer after Page returned from a business trip to Moscow when he was repeatedly named in the James Steele “dirty dossier” as a close confident of Russian energy officials and bankers. Page actually appears to have all the hallmarks of an FBI informant, or an agent provocateur, who was planted into the Trump campaign as part of an intelligence operation. Only, it seems apparent, the intelligence service he was actually serving was American rather than Russian.</p>

<p>That is significant for another very important reason – according to the Washington Post, the FBI obtained a FISA warrant last summer to spy on the Trump campaign under the pretext that Page was alleged to be a Russian agent. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-obtained-fisa-warrant-to-monitor-former-trump-adviser-carter-page/2017/04/11/620192ea-1e0e-11e7-ad74-3a742a6e93a7_story.html?utm_term=.ee32735cc79b">https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-obtained-fisa-warrant-to-monitor-former-trump-adviser-carter-page/2017/04/11/620192ea-1e0e-11e7-ad74-3a742a6e93a7_story.html?utm_term=.ee32735cc79b</a></p>

<p>The Russian UN employee was charged with two others in 2015. There is an interesting section in the Justice Department press release that accompanied the March 11, 2016 conviction of one of the three Russians. Seemingly overlooked by everyone are what appear to be at least some intriguing suggestions that Page is not the unwitting Russian pawn he has been made out to be by most of the media, and was instead quite aware of his role in FBI operations: <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/evgeny-buryakov-pleads-guilty-manhattan-federal-court-connection-conspiracy-work">https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/evgeny-buryakov-pleads-guilty-manhattan-federal-court-connection-conspiracy-work</a></p>

<p>BURYAKOV worked in New York with at least two other SVR agents, Igor Sporyshev and Victor Podobnyy. From November 22, 2010, to November 21, 2014, Sporyshev officially served as a trade representative of the Russian Federation in New York. From December 13, 2012, to September 12, 2013, Podobnyy officially served as an attaché to the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations. The investigation, however, showed that Sporyshev and Podobnyy also worked as officers of the SVR. For their roles in the charged conspiracy, Sporyshev and Podobnyy were charged along with BURYAKOV in January 2015. However, Sporyshev and Podbonyy no longer lived in the United States and thus were not arrested.</p>

<p>BURYAKOV’s Co-Conspirators Are Recorded Inside the SVR’s New York “Residentura”</p>

<p>During the course of the investigation, the FBI recorded Sporyshev and Podobnyy speaking inside the SVR’s offices in New York, known as the “Residentura.”</p>

<p>The FBI obtained the recordings after Sporyshev attempted to recruit an FBI undercover employee (“UCE-1”), who was posing as an analyst from a New York-based energy company. In response to requests from Sporyshev, UCE-1 provided Sporyshev with binders containing purported industry analysis written by UCE-1 and supporting documentation relating to UCE-1’s reports, as well as covertly placed recording devices. Sporyshev then took the binders to, among other places, the Residentura.</p>

<p>During subsequent recorded conversations, Sporyshev and Podobnyy discussed, among other things, Sporyshev’s SVR employment contract and his official cover position, their work as SVR officers, and the FBI’s July 2010 arrests of 10 SVR agents in the United States, known as the “Illegals.”</p>

<p>While there seem to be some remarkable coincidences, it is not known if Page is actually UCE-1 or, it seems more likely, the FBI used Page to introduce one of its own employees pretending to be a coworker in Page’s NYC-based energy trading company, who subsequently passed bugged binders to the Russians. Page was previously reported in court papers to have been identified as “MALE-1.” It’s all the more curious that Page should have two years later attached himself to the Trump campaign, and is now the central figure in “Russiagate.” Stranger still, that none of this has previously been remarked upon in any major media.</p>

<p>Here’s how ABC portrayed these events when it broke part of story about Page in April: <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-campaign-advisor-carter-page-targeted-russian-spies/story?id=46557506">http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-campaign-advisor-carter-page-targeted-russian-spies/story?id=46557506</a></p>

<p>Undercover FBI agents lured Buryakov and his SVR associates, Igor Sporyshev and Podobnyy, into a trap by masquerading as well-placed business sources ripe for recruitment while using physical and electronic surveillance to gather enough information to build their case.</p>

<p>No reference by Newsweek or ABC to an FBI undercover employee posing as an energy analyst or the bugged binders, which suggests that Page (or an agent pretending to work with him) had more than a passive role in the electronic surveillance placed by the Bureau.</p>

<p>It is also significant that Page is the only person within the Trump circle for whom there appears to be strong evidence a FISA warrant was ever actually issued, permitting legal FBI surveillance (see ftn 16, below). The rest of the intercepts that have been alluded to as part of the Rice “unmaskings” were carried out after a FISA Court reportedly refused in June 2016 to issue a warrant application seeking broad surveillance of figures in the Trump campaign. Several media have reported that after the initial warrant request was denied a much narrower FISA request for surveillance of messages from two Moscow banks was granted in October.</p>

<p>Any surveillance conducted outside of the confines of the Page warrant and the possible second warrant was conducted without FISA authorization, and was in plain defiance of the court’s June warrant denial. Conviction for violation of the FISA statute carries a potential 5 year federal felony imprisonment term.</p>

<p>This is how Page describes events of which he was part in a 9-page letter to the Senate Committee published today attached to a CNN article. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/08/politics/carter-page-russian-official/">http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/08/politics/carter-page-russian-official/</a>; see, related, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/trump-kislyak-timeline/519027/">https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/trump-kislyak-timeline/519027/</a></p>

<p>Page characterizes the 2015 unmasking of himself and later leaking of his identity to the press as “Felony #1.”:</p>

<p>Felony #1: Illegal leaking of my identity as “Male-1” in U.S.A. v. Evgeny Buryakov, Igor Sporyshev, and Victor Podobnyy – On April 3, 2017, reporters at ABC News(ftn. 3) and BuzzFeed News (4) requested to meet in order to inform me that U.S. government operatives had unlawfully disclosed my identity as Male-1 in this 2015 case. This particular incident follows an increasing series of similar revelations about other politically-motivated unmaskings in 2016.(5) It relates to my brief interactions in 2013 with Victor Podobnyy, a junior attaché assigned to the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations. During my meeting with U.S. [FBI] agents at New York’s Plaza Hotel in June 2013 in support of their ongoing investigation, I spoke with them at length about my research on international political economy which I had been completing as a Fellow at the Center for National Policy in Washington. I brought this up because it seemed to me that the resources of the U.S. Government might be better allocated towards addressing real national security threats, particularly given the recent Boston Marathon bombing of April 15, 2013.</p>

<p>. . .</p>

<p>With regards to the 2015 [FBI] case where I agreed to provide support,</p>

<p>. . .</p>

<p>Felony #2: Illegal leaking of classified information surrounding the completely unjustified FISA warrant against me, which further enabled part of the Clinton/Obama regime’s domestic political intelligence operations and influence campaign in the 2016 election – On April 12, 2017, the Washington Post published an article explaining that unnamed sources had revealed the completely unjustified FISA warrant to intercept my communications throughout the final months of the reign of the Clinton/Obama regime.(10) Given a growing list of unanswered questions and apparent abuses regarding this nonsensical invasion of privacy, it seems readily apparent that more revelations about these misdeeds will continue to be learned in the period to come.(11)</p>

<p>. . . Not only did precisely that same continued pattern of abuse reflect her disparagement of Director Comey, it also underscores why I have remained a principal target of the Clinton/Obama regime’s surrogates including those in Congress. As a perceived weaker party, I have also been effectively and falsely characterized as a narcissistic loony tune amidst other far worse false accusations by the Clinton/Obama regime. In a revealing New York Times article based on illegal leaks, “The [Obama] Justice Department considered direct surveillance of anyone tied to a political campaign as a line it did not want to cross, the official added.”(16) In other words and consistent with the narcissistic loony tune school approach, they apparently decided it was fine to trample on human rights if someone is a low-level, junior, unpaid supporter rather than a fellow fat-cat career politician from the Washington swamp.</p>

<p>Manafort‘s charges are for not registering as a foreign agent for the pro-Putin party in Ukraine, and laundering Russian cash. Rick Gates hired a guy known for negotiating plea deals and let go of three lawyers, one who revealed he was told Gates was going to be handed more charges (meaning its likely Manafort will be as well)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how sweetheart of a deal they actually received was. To me, a sweetheart deal would be the same deal Huma and the other aides got in the Clinton email &quot;matter&quot;. Immunity. We&#39;ll see how this plays out. I&#39;ve yet to see any real or leaked evidence of Trump/Russia collusion. In fact all I&#39;ve seen recently is the goal posts being moved to obstruction of justice. Which I have a hard time buying if in fact Trump is innocent of Russian collusion. I mean Trump didn&#39;t fire McCabe, and yet he&#39;s no longer with the FBI. Think it may have something to do with his handling of certain matters the past few years and the upcoming report from the IG on the topic? If it is, then Comey would be right beside him. Which gives merit to Trump letting the man go after he&#39;d so ineffectively ran the agency. But again, we&#39;ll see.</p>

I mean you claim all these things that are against Trump when if I remember the msm talked about hillarys email like 24/7 bro. Heh. If you went back and watched the election as a independent like I did you&#39;d see a very different picture. The FBI cost Clinton the election. The GOP used their committees to frame Clinton as a criminal. Whether you agree with that or not it happened. Yiu say the whole city of Chicago was working against Trump? The fuck are you talking about. You can&#39;t just say things and they are magically true. There is curroption on both sides and you&#39;ve bought in to the game.
