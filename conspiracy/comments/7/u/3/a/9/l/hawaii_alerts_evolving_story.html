<p>Because the first lie was either discovered to <em>be</em> a lie, or because the first lie was convincing enough for the perpetrators to get what they wanted.</p>

<p>A good question. Definitively this is all a lot of bullshit. The larger question is for what purpose? A false flag blamed on North Korea as an excuse to start a major war?</p>

<p>Yes, that is comforting psychologically. But it is only a theory. The truth is there was no missile. The government, military and media <strong>lied</strong>. </p>

<p>As I experienced the alert text first hand, part of me felt it was hacked or something. Reading &quot;THIS IS NOT A DRILL&quot; didn&#39;t seem right with me.</p>

<p>Also, if someone wanted to cause trouble, I doubt they&#39;d send just one.</p>

<p>And why would the government even allow the worker to admit he thought there was a real missle incoming? No one else admitted that but him. Sounds like another patsy to me.</p>

<p>To me too. Now, the real question is what was/is the government ultimately planning? This wasn&#39;t done just so some one could have a good laugh (though I&#39;m sure a few people actually did). This isn&#39;t over yet.</p>

<p>I feel like if we were getting missiles shot at us the government wouldn&#39;t want us to know just for sake of keeping chaos at a bare minimum. If the missile got shot down then great, label it a meteor and nobody would be the wiser. </p>

<p>I think there was possibly a missile inbound to Hawaii, authorities felt it was imminent so sent out a warning, missile got shot down and to avoid mass panic they brushed off the warning as a &quot;mistake.&quot; All I can say this story is way too fishy for it not to be a coverup. </p>

<p>Compare racial search queries between “google” and bing.  Compare results of querying various moral wrongs, and attribute them to different races.  XX slave traders. XX rapists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s an interesting test I hadn&#39;t thought of before, even if you just use one search engine. While I don&#39;t imagine it would uncover any vast racial conspiracy, it would be interesting to see the kinds of results Googling &quot;white rapists&quot; vs &quot;black rapists&quot; vs &quot;Hispanic rapists&quot; would bring as a reflection of how they get talked about in the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, that&#39;s what I meant - what are you referring to as the second one? I assume this means you were referring to Japan.</p>

<p>I know people here don&#39;t like to believe in coincidences and usually I&#39;d agree with that, but I&#39;m not sure that the two (Hawaii and Japan) were connected. Hawaii was an official alert from the government, while the Japanese one was from media. That said, I didn&#39;t realize until right now (reading about this in the other tab) that it was the public broadcaster in Japan who sent out the message - but still I think there&#39;s a fundamental difference between (even a public broadcasting) media company sending out something incorrect and the government sending an official warning out to every phone.</p>

Why doesn&#39;t every employee know there is a drill? employee that pushed button, who we are told has a history of misidentifying drills as real occurences, is in charge of the computer that sends warning messages. Instead of him checking to see if this was real or just a drill, he states in his text &#39;THIS IS NOT A DRILL&#39;. Why was the drill not reported on the first day? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.  We have an island full of tourists. They all have their phones and cameras and telephoto lenses at the ready.
