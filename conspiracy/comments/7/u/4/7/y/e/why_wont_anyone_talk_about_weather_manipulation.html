    <div class="md"><p>Out of all the viable conspiracy topics I&#39;ve seen on here, any time I make a comment or share a link about this subject, it gets near immediately countered with some bs explanation and/or insult to me or my thinking personally.  I do find it fascinating that whenever I bring up the subject of weather manipulation in person, or just point out the &#39;sky painters&#39; pumping <em>godknowswhatkindof</em> aerosols into our atmosphere, that most people won&#39;t even question it <strong>if they have noticed it at all</strong>.  And if you say the word &#39;chemtrails&#39;, they automatically think you&#39;re a nutter.  But, the one thing that cannot be disputed: free form aluminum.  It doesn&#39;t exist naturally, yet levels of nano particle aluminum in soil and water have been on the rise for decades. IIRC, it has gone from zero to ~300-400ppm in the 1990s, to 30-40,000 ppm in recent years.  What I fear most is irreparable damage to the ecosystems of this planet...by a seemingly invisible force.</p>

<p>And where are the studies on the effects of aluminum nano particulate inhalation by humans? Oh wait, if people don&#39;t realize what they&#39;re breathing in, they won&#39;t care about any studies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, even if the nano aluminium story is true and higher levels ARE being found, what makes you immediately point to the sky and declare that&#39;s where it&#39;s coming from? There is nothing to link this chemtrails / barium / aluminium conspiracy together. Not a single fact. And the whole conspiracy falls apart as soon as you start testing its claims. You can&#39;t even agree on what those claims are. Is it geoengineering, or population control, or something else? How about its just gullible people believing charlatans like Dane Wigington? It is just fear porn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand what &#39;being objective&#39; means. It means you look at all sides of the argument without any confirmation bias. I have looked at all and every new and old chemtrail claim. There isn&#39;t one &#39;undeniable fact&#39; claimed by chemtrailers that I haven&#39;t been able to explain with established science. The point I&#39;m making is.... sites like geoengineeringwatch are there to suck you in with astounding tales and take your money by selling you orgone accumulators and other useless shit. They are the modern day equivalent of National Inquirer. I doubt if even some of the people putting it together believe it. Believe what you want, but until you look at the science behind what causes persistent contrails, you don&#39;t know shit. And until you start protesting about real geoengineering instead of fantasy chemtrails you ain&#39;t gonna achieve shit neither.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that site is obviously bullshit but there&#39;s every possibility that it&#39;s a limited hangout a la Alex Jones.  These theories really started spreading around 7-8 years ago (which is when these trails started increasing) and this Dane guy popped up out of nowhere.  Social media was also flooded with posts on the topic almost always with poor spelling and grammar.  In my view, the work of shills to discredit anyone who questions the increase in trails.  Morgellons and all this other shit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for debunking and I support your efforts.  But I have yet to see an explanation for the very obvious increase in these trails globally over the last decade.  My hometown is tiny and until recently you rarely saw planes flying over and certainly no long trails lasting for hours.  I&#39;m talking all year round.  I hear the same story from relatives and friends too.  So please explain, with proof, the increase in planes and the conditions required for persistent trails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. What an unusual comment. The answer to your question is actually so obvious you probably looked beyond it. Air travel is increasing every year at something like 10 percent. Everybody wants two foreign holidays and strawberries at Christmas. Buy some cheap piece of tat off eBay from China and it will arrive by air mail. <a href="https://imgur.com/9nbzZeb">Here</a> is a chart showing the historic rise. More planes mean more congestion on existing routes, so new routes are being opened all the time. The only way we&#39;ll get blue skies back is to radically rethink our aircraft use.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question.</p>

<p>I used to think &quot;chemtrails&quot; were bullshit, then I took a job where I spent a lot of time sitting outdoors and I started noticing them for myself and how they turn into clouds or correspond to other weather events. I started seriously researching it and I realize the stuff is basically declassified and out in the open as &quot;cloud seeding&quot;. I feel like if more people called it that it might be easier to redpill people about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe if you understood the difference between cloud seeding and contrails you&#39;d be less confused. Cloud seeding is done by flying small aircraft in and out of existing rain clouds to spray them with chemicals like silver iodide to make them produce rain. This is done where the rainclouds are; up to about 10,000 feet. The white clouds - contrails made of thousands of tons of ice - coming out of airliners are happening at 25,000 to 40,000 feet. They are not cloud seeding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s interesting is that people have been wanting to manipulate the weather for over 1000 years. Ancient societies trying to create rain or control the sea, so it&#39;s not like it&#39;s an outrageous idea. </p>

<p>Regardless your opinion on whether it&#39;s possible or not, I suggest reading some of the patents from 1920-1980 involving controlling the weather, controlling hurricanes, producing rain and snow.
Here&#39;s an example.
<a href="https://www.google.com/patents/WO2003061370A1?cl=en">https://www.google.com/patents/WO2003061370A1?cl=en</a></p>

<p>The technology to do these things exist, but who knows for exactly how long and who is behind it. I think technology isn&#39;t inherently good or evil, it&#39;s how it&#39;s used, but I feel like this is a different story. If you control the atmosphere you control the world. You control where is rains, where droughts occur, how crops are grown, ect.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re curious who is behind it, as usual, follow the money. Bill Gates is known to fund geoengineering for an undisclosed amount.</p>

<p>there are also opinions that, similarily to water fluoridation, this is all about getting rid of toxic waste by mixing it in jet fuel.<br/>
another possibility is that they are doing this to make conducting electronic warfare easier, including haarp and whatnot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has anyone checked out <a href="https://weatherwar101.com">WeatherWar101&#39;s</a> website? <a href="https://m.youtube.com/channel/UC7ktpNzvxJo8PHD0bLl5K-Q">And here&#39;s the youtube channel</a> The basic run down of most of these videos are that they show massive amounts of water vapor being pumped out of industrial cooling towers, and then the storms that form as a result. He also shows how these storms can be directed and replenished over certain areas. <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=481s&amp;amp;v=yRZRe5nCofo">Here&#39;s a decent video to start with</a>. I guess because the videos tend to be slow, unneccesarily long, and on the boring side, thats enough to keep people from watching? Regardless, the content is fascinating to me.</p>

<p>Whether it is true or not, weatherwar101 has been bizarrely absent from the geoengineering discussions I&#39;ve seen on reddit. To me, his videos present more compelling evidence for geoengineering than anything else I&#39;ve seen.</p>

<p>I admit I don&#39;t know much about weather systems or the capabilities of large industrial infrastructure to say for sure that what ww101 talks about is true. But I do know that any time I bring it up, the only thing people can say about it is that it can&#39;t be true because there would be too many people involved for it to be kept secret. That simply does not debunk it to my satisfaction. And, strangely, I  <em>always</em> get a so-called expert in industrial infrastructure who has visited dozens of sites and claims that there is no way it can be true because they would have seen it.</p>

<p>Also if you run a search for &quot;weatherwar101&quot; the official website doesn&#39;t come up. You&#39;ll find the youtube and social media sites and his old blog, but not the current site. Take what you will from that.</p>
