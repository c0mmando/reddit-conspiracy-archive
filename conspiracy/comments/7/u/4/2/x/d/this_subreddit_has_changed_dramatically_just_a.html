       r/conspiracy used to entertain all sorts of weird and wonderful fodder, UFOs, anomalies, physic ability and forbidden archaeology to name just a few.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the last year or so the sub has been swamped with political threads, corporate corruption and the fact that people in power are arseholes generally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's all old hat, Trump is a twat, Hillary is a cunt and so on and so on. Isnt this all old news?! I remember a time when r/conspiracy used to step over these news turds and focused itself on alternative things, alternative ways of thinking. I see hardly any of that now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't this sub have any time for fringe anymore? Don't we welcome a break from the mundane of politics
      </p>
      <p>
       I am r/conspiracy's longest standing mod and i stepped down because i thought we had a free thought forum in place here, well established.
      </p>
      <p>
       All i see these days is shill accusations, Trump endorsing and Hillary and Obama back and forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Political conspiracy should have it's place but the levels that we are seeing on this sub seem to render all other thought and concept obsolete. It shouldn't be this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this sub fails to be an enclave for alternative ideas and discussion then it has failed completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are repeated posts these day, asking whatever happened to the old r/conspiracy? This post is a rant to show that those questions are not in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/conspiracy should embrace the fringe. Politics is predictable, boring and shackled.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think about other possibilities to escape politics, that is why i originally came to this sub.

       I have a theory that the mind that is most likely to believe conspiracies and spread them without much research or fact checking is the perfect mind to spread political lies and conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is honestly extremely genius of the powers that be.
      </p>
      <p>
       the biggest conspiracy this sub should be looking into is the one that is furiously manipulating the people of this sub to do their political bidding.

       Yes. In Antarctica alone there's a long circular track on Rothschild Island that shows up on the map like it's part of the landscape. There's what looks like an outline of a pyramid at a glacier. There's all kinds of activity all over the world. It's fascinating.

       Well skiing is bicycle speeds so maybe someone was dropped off? It's the kind of activity someone would do with an activity tracker as well. I don't believe the idea that it's all melted there and people just hanging out though. I do know there are bases there for a fact going back 60+ years as there was a military documentary about it.

       I'd believe a billionaire on a ski trip before a facility of that size being active. The Antarctic is just obscenely hostile, but this makes it perfect for super secret facility.

       The billionaire ski trip would make a lot of sense. I believe the secret facilities would be more worthwhile in the port areas rather than farther inland unless they really wanted to establish supremecy over the continent. The pyramid looking thing on the glacier is crazier than the C to me. Apparently there is a marathon run nearby every year. Perfect cover for bringing in supplies etc. It just really doesn't look like a marathon route, but who knows. If there are pyramids on every other continent from an ancient civilization I don't see why there wouldn't be one there. Either way it's fun to speculate.

       That would be the perfect cover.

       Inner Antarctica is even more inhospitable than the edge. That billionaire would be a fuckin thrill seeker for that ski trip. More oxygen than Everest, but the temperature is comparable

       That's why they stop at the mountains.
       <br/>
       The one in the water by Japan is a strange one though. Either someone was using it on a boat, or there's some sort of facility off the coast, as there's no land marked but the tracks have a lot of straight lines.

       GPS also doesn't work under much water. They're very weak radio signals and generally require line of sight for accuracy.

       Well I am speculating. But the point is that we don't know what it is, so we can't conclusively say either way. Have a look for yourself so then you can at least speculate on the material rather than just what I'm saying about it.

       That's the heart of the matter. There's no discussion. It's just people banging heads together thinking that if they hit each other hard enough one's world view will somehow win over the other's.

       A lot of it could be "flame wars" started deliberately, maybe even with bots.
      </p>
      <p>
       A user on Reddit worked as a shill and admitted to using flame wars to distract people.

       <p>
        The gist of what I do is teach computers to do sentiment analysis on social media posts that are of interest to clients, tag them based on their various properties (author, sentiments, keywords, etc), and add them to a giant graph of all social media posts we're interested in, who else has retweeted them or the link, who responded to them, etc. We use this to estimate exposure numbers and influence, and try to isolate the key people in a social graph which are causing an opinion to form. (Ideally, on the order of minutes or hours instead of days or weeks.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Once we isolate key people, we look for people we know are in their upstream -- people that they read posts from, but who themselves are less influential. (This uses the same social media graph built before.) We then either start flame wars with bots to derail the conversations that are influencing influential people (think nonsense reddit posts about conspiracies that sound like Markov chains of nonsense other people have said), or else send off specific tasks for sockpuppets (changing this wording of an idea here; cause an ideological split there; etc).
The goal is to keep opinions we don't want fragmented and from coalescing in to a single voice...

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       By doing this, it can create an avalanche, stirring up a bunch of shit between users, fragmenting everyone into these small polarized groups. It will continue to perpetuate after the shills and bots leave. I don't think they have to do very much. Just target certain ideas and certain people when necessary.

       This is exactly what is going on. Awareness of the problem is the first step to solving it. It's just like ignoring annoying people in real life, you leave them alone. Only issue with taking that approach here is that the profiles and whoever or whatever controls them will change the approach and ramp up the rhetoric or games they play. Even then, it's still possible to combat it. If you see the same patterns over and over, there's a high likelihood that those are not organic posts.

       The solution is to not waste time on Reddit.  It's littered with this garbage.  When you speak to people in real life you can at least gauge they are human, they are not a shill, they are older than x, and you can quickly learn whether they think for themselves.

       This sub is approaching 600K subscribers.  This is a battleground for the minds of those who lurk.  I have, for instance, a post sitting at the top of the front page right now regarding Flight 93 from 911.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this moment, the post has garnered 1390 points and 455 comments.  Meanwhile, the post has had 21K views.  That's a lot of lurkers!  That's a lot of minds who are curious about some of the more crazy details of the official 9/11 narrative.  The people that are commenting tend to be firm in their respective position(s) regarding 9/11 events, but both groups are very cognizant of the fact that the debate going on within the thread may very well change the mind of a respectable amount of lurkers.  This is one of the reasons it can get heated.

       I like to believe that people here are all skeptics, but is this really the case?

       Skepticism requires an ability -- and genuine desire -- to put aside preconceived notions, and consider the evidence objectively, without trying to argue a position before fully scrutinising the evidence.

       Most people are in fact happy to defer to authority, defer to consensus, and simply cherry-pick which myths to be 'skeptical' of.

       I liked your initial comment but that’s a bad comparison, bad question and that test is clearly not based on good research. Even if you want to believe that the scientific consensus is incorrect and oil is not produced by organic matter magma is not drilled out of our crust to be used. The amount of magma that is produced by volcanoes is dwarfed by magnitudes by the amount of oil that is drilled and refined. I say this as a half Kuwaiti who works in oil.

       Well would you look at that, turns out I'm pretty much a complete normie after all. I'll put that down to the benefits of a good education, using critical thinking skills and not accepting bullshit simply because.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all very well to espouse a viewpoint of not accepting things at face value, but there's a limit and after that it just becomes a circlejerk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take this one - " Characters like ‘Plato’ and ‘Strabo’ were real people who existed thousands of years ago." Yup, I'll go with that. We have their writings as the main proof, but also accounts from other people who lived at the same time (teachers, students, relatives) and they also feature in official records of the time. All the evidence points to them being real people who lived c.2k-2.5k years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's the counter-argument here? If the above is what normies think, what do the conspiracy folks think is happening?

       The alternative is called Abiotic theory. Essentially it suggests oil may be made by a geological process. I don't think it denies that some oil is made of trees and dinosaurs. It's unpopular because if true, then oil isn't as scarce as we have been lead to believe.

       You might as well give it up in any event. It was never more than a myth that has caused far more trouble, conflict, and human suffering than any good that was ever attributed to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any good that has come about throughout that long violent and bloody history has all been
       <em>
        in spite of
       </em>
       , not
       <em>
        because

       of that. The occasion wins of normal human sensibilities in their constant struggle against the over-arching personal ambitions and competition between leaders for whom those ordinary people were never anything more but disposable pawns in their games and contests of one-up-man-ship.

       A lot of skeptics get fed up.  A lot of times, especially with political stuff, a skeptic will point out something false and get a response as if they believe the opposite of the person they are correcting.  They get strawmanned, or they just get called a shill, or it is whataboutism.  No real response, just the same responses throughout the whole thread.

       Well would you look at that, turns out I'm pretty much a complete normie after all. I'll put that down to the benefits of a good education, using critical thinking skills and not accepting bullshit simply because.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all very well to espouse a viewpoint of not accepting things at face value, but there's a limit and after that it just becomes a circlejerk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take this one - " Characters like ‘Plato’ and ‘Strabo’ were real people who existed thousands of years ago." Yup, I'll go with that. We have their writings as the main proof, but also accounts from other people who lived at the same time (teachers, students, relatives) and they also feature in official records of the time. All the evidence points to them being real people who lived c.2k-2.5k years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's the counter-argument here? If the above is what normies think, what do the conspiracy folks think is happening?

       Ok now down to brass tacks. So the simple scenario I outlined above is the standard default view. You're coming along and saying that it's not correct. The burden of proof therefore falls upon you, not me. You're making the pretty extraordinary claim that Plato did not in fact exist; as we all know, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence to back them up.

       So, a final attempt to get you to understand (actually, I think you understand perfectly well, but you're being deliberately obtuse for the sake of being annoying and nothing more, but I'll give you one more chance).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll lay it all out again, and I'm going to ask you the question one more time. If you can't or don't answer in your next post, I'll have to assume that it's because you are unable to provide the evidence required, and therefore you forfeit this little debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The standard default view is that Plato was a real person who lived c.2.5k years ago. If you wish to challenge this view, you will have to provide evidence yourself. Remember, the burden of proof falls upon you to support your argument - extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all that in mind then, are you able to present any evidence that challenges the standard view that Plato did indeed exist? And please, no more prevarications or bullshit - do have any evidence to support your theory?

       So what? You claimed that we can see Plato's writings for ourselves, and I asked you a
       <strong>
        simple question

       : where?

       That you are dodging this simple question suggests to me that you have since realised this is in fact not the case.

      <p>
       Rather than ponder the reasons why there are no actual writings by Plato which we can access, you are instead trying to move the goalposts.

       You're still responsible for the burden of production. Your assertion is that "we have these writings". He was asking for you to admit them as evidence. He made zero assertions, he only asked you to provide the evidence to the claim you stated.

       Who actually determines what "a good education" presumably is? How much of anything that we "learned" has any real bearing on our daily lives or in any way makes them better or enables us to genuinely make them any better?
      </p>
      <p>
       Education is a compulsory system that was created not by any ordinary people in light of their wants and needs but by a financial and social elite that simply needed more capable workers in order to make more profits and a system to supply more than enough of them to keep their wages as low as possible by forcing them to compete with one another for those jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       A system where you're basically handed an ever expanding slate of so called facts on a variety of subjects from the time that you're a small child that you must commit to memory and will be judged by how well you can manage do that and accurately repeat and describe them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do that within a classroom setting with others that no one makes any allowances of any kind for what any of their individual talents and abilities may be or what genuinely interests any of them because that isn't important to the system or why it actually exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pace of learning is too slow for the ones who find that kind of memorization easy to do and too rapid for those that don't and more of them fall into one or the other than the few that it's actually suitable for. In short it is very much like work and the working world when it comes to those very same dissatisfactions.
      </p>

       It is, by and large, years of repetitive mental and social conditioning that is structured to create a conformity and a uniformity in both thought and behavior cultivated to accept and always be subservient to some higher authority than their own that will continue on and be no different in their adult lives.

       I didn't say that there weren't any resistors who caught on early and learned to give the system what it wanted while still managing to keep a open mind and an opinion of their own safely tucked away but they are a small minority by comparison. More than a few fed-up rebels too, that bucked it until they were old enough to drop-out.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main point being that it isn't a situation that either encourages or is conducive to independent thinking or learning which is why at least 75% of the population not only isn't very good at it but usually tries to avoid it altogether.

       I'm not sure why Plato's existence is in question,  but perhaps one could be skeptical that his writings were tweaked in translation or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of different theories revolving Atlantis actually use Plato's account of the lost empire as a proof of its existence.  He refers to it as an ancient ocean-trading capable empire.

       I agree, can people can believe whatever they want, and identify however they want.

       The typical normie, however, will generally believe most if not all of the items on that list.

       "Conspiracy theorist" exist on a spectrum.  It is the skeptic's mindset that causes you to begin to question the assumptions of your culture.  Eventually you realize that everything is more complicated than it seems.  Sometimes the fundamental assumptions are true, sometimes false, but they are always more complicated than we are taught.

       Dude, no... C'mon, that link has nothing to do with skepticism, more like an unbridled paranoid delusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a skeptic, through and through. You need to,
       <em>
        at least
       </em>
       , provide some rational anecdotes or counter-arguments that support those points, or source someone that does.
      </p>
      <p>
       My basis as a skeptic goes like this: Is there a theory that supports
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       the observed evidence? If so, then that's likely the most reasonable explanation at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       A theory is valid until repeatable observations prove it false. Some good points may be buried in the article you linked, but chances are you're going to have people bounce out after #2~3.
      </p>

       There are quite a few in the list that I don't support, however the majority I just haven't seen enough evidence to whole-heartedly believe the contrary for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Items on the list I haven't seen any viable evidence to believe in (I believe they are wrong, agreeing with the author's intent):
       <br/>
       9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 28, 34, 35, 37
       <br/>
       (15/37, or 40.5%)
      </p>
      <p>
       Items I see as contested, meaning there is evidence of certain interests being involved in manufacturing these "truths". However the actual nature of the item, as depicted by the author, is a half-truth, either misrepresented or poorly understood:
       <br/>
       3, 5, 8, 15, 17, 18, 25, 26, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 36
       <br/>
       (14/37, or 37.8%)
      </p>
      <p>
       And the remaining items, which I have yet to see
       <em>
        convincing evidence
       </em>
       to the contrary, or those which existing common theories happen to fit the bill better than any alternative theories:
       <br/>
       1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 27
       <br/>
       (8/37, or 21.6%)
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I'm 59.4% normie by those standards.

       Oh man, that list is... Wow. The author seems to think that if he doesn't understand something it can't be true. I'm all for keeping an open mind about shit and questioning everything, so if I see compelling evidence that, for instance, space doesn't exist; and importantly
       <em>
        evidence that outshines the evidence that it does
       </em>
       , then I'll accept it. Believing something just because of a gut feeling is just silly.

       According to that "simple test", to be considered a skeptic or not a "normie", you have to disagree with statements like:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        31) Humans of different races are so similar they ought to live together in mixed communities.

       Years ago, when I first starting lurking on this sub, the front page was new, maybe every two or three days.  There are only so many non political conspiracies.  However the discussions within those top posts were deeply intriguing and informative, and fresh with new information daily.

       Now you see a completely new front page on this sub as quickly has twice a day, yet the post are BS political propaganda, and the discussions within are simply shill trash.

       Now don't get me wrong I am not slamming the mods over this, because most people would agree new fresh content would be a good thing, except when its not...

       Part of it is an increased awareness. Part of it is emotion. Topics that generate strong emotions get more upvotes/visibility and users will respond to that.

       In order to take sides in politics, especially with enough conviction to argue about it online with a stranger, you have broken a vital rule of conspiracy theories: question everything. If you are skeptical about everything else in this world, but are ardently R or D, then your politics are purely emotional.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the problem with modern politics. It is mostly emotional for people, except if you proposed this they would VEHEMENTLY disagree with you. If they don't understand why they hold their position, then nobody else will be able to figure it out either, that's for sure, which makes discussing it nearly pointless. Political opinions are also largely social approval-based, another thing people are loathe to admit.
      </p>
      <p>
       From another angle, though, politics is one, big conspiratorial clusterfuck. The perfect thing to talk about in a conspiracy sub, while keeping it non-partisan, of course. If someone picks a side talking about politics, we should gently remind them that they are falling for normie bullshit.

       For a short time it was taken over by trump supporters. But then the mods started banning them for ridiculous reasons in an attempt to silence them
      </p>
      <p>
       Wich allowed hillarys shareblue to take over
      </p>
      <p>
       And since the mods go easy on shareblue its turned into r politics

       I've said it before and I'll say it again: You can have two astroturfing profiles arguing with each other and acting like idiots and real people join in to argue with a piece of software. It also works the other way, to steer discussion away by having astroturfing profiles identify a real human's post that may not contribute to the discussion in any meaningful way, and those astroturf profiles will back the human up.

       Here's the thing, it's only going to get worse so I would suggest putting your nihilism coat on and giving up. Truth, honesty, fairness, respect are all words that are essentially archaic in this day and age. Kasparov has a great quote about media and propaganda which is something like "the goal of propaganda isn't to make you believe wholeheartedly in a cause, it's to muddy the waters to such an extent that not only doesn't objective fact not matter but the population is so exhausted that they just can't deal"

       Wow you hit the nail on the head. Going to delete my previous comment, because yours is spot on.
      </p>
      <p>
       When did this behavior begin? It seems strange to me that people would even come here if they aren't interested in earnest discussion, and just want to fight. Did the sub suddenly experience an influx of new users from another sub or something?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's strange how angry everyone seems to be. If you agree with them, they're happy campers and it's just one big good time, but if you disagree or even if you agree but are willing to give their opponent the benefit of the doubt, then you'd better be prepared for some abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       There seem to be certain topics that downright trigger people too. For example, the level of abuse I've encountered just for entertaining flat earthers and proposing an experiment they could try is incredible. And I didn't even claim it was a solid experiment, I actually just asked if anyone thought it would work.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were a few good responses and some people had good points which lead me to believe maybe the experiment wouldn't work, but others have just been vile.

       From what I’ve seen it became like this once Trump became a viable candidate. At first Trump supporters from outside this sub came here and some mods who support him flagged posts in suspicious ways. Seems like there was a backlash where anti-Trump people started coming here as well to downvote and argue because they wouldn’t be banned for doing so. And now it’s a constant fight between the two groups to determine what reaches the top. Neither are here because they’re genuinely interested in conspiracies, they’ve chosen their corners.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ll admit I’m not much of a conspiracist and I hate Trump but I don’t think this sub should be consumed by politics. I’ve been a lurker and subscriber here for a long time because I found a lot of the crazier conspiracies hilarious and interesting to read. I try not to vote too much here unless people are being dicks or obviously only here to push an agenda. But it’s clear people on both sides come here to duke it out because their respective main subs are 100% set in their corners whereas this sub there’s at least the possibility for it to go either way.

       From what I’ve seen, and I’m going to get shit for this probably, it is primarily Trump supporters who are combative, hateful, and vile. Maybe I’ve just missed the similar comments from non-Trump supporters? And I’m not talking about if I post against Trump, I would expect to get hate from Trump supporters then.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m saying when I see someone vile, for lack of a better word, they always turn out after the fact to be a hardcore MAGA dude, the full nine yards. And this is after noticing their hate when discussing something unrelated to politics.

       Is it just me? I know it’s partisan of me to say this and maybe I’m contributing to the problem, but it seems like libs are at least willing to not call you a fucking regard and to engage you in a civil discussion.

       People don't like being constantly called idiots, alt-right, white nationalists, rasists, anti-intellectuals, traitors, or Russian bots constantly.  It's not fair to blame their anger on Trump's instruction.  They have been and continue to be constantly prodded.  I'm not trying to claim it only goes one way but to pretend people on the left aren't instigating shit and Trumpers are unjustifiably mad just because their leader promotes hate is severely disingenuous. There is plenty of hate of both sides.  However, most of it has been stirred up artificially.  If you only see hate and wrongdoing on one side you are letting your biases blind you.

       So they got called names and they're getting revenge? I don't get your point.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I get called a leftist I don't go "well if you're going to call me a leftist I'm going to get real angry and push for the seizure of the means of production!" I'm center left, getting called mean names doesn't make me go full communist or irrationally angry at the world.

       Also why do you make it seem like being called a racist online is the worst thing ever? Somehow you can call for the expulsion of an entire religion from the country but call them racists and you all jump to "whoa, whoa, whoa first off it's a religion. Second off even if they were a race, how is that racist? We just want to secure the existence of our people and a future for white children. Calling them racist is horrible!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Also also regardless of why they're angry having an entire political movement supported almost fully by anger and hatred of other races, religions and political leanings is probably not good for the people involved nor our nation.

       You're comment did nothing but demonstrate how your biases manipulate your perception of reality.  You think your side is right and the other side is wrong so calling them names is justified and fine and they shouldn't get mad.

Second off even if they were a race, how is that racist? We just want to secure the existence of our people and a future for white children. Calling them racist is horrible!"

       Racism is when a person believes their race to be superior to others.  A lot of these people just want to keep terrorists out.  I do not agree with the all Muslims are terrorist, I believe we created terrorists, however they believe Islam is a religion that promotes violence.

        Also also regardless of why they're angry having an entire political movement supported almost fully by anger and hatred of other races, religions and political leanings is probably not good for the people involved nor our nation.

       I interpret this as "Regardless of why they are angry, Trump supporters are in the wrong, racist, and full of hate and it isn't good for this country"

      <p>
       Ya I mean that's sort of true. Getting called names shouldn't make you angry at the world and lash out at anyone who disagrees. Does getting called names justify the vitriol and hate his supporters spew towards people like Kaepernick? Or any Muslim really?

       It's kind of hilarious you literally used the first response I made. By the way people use the same excuse to hate Jews, "it's a religion not a race so you can't be racist against them". But even if it's not racist or even bigoted it's still anti-American. We are supposed to judge people by the content of their character, not the color of their skin or where they came from. Calling them all mudslimes isn't just nervousness about terrorism, it's vile hatred. Maybe on stage they won't say their true feelings but go to T_D and see the various heavily upvoted slurs for Muslims. While you're there check out the other racist slurs they'll use for blacks or Mexicans or a variety of other races. You can't pretend it's not hatred when they don't even really hide it.

       You should interpret it as me saying any movement powered by anger and hate is not good for the soul of the people involved nor our nation. And I find it hard for anyone to disagree with that. Regardless of whether their anger is justified, it's still not good for them or us.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It’s meant to muddy the waters and discredit the IC/investigation, you fucking retard. People like you would be of more use to this world if you jumped off a bridge and let a school of fish eat you.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you say stupid shit it doesn’t matter where you post, you will get similar reactions. Maybe you should go back to a sub that confirms your biases.
       </p>
       <p>
        Don't be an idiot. Both sides spin stuff like the long-term effects of a tax or healthcare plan, while this memo is a direct attack on the intelligence community in order to protect Trump. This isn't standard DC spin.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's rich coming from a Trump-supporting piece of trash like you. Public perception always matters, even when things should be cut and dry. Fish are getting hungry.

       This is correct. I know the Russian shit is getting tiring but this is the real conspiracy. They’ve managed to divide not only the U.S, but progressives and conservatives around the world. It’s been proven that they are creating bot and troll accounts to push narratives on both sides.

       Conspiracies are great. It’s fun to question everything. That’s the point of a conspiracy, we’re not supposed to just accept what we are told. But this sub has taken a political turn. And while these conspiracies are valid, either side immediately dismisses them because it goes against their “team”.

       This.
      </p>
      <p>
       To those of you who are secular: I ask you to read even just the first 12 pages of “Culture of Critique” by MacDonald, a CSU professor (
       <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/rebellion2/goyim/je1.pdf">
        http://www.angelfire.com/rebellion2/goyim/je1.pdf
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       To those who look to history or to religion for truth: I implore you to read “The Protocols of Zion” (
       <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/%7EMA01/kidd/thesis/pdf/protocols.pdf">
        http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA01/kidd/thesis/pdf/protocols.pdf
       </a>
       ).  Both are incredibly eye-opening.  What is said
       <em>
        of
       </em>
       these writings also speaks volumes
       <em>
        of the person saying it
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Who owns the banks?  How wealthy are the Rothschilds? (no joke.)  Who owns, and who decides what is produced out of Hollywood?  Who owns the media, and therefore selects (trickle-down) who is hired to write these disgusting pieces of propaganda that wish to de-moralize the population?  Who owns most of the degenerate porn companies that ask our women to perform perverted acts, and tempt our men to be weak of mind and spirit??  Use bing instead of evil google (just compare the results they each give you, in your search for truth!)

       As someone who lurks more than posts/comments, it really seemed like since the last US election it became a forum for right-wing Trumpites.

       I mainly only see the top threads as I don't tend to visit directly (so just see them in my front page feed) and it has been nearly universally pro-Trump stuff for the past year or more.

       Clearly there are a lot more political threads. I think one cause is that government corruption and scandals, as well as the media's suppression of them, is so blatant and egregious that more people are waking up to the conspiracies inside our government. It's unfortunate that so much of the discussion is partisan. We should be looking at these institutional conspiracies without a focus on facts and evidence, not a political agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the excessive political threads may be irksome, the up side is that SO many more people are waking up. Sometimes things have to get worse before people wake up and do something.

       Of course I'm aware of actual, paid shills on reddit, long time reader of
       <a href="/r/HailCorporate">
        /r/HailCorporate

       . The actual community disruption currently is coming from TMOR, politics and TD - not paid shills pushing...something (as I see no coherent message being pushed). There is a difference between shills and trolls.

       Most of the disruption of r/conspiracy and r/politics is coming from left wing groups. Look for talking points like:

       "Not everyone who disagrees with you is a shill!"

       You strongly implied it, although you only said shills weren't a big problem. They are definitely a big problem, including actively attacking anyone who posts here and manipulating the voting, especially in the comments (where reddit admins don't care because it doesn't affect link placement which is what the big corporations care about).

      <p>
       Not necessarily. Military intelligence tends to be more loyal than, say, the CIA. But they were definitely shilling against Trump during the election. Most of their tactics involve disruption and discrediting, rather than favoring one party over the other. And they haven't been very active since the election.

       I said shills are less of a problem than actual humans following trends. Call them useful idiots or people with opinions, whatever; shills implies people being paid (imo). I completely agree with anything said about TMOR brigading, its annoying as fuck to see -50 in threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your second point I just think is just wrong. Someone in the AF paid to post on forums (in favor of the federal government) doesn't give a shit what the message is, they just do their job. Trump is 'signing the paychecks' they'd be shilling for the federal government, and probably interventionist policies in favor of military action. It's just beyond a reasonable opinion to think an E1-E4 is typing something in direct opposition to their boss.

       I can see how you might think that in isolation. But if you look into the facts a bit more, it's not accurate. Air Force has a significantly different culture from Army, Marines, and even Navy. And intelligence within all of the military tends to be
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       different from the regular soldiers.
      </p>
      <p>
       This includes tests to look for psychopathic traits, higher rates of participation in secret societies like the Freemasons, and so on.

       It's a step too far to think that Trump's AF is out there shilling....against him. That just defies logic. If it's happening...someone should tweet the dude, I imagine he'd get right on it. Orders come down from the top...and people follow up. That's just a bridge too far, imo.

       Having moderators delete posts that are 'off topic' is too subjective, and too much work for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest subreddits are more like hubs for more niche subreddits, or dumping ground, depending how you spin it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other subreddits linked in the side bar, r/C_S_T is pretty good.

       Disagree man. This sub's been around for a long ass time and having it just turn into a shitpot would be bad. The problem is tho is when there is a political conspiracy worth talking about on this sub what would we do about it?

       its actually a brilliantly simple idea, kinda like how you do most of your shopping at wal mart because they have every common item you need all together, but you cant get upset when they dont have fiberglass matting and resin. so you go to home depot, but you sure as fuck dont sit there like "yeah they should just combine stores"

       Every conspiracy is interconnected. Casting a veil would effectively hide the bigger picture.

       The calls from bad actors to censor discussion here has been annoying, even when it's apparently an old mod making the call for censorship, but this is actually a decent compromise that would satisfy their complaints without censoring the actual point of this community.

       the entirety of reddit is complete shit. Same reposted shit is always popular same questions asked same topics, all the good stuff is instantly downvoted before it even gets a chance. This whole fucking site is manipulated so bad and its making me so disgusted, where are we to go?

       I keep hearing people say that, but I'm not seeing it.  Granted, a lot of my other interests are outside the realm of politics - but there's a numerous great and niche subs out there, many with active participation.  Further, I appreciate being able to check in and out of different subjects.  From here to
       <a href="/r/powerwashingporn">
        /r/powerwashingporn

       to

       Once a sub gets big enough it becomes compromised though. There are a few subreddits I enjoy that are not very popular and you can tell how much more real they feel.

       one of those IMO, it was just too big, but it certainly had a lot of good content and wasn’t constantly overrun by political posts. But if you’re interested in stuff that doesn’t hit the front page reddit is still just fine.

       The problem arises that a lot of people are interested in conspiracies of political nature. I think that things like Pizzagate and other scandals are the reason why our sub was targeted. Of course, many of those who are interested in these conspiracies are also supporters of Trump, so we get attacked as being partisan and making this sub "T_D2.0". And that seems to be where the back and forth starts coming in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if people just let others discuss whatever conspiracies they want without ridicule, deflecting, defending, etc. we wouldn't have this problem. That means that if people want to discuss Trump-Russia collusion, Trump supporters shouldn't attack them either. Probably just wishful thinking, though.

       Someone corect me if I am wrong, but wasn't there a mass migration from T_D to r/conspiracy around a year ago?  Can someone please post a link or explain what happened or how the moderators cooperated to receive T_D transplants (or make conspiracy more welcoming to Trump supporters)?

       People who browse and post in T_D also post here. That shouldn't be a surprise, nor should it be particularly controversial. I don't think the term "migration" makes sense because its not like they left T_D. I do think many of them probably started coming here more when Hillary started running because of the conspiracies surrounding her, and then Wikileaks with the DNC and Podesta emails, and Seth Rich also provided really good conspiracy fodder. It seems like some people have a really big problem with that, but in my opinion, if you don't like that content then you should just ignore it. Block those users if it really annoys you that much.

       I agree with you on every point.  However, there was
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       specific that happened which resulted in many T_D users who before, had no activity on
       <a href="/r/con">
        /r/con
       </a>
       , to become regulars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, I think I may remember.  T_D subreddit was suspended And conspiracy's moderators posted an announcement welcoming T-D users.  I believe that's what I am remembering.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was a mistake.  No because it was an invitation for T_d, but because it appeared partisan and will forever be used to dismiss the community entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example; One's argument is immediately dismissed because he's a "trump supporter".
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because he posts in conspiracy!
      </p>
      <p>
       But conspiracy users are by and large non-partisan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, what about mods 'teaming' with the_donald?
      </p>
      <p>

Can you see how that hurt conspiracy in the long run?

       Personally, I find it hard to believe that a bunch of Trump supporters with no interest in this sub became permanent members here just because of that Mod post (which for the record, I don't remember seeing but I'll take your word for it). I'd have to see the post itself to really give my opinion on it, but it does sound really strange from what you've said.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even assuming that is true, is it so bad that there are people here who support Trump? I guess I shouldn't be surprised if people say, "yes, that's a problem," but that seems like a pretty intolerant view to have, and in my opinion that outlook is a big part of the problem.

       I'm not saying that you're making it up. Just that, even if they saw that post, if they had no real interest in conspiracies in the first place I can't imagine them sticking around here for very long.
      </p>

       I think there is a lot of natural overlap between these conspiracy theories and support for Trump due to his generally anti-Establishment nature (and I know we could debate that). At least that's sort of how I see myself.

       Same here. I didn't really gravitate towards ANY conspiracy theories until I became disillusioned with the MSM during the election. As a result, I started visiting T_D...and later ended up here.

       It wasn't a "hostile takeover" attempt--more of a natural progression for me.

       Well, just so people don't start going on subjective experiences, I've been disillusioned with the MSM for a long time and I don't frequent T_D. I came here because people dig, and that's what I find the most interesting.

       OP made a point. It is bad, and it is indeed a problem that many new r/conspiracy users aren't aware of, or don't understand, or ignore the corruption of our political systems and "support" either side at all, allowing themselves to be divided and distracted.

       Well I think that's a pretty silly and intolerant view to take. And frankly, it doesn't matter how you feel about it. It makes total sense that people who support an anti-Establishment figure who is exposing corruption come to a conspiracy forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is a problem is all the people who have suddenly arrived here touting the MSM Establishment narrative like all the other major subs in Reddit. Literally arguing against conspiracies using Project Mockingbird talking points. And they vote manipulate like the rest of reddit, as can be seen here. This sub wasn't always like that.

       ...which has/had a history of condemning the political system as a staged puppet show. The script writers saw the people wanted disclosure and an end of corruption, so they painted a puppet with orange hair and characterized it as "Anti-Establishment".

       Don't get me wrong, I rooted for Trump too. I went around and told everyone toldyaso. It's the best thing to happen to drive home the point: the republic democracy or democratic republic or whatever you prefer to call it is hopelessly broken. And once he has disappointed and shattered all the dreams like Obama has, maybe the nations finally come to their senses, peek behind the curtain and rethink their whole approach to collective decision-making.

       Here's the thing: you think Trump is a puppet, and I don't. I can accept your view and I'm not going to say that you shouldn't be posting here for falling into that thought-killing cliche. Its your opinion and you're welcome to it. I even enjoy entertaining that idea myself, and I always remain open to the possibility.

       But, I remain cautiously optimistic about Trump and you seem to have a problem with that. But its your problem, not mine, and I'm going to keep giving my honest opinions on the matter. If you don't like what I have to say, feel free to block me.

       Ha, I gave him the benefit of the doubt. But I have a simple metric: has the 9/11 case been reopened, all witnesses been called in, all evidence secured, all suspects ordered not to leave the country? Or is he still playing 6D chess?

       I'm not calling you dishonest, necessarily. Go ahead and read the thread and come to your own conclusion. However, many dishonest users have conveniently misread that thread and repeated the lie over and over. I don't believe this was entirely organic. For all I know, you are an honest user who has fallen victim to the gaslighting.

       The bottom line is that the claim is nonsense. It was a perfectly innocuous thread but somehow it has become a favorite talking point almost every time the "T_D 2.0" debate comes up.

       In my mind, the problem here is the display of personal bias which provides ammunition for detractors (and shills) to attack the sub and group all conspiracy theorists as "Trump supporters".

       Mods (in my opinion) should show no signs of preferential treatment.  Just look at the first three comments as a prime example.

       This is a battle of hearts and minds.  And meme warfare.  What you say as a moderator reflects on the community.  Showing any preference whatsoever for any side caqused preconceived notions from people who casually come aross
       <a href="/r/con">
        /r/con
       </a>
       , that it is a partisan community.  Which couldn't be further from the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But appearances are everything in a community like this where most users form their opinions from nothing more than the titles of posts.

       I'm just confused how telling people that we will ban them specifically, if they fail to follow our rules is preferential treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had made a post to /politics users telling them specifically, that we would ban them if they break our rules... You guys would he bitching aboute singling them out.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I singled out TD posters who were suddenly here one day when TD went dark, you call it preferential treatment.  I literally warned them that I would ban them, I had already banned like a dozen of them which is why the sticky was posted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't fucking win with you people i swear to God.   The sub sucks now because you fucking collectivist are more sensitive than a sunburned penis.  You guys misrepresent every god damned thing, and the majority of our new liberal users refuse to allow space for traditional conspiracies to exist here.  It's turning into "March against Trump" in the comments and it's fucking boring.  I have little doubt that half of you are real users and the other half are paid record corrections.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the Donald goes and what I hate about them, I fucking hate memes.  I was one of the main mods who put the no meme rule in effect (I dare you to remove that rule) I fucking hate the constant circle jerk in the comments there with no actual conversation.  But at least they are willing to discuss some vaccine conspiracies and AGW conspiracies.  This self imposed "the science is settled" bullshit from the left is fucking madness.  The science is not settled, it's politicized like everything else in this corrupt fucking world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope the ring leaders of our surveillance state went too far and spied on a presidential candidate.  I hope it all comes out to the public and I hope they all get arrested.  It's literally the best chance we have to save the nation without rivers of blood in the streets.  The status quo of political elites like Hillary being immune to the law and the media running cover for them is exactly how you end up smack in the middle of the hell you folks claim to be trying to avoid by "punching Nazis".  It's hilarious.  The Nazis we're the ones going around punching their political opponents, read a fucking book.

       You mods should probably even have different accounts you use to participate in threads so you can stop making potentially biased comments. It would detract from our arguments against you, that you're biased. And it would remove the potential of impropriety. Just stop giving us ammo to call you biased, it's really not hard.

       We have two options: our moderators can be open about their biases or they can hide them. What we can
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       have is unbiased moderators. I don't mean to say that moderators should moderate according to their biases, but EVERYONE has a bias. This is a basic part of our individual worldviews. It's much healthier for moderators to share their biases openly because that makes it so much harder to get away with biased moderation. It's slightly unintuitive, but think about it for a moment. If a moderator wanted to play favorites, the best way to do that would be to fly under the radar as a bland, faceless moderation machine. That's what automoderator is for. I prefer moderators to be real people with real opinions because
       <em>
        that's what they are

       I'm not sure how that really showed preferential treatment. In fact the whole thread was to tell them that they would
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       be given preferential treatment. He spoke in their language to make sure they got the point and he used humor to lighten a bizarre moment in subreddit drama history.

       There is
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       wrong with that thread. There is something wrong with the people who think that thread had
       <em>
        anything at all
       </em>
       to do with an influx of
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       users, because that makes zero sense if you think about it for one microsecond. There is something wrong with the shills who took that thread as an opportunity to further their goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get your point, I just don't like the idea of moderators pandering to the lowest common denominator. People might think this, shills might do that, so let's all just hide our political views rather than expecting users to accept the reality that we all have political differences and
       <em>
        that's okay
       </em>
       , even for moderators. He laid his bias out on the table candidly and this is something we should all be able to do in a non-partisan community. In my opinion he was just calling things the way he saw them. Agree or disagree, there is a productive conversation to be had. On the other hand we have countless threads that start with a personal opinion that Trump is a turd and then immediately chastise the community for being too partisan, completely blind to their own hypocrisy. For those people, non-partisan really means, "Don't like Trump openly or my head will explode". Well, too bad, some people like Trump, and they have their own reasons. It is precisely because this is a non-partisan community that we should be able to discuss these issues respectfully no matter what political views are expressed.

       I get your optics argument, I just find it a bit weak to blame

       because
       <em>

       that our users can't handle political differences.

       I've also tired of trying to explain that TD citizens don't actually think Trump is a god emperor and they only call him geotus to annoy the hypersensitive left.  The whole fucking language there is a big joke and a stand against PC SJW culture that ruins everything it touches.

       The middle ground is growing as fewer and fewer people identify with a political party.  The fact that a place like this has become a battle ground is not at all unexpected and it will only get worse if current trends continue.  This should not be unexpected.  Trump expedited this, but even without him, the middle would still be growing and as such, it will continue to be a battle ground.

       What makes me partisan? I support what I feel is right, I certainly don't blindly support Trump or support party lines. For example, fuck the vast majority of the Republican party and fuck Trump's support of Israel, among other issues. I am intellectually honest in my views, I just happen to support most of what Trump is doing and I want to see those who are truly corrupt and damaging this country brought to justice. Just because you disagree with my outlook on these things doesn't make me partisan.

       Partisan doesn't mean you don't agree with the viewpoints you espouse, it means you consistently land in the corner of one party, which you do. And hey, you can absolutely feel free to believe whatever views you want, but bemoaning the state of this sub as a partisan warzone when you are a champion of one army is hypocritical.

       How do I consistently land in the corner of one party if I generally hate both parties and the way they legislate? I think the Bushes were just as bad, if not worse, than the Clintons or Obama. I actually voted for Obama. My views are more right-leaning and nationalist, but that's different than being partisan. Those are just my views.

       Every single one of Trumps policies outside of the TPP line up 100% with the republican party. You can pretend you hate both parties. But all that means is you're a Trump Republican that thinks old school republicans are lame even though you share all the exact same values.

       I'm generally a lurker, and I don't really like to argue, but I constantly see you on one side of the "divide" in here. Almost every political thread. You say stuff like what I just cut and pasted, posted mere hours ago, but then you're in here bemoaning the divide.

       It looks insincere, at the least.

       Do you think I shouldn't say that because some people might take offense, even if its an actual observation of mine? Granted, that thread really isn't good conspiracy material. Its probably not worth commenting on that sort of thing in the future. Point taken.

       I don't see how people could take actual offense to such a silly statement. But why say such a blanket, broad and frankly silly opinion on a conspiracy thread? All that does is further the divide.

       I'm loathe to say "Keep it in the Donald," but that's exactly the place for that. I think you'd be hard pressed to find people in
       <a href="/r/politics">

       even saying something like "Conservative women are uglier than liberal women".

       But that's just my two cents. I read that was shook my head, came in here and saw you make this post. But thanks for being receptive.

       Ya I constantly see bloody in multi level comment threads arguing with people who don't agree to what side they agree with. It's a 2 month old account so I'm pretty sure it's someone evading a ban here (possibly due to non stop arguing) or someones alt to help agree with what they are saying on another account (considering 99% of their posts are in this sub only).
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, they are part of the campaign to divide and conquer.

       There is no campaign to divide and conquer this sub lmao.
      </p>
      <p>
       The explanation for the change of topics in this sub is that many of us have grown up. Many of us have fallen for really stupid conspiracy's that seemed very credible at the time, and after falling so many times, you eventually sway yourself into more 'credible' stuff. I like to use Rogan as an example, I remember liking his podcasts a lot, years ago because he ate up many CT's back in the day, and now he is more conservative and likes to throw in sources when making claims.

       I think that a lot of people feel like things are about to explode politically, economically and militarily. Everyone is so charged up even trying to stay as neutral as possible I find myself curious about the numerous leaks and scandals appearing nearly every day. I feel like if a shtf situation is about to occur that I want to understand the truth about it so I can know where to stand. I don't know if that makes sense to anyone else but it feels like that's what this community is trying to discern with all of the politics lately.

       I personally believe that pretty much the whole American government is corrupt and in need of a good reset. The best part of both parties attacking each other so intensely is all the awareness this is creating in the general public of this corruption.

       This is exactly how I feel.  There are many theories and opinions in r/conspiracy I disagree with, but I'm also open to the theory.  And if/when shtf I want to be able to at least see it coming and recognize what is happening.

       I know what you mean dude. We literally have the government declassifying their remote-viewing research, combined with the admission of the UFO phenomenon, and strong indications that they are more than just physical craft.

      <p>
       I mean, we have the government tangentally implying that there is more to reality than materialist science would have us believe, and all people can do is shitpost about the day's political talking points.

       What’s it take to start a new sub? Similarly minded, conspiracy with some corruption coverage or subterfuge. But also banning auto mods/bots.  I don’t like much that takes me out of the app and to a revenue generating page. It’s like click bait.

       The Alphabet Agencies do lie. Why do they lie?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is every lie based on the premise that "we need to fuck over the common man for our money masters"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainly some. Could some lies be because humankind actually found the door to the ultimate nature of reality and that scared the shit out of the humans who found it? Being a human with a (self described) decent theory of mind, I would say so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too often we assume that those in government are these ubermensch who don't take shits, who don't have personal lives, who don't have a connection to the plight of humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess what, they're human too. People don't want to get fired or look bad to their peers and superiors, so shit gets covered up, truths obfuscated, speculations codified.
      </p>

       I hope that gives you a new perspective to mull over.

       Project Bluebeam is an elaborate hoax not based merely on "money." Nobody implied they weren't human, but I assume you're open to the idea that they are undercover reptilians. Thanks for your brilliant insight though.

       Their "lie" only got five minutes of fame, then the news went immediately back to The Trump Show.

       Project Bluebeam is long-term. The UFO story got front-page news for the day. Do you really expect it to last longer than however long they want to cover it for? Everyone believes in aliens and wants it to happen. It's a mainstream conspiracy theory that gets plenty of coverage.

       The powers that be did a great job of discrediting John Podesta, the most vocal political proponent of disclosure out there, right before some disclosure actually happened. Thus, any discussion about the subject is replaced with pizzagate.

       Dude everything gets tied back to pizzagate. Q has the same fingerprints all over it. A couple well placed coincidences, a provocative source, a bunch of people with too much intelligence and not enough independence, and a movement is born.

       Podesta got slandered hard because he was trying to get this out. It is too early to tell, but part of me wonders if this is the beginning of truly raising up the common person to the level of abundance and freedom as today's billionaires?

       Podesta had been blueballing his donors for years over UFOs.  The recent disclosures are from Harry Reid anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta is a political consultant who has helped authoritarian regimes such as Azerbaijan through his consulting company.  He also just so happens to understand the X-files demographic of America.  Podesta hasn't demonstrated himself to be trustworthy

       This sub is now a refugee center for banned/outcast people from other political subs and religious fanatic nutjobs.
       <br/>
       Also one of the biggest problem is that most users think the world is spinning around USA and Trump.  It triggers me whenever I read "our nation", "our homeland" and "our president" - it's like assuming every person on reddit is from USA.

       So bored of people (and this goes for reddit as a whole) assuming everyone is American. Ruins so many discussions because instead of discussing everything devolves into people arguing why they are or are not whatever stereotype the other person accuses them of being.

       Canadian here, I agree. Reddit is bigger than the U.S. but because of the Trump war it’s taken over everything. Even r/Canada feels like an American political sub now. It’s just another battleground between progressives and conservatives.

       Agreed. One way to solve this problem quite quickly would be to absolutely come down hard on shill accusations, whether explicit or implicit. Why? Because without the ability to constantly talk about shills and how only shills would believe this or that, and how this sub is a "battleground" between shill and "organic" users, 75% percent of people who post about that stuff would have nothing left to say.

       thats why you play it safe and draw it a little to one side or the other, like historical politics is fine, but no fuckin current event politics, send that shit to a new sub. its easy, it just takes some time and trial and error to develop a solid set of rules. then you put them in the sidebar, tadaa

       i mean it's political because literally the biggest conspiracy in decades involves the president. it would be wrong if it wasn't the main topic of discussion here of all places. the shit posting comes almost exclusively from the_donald.

       That's what I'm thinking, either a new specifically fringe topic subreddit OR ban political posts here and have them moved to a new sub. I'd love to see tgis sub (or a new one, headed by the old mods) return to classic conspiracy stuff.

       You'll have to leave reddit to get that.  It's not the platform it was just 5 years ago.  Cultural Marxists politicized everything, now censorship and shilling is the new norm.  It's a systemic problem for the whole site, not just this sub.

       One way to return some some sense of 'normalcy' would be to ban/lock any politic topic. Do that for a month, take the ban off, and see if that tones down the shill-factor. Can't hurt to try something along those lines.

       I think people are starting to realize that this is the new battleground.  The fight for control over people's thoughts and opinions is here on the internet and no longer just on TV.  People are either seeing this and "fighting" back or they go elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish conspiracy was just simply about UFO's and bigfoot type stuff but its not that any longer.  I feel like those are pretty much irrelevant now given how obvious that the fight is raging right in front of us.  Here and now, we are being engaged.
      </p>
      <p>
       To disregard this effort on us, is an injustice.  That's just how I feel.  I take that effort and work seriously because it does affect how my world is shaped.

       Bigfoot, Nessie and spontaneous combustion no longer mean anything.  Political manipulation is a little bit more pressing an issue.

      <p>
       I know that plays right into the hands of those who are here to incite poor responses in people and muddy the waters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering you can't have a proper political discussion on r/politics at all without being banned, I think this is one of the last few places it can be done.  I'm taking advantage of this opportunity to speak my mind.

       Political manipulation is old. But the scale and degree of weaponization of it that we are currently existing under is unprecedented. Social media allows for mass, personalized targeting with high contagion. While the biggest datasets on human behavior in the history of the species allow the message and its effects to be fine tuned and predicted to a horrifying degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate the false political divide that is used to steal our power, but to me it seems obvious that political manipulation is by far the most pressing conspiracy of our day.

       Assuming the best, you're just not looking hard enough. You're really gonna discount an entire decade? The rise of social media and access to easier access to a computing device has changed the landscape compared to 2008. Most of the planet is connected, and info dissemination is no longer as centralized.
      </p>
      <p>
       New arguments are being had about topics such as technological censorship, surveillance, immigration, globalism, nationalism, the differences between sexes, genetic population differences, and transhumanism just to name a few. The landscape having changed so much has allowed for loads of "new"(perhaps because they were held back or just weren't pertinent at the time) arguments to be heard on these subjects.

       Reddit is a battleground to sawy peoples views.  Since this last election it will never be the same place you used to visit. There is too much traffic here to not make it this way. I used to come to this sub to relax and see some outside the box thinking. Now it is almost as toxic as r/politics. There are some great people on this sub that are getting drowned out by bots, narrative driven accounts and just plain old circle jerking.

       I would also expect this subreddits subscribers to know better...but we've had such an influx of "others" who don't know discussion who are ignorant and close minded but you can't really blame these people for being ignorant but you can blame them for fighting among other individuals who have different views. it's sad really and this sub isn't one I frequent much anymore as opposed to 3 or 4 years ago when this used to be my default go to sub.

       Suggestion for the mods:
      </p>
      <p>
       Flairs/filters
      </p>
      <p>
       This would solve all problems. Like, look at
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology
       </a>
       . Don't wanna read about net neutrality? Just filter it and you won't see any submissions about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Create flairs and add a new rule about flair/filters. So you'd have flairs: politics, history, banking, 9/11, technology, society etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fair enough?

       This is a great idea. I come here to discuss conspiracies, so I would be pissed off if the mods started censoring discussion of conspiracies involving governments. Those are the best fucking conspiracies to discuss! But if there were tags and filters, people who come to r/conspiracy to discuss wacky shit like psychics rather than actual proven conspiracies would be able to easily find what they're looking for too.

       I didn't say anything was "fake". Psychics are not a conspiracy because the word conspiracy means "a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful." That's all that word means, and if the topic doesn't have to do with a group planning/doing harmful things, then it's not a conspiracy.

       All of the political subs are currently cancerous because of establishment agenda moderators. The mods of this sub have held it together long enough to turn the tide in an uncountable number of political and economic conspiracies. Maybe.

       Agreed political conspiracy is obvious we all know we are being fed lies and bullshit. Feels like its getting harder and harder to not be consumed by politics. I know I was letting it get the best of me for a while but I have tried to chill out. Would much rather talk about aliens, UFOs old religions etc.

       RIP Godlikeproductions, it was my favorite conspiracy forum in the mid 2000s but it gradually devolved into a hyper partisan cesspool, mostly far right wing identity politics type stuff, same thing happened over at Redicecreations which was another place I used to frequent. I remember when Alex Jones used to reject the false left/right dichotomy too, the idea that our entire political system was compromised used to be central to his work many years ago but now look at him, just another partisan mouthpiece....man this is the conspiracy we need to be talking about here lol, the complete subversion of almost all major conspiracy sites and figures, like wtf happened?

       There's an eccentric alternative physicist called Jack Sarfatti - lots of unusual ideas in the 60s, 70s etc., was featured in the book 'The Hippies Who Saved Physics' and claimed an unusual experience when he was a child of being phoned from the future by a mysterious figure. Fast forward to today and ... he spends a lot of time retweeting Pro-Trump memes on Twitter.

       Even the comments section of a site like Crazy Days and Nights, which has always been all about salacious celebrity gossip - who screwed who, who likes nasty porn, who abused their power and hurt someone, etc - has turned into this.

       This sub ain't ever going back to the old days. Even in the old days we all agreed Obama was just another puppet. So when our politics all seemed to align there seemed to be no problems, ain't that always the problem?
      </p>
      <p>
       The president openly uses twitter now. The internet hive mind has made conspiracy mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we can possibly directly tweet the president about UFO disclosure and if you trust him on his answer then conspiracy solved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regular "normies" are on the street talking about conspiracy. Randomly in facebook threads you see a guy throw out Seth Rich or someone making a Trump is Putin's bitch joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's two ways about this IMO... Aliens and UFOs are real and our politics don't matter. Or we haven't been visited and our politics is everything that matters until our planet dies.

       Most conspiracy theorists believe:
9/11 was shady;
Vaccines are dangerous;
Obama has ulterior motives and wasn't a paradigm of altruism;
Kennedy was killed by the CIA;
The media has an agenda;
And elections are rigged.
      </p>
      <p>
       So does Trump.
He's the man--a folk hero to the organic users of this sub. 
And that attracted a high degree of opposition and (paid) dissent.
Ask yourself this: would conversation here improve more if liberals or conservatives were banned?
Flip that on it's head: show me a good left leaning conspiracy site. You can't.
Go to glp, ats, or /x/ for your conspiratard fix until these bozos start banning the marxists in our midst.

       Here is the whining I'm referring to. 
It's spineless. 
I pointed out what's wrong, and you take offense to it, rather than addressing the point.
Conspiracy theorists tend to lean right, you faggots come here to battle on our turf, because the_donald bans you. 
You should be banned here, so then we could talk about Planet X, Atlantis, Mk ultra, and countless other fun conspiracies.
Instead we need to like, wow man, worry about the conversation being injected with things that make you uncomfortable, like, woooow man.
Faggot.

       Why the hell wouldn't political conspiracies be a foundation of this subreddit, especially given the MSM Trump-Russia narrative, the Steele Dossier, the new Cold War era feel, the tangibles.....DUH. It's all bursting at the seams with interesting stuff.

       When I first found R/conspiracy we were talking about how the government was about to admit that aliens had visited earth and our government has been communicating with them. There were all these credible leaks and UFO sightings and it's all seemed took be adding up to something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if a post is about an alien they mean it's an illegal alien and it's a big fight about Democrats and Republicans.

       Honestly, if I wanted too read about political conspiracies I would go read my uncle Larry's Facebook posts. I think r/conspiracy to be better than my crazy uncle Larry.

       But we have the Conspiracy theory of all Conspiracy theories unfolding right before our very eyes!!! Which links together almost all previous conspiracy theories as one giant conspiracy theory consisting of all the individual conspiracy theories over time! The White hats are using Trump and the military to take down all the perpetrators of said conspiracy theories! Exciting times we live in! Hence the new focus...Q came on the scene pretty much exactly 3 mo. ago to show us what has been, and is, unfolding behind the scenes.

       I just click the hide button on any bot/shills post and r/conspiracy actually looks like it did in the past. It's easy to forget that politics and conspiracy has always gone together in certain subjects like the moon landing, 9/11, the start and end of the Vietnam war, and the business plot of 1933.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference between those eras and now is we get so much information so fast that certain weird events from earlier this month (Hawaii missile threat on Jan 13) seems like it was forever ago in our minds and we get right back to my side vs your side with cheap distractions that have no info. Just upvote and discuss what you like and click the downvote button on what you feel deserves a downvote.

       one of the big problems I see with this sub is people dont accept any debunks. I am an occam's razor kinda guy, thats not to say everything can be explained and every good explanation is correct. But part of being a conspiracy "fan" is to be properly skeptical about things.

       You probably got downvoted because you did not even back up ONE thing you said with any sources. You should have been sourcing all of your points, but I would be happy with just a couple of good sources, if even for credibility's sake if nothing else.

       isn't special. Due to multiple reasons, after the 2016 election,the entire web become more politicized and it hasn't died down since. The forums and institutions dedicated to discussing politics have
       <strong>
        failed us
       </strong>
       , due to conspirators. That's why it ends on on

       Breaks in the mainstream establishment narrative occurred, and causing a breakout  of people recognized the "system" for what it is. Until there's meaningful change, I just don't see things dying down.

       Its simple.In 2016 Reddit fringe subs swayed the election in favor of DT. The wikileaks, the memes, the lies, Pizzagate, the side of beef - Reddit is leftist corporate owned. They have taken over every major sub and effectively quarantined T_D.
      </p>

       What happened in 2016 womt happen again. If anyone is going to use Reddit as a weapon its leftist and the corporate globalist that pay them.

       Maybe because everyone realized UFOs and all that jazz are part of a government psyop? Also, they've become so mainstream that everyone is discussing them. There is much greater influx of naive partisan users, shills, astroturfers, trolls, and bots? I agree that the Trump-shilling has overtaken certain conspiracy circles, just as the anti-Trump blitz rages in the rest of the MSM. But there are some positive changes here: now we can speak openly about Jewish conspiracies. The real discussion as always happens in the New and Controversial headers. The Top page is obviously manipulated along with the rest of Reddit to showcase certain agendas, celebrity worship, Netflix advertising, etc.

       There's definitely a funded concerted effort to control the narrative here. Aside from going completely fascist, which nobody wants, and even that would do little to curb the flow, there's nothing that can be done other than abandoning ship for calmer waters.

       Everyone should be encouraged to upvote on new and controversial. Make statements like "upvote on new for your daily seratonin! it's tax deductible!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there are JIDF brigades, The_Donald brigades and topmindsofreddit brigades that are downvoting on new to keep interesting out and political topics in. That's why the votes appear to follow this trend: initially all positive (5 votes), then downvoted to less than 60 percent (next 20 or so votes), then back up to high 60s (from then on).

       There are real issues nowadays, rather than shit like UFOs and Flat Earth. Those kinds of fun little theories and whatnot are naturally going to take a backseat to the kind of things that people have real evidence of, and which effect them much more directly. Things that real people would actually care about. As a result, myself and others like me were drawn here to discuss them. Would be nice if the "fringe" stuff and political stuff had different sections so that the fringe people could be happy in their space, and the political people wouldn't have to deal with shills associating them with fringe people.

       -Politics is predictable, boring and shackled.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 changed that. We have a conspiracy of gvt insiders who most likely attacked their own people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Waco Texas was another political conspiracy as was Ruby Ridge.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2016 the political establishment caught unaware by Sanders rushed in to r/conspiracy to try &amp; affect the political narrative by overrunning/ raising the noise to signal level of normal conspiracy discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is another conspiracy worth fighting. To just relinquish ourselves to "non-political" conspiracies is to bury our heads in the sands.

       You're absolutely right. Unfortunately, political conspiracies have taken precedence because, let's face it, everyone's preoccupied with them. We're also, for the first time in history, witnessing these conspiracies unravel in real-time. THIS is totally unprecedented. For so long, conspiracy was about
       <em>
        what happened
       </em>
       , now it's
       <em>
        what's happening
       </em>
       . Call it
       <a href="http://www.rushkoff.com/books/present-shock/">
        Present Shock
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's not going away anytime soon. We either embrace it or move on to more compartmentalized subreddits where the topics can be narrowed down something more specific. r/conspiracy, being a generalized subreddit for ALL THINGS CONSPIRACY no longer has that capability or control.

       Not quite that simple. While it's true Trump supporters flowed in after the demise of their sub, they were also followed here by Dem/Hillary supporters so now they battle out their collective bullshit in "our" sub.

      <p>
       So, in fact, it, like the political process itself, r/conspiracy has been co-opted by a two party cluster-fuck.

       I was thinking the same thing, OP. Perhaps, we need to separate the sub in more specific ones, like conspiracy_politics, for example.

       But i would hate such division and i do agree, the posts are too political and obvious. I admit, myself submitted a couple of such links, but in my mind, i just wanted to have conversations about the subjects at hand.

       It's also sad when, in the midst of one of the biggest coverups in US History, this sub has all but gone silent on the issue. The Las Vegas shooting--the worst mass shooting in history--hardly makes a headline in this sub anymore. We're living a near-JFK size conspiracy, and yet, nothing here to see, move along. It's a bummer.

       Trump supporters are being pushed out and marginalized and censored from most mainstream discussion forums on this site -- that's no conspiracy -- and when you have people excluded and dismissed and ignored, they will often turn to enclaves like this one.

       I feel this way about Above Top Secret as well. It used to be amazing to go there and see the top threads being ancient cultures, conspiracies mysteries aliens ancient tech ect, but since the 2016 election that’s all that’s dominated the front page. You used to check the main page and have 26 different topics, now it’s all the same. I’m not saying there’s not a time and a place for it, I just miss the old discussions.

       From my perspective it started to get really bad after Sandy Hook when they began banning people for suggesting there was something amiss about the entire event and declaring outright that there would be no discussion of a hoax allowed. It just kept sliding downhill from there.

       Sounds about right. That’s where I used to get all of my good conspiracies, you could jump on the main page and go from hollow earth, to Antarctic nazis, to aliens to one world government and everything in between. Now it’s all politics. I used to love that site now I go on once every 3-4 months if that.

       Yeah exactly, ATS went to shit as well. Really put me off visiting here and there cos I don’t have the patience to trawl through all the political bullshit. There’s definitely an important place for political conspiracies but it just became all about one side of US politics vs the other.

       Exactly. I live in the US myself and it irritates me, I could only imagine how it feels to people visiting from outside the states. It would been nice if they put a couple from each topic on the main (3 from fragile earth, 3 from ancient mysteries, 3 from politics ect).

       The op is completely correct in that there is a clear divide between the old and new subreddit, the old good times and the new bad times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imo the only way to go back to the old one is by some seriously strict moderation, in both posts and comments. If a post is not in line with traditional conspiracy topics, bin it. If the comments start to get political, delete them immediately. Be ruthless for a few months and then reap the benefit.

       To be honest I think the conspiracy crowd has been hijacked by either the CIA or other alphabet gangs. They are steering the narrative away from true questioning and alternative thinking and turning it into nonsense. For example, "Qanon"... The guy (if he is an actual person)  could literally be anyone, and masses of people are following this person like a cult! It's basically a sort of Honeypot, in which large swathes of people are being deceived into following this person... For one, nothing Q says even makes sense, it's a bunch of incomprehensible nonsense. Secondly, nothing he has said has happened....
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, that was just one example. I'm sure there are MANY other gatekeepers within the truth community that are actively deceiving people.

       This constant meta bullshit fighting like children in the comments needs to stop, you can't really discuss anything like an adult here without people getting overly sensitive. I usually avoid most the political stuff but since there's hardly much else going on sometimes I just avoid the sub alltogether.

       At the very least stop posting twitter links. I fucking hate when people don't post the actual source material, it makes me think they did not even bother to get to the source material. It's lazy. Facebook links are already banned from the sub, twitter links should be added. Left/right DNC/RNC, Trump/Hillary twitter shitposts are the fucking bane of my existence.

       People need to understand that UFO and ALIENS are the ULTIMATE CONSPIRACY. Those who have done an incredible amount of research all come to the same conclusion: The Satanic Elite exist. They worship and work for PREDATORY ALIENS who are primarily based in the ASTRAL DIMENSION. Education, Careers and Retirement are important, but EVERYONE ends up in the same horrific spot at the end: ALL HUMANS have their MEMORIES ERASED and everyone is FORCED TO REINCARNATE. Earth is NOT A SCHOOL. This reality has been completely ENSLAVED...

       conspiracy is the two party system itself. The one that has been completely co-opted by financial and corporate interests.

       Gerrymandering  is another huge fucking problem that needs fixing. Some of the court rulings coming down are forcing states, such as North Carolina, to throw the whole thing in the shitter and re-do the entire state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly enough, fixing gerrymandering is the absolute first step in fixing everything that's fucked about our current 2-party political system.

       A conspiracy is defined as a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful. I'm only interested in discussing UFOs and that kind of wacky stuff from that perspective, and only if there's actually some evidence to grab on to. I don't come here for wacky stuff like that, I come here to discuss the crimes people commit when they conspire with conspirators. I want to talk about groups of people doing bad things, I want to talk about their plans and their ill intent, not merely wild ideas or unproven theories. If I wanted to talk UFOs and all that wacky shit, I'd go to r/ufo or r/cryptids or something. I want to talk conspiracies, so I come to r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, ever since the CIA coined the term "conspiracy theorist" to belittle those who didn't believe their lies about JFK's assassination, these sorts of truth communities devoted to exposing conspiracies have ALWAYS been interested in government conspiracy. And government means politics is automatically involved. I mean, did you think the deep state murdering JFK wasn't politically motivated? How about when they killed MLK? Are we not supposed to touch politics when we talk about these people assassinated by our own government? How? How are we supposed to discuss modern conspiracies, like the media's gaslighting surrounding Russia? Or the way Wikileaks proved the 2016 Democratic primaries were being cheated by the DNC on behalf of the Clinton campaign? Rigged elections are a pretty big conspiracy, but you tell us we shouldn't touch politics? Social media is bombarded with political shills now, the very cause of your complaints about annoying political posts I'm sure, but you'd tell us to avoid politics, meaning we can't talk about these digital agents provocateur? Wealthy assholes are conspiring and paying people to come here to troll us, just to disrupt this community, and you would ask us to not point this fact out?

       The thing is, is that normally, minus all the political shitposting, this  would be just fine. You had your niche of interest, and other people had theirs. When this sub is operating like it used to, when there was not the flood of political poop flinging, there was room for everyone to explore and focus on specific areas and disciplines of Conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might not like the UFO conspiracies, or the Roman Catholic Church conspiracies, or any other number of fringe, but that's fine, you can focus and discuss areas you and others share an interest in, and other people could come in and learn from the conversations you shared with other people in to your preferred area of conspiracy discussions. There was no losing good commentary due to flooding, spamming and forum sliding.  Active commentary had a chance to season and be visible to people for a longer period of time. This is part of what is so bad about all these political shitposts, it literally drowns out and waters down everything to the point where the sub ceases to really say anything at all.

       As

       stated, people need to start stepping over these discussion turds, start reporting them to the mods, let them know when /new queue needs the mods to spray these turds down with a hose and clean the shit off the subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the mods should add a "political shitpost" reporting category myself, but that discussion is above my pay grade.

       We're in the throws of a massive information operation focused on amplifying and empowering the political fringes.  Antifa, the Charlottesville "nazis", and predatory partisan media are all part of the biggest conspiracy of our lives.  The "Russia narrative" is part of it. Heck, the X-Files doesn't even know how to present conspiracies anymore other than claiming that the truth is an objective thing.  The vast sense of disorientation is the exact goal of our enemies, who are all over reddit and other forums.

       Ugh. The sportification of politics is appalling. The two party system has grown stagnant and the various  corporate, banking, and military industrial complexes now run the show. The dems and repubs are two sides to the same coin and it's not even hidden any longer, only those that are disillusioned can't see it at this point. One has a choice when game of politics is played, cyanide or arsenic... Sure they differ in means and mode, but they both ultimately end in the same result...

       Damn this hit the nail on the head. I’ve never been much for commenting here and I certainly have my political leanings (dirty lib) but i have spent years coming here every night to explore the fringe before drifting off to sleep. I loved that part - the heart - of this sub.

       It may be worth discussing a “no political scandal” policy. We see a ton of that. True theories of government conspiracy - backed by research - should I suppose be allowed but just posting news stories and vaguely saying “see there trump goes again doing x” needs to be cut out.

       narcissistic troll confirmed. Always telling others they’re weak and wrong like it would be realistic to think he’s anything above the usual teenage american autistic alt-right retard of objective fact and not personal view.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, YOUNG AMERICANS ARE AUTISTIC RETARDS and only an autistic retard doesn’t take this for granted. Scientific fact. Thus only a retard takes your opinion and anything you are and do seriously. You are worthless, fact not insult.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alt-right is the political choice of the american autist. AN ALT RIGHTER IS A FUCKING NARCISSISTIC LOSER, and that’s a fact. You are such, fact and compassionate help, not insult.

       IMMEDIATELY REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THE GENE POOL, RETARDED FUCK. pro Trump people are INFERIOR, and thats a fact.

       I appreciate the foundation you laid, and have the utmost respect for the war you fought, but I am terrified for my daughters future and wouldnt consider quitting the battle I am fighting for anything so I cant identify with your decision to walk away. I spend more time defending my controversial opinions than I do advancing the ideas I want to progress or move forward but I will never stop fighting the good fight.

       To the anti Trump crowd I would suggest if you have one reason, literally one where you feel the Clinton crime wave ahould continue bring it, I will accept you with open arms. To the pro Trump crowd same offer, I will believe if you if you give me any reason to, I mean any reason.

       I think it's because politics and conspiracy have gotten closer than before and collided and merged and now is overlapped in ways that it had not been before. Barely any conspiracy was acknowledged in the news or political realm and now it is crossing over and what used to be separate channels angles theories and players are becoming exposed, recategorized, consolidated, and flooded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy was never pure, safe, nor clean. Always fraught from the beginning by its very nature with shills, cointel, ignoramuses, limited hangouts, psy oppers, larpers, and saboteurs. I feel we're in the midst of its multiplication, amplification, finalization.

       Is there not a political conspiracy subreddit for some of this stuff to go? I don’t want it to get to a point where any conspiracy isn’t on the table for discussion but the karma farming posts on this sub especially get tiring. Years ago, posts were OC and well thought out. Now one of the buzz sites posts an article with a catchy headline and it pops up 4-5 posts out of 10 on “new”.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need the return of thought-provoking content. We need to hear the other side of the discussion so we can formulate our own opinions based on due-diligence. I understand the left/right discussions get people’s blooding pumping but what the fuck is going on in Antarctica? Is it possible the Vatican re-wrote history and some point along the way and out our thoughts on time (and our place in it) is fucked? Is ritual magic used by the elite to conjure demons for power?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s start asking some real God(?)damn questions around here and let’s have a discussion that mutually benefits us all and challenges are preconceived notions that were taught to us by a system meant to hold us back. /rant

       i always thought conspiracy had a base of users that were anti-corruption / pro-transparency.
      </p>
      <p>
       its been flooded with shills.  i mean, ffs, the dems are literally freaking out about this memo coming out - and for some reason in this subreddit there are anti-trumpers.

       I don't think we should discredit some things we've learned here recently. Yeah sure alien and lost civilization topics are some amazing alternative info but most of us have already have heard of all of that that's where we all started that's why we're all here.. 
    And yes while it is mostly throwaway propaganda posts now you can't discredit the real world and current conspiracies people here have been talking about like pizza gate, Elsa gate, the reddit bot and shill accounts, the Las Vegas shooter and Sandy hook shooting to name a few.
     There are real ass things going on this world right now and I think focusing on these conspiracies in our lives in this moment is more important than thinking about what went down in Atlantis or with the Annunaki or Reptilians or whoever else.

       I tried going back and finding some of the threads when I first found this place but after reddit changed the voting algorithm and the election it’s almost impossible. There was some seriously interesting well articulated and laid out posts 6 years ago about really good stuff. Now I can’t find shit cause the top posts of all time are Hillary/Trump and dumbass pizzagate posts.

       If you end up starting a new subreddit (or know of one) that's more open to free thought, do us a solid and recommend it here please.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has been my experience too often that any gathering of free thinkers will inevitably be overtaken and homogenized by douchebags. Sometimes infiltrated and destroyed. Sometimes just naturally caving to social decay or stagnation, pushing the free thinkers to migrate somewhere else. Generally, free thought seems to require a kind of nomadic perpetual-migration. The wild west of ideas is sort of always on the move. It's sad but that just seems to be how it goes...groups never last.

       Well, those are all silly-ass topics. Nothing wrong with "conspiracy" being relevant to people's lives. There is no better time for real discussion than now about politics, as politics is an expression of the values of a culture. A conspiracy against people getting healthcare is an important one.

       I am thinking there is a huge international Difference in how we interpret the Topic of “Conspiracy”!

       “A Conspiracy” in Europe is (mostly) always defined as a political Topic but never as “Exopolitic”!

       I've visited a lot of threads, forums and chat rooms for years now and unfortunately you are correct. I noticed about 6 years ago them becoming more about politics and gun control and pushing out conspiracies, UFOs, paranormal stuff etc. About 2 years ago this got worse where it's even more about Trump and political scandals and there's almost nothing else.

       Some subs themselves need subs. (And those would act in a manner similar to
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , but for the higher-up sub-topics.) But reddit as a site really isn't laid out for branching like that.

       I joined for the fringe shit. It's fun. But it's hardly ever posted anymore. The political drama had become so pervasive that when an actual fringe theory was posted the other day, I was almost annoyed by it. I had to stop a minute and remember why I was actually here.

       Can we agree to just say "fuck American politics" and go back to fun stuff about aliens and Illuminati and cryptozoology and shit?

       I agree 100%. The change is very noticeable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the start of the last election campaign there has been a very noticable attempt to swamp most of the popular subreddits with political threads. It has happened to subreddits that aren't even politics related.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest I am not sure what can be done. Maybe somone should make a conspiracy subreddit that does not allow American politics? Or bans party politics. I am not sure, at the moment I feel Reddit in general is very curated. It is clearly being used as a political influencing tool.

       way more interesting stuff. I appreciate political conspiracy as well, but this sub was lost a while ago to paid shills and bots promoting propoganda. I even deleted my old reddit account and made a new one less focused on political and conspiracy conversation because honestly most of reddit has been infested, and brainwashed by the propoganda.

       We always had suspicion of the deep state. This president openly declared war on it. Not sure how real it all is, but it sure makes it hard to avoid Trump. I've noticed it too though. Critical thinking seems to be a lost art.

       This same change has happened over and over in all the fringe-type subs:
       <a href="/r/Paranormal">

       <a href="/r/UFOs">
        /r/UFOs
       </a>
       , to name a few.  People come in and start casting aspersions on the users, calling them schizophrenic/paranoid/etc and in need of professional help, blah blah blah and before you know it everybody has crawled quietly into the most distant corner they can except whoever is left with enough spine to stay ends up posting more mainstream stuff -- all of it likely seeded by the same users who started the change in the first place.

       Thanks for your post OP. As a Flat Earther, I can tell you some stories. This is one of my new throwaway accounts, check out my karma.
      </p>
      <p>
       We get shilled and mass-downvoted pretty quickly. When I left Twitter end of last year, my blocklist had 800 names on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I only used the account for about a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here on r/conspiracy, any post will get someone disagreeing in the comments pretty quickly. No many people are even bothering to get a convo going any more.

       Your version of conspiracy is the type that has given conspiracy a bad name.  It is a description of the insane people on the subway who talk to themselves.  Personally, I prefer the more realistic type of conspiracy discussion that we currently have here.  Keep your nutty unfounded theories about archeology to yourself.

       Basically from wide variety of things has been narrowed down to pointless political bickering. Parties interested has ruined the thread in a big way. By making it irrelevant, bringing forward things that don't matter or are damaging and hide away all that is interesting, secret, mysterious.

       Honestly I haven't seen much change in this sub in the roughly 6 years I've had this account. Seems pretty much the same type of stuff here everyday in my opinion.

       Maybe you're talking about farther back than 6 years though, who knows.

       I hear what you are saying but, just because "Politics is boring", doesn't mean it shouldn't be at the forefront of the discussion here, right? Observing what politicians say as opposed to what they do, seems to me to be a useful tool in navigating through the "muck" sometimes found on here and establishing some kind of knowledgeable foundation. 
Now, I'm not saying it should be all "Trump this and Hilary that" but, we have the ability these days to see these powerful figures put in the spot light and be placed under heavy scrutiny so we can try and make informed decisions. We have a unique advantage living in the age of the internet to try and piece together what we observe from these powerful people with other conspiratorial info we have about other (seemingly) non-political issues.
Just my two cents tho.

       Its nice you're allowed to say this, but many people were banned at every step of this metamorphosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       They consider it an "attack on the sub" to say they are being biased, or anything that's not "good job". Many users have been banned/harassed for saying exactly what youve said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this sub is a joke, its spawned other subs, just to laugh about how things are done/said here. The mods seem proud of this most the time..

       I think it's less about a "fringe" vs "mainstream" problem, and more just that it seems every time this subreddit is near hitting a consensus on something major, a theory maybe that even other subreddits would consider plausible, the 24 hour news cycle pumps out another ridiculous story filled with loopholes for our collective imagination to run wild in. This is where we splinter into a thousand pieces and become possessed by our political/social biases.

       It's up to you, or any individual, to pick one thing and investigate it to its conclusion and not allow any "breaking story" to interrupt you.

       It’s not even the political conspiracies that bug me the most. Just the heavy bias in them. People are all for supporting some insane conspiracy against one side but refuse to even entertain the idea of one on the other. Such as any Russian related topics being considered as 100% lies. Sure the topic gets old. But that’s not the complaint against it that I see. It’s just discounted as liberal media bullshit. When it really looks like it’s some of each. Liberal media biased? Yes, like conservative media. Was there any Russian conspiracy at all? Yeah, we frequently see an abundance of Russian bots being exposed. Neither side is really on the side of the public. They are just dragging us into their rivalry.

       Yup, this is the truth.  Used to be a cool day when you could come to this forum to discuss conspiracies.  Now, not so much.  I find this relevant on other forums as well.  To much politics...not enough conspiracies.  Politics will ALWAYS be conspiratorial in nature.....ALWAYS!  But most of them are not conspiracies in and of themselves......they are just people hiding information so they don't get caught in their lies.  BORING!

       I made a video about some strange things to happen in the past in my country which immediately got down voted. Took me ages to make the video and I was hoping it would provoke some discussion and amateur investigation in this sub. At that moment I realized if it's not to do with American politics then it's not welcome here

       I'm not going to lie, having the political arguments on here has opened up my eyes to exactly how corrupt and diseased the hierarchy is on this planet. I'm always up for a good UFO story, but finding this place after the Vegas shootings has opened up my eyes to other areas that affect my life like the health industry. Which is all connected to the corrupt state of our government.

       No it isn't and don't be so defeatist. People have read the post and commented. Both political parties are dog turd and i still hope that we have enough time left to make the masses realise that there are bigger things than politics, i hope that there is still time to turn things around, not just in the US but the World over.

       Maybe a side effect of all the political squabbling is that people will get burnt out on it and see through it in larger numbers than would have otherwise. The theme across all the various camps is that Big Changes are coming, which feels true whether people can agree on the form or not. Thank you for your post!

       I think the that the whole conspiracy argument has devolved to the one fundamental conspiracy theory of everything. Postmodernism, globalism and everything connected to it or against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soros, Clinton, Obama, the EU, the Royal Families, big oil, big pharma, OPEC, Israel, Akhenazis, BLM, Antifa, mainstream media, celebrities, the Podesta's, Pi__agate, child porn and sex slavery, the Democrats, deep state, FBI, Mueller, the military industrial complex, central banks, Afghanistan and heroin, Syria, Libya, Yemen, etc etc.

       It's been a pro Trump, right wing shit hole of Russian active measures/right wing conspiracy theories since Trump announced his presidency. It's dead. Conspiracy theory itself is dead because the people have been mentally beaten and abused by real conspiracies in the past as well as 9/11. But now the people are collective paranoid schizophrenics and everything has become a false flag or conspiracy supposedly by George Soros, Hillary Clinton, Obama, Rothschilds, globalists, John Podesta, or any other left wing political figure. It's all anti left wing anti intellectual garbage and parrots right wing nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where's the irrational and emotionally charged conspiracies against Republicans? Trump? People really believe the right wing is innocent and without blame? Oh Jeff Sessions wants to ban legal weed, that's the only criticism of the right I see. This place fucking blows.

       Do some digging, the dark web has a bad wrap for obvious reason but there is real conspiracy sites are out there. And even then true info is only really shared via pgp encryption by dedicated journalists and fringe hackers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't share the onion sites because im a douche and dont think you guys deserve to just be given said info or knowledge how to even access the sites. But its just laughable people think any real info is shared on clear net.

       Dear sir,
      </p>
      <p>
       first, thank you for your public service as a mod;
      </p>
      <p>
       second, I heartily agree with your enthusiasm for weird ideas;
      </p>
      <p>
       third, please accept my apology for failing to post fringe ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe I can explain why so few fringe thinkers are posting wild flights of speculation. Reddit is not a place that guarantees freedom of anonymous speech.  If a fringe thinker posts some "high weirdness" or "high strangeness" on Reddit, the owners of Reddit might decide that it is thought crime, and they might dox the fringe thinker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: For example, if I am an intrepid investigator, gallivanting about the countryside, photographing chupacabra outbreaks and interviewing cold fusion experimenters, my stories of my investigations would leave traces of my private information.  Investigators who provide evidence can often be doxxed because they have provided evidence.  By contrast, anonymous voices on the Internet are harder to trace, because their comments about government corruption might have been written by anyone.

       Ya man.  I was never a mod, but a frequent poster, and I left years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed it was under seige from outside a long time ago.  First it was that the sub got overtaken by anti-semetic material, that was used to label conspiracy as full of neo-nazis/anti-semites.  I love WW2, and studying Nazis, etc, but all of the info/posts were tainted with anti-semitism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, the Trump phenomena happened, and it was more of the same.  Trump posts/Anti-Democrat just blotting out the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Backbone of
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       was never rooted in a specific, hard ideological bias.  It was based in the idea that you have to approach EVERY situation from an unbiased perspective, to see the truth(or as close to it as we can get).  I think if there was a bias, it was that most people were hard ideological communists, or hard ideological libertarians, but many who didn't fit into these characterizations existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       With The Anti-Semetic period, and the Policical, Pro Trump period, the result was the same... that unbiased, unpurposed search for the truth was cast aside.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that both movements were pushed on some level by "TPTB".  I think this place, above all others in the USA(Cyber, or Physical) had some real conversations, and real information, that fostered some real, informed and justified anti-government, anti-corporate, anti-banker, anti-globalist sentiment, that many powerful groups feared.

       You wanna know what the real conspiracy is, this shit is all mind control, the political soap opera, it's so damn hard to get away from. It's also polarizing as hell, whether by design or not it's the sad reality. It's so bad that if you try to separate yourself from the reality tv presidency you're seen as an enemy to both sides. So we are psychologically reinforcing the divide, forcing us to pick a side.

        By doing this, it can create an avalanche, stirring up a bunch of shit between users, fragmenting everyone into these small polarized groups. It will continue to perpetuate after the shills and bots leave. I don't think they have to do very much. Just target certain ideas and certain people when necessary.

       This is exactly what is going on. Awareness of the problem is the first step to solving it. It's just like ignoring annoying people in real life, you leave them alone. Only issue with taking that approach here is that the profiles and whoever or whatever controls them will change the approach and ramp up the rhetoric or games they play. Even then, it's still possible to combat it. If you see the same patterns over and over, there's a high likelihood that those are not organic posts.

       This sub is approaching 600K subscribers.  This is a battleground for the minds of those who lurk.  I have, for instance, a post sitting at the top of the front page right now regarding Flight 93 from 911.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this moment, the post has garnered 1390 points and 455 comments.  Meanwhile, the post has had 21K views.  That's a lot of lurkers!  That's a lot of minds who are curious about some of the more crazy details of the official 9/11 narrative.  The people that are commenting tend to be firm in their respective position(s) regarding 9/11 events, but both groups are very cognizant of the fact that the debate going on within the thread may very well change the mind of a respectable amount of lurkers.  This is one of the reasons it can get heated.

       Project Bluebeam is long-term. The UFO story got front-page news for the day. Do you really expect it to last longer than however long they want to cover it for? Everyone believes in aliens and wants it to happen. It's a mainstream conspiracy theory that gets plenty of coverage.

       I didn't say that there weren't any resistors who caught on early and learned to give the system what it wanted while still managing to keep a open mind and an opinion of their own safely tucked away but they are a small minority by comparison. More than a few fed-up rebels too, that bucked it until they were old enough to drop-out.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main point being that it isn't a situation that either encourages or is conducive to independent thinking or learning which is why at least 75% of the population not only isn't very good at it but usually tries to avoid it altogether.

       I think you don't see the vile from Anti-Trumpers because you agree with them.  I'll list you some examples of the vileness towards me just yesterday:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It’s meant to muddy the waters and discredit the IC/investigation, you fucking retard. People like you would be of more use to this world if you jumped off a bridge and let a school of fish eat you.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you say stupid shit it doesn’t matter where you post, you will get similar reactions. Maybe you should go back to a sub that confirms your biases.
       </p>
       <p>
        Don't be an idiot. Both sides spin stuff like the long-term effects of a tax or healthcare plan, while this memo is a direct attack on the intelligence community in order to protect Trump. This isn't standard DC spin.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's rich coming from a Trump-supporting piece of trash like you. Public perception always matters, even when things should be cut and dry. Fish are getting hungry.

       That's why they stop at the mountains.

       The one in the water by Japan is a strange one though. Either someone was using it on a boat, or there's some sort of facility off the coast, as there's no land marked but the tracks have a lot of straight lines.

       So they got called names and they're getting revenge? I don't get your point.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I get called a leftist I don't go "well if you're going to call me a leftist I'm going to get real angry and push for the seizure of the means of production!" I'm center left, getting called mean names doesn't make me go full communist or irrationally angry at the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also why do you make it seem like being called a racist online is the worst thing ever? Somehow you can call for the expulsion of an entire religion from the country but call them racists and you all jump to "whoa, whoa, whoa first off it's a religion. Second off even if they were a race, how is that racist? We just want to secure the existence of our people and a future for white children. Calling them racist is horrible!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Also also regardless of why they're angry having an entire political movement supported almost fully by anger and hatred of other races, religions and political leanings is probably not good for the people involved nor our nation.

       I interpret this as, "They call me names and  I don't get mad so calling them names shouldn't make them mad"  I'm not mad and they are irrationally angry.

       Racism is when a person believes their race to be superior to others.  A lot of these people just want to keep terrorists out.  I do not agree with the all Muslims are terrorist, I believe we created terrorists, however they believe Islam is a religion that promotes violence.

       Well I am speculating. But the point is that we don't know what it is, so we can't conclusively say either way. Have a look for yourself so then you can at least speculate on the material rather than just what I'm saying about it.
