        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I thought you all here would like this information. I have done a lot of work archiving and researching the vast amount of information that has been released in the JFK Files, yet, what I just discovered was exactly how much is being withheld.  I thought to those researchers here who are currently working with the files, would want to know this.</p>

<p>In October, I filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the National Archives for a list of all documents currently WITHHELD. We know what they released, but I was seeking a list of what was still classified.</p>

<p>On January 30th, yesterday. I received the list.</p>

<p>This “withheld” list was released via the FOIA to myself/The Black Vault in FOIA Case #NARA-NGC-2018-000072.</p>

<p>It shows 22,933 Documents totaling 442,606 Pages are being withheld, though the list needs clarification.</p>

<p>According to NARA: “We conducted a search and were able to locate an EXCEL spreadsheet that lists everything that has not been released since December 15th, 2017 (the last release date). We are releasing this document if full with no redactions. The spreadsheet lists the JFK record number, the decision, the file number, document date, number of pages, and the origination agency.”</p>

<p>However, upon investigation, NARA also listed the entire set of PARTIALLY released records, along with those completely withheld.  Digging deeper, and with the help and verification of Jimmy Falls of the news agency WhoWhatWhy we came up with the same numbers, using two entirely different methods.</p>

<p>It confirms there are 3,082 Documents, totaling 217,114 Pages that are not yet released to the public.  We cross referenced the list below, with the master NARA list of released documents, and came up with the same exact conclusion and both verified these numbers.  I then called NARA on the telephone on 1/30/2018 to confirm — and they informed me that these records are in the process of being reviewed through April of 2018 for possible release.  Although more than 2,200 of the 3,082 should already be online, I told her that I believed they were not, and NARA recommended to wait until at least April of 2018, as more documents are reviewed, released and organized.</p>

<p>Here are some links to verify all of the above, and continue research, if you need the resource:</p>
