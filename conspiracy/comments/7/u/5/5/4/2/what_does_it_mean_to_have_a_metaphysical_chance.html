<p>At 6:10, Alex Jones says that the Illuminati must tell you what they&#39;re doing to you so that metaphysically you have a chance to fight back against it. What exactly does that mean? I like to reference 1984 and say that metaphysics is not my strong point, so can someone explain it to me?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding is that it has to do with weird free will stuff as it relates to multi-dimensional consciousness.</p>

<p>The common narrative is that &#39;free-will&#39; is a massively important metaphysical element of consciousness/life on earth(although this may not be true in other parts of existence) and that there&#39;s a whole bunch of weird spiritual/multidimensional/universal systems in place to respect, enforce and ensure that free will is respected with absolute authority. However, apparently there are some really funky &#39;rules loopholes&#39; that particularly clever spirits/demons/aliens/&#39;well educated&#39; humans can use to come dangerously close to violating free will without actually running afoul of divine/cosmic/universal law. Disclosing the actual intent behind certain actions is allegedly part of this on a metaphysical level. So, &#39;the illuminati&#39; and co., in essence, need to telegraph everything they&#39;re doing beforehand in order to get approval from the &#39;proper authorities&#39;. If they properly follow the letter of the law and don&#39;t mess up, they get to avoid the less than pleasant punitive measures meted out for violations and if they screw up in their attempts to skirt the rules cosmic punishment that is unavoidable is incurred.</p>

<p>It&#39;s too complex to fully get into here, but there&#39;s basically an elaborate cosmological framework that involves the idea that &#39;you&#39; aren&#39;t actually the full entirety of who You are. Actions that happen to you need to be approved and vetted on multiple fronts, but down here in the mud, as it were, you end up seeing the final culmination of these processes in weird alleged disclosures in art, sculpture, and mass media. A big thing is that, apparently, it&#39;s very very much &#39;against the rules&#39; for a group to be enslaved with literal 100% effectiveness. There always has to be a way out and the slaveholders are metaphysically obligated to make you aware of the doors even if they&#39;re allowed to play some pretty shitty games in an attempt to hide what they&#39;re doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, but even if I were to know what&#39;s coming, how exactly do I fight back against it? I mean for example, Project Bluebeam is coming in the future, August 9, 2045 I believe, and without debating if that&#39;s the date, even if it was, would it make any difference if I knew? I feel like my fate is decided by the majority of &quot;sheeple&quot;. Not to say I wanna use that as an excuse, but is this &quot;metaphysically chance to fight back&quot; an actual chance, or just some theoretical bullshit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s an analogy. You work at a mine with dangerous areas. You wander into one and get hurt bad. You go to court and ask for redress for your injury. The judge asks if you were warned. The verdict may hinge on your answer to that question. </p>

<p>Now, if someone says &quot;I&#39;m going to turn you into a mindless cyborg with an implant&quot;, that&#39;s when you have to decide to avoid that future outcome. If you don&#39;t - well, you were warned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of us, including me, are pretty clueless about what exactly takes place when we die. I prefer to leave that process to my faith trajectory.</p>

<p>What I am talking about with this &quot;fair warning&quot; business is the essential gist of esoteric knowledge that I have picked up, and that we experience all the time. Think about how brazen and inexplicable events like 9/11 and Las Vegas are. That&#39;s sending a message. Think about how often you hear that all work will be performed by robots and drones within 20 years. Think about all the overt hints about chemicals, pharma, drugs, etc. being used to pacify and streamline (cull) the population. Above all, think about how frequently we have been told about a global government. Why in the world would they openly discuss all this? As if all the people will just walk straight to the transition centers... Maybe they are stupid, but I doubt it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at predictive programming, in each situation, there is an invasion during a “festival” 
Shadow the hedgehog (Fire in the sky festival, also a hologram appears, like a fake messiah) [link to <a href="http://www.youtube.com">www.youtube.com</a> (secure)] 
In Sonic Adventure 2 Battle and Shadow the Hedgehog, one of the weapons mentioned is the “Eclipse Cannon” 
Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 (The Star Festival) 
 [link to <a href="http://www.youtube.com">www.youtube.com</a> (secure)] [link to <a href="http://www.youtube.com">www.youtube.com</a> (secure)] 
Zelda Majora’s Mask (There is a 3 day festival, and on the first day Aliens come.) 
 [link to <a href="http://www.youtube.com">www.youtube.com</a> (secure)] 
 [link to <a href="http://www.youtube.com">www.youtube.com</a> (secure)] (Go to 4:42, he talks abot the red/orange star, that is the planet X/Niburu reference
Also Majora’s Mask = MM (M = 3 sideway) MM = 33</p>

<p>Also, in Star Wars, the main character is &quot;Luke Skywalker&quot; and in Shadow the Hedgehog, of course it&#39;s Shadow the Hedgehog. Both have a scene where they are told by Darth Vader/Black Doom that they are descendants of alien species.</p>

<p>Luke Skywalker = L.S. = 31
Shadow the Hedgehog = S.H. = 27</p>

<p>The Solar eclipse in 2045 goes from California to Florida, the 31st to 27th state.</p>

<p>August 9, 2045 is 33 days before September 11, 2045. So you would have the event 33 days short of 44 years apart. Plus August 9 and August 11 is another 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you knew what was coming, your actions would inevitably change towards this event. So to not infringe upon your free will of choosing route a or b, you will not get predictions. 
All future events are infinite possibilities. And all consciousnesses operating on earth work together towards which possibility becomes reality. 
It is this way because we are influenced by the illusion of time, this illusion has no impact on other planes of existence. Other beings supposedly see all possibilities, but can never tell which will become truth.
Yet, one thing they all agree upon: there will be physical devastation of planet earth somewhere in the future, to enable a regeneration of planet earth but wether it is man made(war/pollution whatever) or natural (meteor/flood whatever) or extraterrestrial and the time of occurrence is uncertain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another simple explanation that doesn&#39;t rely on pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo is based on psychology.</p>

<p>Most people have a sense of empathy. Even among the elites there can be a sense of guilt for what they do. By &quot;telegraphing&quot; their plans they can justify themselves by saying that if people really didn&#39;t want what was happening, they would stop it.</p>

<p>Basically this type of person believes that the &quot;masses&quot; not only need to be controlled like this, but <em>want</em> to be controlled like this, and thus they are only giving us what we want. Therefore, they do not have to feel guilty, and can in fact feel noble for giving the people the life they actually want.</p>
