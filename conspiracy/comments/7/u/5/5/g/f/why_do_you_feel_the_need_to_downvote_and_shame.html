       Exactly, like being a flat earther, I've learned that there is no way to win an argument with a shill. So I simply believe flat earth and avoid discussing it too much and try to focus on other conspiracies.

       We're living in a soundbite society.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've put out well reasoned replies with supporting links and purposely took a tone of trying to find middle ground and willing to engage in open exploration of truth even if it means I was wrong (which I have many times) and been quite careful not to overstep but be civil and all that.  Those posts often get ignored or 1 upvote
      </p>
      <p>
       I've put out one line quips and they fucking take off with the upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Text is incredibly limited in it's ability to contain and convey information, context, meaning and relevance.  For to convey all that requires much more text than people are willing to consume and it's often dry consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       Come up with an amazing, short and on point zinger and it doesn't matter how on point the other person is.....people will seize the zinger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why this is.....is an incredibly interesting topic for discussion and research, IMO.

       In your opinion, what proportion of adults in western society are

        TRULY
       </strong>
       capable of challenging their own preconceived notions?

       In my experience, it is less than one per cent. I never used to see things this way, until I started paying attention to how 'open minded' people behave when challenged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instantly they try to argue/defend their position, rather than
       <em>
        reconsider

       it.

       Yep exactly my experience also.  Some of my favorite people in this world are hard-core science guys and I love to talk with them about all kinds of different topics.  I've literally known these guys my entire adult life and we've remained close friends all that time and had MANY conversations about hard core science stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was surprised after I started questioning what I was taught in my science classes then doing independent research then presenting it to them, how closed minded they were when some topic went against their cherished beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since I know them well and we often engage in long discussions, I took on some of these topics with the one I feel closest to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was surprised to find he's incredibly closed minded to new info.  He learned the truth at some point in life and seems unwilling to even explore other alternative explanations and data.

       I think that almost all humans are this way, whether it is by 'nature' or 'nurture'.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is why I try to always ask myself, when presented with a challnging idea, what is my evidence'.
      </p>
      <p>
       rather than get triggered or defensive, I try to focus on, 'what have I seen with my own eyes'.
      </p>
      <p>
       For this reason, I like to run
       <a href="https://www.johnlebon.com/articles/37-things-normies-believe/">
        this short list
       </a>
       past 'open minded' people, to see if they are able to challenge their own beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast majority of people who claim to be 'open minded' soon prove to be anything but.
      </p>
      <p>
       They make appeals to authority, appeals to consensus, and become the very thing they claim to hate.

       We live in amazing times for sure.

       I'll check that out...thanks!

       As I was reading your reply I thought of an interview I heard with Jim Carey.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was talking about how his exploration of characters and his deep dives into them revealed how thin and often tenuous our own images of ourselves are.  I think he was specifically talking about when he played the role of Andy Kaufman where he went so deep he actually embodied Andy (who was obviously dead at the time).
      </p>
      <p>
       He was so convincing and so real that Andy's own family even thought he was being inhabited by Andy himself.  Jim even said things of the sort....like his ego and personality just stepped aside and let Andy's spirit take over his body.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds irrelevant to our discussion but I think it's directly relevant because I think people cling to these beliefs as a way of reinforcing their ideas about who they are in the world.  What they believe is so intimately locked with how they see themselves that they can't easily let go of those things.
      </p>
      <p>
       That idea gives me much more compassion for them than simply labeling them as close minded.

       The only time I downvote is if someone calls me a name or is insulting to me. Honestly, I rarely downvote.

       Because it's so much fun and makes me feel like I actually have a tiny amount of actual power when I anonymously bully people over the internet until they're pissed. This hobby distracts me from my pathetic, worthless life. Sure, I could develop into a mature, rational adult, but that's hard, and requires an honest look at my own behavior and how my actions negatively impact society, and ultimately cause greater hardship for myself. Besides, critical thinking and using the internet to find primary sources which support my arguments is boring. So for now I'll just keep  on trollin.
