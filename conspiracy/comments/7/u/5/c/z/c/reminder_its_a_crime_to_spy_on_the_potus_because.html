<p>This is America. We have classes and some people are just better than you because they have money. He&#39;s not any American.

    <div class="md"><p>The one that says you can’t spy on Americans citizens. If you’re keeping score at home, this scandal, the Obama Administration’s decision to sell uranium to Russia, and Fast &amp; Furious (where Eric Holder sold assault rifles to Mexican drug cartels) together make Watergate look like tittlywinks. Politics have always been dirty, but during Obama’s 2nd term he and Hillary ramped that shit up to level 11,000.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no law saying you can&#39;t spy on Americans. At all. In fact there is the opposite. What do you think the Patriot act was or what a FISA warrant does, or how police do stings, or wiretaps. You are just talking out of your ass. Watch the Wire for fuck sakes.</p>

<p>I’m talking out of my ass? Patriot Act covers individuals suspected of involvement with terrorist organizations, although I’m sure Obama and Hillary would make that argument with a straight face and then remind you “they were the most transparent administration ever.” Talk about letting your ass do the talking. </p>

<p>If that doesn’t work, Barack’s lawyers could surely make an argument based on FISA. Unfortunately they would be laughed out of the court room. This stuff makes Watergate look like a practical joke. This is serious high treason level shit and they turned around and paid some C-list media outlet to try and cover their tracks and it ended up blowing in their face. Thank god Wisconsin and Pennsylvania came through on election night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Patriot Act allows for everyone to be spied on citizen or not, and was from the 2nd Bush administration not Obama. FISA has to be approved by a judge and evidence has to be presented to obtain a warrant, and apparently one was obtained from a judge to monitor Russian activity out of Trump Tower, so we know a judge did not laugh it out of the room but rather found it to be worthy of invesitgation. Also Presidents aren&#39;t supposed to interfere with Law enforcement at all, so Obama, wouldn&#39;t be asking anyone for anything, nor would Hillary, that would be the CIA, DoJ, NSA, FBI not them. Which is why Trump has violatted the law by obstructing justice and trying to steer the Mueller investigation and Comey before him. Again you not only are barely able to write a coherent post, but you are uninformed and flat out wrong and dellusional.</p>

<p>That’s just factually inaccurate in this case. Trump has his phones tapped at Trump tower, a year after that provision of the Patriot Act has expired. The Patriot Act expands government surveillance power but doesn’t provide the executive branch or any intelligence office with a blank check to do whatever they want to whomever they want. If the Obama admin. was going to wire tap Trump, which they did, they did it in flagrant violation of federal law.</p>

<p>“The current fight in Congress over surveillance programs has led to a lot of confusion about whether &quot;the Patriot Act has expired.&quot; It hasn&#39;t; most of the Patriot Act is permanent. But three of the many, many individual provisions within the law expired, or &quot;sunsetted,&quot; at the end of May 2015. The most significant of these is Section 215, which the government used to justify the National Security Agency&#39;s controversial phone records program.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FISA or wiretaps in general, and the NSA mass phone data collections, are not the same thing, one was the bulk collection of all metadata from everyone and anyone using phones, the other is through a warrant via a judge and is still totally legal, so no one got a blank cheque, they got a warrant from a judge who gave them permission to surveill Trump based off of presented evidence deemed worthy of invesitgtion by a federal judge. Anyone can be spied on as long as they go through the proper channels. Good googling though, you might actually learn something today.</p>
