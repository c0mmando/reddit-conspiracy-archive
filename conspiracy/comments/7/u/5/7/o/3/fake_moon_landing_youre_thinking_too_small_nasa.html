        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It just dawned on me, that at the same time that NUMEC was happening (at the height of NASA and the infamous Apollo Affair involving MUF and Israel), that the same CGI and filming techniques might have been used to hoodwink us all.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s a stretch, but no more so than thinking of the whole moon landings as entirely faked (in fact, I think it isn&#39;t too much to suggest that that really isn&#39;t the point):</p>

<p>THE POINT IS, that just like the &quot;facts&quot; proposed that are supposed to convince us that the Apollo Affair was entirely benign, so to some constructs have been erected around the &quot;Moon Landings&quot; and even perhaps around telescopic images that are inevitably just &quot;artists&#39; renditions&quot;...every image from space has been doctored already before your see it. Think about that. What you think you see, is really only what someone else wants you to see.</p>

<p>You think about that. NASA is not what you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the truth about the moon landings is a sad one.</p>

<p>I believe man got to the moon, i believe the Russians got there first but couldn&#39;t bring their crew back and that is exactly what happened to the Americans. </p>

<p>Either it was a known suicide mission or three keen astronaughts were sent to their deaths. They were told everything will be fine, they get to the moo, drive about, radio back, pick up moon rock samples etc. Then Houston cut the feed, tell them they&#39;re having difficulties and left the men to die.</p>

<p>Enter Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong and Third Guy. Three actors who were told they were going to the moon as well (and then just hypnotised and lied about it) or they helped re-record the moon landing footage with the knowledge they had of the actual moon landing. </p>

<p>NASA destroys the original tapes, not because of aliens or scarey shit they find in a crater, but because the actual moon landing footage had three different people, with different voices, acting differently. The tapes and radio feeds that were destroyed will have had the original three astronaughts&#39; final moments. Crying, begging, screaming for help while they choke on their last reserves of oxygen.</p>

<p>So yeah, America got to the moon second, but did something the Russians wouldn&#39;t admit to; they got to the moon but killed a few people doing so.</p>
