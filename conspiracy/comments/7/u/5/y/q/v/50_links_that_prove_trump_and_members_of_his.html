<p>If anyone has better, newer, or more accurate articles they&#39;d like to share, please feel free. I just feel like they should all be in one place for people to view.</p>

<p>** I know this may be hard for some of you to accept, so if you need to lash out in anger, and write the most awful, foul comment ever feel free to do so in the comments. I will listen to you, and I accept you and love you. I will ask the mods not to remove these, no matter how awful they are. The same part of our brains that respons to a physical threat, also response to intellectual one as well. Our brains are ass holes so when we feel that part of our core identify and beliefs are questions, we react the same way we would if we were being physically attack. I am giving them a chance to vent anger and work through it. I ask people to respond to those types of comments not with insults or profanities of their own, but with interest. That you ask them why they believe these beliefs, and listen.**</p>

<p>I also ask that the mods sticky post this, please!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this guy gets 10 million a year from a Russian oligarch (who he offered private campaign briefings to, and was millions in debt to) to lobby for pro-Putin interests for about a decade.</p>

<p>Then, helps to launder Russian cash through real estate, shell companies, etc.</p>

<p>Then starts working for a campaign that Russia has been trying to work its way into (through Papadopolous, through the NRA, through Christian organization, etc) as the campaign manager, pro bono.</p>

<p>Then is indicted for failing to register as a <em>foreign agent for the pro-Russian party in Ukraine</em>, the party of regions, and laundering Russian money, doesn’t have anything to do with collusion?</p>

<p>I get the argument that the years in the transactions of money laundering don’t match up to the campaign but it doesn’t make it unrelated. It’s also worth noting that it’s widely believed that <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/paul-manafort-could-face-fresh-indictment-report/article/2644417">Mueller will indict Manafort again</a>.</p>

<p>It’s mind blowing to me that people are using the indictments and plea deals as “proof of no collusion”, as the two indictments are not expected to be the only ones for those parties, and those plea deals barely mention anything <em>because they are cooperating</em>.</p>

<p>Michael Flynn is well known to have done a lot more shady stuff than he pled guilty to, he got a sweetheart deal in exchange for information (and if someone as high up in the ranks as him flipped, it’s safe to say they flipped him to try and get a bigger fish, the only four really which are Kushner, Sessions, Trump Jr., and Trump)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that years don&#39;t just match up, they&#39;re way off. 
 What he, Gates and Tony Podesta were doing for years were a crime (operating as foreign agents on behalf of Ukraine) and everyone turned a blind eye to that.  They were making so much money doing it, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ukraine-lobbying/with-cash-ukraines-political-foes-bring-fight-to-washington-idUSBRE9BJ1B220131220">Reuters even wrote about it</a> And they were all unregistered.  It&#39;s disingenuous to use his indictments as some form of proof Trump colluded, and It&#39;s 2nd on the list.</p>

<p>Look, I&#39;m not a Trump supporter (Didn&#39;t vote for either, went 3rd party), I think he&#39;s an awful shitty person who loves to hear himself compliment himself.  With that said, I tend to agree with a vocial Hillary supporter and former CIA head Michael Morell, he said what I see, &quot;no there there&quot;.  Now if Mueller cracks this case wide open and proves it, great, but up till now I&#39;ve only see a few things that may pan out with a shit ton of smoke, like the claim that Manaforts indictment is evidence of collusion.  At this point it doesn&#39;t matter ultimately, we&#39;ll see how it all plays out.  We&#39;re still going to be bombing other countries and congress is going to pass fucked up legislation while everyone debates this shit.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>well, that’s not exactly true. OP gave you a wide number of links, all of which help to prove a wider conspiracy going on between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. They are all part of a web of evidence.</p>

<p>You took one piece of evidence, and asked for someone to explain how this one piece “proves collusion”</p>

<p>I was honestly unsure of whether to respond how I did or to make the point I am now, that taking a piece out of its larger context and into a vacuum and asking how that one specific thing proves anything is intellectually dishonest. </p>

<p>I don’t particularly believe, say, Pizzagate, but I can still see how it’s unfair to take one of Podesta’s emails and say “well how does this email prove the claims of Pizzagate”, because no one piece of evidence does that. Connecting evidence to other evidence, seeing how they match up in terms of timelines, etc., this is how you get to the bottom of things.</p>

<p>For instance, I can connect Maria Butina’s appearance at a Trump rally in Vegas in 2015, asking Trump about Russian sanctions, to the
“Kremlin Connection” email sent by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/03/us/politics/trump-putin-russia-nra-campaign.html">Paul Erickson</a>, because Butina and Erickson own an LLC together, Bridges LLC that has no online profile or apparent business (read: a shell company).</p>

<p>I can also connect this to the FBI investigation of Butina’s boss Alex Torshin laundering money through the NRA, as the NRA was the intermediary used to connect Torshin and Erickson. </p>

<p>That evidence combined makes a stronger case than each piece looked at separately, that’s how investigating something works</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree with you about no proof of collusion. I&#39;m just going to set a scenario and see if you woild be concerned. Obama is in office a year. Susan Rice has been fired for lying to Joe Biden and more importantly the FBI, she is now a convicted felon and cooperating against Obama. David axelrod is under indictment with his partner for money laundering and crimes against the state. If just that was going on right now I would say the environment would be a tad different. So let&#39;s not play the left right game and concentrate on the big picture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing the Russians did was leverage social media to influence opinion. In comparison to what we in the west have done over the past 70 years to actually overthrow other democratically elected governments through violence and nothing more than what the CIA does currently.</p>

<p>Plus this is also an ideological issue, in my opinion the EU is a far greater threat to American and UK sovereignty than the Russians.</p>

<p>Forensic investigations of documents made public two weeks prior to the July 5 leak by the person or entity known as Guccifer 2.0 show that they were fraudulent: Before Guccifer posted them they were adulterated by cutting and pasting them into a blank template that had Russian as its default language. Guccifer took responsibility on June 15 for an intrusion the DNC reported on June 14 and professed to be a WikiLeaks source—claims essential to the official narrative implicating Russia in what was soon cast as an extensive hacking operation. To put the point simply, forensic science now devastates this narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia is not the biggest scandal in US History.  Their behavior hasn&#39;t changed in 20 years but now that Trump is elected it becomes a focus of fake news and hysteria. </p>

<p>Having DOJ/FBI folks conspire to overthrow Trump is the biggest scandal in US history.  We know they did it with MLK and JFK but never investigated and brought to light the evidence.  Now we have a chance to clean up corruption, people are being brain washed.  The MSM who colluded with FBI/DOJ efforts are obviously doing their best to distract and downplay.  </p>

<p>Bernie was rigged against and now we see similar actions against Trump.  Russia is a problem but the scale of the problem is nothing in comparison to the hijacking attempts going on with our democracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lifelong Independent here. Was a Beemer in the last election. First, thanks OP for such a considerate post. Yeah, this probably should have gone in r/politics, but I don&#39;t mind it here either. </p>

<p>Russia is oft used as a red herring to scare Americans into whatever line of B.S. the deep state is selling, so you&#39;ll have to forgive many of us for simply finding all of this Russia stuff just a bit too convenient. We&#39;ve heard it for the better part of 50 yrs. </p>

<p>Thing is, clearly there&#39;s cheating on both sides, but most of us agree that the Post -Obama US is a real shithole of a place and we&#39;re tired of that shithole being run by the same shitheads. Hence the popularity behind wild card candidates in 2016. </p>

<p>So, on the day Hillary lost and Trump won, I was very pleasantly surprised, because it meant that America has at least a few fucks to give left, and she told Corporate DC to fuck right off. </p>

<p>I know you are a liar through and through, I know that you aren&#39;t coming from a place of good faith, and I know it is likely you aren&#39;t even really a human being....</p>

<p>That being said, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/1007346/download">here is a link to the actual court documents for George Papadopoulos&#39; guilty plea.  It is related to the campaign and the election, despite the easy-to-prove-lies you are trying to spread</a></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>1) Yes, I do.</p>

<p>2) That&#39;s not how investigations of this size and scope work (rushed to completion, sharing your evidence with the public, etc)</p>

<p>3) <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/30/politics/donald-trump-attorneys/index.html">We are already at that stage, anyway</a></p>

<p>So, just to add to the 50+ links you intentionally ignored already, these are irrefutable facts that prove what you are saying is wholly inaccurate</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Trump employed a foreign national as campaign advisor, would that be collusion?  Would that be acceptable?  Would you turn a blind eye?  If the US allows foreign nationals to work as campaign advisors, does it really matter what happens with this Trump collusion thing?  Should our candidates be able to hire foreign people who also work for political campaigns in other parts of the globe?   As usual, people only want to address part of the problem.  But if you only address part of the problem, then the problem still exists and it will be ripe for exploitation.  I think our politicians like to exploit things, so they are only mildly motivated to fix anything.</p>

I am giving them a chance to vent anger and work through it. I ask people to respond to those types of comments not with insults or profanities of their own, but with interest. That you ask them why they believe these beliefs, and listen.**</p>

<p>So I guess in your unbiased opinion, Trump supporters are irrational, foul mouthed creatures who are so hung up on their worldview, that they&#39;ll will feel physically attacked by the sheer amount of evidence you&#39;ve displayed and will likely lash out.

    <div class="md"><p>I love how people are claiming that this sub is garbage for &quot;not supporting the biggest conspiracy theory every&quot; or whatever. Interesting how the exact same phrases keep coming up...</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting that is the only conspiracy that they believe and coincidentally (not really) the only conspiracy that the media does not label as tin foil hat worthy? The same media and intelligence communities that lied to your face and have spun story after story trying to manipulate you though propaganda to believe that the U.S. is about spreading Liberty and Justice? They would never spy on you they said. They would never lie to you about foreign affairs they said. Trump is so evil and ruining everything they said (where&#39;s the chaos I was told was coming and coming?).</p>

<p>Do you really think that the greatest conspiracy of all time would be something that the mass public would believe? TPTB would do everything in there control to keep the masses as sheep not knowing that they are being herded. If Trump is impeached what do you think is going to happen? They are gonna put in Hillary and the whole world we just become United and happy?</p>

<p>No here&#39;s the real conspiracy that this sub has claimed parts of since we&#39;ll before the election. The media, Hollywood, and the deep state are all controlled by evil people at the top involved in all sorts of nasty stuff (Pizzagate type stuff and worse). These people are hiding occult knowledge about our history, our true nature, the nature of the universe through secret societies or &quot;brotherhoods&quot;. Atlantis, Law of One, Aliens (interdimensional beings), Rome (Jesuits), Zionism, Tesla, The Bible and other historic texts, all are part of this much larger conspiracy. Politics are a part of it because these secret societies are controlling things behind the scenes and there are multiple. There is no coincidence that Trump&#39;s uncle was the last one to see Tesla&#39;s documents. </p>

At the same time, it’s suspicious that no one even wants to consider the evidence. 50 sources and every single one of them is lying?

<p>I still don’t see a single comment about anything from the links. Not one. There are a couple dismissing one of the links, the Manafort one, but this appears to be commentary on the title alone. Isn’t that weird?</p>

<p>but the absolute unwillingness of the users here to even consider the evidence ranks pretty high among the conspiracies surrounding this sub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You see the problem is isn&#39;t that people are willing to &quot;consider evidence&quot;, but rather the people posting it are claiming it to be absolute fact when while there is a ton or circumstantial evidence none of it directly proves anything. Even worse it&#39;s a classic case of information overload where you make a bold claim, provide a ton of sources for different things as if that somehow proves the bold claim. Since the reader is so overwhelmed by the mass amount of information they obviously aren&#39;t going to try and disprove all of the links.</p>

<p>That said this post really demonstrates the fundamental problem of the Russia narrative. The entire narrative has played along like this. News outlets will continually present the reader with a new &quot;fact&quot; each reliant on each other to create a larger narrative (carefully selected and spun to fit the larger story. It&#39;s important to note what&#39;s <strong>not being said</strong>). </p>

<p>Now this &quot;fact&quot; which more often than not has nothing other than hearsay to back it up is then assumed to be true. If anyone questions any individual fact they are immediately pointed to future &quot;facts&quot; whose validity inherently depended on the previous fact being true. It is circular logic at it&#39;s finest.</p>

<p>The initial example that started the narrative was the Russian hacking the DNC. Now there still is 0 conclusive evidence that the Russians hacked the DNC other than the intelligence communities (known liars) claiming it to be true.</p>

<p>At the time all I heard on this sub is that &quot;oh they will release the proof when the investigation is finished&quot;. It never came...</p>

<p>Instead what came was more convienently timed &quot;facts&quot; such as Facebook and Twitter accounts. Now many of these quickly debunked and taken down such as the 21 states &quot;hack&quot; or the &quot;power grid hack&quot; but this is conveniently ignored because &quot;the new facts prove that the entire story is legit&quot;. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe me watch it play out in real time, it&#39;s fascinating to see the public opinion be developed in such a way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s a good point. I also disagree with calling it “proof”. If anything it’s evidence, and the jury is still out if it’s material evidence. I don’t think you can completely discount everything anyone says if it goes against what you want to believe, so I think there must be some substance to this conspiracy given the number of different sources. Still, what we’ve been told so far wouldn’t hold up in a court case.</p>

<p>I don’t know if #TheMemo will have anything to do with this or if it’s mostly related to Hillary, but maybe there will be something substantial in it.</p>

<p>At the same time, it’s weird that in a place where people will spends hours poring over 4chan posts and scouring the internet for concurring evidence, no one seems to want to look into a single one of the links OP posted.</p>

<p>No one even seems to be able to say why <em>any</em> of these links are bs, let alone all of them. Every response is either an attack on OP or an attack on the sources, or an assumption that the entire thing is bullshit, apparently because it goes against what the “good guys” are saying.</p>

<p>No one has really defended the links either. OP posted them and people quickly proceeded to ignore them and begin throwing randomly aimed insults.</p>

<p>I agree and don&#39;t get me wrong I am not claiming that any individual source is wrong or anything of that nature. I just find it very peculiar that on a regular basis &quot;facts&quot; keep coming out which you would think would all have been known before the election. The fact Facebook and Twitter bots waited 6 months after the election after the DNC shifted the blame onto Russia to release there &quot;facts&quot; makes no sense to me especially considering the mass amount of data they have on everyone that I have seen first hand from people working there they would know immediately not 6 months later. </p>

<p>Add that to the whole Crowd strike involvement with the Clinton campaign and the false stories and it&#39;s easy to see why people are extremely skeptical. Innocent until proven guilty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is odd that nothing seems to have been released before the election. I mean, the story was out there, but it didn’t go very far. And dems definitely screwed themselves by shilling too much.</p>

<p>I agree with innocent until proven guilty, but isn’t the investigation essentially being blocked? It would make sense if Trump said the team is biased and someone else needs to investigate, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. The whole thing is being disappeared, or at least an attempt is being made.</p>

<p>I know it may not be related to that specific investigation, but I really hope they release the memo, and ideally the original source documents, even if redacted. It would just be nice to see something actually come out of any of this, from either side. So much noise is being made but nothing ever seems to happen. Which of course is probably the point. Hopefully someone with a voice calls bs on it all.</p>

<p>If Sanders wouldn&#39;t have been screwed over he would have won the Election hands down. A lot of us voted against Clinton for that very reason and Russia had nothing to do with it. </p>

<p>People just hate Trump cause he is an outsider with no filters. Do I approve of everything he does? Hell no. But I don&#39;t get offended/butthurt by him telling it how it is. A shithole is a shithole, I grew up in a shithole town in FL and more than 80% of the population is white. NK has been fucking with us for decades, their technology is finally catching up to the shit that comes out of their mouths.</p>

<p>All in all I 100% don&#39;t believe there was any collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. Could Russia have influence on the election in favor of Trump? Sure, right now this country is so fucking divided it&#39;s fucking pathetic, and that is the kind of shit our enemies want. </p>

<p>TL;DR No collusion between Russia and Trump Campaign 100%. Clinton will never be President, her fault Trump won. And I hope a false flag happens at the Super Bowl to reunite this pathetically divided country.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not so much Trump himself that is the reason, it&#39;s our political parties. One side is still butthurt and they take everything Trump says or does and spin it to fit their narrative. Also doesn&#39;t help mainstream media is a fucking joke these days, taking shit way out of context.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the work you put into this. I clicked the thing about Russia hacking the election.</p>

<p>The2nd paragraph states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>two sources familiar with the matter tell TIME. Investigators have not identified whether the hackers in that case were Russian agents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its shit like this that makes people not believe. There is a narrative being pushed about Russia hacking the election and the 2nd paraghrapgh states the exact opposite.  You can&#39;t have the 2nd paraghrapgh discredit the entire talking point and wonder why people don&#39;t believe the talking point. </p>

<p>Couple that with the fact that alphabet agencies can make it look like a security breech happened from anywhere in the world makes the burden of proof quite high. </p>

<p>That is why people don&#39;t  belive &quot;facts&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if you added excerpts from the articles, this is nothing more than a typical gish gallop. People use them to push agendas on Reddit all the time.</p>

<p>Make a huge post with 50 links and excerpts like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As soon as news of the termination broke, some political observers began to sound off that something doesn&#39;t add up. The timing is suspicious, and the reasoning is convenient. It raises all kinds of questions about what happened and what happens next, especially as the FBI is reportedly ramping up its investigation of Trump associates&#39; connections to Russia.</p>

<p>“A number of theories have been circulating about the supposed relationship between Dmitry Rybolovlev and President Donald Trump,” Sergey Chemitsyn, an adviser to the Russian billionaire, said in a statement to McClatchy. “None of these theories has any foundation in fact.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>. This is the laziest, most disingenuous form of argument a person can make.</p>

<p>And to top it all of, you introduce the post with a lighthearted comic romising that if we hear you out, we&#39;ll see your side of things.</p>

<p>Dump 50 links. No analysis, no context. That&#39;s All Folks!</p>

<p>you probably haven&#39;t even read half of them</p>

<p>If you were capable of articulating the logic behind your reasoning clearly, you would have done so and you&#39;re argument post would have looked something like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/72gebw/trumprussia_imbroglio_breakdown">this</a>, but you aren&#39;t. hence the gish gallop.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>up till now I&#39;ve only see a few things that may pan out with a shit ton of smoke, like the claim that Manaforts indictment is evidence of collusion. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>well, that’s not exactly true. OP gave you a wide number of links, all of which help to prove a wider conspiracy going on between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. They are all part of a web of evidence.</p>

<p>You took one piece of evidence, and asked for someone to explain how this one piece “proves collusion”</p>

<p>I was honestly unsure of whether to respond how I did or to make the point I am now, that taking a piece out of its larger context and into a vacuum and asking how that one specific thing proves anything is intellectually dishonest. </p>

<p>I don’t particularly believe, say, Pizzagate, but I can still see how it’s unfair to take one of Podesta’s emails and say “well how does this email prove the claims of Pizzagate”, because no one piece of evidence does that. Connecting evidence to other evidence, seeing how they match up in terms of timelines, etc., this is how you get to the bottom of things.</p>

<p>For instance, I can connect Maria Butina’s appearance at a Trump rally in Vegas in 2015, asking Trump about Russian sanctions, to the
“Kremlin Connection” email sent by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/03/us/politics/trump-putin-russia-nra-campaign.html">Paul Erickson</a>, because Butina and Erickson own an LLC together, Bridges LLC that has no online profile or apparent business (read: a shell company).</p>

<p>I can also connect this to the FBI investigation of Butina’s boss Alex Torshin laundering money through the NRA, as the NRA was the intermediary used to connect Torshin and Erickson. </p>

<p>That evidence combined makes a stronger case than each piece looked at separately, that’s how investigating something works</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how people are claiming that this sub is garbage for &quot;not supporting the biggest conspiracy theory every&quot; or whatever. Interesting how the exact same phrases keep coming up...</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting that is the only conspiracy that they believe and coincidentally (not really) the only conspiracy that the media does not label as tin foil hat worthy? The same media and intelligence communities that lied to your face and have spun story after story trying to manipulate you though propaganda to believe that the U.S. is about spreading Liberty and Justice? They would never spy on you they said. They would never lie to you about foreign affairs they said. Trump is so evil and ruining everything they said (where&#39;s the chaos I was told was coming and coming?).</p>

<p>Do you really think that the greatest conspiracy of all time would be something that the mass public would believe? TPTB would do everything in there control to keep the masses as sheep not knowing that they are being herded. If Trump is impeached what do you think is going to happen? They are gonna put in Hillary and the whole world we just become United and happy?</p>

<p>No here&#39;s the real conspiracy that this sub has claimed parts of since we&#39;ll before the election. The media, Hollywood, and the deep state are all controlled by evil people at the top involved in all sorts of nasty stuff (Pizzagate type stuff and worse). These people are hiding occult knowledge about our history, our true nature, the nature of the universe through secret societies or &quot;brotherhoods&quot;. Atlantis, Law of One, Aliens (interdimensional beings), Rome (Jesuits), Zionism, Tesla, The Bible and other historic texts, all are part of this much larger conspiracy. Politics are a part of it because these secret societies are controlling things behind the scenes and there are multiple. There is no coincidence that Trump&#39;s uncle was the last one to see Tesla&#39;s documents. </p>
