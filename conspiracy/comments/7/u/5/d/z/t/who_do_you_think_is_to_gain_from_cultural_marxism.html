    <div class="md"><p>The Frankfurt School &quot;Cultural Marxists&quot; in fact <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_industry">critiqued Hollywood</a> (Adorno), <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/postmodernism/#9">critiqued Post Modernism</a> (Habermas), and <a href="https://konspektikaust.wordpress.com/2012/10/22/nancy-fraser-rethinking-recognition/">critiqued Identity Politics</a> (Fraser).</p>

<p>But the right side of politics would have you believe they created these things.</p>

<p>Also, Yuri Bezmenov was funded by the John Birch Society (who lost popularity <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Birch_Society#Eisenhower_issue">when they accused Dwight D. Eisenhower of being a communist</a>). He didn&#39;t even do any subversion in America - he did it in India (and married an Indian woman). His main &quot;subversion&quot; was writing for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIA_Novosti">RiA Novosti</a> (a Russian government news outlet, sort of like Russia Today). That was the extent of his subversion, and he went on to preach equality:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I believe that black is beautiful, but unlike some of your liberals, I practice what I preach. I live in a black area of Los Angeles, in the city which has the best black mayor in the United States, Tom Bradley. I am married to a girl who is rather black, maybe not as black as Andrew Young or Jesse Jackson, but nobody’s perfect. And I am trying to bring such beautiful concepts as equality, justice, and freedom into practical implementation.&quot; -Yuri Bezmenov</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Yuri quote is from his book, &quot;Black is Beautiful, Communism is Not&quot; which is available <a href="https://archive.org/stream/YuriBezmenovBlackIsBeautifulCommunismIsNot/YuriBezmenovBlackIsBeautiful_djvu.txt">in full here</a> from &#39;archive.org&#39; the not-for-profit organization behind &quot;The Way Back Machine&quot;. You can also find <a href="https://archive.org/details/BezmenovNoNovostiIsGoodNews">info</a> on another one of his books &quot;No Novosti is Good Novosti&quot;.</p>

<p>The long and short of it is that most governments around the world use new media as a way to get certain perspectives pushed out there. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq8A_8gUc3Y&amp;amp;t=500s">This video kind of sums up why that came to be.</a> - it was to do with the transition between empires and nations (and the question of how to convince people to go to war).</p>

<p>But yeah, my understanding is that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3qkf3bajd4">this video</a> of Yuri entitled &quot;Deception was my Job&quot; involves him giving an interview to a member of the John Birch Society, and it&#39;s assumed they funded the video.</p>

<p>Conservative Think Tanks have been very much involved with demonizing The Frankfurt School and moulding the term &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; into a buzzword/conspiracy. I mean check this out, here&#39;s a quote from William S Lind of the &#39;Free Congress Foundation&#39; (a right wing think tank):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Just what is Political Correctness? The &quot;Politically Correct&quot; people on your campus really, really don&#39;t want you to know the answer to that question. Why? Because Political Correctness is nothing less than Marxism translated from economic into cultural terms.&quot; -William S. Lind</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...and here&#39;s an exert from the manifesto Norwegian mass shooter Anders Behring Breivik sent out before killing a bunch of kids (in the name of his politics):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Just what is “Political Correctness?” Political Correctness is in fact cultural Marxism (Cultural Communism) – Marxism translated from economic into cultural terms.&quot; -Anders Behring Breivik</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Modern political ideologies have become an unhealthy framework for humanity (I mean shooting a bunch of kids isn&#39;t healthy for anyone). It&#39;s sad. People can&#39;t even talk to each other any more.</p>

<p>Do you have a first hand account of how terrible Hitler and nazi Germany was in the 1940&#39;s? Do you have first hand experience of how slavery in the states was inhumane? I don&#39;t believe we need to have a first hand experience to know that something is bad. That&#39;s absolutely an absurd thing to believe. </p>

<p>The entire point of teaching history is to educate about what happened, why, and what we can learn from it so that we don&#39;t make the same mistakes as others before us. History, books provide real first hand accounts. Are you aware that back in the 20&#39;s Russia had to put up signs begging their people to not eat their babies? Are you aware that more than 100 million people died under communist regimes in the 20th century? Do you believe Fidel Castro was a great guy and that the people who fled we&#39;re just snowflakes? How about the defectors from North Korea, think their just bullshitting us? The Gulag Archipelago would be a great first hand account of what labor camps were like in the Soviet Union in the 20th century if your looking for real people, expressing their very real experiences. You read that and then get back to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if anybody is at all interested in an actual explanation of how this ideology works or not. It seems we turn our brains off as soon as we hear that &quot;cultural marxism&quot; tag. But truly understanding your enemy - or even honestly engaging with them - is truly empowering.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start with the most obvious pain point - the one that Jordan Peterson stepped into and became famous - the issue of sexual identity. Take a deep breath.</p>

<p>If you knew for a fact that X number of people from your community would have to be sent to the gas chambers - who would you send? Sure you could start with convicts and maybe the mentally ill, but eventually you would have to start choosing &quot;normal&quot; people. The sexual identity &quot;sjw&quot; folks are all about insisting that LGBTQ... people fit in the &quot;normal&quot; category - in terms of gas chamber appointments, and in terms of other amenities that are socially available to &quot;normal&quot; people. Is that wrong?</p>

<p>But does it matter? Let&#39;s imagine that you happen to be smart enough to see that for whatever reason, the human population is rapidly changing their own biological predispositions, just by a variety of social, hormonal, chemical, and other disruptions to the human organism. What if you knew that in 20 years the number of people identifying LGBTQ... was going to very possibly become a serious minority. Maybe a majority of people - citizens - voters.</p>

<p>Now you can jump all over the premises I just laid out. But if you put yourself in that situation, and you saw a world of hurt coming on, where massive resentments between large sectors based on identity could lead to division, discrimination, hatred, threats, violence, and ultimately a strange new form of genocide. And it could go either way.</p>

<p>The so-called &quot;cultural marxists&quot; have been designing a society that cannot slip into the death camp mode and take a sizeable population down the drain. Do you blame them?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll explain more - the roots and justification, the mind-altering, the political and media manipulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This seems to be a weirdly mixed up post. I thought at first it was the usual &quot;bash the dirty marxists&quot; stuff, but then a bunch of commenters wanted to balance that out with scholarly lectures - as if professors just doing their thing couldn&#39;t be too bad.</p>

<p>But what I want to get at is the true roots of the movement and why they have the sensitivities we all laugh at.</p>

<p>All the Frankfurt School were political philosophers who got their start after WWI and thrived for a time in Weimar Germany. When Hitler came to power, they eventually had to flee. One of them, Walter Benjamin, did not make it out (he committed suicide when he thought the Nazis were about to arrest him in France).</p>

<p>So they were all marked by the enormity of the holocaust, as we all should be. The thing about the holocaust, that distinctly separates it from almost every other mass murder genocide event, is that it was done as a highly rational, industrial operation. In other words, it made murder into a factory process.</p>

<p>So when the Frankfurt School got re-situated in California mostly after WWII, they specifically concentrated on an analysis of the personality that could perpetrate such a crime against humanity. Their study was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Authoritarian_Personality">The Authoritarian Personality</a>. Here is a bit from wiki:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The personality type Adorno et al. identified can be defined by nine traits that were believed to cluster together as the result of childhood experiences. These traits include conventionalism, authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, anti-intellectualism, anti-intraception, superstition and stereotypy, power and &quot;toughness&quot;, destructiveness and cynicism, projectivity, and exaggerated concerns over sex.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My &quot;Meta&quot; view of what they then set out to do, is to create a world in which that personality could not easily be entirely placed in all power positions in any given governmental system - at least in the western democracies. This objective <em>required</em> lots of indirect, wacky strategies. The &quot;test case&quot; was Flower Power that helped end the Vietnam War. Pushing standard assumptions concerning morality, sexuality, the family, etc. was a key component.</p>

<p>In the background of this on-going project is always the gas chambers and what they symbolize: the ability of an industrial nation to evaporate a chosen segment of the population - no fuss, no mess.</p>

<p>btw, all of you holocaust-deniers - wink, wink - this entire concern would be only slightly diminished if indeed there were no jewish holocaust! In other words - even if it was just a matter of appearances being made with all those camps, the symbolism and lessons are still pertinent and effective in designating the goal: don&#39;t enable things like gas chambers. </p>

<p>Genocide has occurred in Rwanda and Cambodia - millions killed, but not yet industrially. Perhaps some larger authoritarian high-tech event has been prevented by the efforts of the Frankfurt School?</p>

<p>imho, that frames the essence of &quot;cultural marxism&quot;. It seeks to inoculate culture from another 20th century debacle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cultural Marxism was The Frankfurt School&#39;s critique of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_industry">The Culture Industry</a>. It was an early critique of mainstream media and neo-liberalism. Adorno had things like this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Culture Industry not so much adapts to the reactions of its customers as it counterfeits them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;this bloated pleasure apparatus adds no dignity to man’s lives. The idea of “fully exploiting” available technical resources and the facilities for aesthetic mass consumption is part of the economic system which refuses to exploit resources to abolish hunger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The ruthless unity in the culture industry is evidence of what will happen in politics. Marked differentiations such as those of A and B films, or of stories in magazines in different price ranges, depend not so much on subject matter as on classifying, organising, and labelling consumers. Something is provided for all so that none may escape&quot; -Theodor W. Adorno, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/adorno/1944/culture-industry.htm">Enlightenment as mass-deception</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile Marcuse warned everyone that &quot;progressive politics&quot; could also become repressive and regressive in it&#39;s own ways:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al3aOuqpVbs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al3aOuqpVbs</a></p>

<p>...and The Birmingham School warned that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uses_of_Literacy#The_.22drift.22">culture was drifting away</a> from local culture. Due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uses_of_Literacy#Massification_of_culture">Massification of culture in the form of the globalization of media + tabloid journalism.</a></p>

<p>This was a pre-internet critique of mainstream media and neo-liberalism, and ended around the time media became more democratized in the 80s, when the internet began to be foreshadowed with Zines, DIY culture, and public radio/TV. That&#39;s when the tail end of the Birmingham School declared the need to critique mass media <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding/decoding_model_of_communication">to be kind of over because everyone could talk to everyone.</a></p>

<p>....of course, the right wing conspiracy theorists will say it&#39;s SJWs and a jewish plot that runs the media... but it was actually critiquing the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I think I get it now. I always wondered why people used the phrase &quot;cultural marxism&quot; when they always have absolutely no idea about actual marxist philosophy. When idiots say &quot;cultural marxism&quot;, they&#39;re using it as a synonym for the concept of social equality. They&#39;d look fucking dumb as hell to say &quot;I am opposed to the concept of social equality&quot;, but if they misappropriate some scary buzzwords like &quot;marxism&quot;, they can express their desire to support subjugation of others without everyone realizing how much of a jerk they&#39;re being. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a grassroots movement at all.  I think it&#39;s one of several issues (gun control, abortion, BLM, feminism, etc) that gets overexposed for political gain (not left/right but divide and conquer).  The cabal want us to focus on things that affect a disproportionately small number of people, or on things that are so evenly split between groups that no progress can be made on them, or on things that where there the crimes are becoming more and more minute.  People get emotionally entangled in these issues, but no progress is really made, meanwhile no one pays attention to the important shady stuff they do behind close doors.</p>

<p>Part of this is to instill victimhood consciousness.  People who think they are the victims have mental blocks which prevent them from achieving their goals.  They spend so much energy circling around the different reasons the external world is screwing them that they don&#39;t spend energy on what they can do to achieve their own individual goals.  Victims in civilized society want the authority figure to step in and fix the problems for them, so it reinforces the governments position over the people.  So you get this weird thing where Obama can exert power over all the colleges in the US and force them to hold these rape tribunals that exist outside of law.</p>

<p>Secondarily, they want to blur the lines of what&#39;s acceptable and distract from what they are doing.  By shifting the line, their pedo and violent stuff gets moved closer to center.  Also by spamming the media with certain ideas it floods the channels with &quot;safe&quot; content, while diluting the focus on the darker stuff.  A lot of the MeToo stuff is legit, but a lot of it is trying to flood the channels so that we think the bad stuff is casting couch stuff, rather than pedo stuff.</p>

<p>Thirdly, for whatever reason, the cabal has a strong desire to mix the genders.  I think it goes beyond trying to break our identities and traditions.    You can very clearly see it in Hollywood.  </p>
