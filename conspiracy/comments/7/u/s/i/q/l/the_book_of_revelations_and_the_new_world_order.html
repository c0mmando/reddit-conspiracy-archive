    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t a specific date, it is more of a gradual leaving the Age of Pisces and moving into the Age of Aquarius. Some people believe the year 2012 is significant (meaning I they think we started moving toward Age of Aquarius in 2012).</p>

<p>It all has to do with where the Sun rises on the Spring Equinox of each year. For the past 2,000 (or so) years it has risen in the constellation of Pisces.</p>

<p>The Sun rises and stays in each constellation for approx. 2,000 years.</p>

<p>There can be evolution with or without a God, I realize this.</p>

<p>Also, literally every passage?</p>

<p>Including that an omnipotent and benevolent God would endorse executing some random guy the congregation found in the forest?</p>

<p>&quot;Now while the sons of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering wood on the Sabbath day. Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation; and they put him in custody because it had not been declared what should be done to him. Then the Lord said to Moses, “<strong>The man shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp</strong>.” So all the congregation brought him outside the camp and <strong>stoned him to death with stones, just as the Lord had commanded Moses</strong>.&quot; - Numbers 15: 32-36 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Then I saw another beast rising out of the earth. 
It had two horns like a lamb 
and it spoke like a dragon. 
It exercises all the authority 
of the first beast in its presence, 
and makes the earth and its inhabitants 
worship the first beast, 
whose mortal wound was healed, 
performs great signs, 
even making fire come down from heaven to earth 
in front of people, 
and by the signs that it is allowed to work 
in the presence of the beast
it deceives those who dwell on earth, 
telling them to make an image 
for the beast that was wounded by the sword 
and yet lived. 
And  it was allowed to give breath 
to the image of the beast, 
so that the image of the beast might even speak 
and might cause those who would not worship 
the image of the beast <em>to be slain.</em>
Also it causes all, 
both small and great, 
both rich and poor, 
both free and slave,
to be marked on the right hand 
or the forehead, 
so that no one can buy or sell 
unless he has the mark, 
that is, the name of the beast 
or the number of its name. 
This calls for wisdom: 
let the one who has understanding 
calculate the number of the beast, 
for it is the number of a man, 
and his number is 666.</p>

<p>Rev 13:11+</p>

<p>The chip will not be a choice.  Then you will know this prophecy is real.  Who knows, may not even be a chip. But the same outcome. No money, all transactions monitored. Cashless scenarios are being entertained frequently. And remember, this was prophesied before technology, so don’t go making assumptions on what we know from last few decades. You will have to just wait and see where it goes.  </p>
