    <div class="md"><p>Legislation isn&#39;t politics? K.</p>

<p>Im not saying it&#39;s wrong to get involved. I am saying, at least for myself, is after years of being involved i would rather chase information and reflect over it so i can delegate the getting involved and being social to those that still have the energy for that sort of thing.</p>

<p>And, on some topics, especially the kind chased around here, i think some folks get a bit paranoid that they&#39;d end up on a wack-a-mole list if they tried to confront certain complaints head-on. I could be wrong.</p>

<p>Government isn&#39;t useless, but it isn&#39;t what people want at the center of their lives in many cases.</p>

<p>Just thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s a good question... </p>

<p>Anymore, at the most base level, i try not to get any more worked up over or active in events than i would speculating on the next star wars movie or deciding whats for dinner. </p>

<p>Previously, it involved 14 hour days,/ 24/7/363 total commitment, personal action, book keeping, recruiting, indoctrination, accountability measures, and active delegation of actions. way too exhausting. i retired that part of myself. this is just a hobby for better or worse anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To solve it requires far more than petitions and writing Congress. It requires seizing the Parties, from the local to the national level, installing actual representatives of the People in the newly captured Parties, then running actual Representative of the People at every level of government, often in contention with the Party as it is being stormed. Grassroots organizing is the only way forward, and it aint easy.</p>

<p>Here is an example of what I mean- the smallest organizational unit of the Democratic Party is the Precinct. Any registered Dem can show up to their local meetings and vote for their Precinct Chair. Precinct Chairs vote for County Chairs, who vote for State Chairs, who vote for National Chairs. This is how you storm the Party- one state, one race, on goddamn county at a time. Writing petitions won&#39;t do anything- Congress is, for the most part, a lost cause.

This is how you storm the Party- one state, one race, one goddamn county at a time. Writing petitions won&#39;t do anything- Congress is, for the most part, a lost cause. It requires replacing the current Congressmen, and that only happens with organization from the bottom up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but they can&#39;t rig the Primary if they don&#39;t control the Party, and Party positions don&#39;t require Primaries...like I said, any registered Dem can show up to their local Precinct meeting and vote for the Chair. All you need is to surmount the massive obstacle of organizing enough people to be there, on time, on the same page, to start fighting it. This is why I say we need to take the Party first. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s not a bad opinion. I think the important thing, though, is that they still have to maintain the show of Democracy, which involves actually letting the People have a say in the process somewhere...this is their only weakness, because though it is a small say, if effectively organized around, it is their achilles heel. Like I said- <em>any</em> registered Dem can show up to their local meetings and vote for the Precinct chair. The difficulty is getting people registered, getting them informed, finding a candidate, letting everyone know the date, and then getting everyone there in enough numbers to win a floor vote. A lot of these Precinct Chairs are chosen by highly involved Party members, but usually only a handful...there&#39;s nothing they can do if 100 registered Party members walk into the meeting and outvote them.</p>

<p>I think the only issue here is that so many people are utterly dependent on the system for their daily lives that even though they may despise it, to stop working within it means homelessness, poverty, or even death for them and their families. This is why I don&#39;t think people will start doing that until the food runs out- then the desperation truly sets in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that, I disagree because of the Orgs he promised to found when he condeded- such as Our Revolution, the fact that he <em>did</em> found them, that they <em>are</em> fighting the DNC, and that the DNC purged Bernies picks for the Ethics and Rules commission...I think he took a strategic move in endorsing HRC to avoid being Nader&#39;d, and he came off politically stronger because of it. Even at the time members of his inner circle stated that he had doubts about HRC&#39;s chances at winning.</p>

<p>I disagree with a lot of Ron Pauls politics but I think he is a real believer and friend of the People, and I support some of his bigger initiatives like auditing the Fed, but as I&#39;m sure you can tell I&#39;m no Libertarian, so a lot of his ideas are non starters for me ;P </p>
