    <div class="md"><p>Mass at speed = initial mass at rest/square root of (1-v2/c2).</p>

<p>This is the formula necessary to calculate the <em>increase in mass as an object approaches the speed of light.</em></p>

<p>Let&#39;s say, for instance, you wished to escape the gravitational field produced by the earth. You would need to generate your own field of gravity that was greater than -9.82m/s<sup>2</sup></p>

<p><em>Theoretically</em> if one were to accelerate an already massive enough object near the speed of light, it would increase the mass of said object, thus increasing the strength of the gravitational field the object produces. If you produced a gravitational field with the force of 10.00m/s<sup>2,</sup> you should move through space at a rate of 0.18m/s<sup>2.</sup> Increase it even further, and you have the potential to bend time and space. </p>

<p>This is the closest I&#39;ve ever been able to come to calculate what is necessary for traveling through time. You would need an incredibly heavy object to accelerate in something similar to a particle accelerator, only on a massive scale. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>if media is any indication of how it&#39;s done you&#39;ll need to get a long wool green or brown overcoat like the kind Tom Baker used to wear when he was Dr. Who.  and you&#39;ll need a long scarf.  some kind of hat, preferably a toque of sorts that&#39;s somewhat disheveled.  you&#39;ll need some watches, ideally self winding, and some pocket watches.  as many watches as you can get that add to the general vibe of Time Lord.  you&#39;ll need good boots - i recommend solid work boots of some kind.  you&#39;ll need flashlights, preferably windup ones cos finding batteries is hit and miss during your travels.  you&#39;ll need some kind of flash or thermos.  self-explanatory really.  you&#39;ll need a partner, preferably younger and female.  and a dog doesn&#39;t hurt, either.  i recommend unruly ones because well, if you can&#39;t control them, then who can?  anyway...you&#39;ll need a good compass.  you&#39;ll probably need some sort of leatherman.  a lock pick (electric toothbrushes glued to some bra underwire is good here) for the scrape, and some more bra underwire for the torsion wrench.  the metal they use is ideal!  you&#39;ll need some kind of bolt cutter that you can carry under your overcoat (this also works well as a weapon if you&#39;re uncautious).  you&#39;ll need some kind of man bag to put your stuff in.  and you&#39;ll need a towel.  ok.  oh, and if you&#39;re really fancy you can get one of those scientific calculators that has a programmable reverse polish notation stack to run your code on.  get all of those things together and you&#39;re reasonably prepped.  all you gotta do next is look for phonebooths or porta potties that look out of place.  and you&#39;re golden.  good luck chappy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well not really.  i studied mech eng and we did some of the transistor stuff.  i&#39;m a quick learner and could come to speed quickly enough.  and i&#39;m pretty solid on the symbolics side of things having written a bunch of code from scratch trying to model the universe.  i reckon i could probably design a computer if i needed to.  and i&#39;ve done work as a mech eng on heavy duty pulley design so i&#39;m kinda ok on the mechanics of gears - could improve this i guess.  essentially this gear model is how you&#39;d build a calculator and from that you could derive the rest of it.  i reckon the watch makers know a thing or two.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly. and dont forget to consider looking at those counterweights. it would be agonizingly slow between retrieves - but it could hold a hell of a lot of patterns at once.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I understand it - and believe me I don&#39;t much - all quantum entities can be addressed to all others in the timespace block. That means they are already adjacent, in a way, to wherever we might want to travel.</p>

<p>So the technology will involve a sort of teleportation of something (a pattern?) not through, but via, all possible universes, to another address in the ginormous block of available addresses.</p>

<p>It may be prudent to start by doing the reverse operation, that is, try to gather a pattern from a distant address into ours, rather than pushing ourselves there. It may also be best to merely pull a visual and not try to pull the focal entity and reify its pattern.</p>

<p>I know just saying &quot;teleport&quot; for the technology is a cop-out. This is the part that I can&#39;t see comprehensively. But I suppose it will have to do with both Einstein and Tesla, who gave two conflicting explanations. When we are able to synthesize those, it will be much clearer.</p>

<p>Of course all these constructs can be found hanging out in various corners of the UFO/Free Energy/AntiGrav/ESP/Alien/Conspiracy world. It&#39;s not really my theory. I&#39;m channeling it. Would be great if some of you would clarify (or demolish) the possible avenues stated here. </p>

<p>so my general impression is that einstein was wrong and tesla is more on the tip.  the way i&#39;d go about doing it would be to figure out how to get a rapidly spinning heavy metallic magnetic ball levitated over a field.  spin it up.  then turn on other magnets to isolate its spin along a single axis, constrained in all other axes.  then turn on some more magnets to stop that spin.  the momentum would have to go somewhere.  if you understand the right hand rule and how gyro momentum spits out sidewayslike you&#39;d be able to figure out how to arrange the magnet parts.  once the ball has its rotation controlled the remaining vectors should be moving in the time dimension.  and if the field strength is sufficient, those things within it should also move along with it.  that&#39;s how i&#39;d approach designing this kind of machine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it seems to me this will induce a perturbation in the gravity field, trivially allowing anti-grav, but also possibly enabling a controlled wormhole, which is likely to come out at some other location. the question is, how do you direct that where you want to go?</p>

<p>but - here&#39;s where it gets weirder - i am not convinced that we can do it with &quot;machinery&quot; alone. there is something pertaining to consciousness that may be crucial. then the issue becomes how might we instrumentalize the soul - too far out for most...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah anti-grav for sure is there.  hutchinson&#39;s vids show this.  so it happens.  in terms of where it goes re: time?  i dunno.  there are some vids by dr. david anderson of the time control institute where he describes some of the experiments that have been successfully done and he seems to intimate that it&#39;s a mutable hypercube model (ie. back to the future).  i think the only way to know is to do the experiments.</p>

<p>re: the soul stuff.  yeah.  good intentions, right.  there was another guy i think in a project camelot vid who worked as a machinist in some of the followup experiments done to the philadelphia experiment and this guy made a point of saying that during the construction of the equipment they were told very clearly that their intentions were a very important part of the manufacturing.  so...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>interesting - have heard that same &quot;intentions&quot; focus discussed in several other modes. sometimes i think in part what we do when we comment online is to lay out a pattern of intentions - whether they do anything or not we may never know.</p>

<p>just a hunch - i think we all (here) know that some lab underground with zero visibility is doing this stuff in non-fiction mode. maybe part of the &quot;problem&quot; is that they are doing it with bad intention (to steal, to hide, to dominate, etc.) and that what is needed is the opposite of those.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well for sure the tech exists in my experience.  i have several people contact me in the strangest ways and they&#39;ve more or less communicated this to me.  there are at least 2 groups with it, maybe more.  there is some sort of time conflict going on.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i wont say &quot;experience&quot; - for me its just a weird (thats my favorite word any more) sense of certainty about these things - including the time wars. Something went seriously funky around 9/11, at least. But maybe this type of thing has been going on all of history. I spend a whole lot of time thinking about contingency - what could have happened but didn&#39;t but may still be floating around like a wisp of fog.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well ok so one of the things i was told was the sequence of future events - and this happened circa 2005.  this is only one of the incidences.  this dude told me about trump getting elected and nuke war with NK.  he told me about the romans and saturn and time travel and sims and flat earth and pizzagate (which is a key part of the whole thing).  it was pretty weird.  and i&#39;ve had a bunch of these type of experiences more or less my whole life.  so i&#39;ve kept an eye out on how to prep - but never really knowing who to trust or if i was being manipulated (which i&#39;m pretty sure was the intention in a lot of the cases).  so what i settled on doing was just getting good as systems design because it enables scale.  and just tried to get good at that while these clowns kept trying to make my life difficult and full of distraction.  it&#39;s been a weird ride. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i managed to get as far as make running on debian but there were some hiccups along the way with libdb that i found a resolution for here (<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3686">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3686</a>).  still having build issues..trying on fedora now.  i did notice that he says &quot;do not use this&quot; at the top of his git readme, and he has another repo that&#39;s empty where he&#39;s probably put the complete implementation in when it&#39;s ready.  this repo seems to be a test one.</p>
