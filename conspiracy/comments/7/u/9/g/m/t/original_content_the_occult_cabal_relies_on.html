        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">65</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-01-31 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Love_And_Light33.html">Love_And_Light33</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Symbols have power. The esoteric eye of the cabal, those who are virtually unknown to the general public, whose names have never been registered by any government, whom have never received an identification number and who live in a hidden runaway civilization, think in symbols a few magnitudes more complex than our own primitive language system. Those underneath them, those families we know who are controlled by their lust, greed, and <em>fear</em>, meditate on symbols while performing their depraved satanic rituals to charge them with power, and then place these symbols hidden in plane sight to saturate the general publics subconsciousness.</p>

<p>Symbols lose their power when the uninitiated gain an understanding of their meaning.</p>

<p>One of the most important symbols of the cabal is the well known symbol of the triangle that continues to create denser and denser triangles within itself. You can see this symbol embedded 6 times here on the LA County Sheriffs badge:</p>

<p><a href="http://stateofthenation2012.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Badge_of_the_Sheriff_of_Los_Angeles_County.png">http://stateofthenation2012.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Badge_of_the_Sheriff_of_Los_Angeles_County.png</a></p>

<p>The esoteric meaning of this symbol is that it represents the opposite of the divine fibonacci spiral:</p>

<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Fibonacci_spiral.svg">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Fibonacci_spiral.svg</a></p>

<p>The fibonacci spiral is the divine square, the rate of growth of the development of our spirit. At any point on the spiral, we feel a deep kinship with everything we have accomplished, yet also see how grand and vast the opportunities for growth the future holds, accelerating as we get closer and closer to transcending this matrix. There is free will to experience this rate of growth in any form we choose.</p>

<p>The cabal represents an opposite force to this freedom. The path is fixed, there is no free will. It looks like the universe is ending at each turn, and this terrifies those caught in the loop. Each turn is progressively denser, more suffocating.</p>

<p>This is the cycle of fear that the cabal want to trap us in.</p>

<p>This symbols is used to represent the child trafficking rings because the victims are caught in this cycle.</p>

<p>THere are surely more layers of meaning that I haven&#39;t pierced yet. It is an occult law that the karma of learning and the karma of teaching are intimately linked, so my hope with sharing this information is threefold, one so that the awareness of this symbol may lessen or eliminate any contaminations it may have caused in our subconsciousness, two so that the symbol itself may lose power on any plane it operates and so that we may begin to see these pedo rings being exposed, and third in hopes that with a group discussion we can pierce deeper into the veil on this subject.</p>

<p>Symbols, like many of the tricks of the cabal, can have no effect on you simply as a result of your will (and a body clean of contaminations and with spiritual practice) but awareness is key to this.</p>

<p>Symbols are how the cabal have lulled the world into mass hypnosis, but their reliance on it will be their downfall.</p>

<p>Thus, the move to symbols was made.  Hence the saying attributed to Confucious, “Signs and symbols rule the world, not words nor laws.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is the Bible corrupted/turned upside down. It is not the endgame of love and peace like Jesus wanted.  But Lucifer&#39;s desire for power and greed and supreme knowledge so man can become God. Both of whom are said to be the sun/son of God...
Even if you aren&#39;t religious,  the top people are, so it is best to become acquainted with what they believe.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s only one path to God, that would be &quot;the door,&quot; otherwise known as Jesus Christ. The other path at best leads to being a servant of Lucifer or whatever you want to call &quot;the devil.&quot; I think everyone here knows how that ends. You can be judged by your works without Faith if you&#39;d like. But &quot;all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.&quot; </p>

<p>God had many sons. But only one is unique, the &quot;embodiment&quot; of God Himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree but there are people that believe Lucifer is the real Jesus, dating all the way back to the mystery religions and Osiris/Isis. That the God from Genesis was not benevolent because he kept us in the dark and withheld knowledge.  It was Lucifer who gave us knowledge and therefore allowed us to evolve.  Lucifer is the light bringer. </p>

<p>Imo it is a lie though, making us believe we can actually become God through acquisition of power and intellect.  That we can evolve to our highest supreme being which would be God as man (again, not meant for us but for one individual -the Antichrist?) But man is inherently flawed with prejudices, capacity for evil, etc. So man as god would be frightening.  </p>

<p>Unless that man was like Jesus,  the living embodiment of love and forgiveness.  Something so simple but so incredibly difficult.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I know Gnosticism quite well unfortunately. Fell into that trap for many years. Perhaps it was providence though, as I now spend much of my free time attempting to show others what God showed me about it. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no doubt in my mind that &quot;Lucifer,&quot; actually read Naschach, is also one of God&#39;s heavenly sons. (&quot;Kal El of Krypton&quot; anyone?) But when he and his underlings rebelled they were cast out of heaven and given some temporary dominion here after the tower of Babel incident. (&quot;Stuck in the middle with you&quot; ring a bell?)</p>

<p>One of the greatest things I gleaned from my Gnostic days was the ability to recognize the theology.  Hard to believe but pretty much every blockbuster movie, and hit album since the 1940&#39;s or so has a bit of that in there. Things by Wachowski Bros, Stanley Kubrick, are all Gnostic theologies. Lupe Fiasco has &quot;there&#39;s only 2 ways out, one is the door (Jesus) the other is me (Lucifer)&quot; as the hook. TPTB have been using the music and movie industries to basically &quot;inception&quot; these beliefs into our heads. Unfortunately it is working.</p>

<p>So I come to places like this, take my down votes like a champ, and fight it the best I can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus was a son of God, not &#39;the&#39;, &#39;the good news&#39; is that Jesus was a man who became divine, which means it is possible for all mankind.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, God had many sons. Only one was unique though, Himself as a being we could look upon. Jesus was the physical embodiment of that son. </p>

<p>Your &quot;good news&quot; is wrong. Man cannot become Divine of our own volition, though many have tried, all have failed. That serpentine teaching has been wrong for thousands of years, and still is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The original Coptic in the oldest biblical texts (the Nag Hammadi library) clearly shows that Jesus was &#39;A&#39; son of God, it has later been corrupted in the Greek translations by the Romans to make people believe it said &quot;the only&quot; son of God, which is why they attempted to burn all the original Coptic texts which proved their fraud.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Your &quot;good news&quot; is wrong. Man cannot become Divine of our own volition, though many have tried, all have failed</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>So you don&#39;t believe in Jesus?</p>

<p>I ask you again: what do you believe is &#39;the good news&#39;? Gospel means &#39;good news&#39;, after all, that man can become divine certainly is good news. What do you believe is the good news, as you don&#39;t believe the teaching of Jesus that man can achieve divinity?</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Gnostic &quot;Jesus&quot; is a forgery.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The Gnostics actually knew Jesus personally, the Catholic church was made by Roman emperors who were pagans who lived centuries after Jesus was dead and knew nothing of his teachings, nor did they care. The first thing the Roman Catholic church did was hunt down, kill and burn the Gnostics and their holy texts who actually knew and wrote down what Jesus preached, as they actually lived in his time and learned directly from him.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to see the sources on your last statement there because <strong>ALL BIBLICAL SCHOLARS REGARDLESS OF THEIR RELIGIOUS STATUS COMPLETELY DISAGREE</strong> with your ridiculous claim. You&#39;re mistaking Dan Brown for a non-fiction writer. The link I added is a PhD speaking on the subject. The whole point of Nicea was to cannonize what was known teachings of the apostles into the new testament scripture and separate it from Gnostic baloney.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Innately. It&#39;s not that he was just the &quot;Son of God&quot;, He <em>was God</em> (&quot;is God&quot; would be a better statement) born to a human. The spirit of the infinite in a finite body. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>41 Every year Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem for the Festival of the Passover. 42 When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival, according to the custom. 43 After the festival was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. 44 Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. 45 When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. 46 After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. 47 Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. 48 When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.” 49 “Why were you searching for me?” he asked. “Didn’t you know I had to be in my Father’s house? 50 But they did not understand what he was saying to them. 51 Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart 52 And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are all God&#39;s children, and can &quot;hear&quot; His voice, but we are born of earthly seed. Jesus physical body was earthly, so he indeed had to do human things like learn to read, walk etc, His spirit however, being Divine, could <em>feel</em> the spirit world in a much greater capacity than you or I.</p>

<p>My 2¢ anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember that passage, so I guess we can say for sure at 12 he knew. But try to imagine the sense of power that must feel to someone if they had to come to know it instead of being born knowing it. Nonetheless, if you knew you were God/son of God would death even be a matter to you? Was Jesus just Gods spokesman laying down the rules to live by? His most important message for commandments is pretty much similar to the golden rule found all around the world, even before Christ, which is to treat others as you want to be treated. Mark 12:29 he basically says, love God, and love your neighbor. If we can love our Creator and respect our brother and fellow man we should be good. Lol. Only thing is a lot wanf their Creator to be the correct one. People are so afraid to be wrong because it would possibly condemn them to hell, so they judge those who believe differently, even kill those who believe differently. If you follow that golden rule your heart is usually guided with love. Cause people can love eachother forever, if it&#39;s cultivated. But if you treat eachother with hate, it will always lead to conflict. And either reexamination or death in hate and bitterness, hopefully not transfered by seed. If we can cultivate in our hearts the feeling of love, that&#39;s the kingdom of God to me. I won&#39;t fight for government or  religion but I&#39;ll fight for love. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yes, the social religion aspect again.</p>

<p>Did you miss the parable of the prodigal son?</p>

<p>Or 80% of his other teachings?</p>

<p>You want to pick 2 things of the many he taught and say that&#39;s all that counts.</p>

<p>&quot;I am the way the truth and the life. <strong>No man cometh to the father but by me.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am the vine; you are the branches whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is which bears much fruit. <strong>For apart from me you can do nothing.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Whoever heats my word <strong>and believes Him who sent me has eternal life.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>You speak like a serpent. Twisting words out of context to suit. </p>

<p>Of course it will lead to conflict. Pray and love your enemies sure, but don&#39;t bend to them. This is spiritual warfare. One path cannot reconcile to the other. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t cultivate anything. Believe me I tried. For years and years and years. That doesn&#39;t mean I didn&#39;t feel love, but this is <em>entirely different</em>. The garden of pure love and joy God put in my heart is <em>tears of joy inducing</em>. I have never ever felt this great. And it has given me a whole new world view. I&#39;m better at <em>everything I do</em>, most importantly with my family, but in every aspect of my life. Not because of me being better, but because of Him in me! It&#39;s wonderful.</p>

<p>The very notion of going back to how I was before this makes me think of puking. And I was still a good guy. Wasn&#39;t into drugs or anything. Wife and kids still loved me and I them. Everything is just better now. Beyond better even. Not to say that bad things don&#39;t still happen, but how I react to them has changed.</p>

It&#39;s crazy how you think you have all the answers and a direct link with Jesus or God and nobody else has even come close to knowing it. That&#39;s naive and very, very ignorant. You&#39;re letting religion separate you from everyone else. </p>

<p>And yes I take one thing that Jesus said because in Mark 12:29 he was asked by a nobody like you or me, what the two most important  commandments were, and although he never wrote anything down, he says those two things. And for that man to follow those two things if he wants to go to heaven.</p>

<p>Seems like you&#39;re just defending yourself with a Bible and feelings though. What makes you think the Bible is free of corruption in itself? And if you can hear God, why did you ever or do you ever need the Bible. Does the person who&#39;s born blind, deaf, and dumb get a one way ticket to hell because they never could read the Bible and follow it? Your white Jesus and Bible is a product of control and passiveness, while the government who uses it as such, practices the exact opposite when dealing with other people than themselves. </p>

<p>Calling other people things, judging, acting like you&#39;re holier than someone else..  That&#39;s fear. You still have a long ways to go just as anyone else. Born into systems of control, that you can&#39;t even identify yet. Good luck.</p>

<p>Also, did you happen to read through the comments I was responding to? The way in which the only person I directed the &quot;speaking like a serpent&quot; to directly attempted to deceive me via convoluted questions no man has the answer to?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No man has the answers about God yet here you are speaking like your form of knowing of God is more superior.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If being called serpentine offends a Gnostic, they have no idea what Gnosticism is. It&#39;s literally serpent worship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well said that I speak like a serpent lol. But I&#39;m not Gnostic. And if you think I am, than you are the same, because your wisdom of occult knowledge is still with you. And I do not worship serpents. Ew. Do you? </p>

<p>I feel like I&#39;ve been in your position before though. And I guess I was like you too. I stuck to my beliefs and used the Bible for confirmation bias. Yea.. It gets tiring doesn&#39;t it? I commend you for working and practicing what you feel is right though. Keep searching for truth in all forms. If Jesus is your vehicle then good. But the Jesus in the Bible isn&#39;t the same one worshipped today by 90% of people who call themselves Christians. They only use his image to make money and make people passive and easy to control. That&#39;s an antichrist way of worship. Homeless numbers keep going up, it&#39;s insane. Jesus cared for them... What are the churches doing for them? Where I live, they drive luxury cars and wear suits and ties to church while passing the bum sleeping under the palm tree on a median on the way to church, those are the preachers. The way, the truth, and the life are a set of ideas that when practiced lead to cultivation of love and bond between man. People can pick apart the Bible and use it as confirmation bias toward many different ways of belief and thinking. And claim that their way is the right way and only way, can&#39;t they? You gotta feeeeeel. It&#39;s simple, ask yourself if the way you&#39;re treating someone is really the way that you&#39;d want to be treated. Be real about it your true nature will surface. Finding ourselves through a christ consciousness is something that was innately built into us without need of institutionalized religion. Your actions are what judge you in the end. Not because you know a name or have a password. </p>

<p>Enough said. Why apologize if you&#39;re right? You need to define your definition of Gnostic because I don&#39;t think we&#39;re talking about the same thing. And how can you have a normal conversation with anyone if you think everything they&#39;re saying is trying to decieve you? That&#39;s paranoia. You&#39;re labeling everyone negatively because they don&#39;t believe the same as you. You can&#39;t change anyone&#39;s ideas in that shell. Be real man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The roundabout questions aimed at my thoughts on Jesus childhood divinity seemed very... craftily put to entrap me in some kind of theological snare about the divinity of mankind. I apologise if that is not the case!</p>

<p>Gnostic books, like the &quot;Secret Book of John&quot; spell out the worldview at complete odds with Christianity:</p>

<p>God is an unknowable spirit, or &quot;force&quot; to take the Lucasfilm spin.</p>

<p>It created many aeons under it.</p>

<p>One of these aeons &quot;Sophia&quot; or wisdom,  decided to create without her &quot;consort&quot; another being.</p>

<p>This being was imperfect, or ignorant.</p>

<p>This being is &quot;Yahweh.&quot; Known as Yaldaboath in the text.</p>

<p>This &quot;ignorant creator god&quot; created humanity and was tricked by the unknowable spirit to blow some of his essence into mankind&quot;</p>

<p>Mankind is now a slave in the material world, the garden of Eden</p>

<p>The serpent in the garden is &quot;christ&quot;</p>

<p>The serpent, by the giving of the apple, taught mankind a piece of his divinity</p>

<p>&quot;Jesus&quot; is this serpent</p>

<p>That&#39;s how a Gnostic traditionally sees it, though there are some variations.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect to change a Gnostic, of this type, believers mind. Only present the opposing theology to others reading it. Regardless of texts or history or anything else, that is a strong and hard delusion to break, as pretty much any argument is met with &quot;but the demiurge&quot; I know this because I was this. Scriptures about Jesus are cherry picked to uphold this belief, and everything else He taught is &quot;corrupted&quot; to them. </p>

<p>I apologise again for my &quot;shell,&quot; you caught me right in the middle of a heated debate with a person who&#39;s been following me around for weeks on this subject, and to be honest one of my replies this morning was not meant for you at all. I use mobile and usernames blend a bit.</p>

If you think those are too young to be important than your Roman pagan censored bible certainly is, as it is much younger, many centuries after the death of the apostles.</p>

<p>Listen to Jesus, he told you himself what would happen and what has happened:</p>

<p>Those documents are old sure, but date well into the 100s, while the original texts from the apostles date to 50-70. Claiming them as the &quot;original Bible&quot; is, again, ridiculous. </p>

<p>Yes Jesus condemned the Pharisees. See, the prophet Elijah told the Jews that the Word of God was for <strong>ALL</strong> men. Just as Jesus did. But they held onto their racial superiority complex, and crucified Him. After which God withdrew his protection, passed the torch to the Christians, and allowed their temple to be destroyed. Catholics carried the torch for a while. But in time, and unfortunately not much time,  they too were corrupted. And we get the Protestant movement. Who still carries that torch for the most part, though it too has been infiltrated and partially corrupted by both Jesuits and Freemasons. Speaking of Freemasons, did you know their highest degrees are basically Gnostic? Interesting thought huh? The people who control this world and do most all of the horrible shit going on even unto today, that we sit here and uncover and read about, the sexual predators, child molesters, murderous deceivers, all use your religion to justify their actions. Neat.</p>

<p>The &quot;good news&quot; is that while all men have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God, you can be washed clean through the blood of the lamb. Jesus&#39; sacrifice wasn&#39;t for naught, as your beliefs claim.</p>

If Jesus was born God it is impossible for any human to &#39;follow his way&#39;. Miracles are possible for all people - that&#39;s the good news - faith can move mountains, YOU can move mountains, the good news is not that only Jesus can perform miracles and only Jesus&#39; faith could move mountains and only Jesus was a son of God - that&#39;s bad news, and certainly not the teachings of Jesus - could you imagine him walking around saying that?

    <div class="md"><p>How on Earth did you interpret Jesus saying the kingdom of God is WITHIN man, clearly saying human beings have a deep connection with the divine, as meaning that if people &#39;believe in Jesus&#39; (believe what about Jesus? Believe that he was born man, bacame God, and so can you! THAT is what you need to believe to be saved!) they will be &#39;saved&#39; (from what? THE HUMAN CONDITION AND IGNORANCE!). Your bizarre and pointless interpretation of Christ doesn&#39;t make any sense! If he were born God, omnipotent and omniscient, his miracles, deep understanding and loving behaviour is not at all impressive, if anything they are much less that what one would expect of an omnipotent God.</p>

<p>If Jesus was omnipotent, why did he not eradicate all disease etc? Jesus was a man that was enlightened and was united with his source, which is God. God is the source and creator and maintainor of all things, including all people. The good news is that the kingdom of God is within man, and that you can unify with God, your source, as well, and do miracles and move mountains, just like Jesus, all it takes is faith. The good news is not that you may have a chance to not be tortured for all eternity if you, a feeble and ignorant human being, live up to the standards of how God himself, the omnipotent and omniscient, acts. Read the original bible my friend, all of this is written.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have read the original Bible which was burned and suppressed by the people who wrote your Bible centuries after the death of the apostles, that is where I get my Christianity. Buddha was also  perfect per your definition. He resisted temptation. Jesus is just another enlightened human among many, a son of God, not THE son of God, and they were all born human beings. And no, I do not claim to be enlightened or anywhere near Jesus ofc, but I aspire to walk in his footsteps, and have faith that the Holy Spirit one day by the grace of God will lead me there, as it lead Jesus, and so should any true Christian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh?  I&#39;m using your example,  you said Buddha is perfect and Jesus is not.  Can I ask why? Why is Buddha, who was a man also, perfect, but Jesus,  man also,  not perfect? I never brought up Buddha.  Buddha did not resist temptation for part of his journey either?</p>

<p>Jesus supposedly did not sin.  Give me proof that he did.  And don&#39;t use the dead sea scrolls,  those were translated by people on Rockefeller&#39;s payroll.       </p>

<p>Edit.  If Jesus is God,  saying man can become Jesus means man can become God. That is pretty close to what luciferians believe, and freemasons,  and ancient mystery religions.

    <div class="md"><p>I never said Buddha or Jesus was &quot;perfect&quot;, whatever that means, I just used your definition of perfect: &quot;resist temptation&quot; on another example to show that your definition of Godhood (perfect, resist temptation) is wrong.

<p>The dead sea Scrolls aren&#39;t good enough as a source? :P</p>

<p>Satanists don&#39;t want to become Jesus &#39;-&#39; that&#39;s Christians (True Christians). Uniting with God means becoming loving and compassionate, like Jesus or Buddha, not Satan. In fact, the entire story about Satan was that he was united with God but left the union and seperated from God -_- that&#39;s literally the opposite of what I am describing</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You brought up Buddha first.  I never claimed Buddha was or was not perfect. 
You also said you believe Jesus was just an enlightened man.  Then sure,  man can become like Jesus. </p>

<p>Provide proof that Jesus sinned? Can you? </p>

<p>I explained why dead sea scrolls is not legitimate.  They are housed at the Rockefeller Museum ffs.  Read Dead Sea Scroll Deception by Baigent.  Read anything about Luciferianism.  There are a ton of resources about it.  They believe man can become God.  That Lucifer,  not Jesus, is the &quot;light&quot; or the &quot;illumined one&quot; and the savior of man.  That man evolved with the help of Lucifer through intellect or knowledge. I&#39;m not just pulling this shit out of my ass.  Listen to Bill Cooper&#39;s Mystery Babylon. Read anything about Egyptian religion and ancient secret  societies.  Read anything about Freemasonry.</p>

<p>Here are some quotes from books you should read: </p>

<p>&quot;Man is a god in the making.  And as in the mystic myths of Egypt,  on the potter&#39;s wheel,  he is being molded. When his light shines out to lift and preserve all things, he receives the triple crown of godhood. &quot;(<em>The Lost Keys of Freemasonry</em>) </p>

<p>&quot;In the closing ceremonies of the ritual for the Royal Arch degree,  the candidate is asked, &quot;Brother, Inspector, what are you?&quot; and he replies, &quot;I AM THAT I AM&quot;. (<em>The Question of Freemasonry</em>)</p>

<p>&quot;The true and pure philosphic religion is the belief in Lucifer, the equal of Adonay (the God of Christians) ; but Lucifer,  God of Light and God of Good,  is struggling for humanity against Adonay,  the God of Darkness and Evil. &quot; (<em>Morals and Dogma</em> Albert Pike)   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I mean with enlightened is unification with God and the annihilation of the Ego. When &#39;Jesus&#39; spoke after he was enlightened around age 30 it was God speaking, his body and mind merely puppets for the Holy Spirit. I do believe many other people in history have been unified with God, for example Enoch, who the Bible says left the world to walk with God. I do not believe Jesus was born enlightened or as God himself, the eternal, immortal, perfect, omnipotent, omnipresent creator of the universe, no, and if he were omnipotent you must admit he did very little good with his vast power, which does equate to evil. If he were born human however, he might be the greatest ever. How is that satanism? </p>

<p>When Jesus said: &quot;before Abraham was, I am&quot;, he was not referring to his body or mind/memory-complex, but his divine essence, it was the Holy Spirit speaking. I do believe the good news and the original message of Jesus was that this divine essence exist deep within all of us, and we need to find it. If the free masons believe the same I won&#39;t just abandon my beliefs, but I am not convinced those quotes are completely true or in context - they do take an oath of silence after all, so why wouldn&#39;t they lie publically?</p>

<p>The dead sea scrolls information is interesting, I will refer to the Nag Hammadi library in that case, link already provided.</p>

<p>Can you prove Buddha sinned? Why ask me that silly question</p>

<p>Edit: I do think it is funny you brought up deifying men, isn&#39;t that exactly what you are doing with the body/mind-complex of Jesus when you claim he was born as the omnipotent creator of the universe, and only he can ever aspire to unification with God, because he IS God and not man at all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree but there are people that believe Lucifer is the real Jesus, dating all the way back to the mystery religions and Osiris/Isis. That the God from Genesis was not benevolent because he kept us in the dark and withheld knowledge.  It was Lucifer who gave us knowledge and therefore allowed us to evolve.  Lucifer is the light bringer. </p>

<p>Imo it is a lie though, making us believe we can actually become God through acquisition of power and intellect.  That we can evolve to our highest supreme being which would be God as man (again, not meant for us but for one individual -the Antichrist?) But man is inherently flawed with prejudices, capacity for evil, etc. So man as god would be frightening.  </p>

<p>Unless that man was like Jesus,  the living embodiment of love and forgiveness.  Something so simple but so incredibly difficult.  </p>
