        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">63</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-01-31 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/axolotl_peyotl.html">axolotl_peyotl</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Perhaps emboldened by the admin&#39;s apparent apathy to behavior that <em>should</em> be considered as going against the core ethos of this website, the stalker/hate sub known as TMOR has significantly increased their attacks against me and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as a whole.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7u1py5/how_come_washingtons_in_a_rush_to_rig_russias/dtgtyld/">this submission statement of mine</a> from yesterday has managed to achieve an impressive -101 in comment karma. </p>

<p><em>Curiously, the thread never got very popular (it hit 0 fairly quickly) and only a dozen or so other users actually commented at all.</em></p>

<p>For those familiar with reddit, that would <em>not</em> account for over -100 comment karma, with well over +100 comment karma for the top comment (which was a TMOR-esque ad hominem attack against me). To reiterate, a few comments that disagree with a post does <em>not</em> equate with <em>over 100 downvotes on a mere comment in the thread</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7u309p/top_mod_goes_full_comrade_and_posts_literal/">Here&#39;s the explanation</a>. Notice how this TMOR thread has <em>significantly</em> more activity than my thread: it&#39;s at 300 points with 55 comments.</p>

<p>IMO this is <em>irrefutable</em> evidence of a TMOR induced/inspired brigade that created a -100/+100 discrepancy in the voting of my post.</p>

<p>In a similar example from yesterday, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7u1n3e/reaction_to_recent_iranian_protests_reveals/dtgudou/?sh=bf98fd55&amp;amp;st=JD290RBE">another comment of mine</a> was downvoted dozens of times <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7u5737/top_mod_at_it_again_complains_about_his_blatant/">and it just so happens it was linked</a> by TMOR as well.</p>

<p>And hey look, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7u410z/top_mod_posts_political_thread_weeks_after_saying/">they linked to <em>another</em> one of my posts yesterday.</a></p>

<p>And last night, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7u86iz/rtopmindsofreddit_tmor_is_actively_and/">when I submitted a similar post</a>, the brigading <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7u8gwp/top_mod_is_whining_and_crying_about_imaginary/">continued</a>.</p>

<p>As of late, TMOR has decided to honor me with multiple links to my posts and comments on their front page on a regular basis (there have been at least a half a dozen in the last 24 hours). <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7t536z/stand_up_to_the_mod_abuse_axolotl_peyotl_sets_a/">Their current sticky</a> is even some sort of perverse call to arms against me.</p>

<p>Scanning through these threads is a fascinating experience...they don&#39;t even know me, and yet it&#39;s palpable how they delight in their obsessive disdain, and all over some person on the internet!</p>

<p>This thread should serve as a good reference point for those who accuse us of spouting baseless accusations against what very clearly is despicable behavior being regularly carried out by hate-oriented subs like TMOR.</p>

<p>Please take the opportunity to provide your stories/evidence of this egregious and manipulative behavior.</p>

<p>By the way, are you going to keep the 10 minute restriction on comments from folks without enough karma? You should lift that. </p>

<p>Also, in fairness, as excited as I am about being granted entrance to your swill pond, ought you not grant the same privilege to anyone else that is mentioned or x-posted in your sub? Or do you admittedly believe that people do not have an inherent right to defend themselves?</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAHAHA.</p>

<p>You&#39;re kidding, right?</p>

<p>No, wait... you&#39;re the dude who just sent me that loony lawsuit message. Dude, I was a print reporter for nearly 25 years; I&#39;ve been sued by actual people with actual money, given depositions that weren&#39;t imaginary for laws that actually exist.</p>

<p>When I jointed TMOR about a year ago, I&#39;d say about 90% were just reasonably sane people who, frustrated by the amount of sheer unreasonable stupidity on reddit, decided to start mocking it where it appeared most often, which was conspiracy and the_donald. </p>

<p>Since then, the group seems to have morphed into half people mocking the insanely stupid, and half people banned by flytape or axotl from your forum.</p>

<p>So the answer is most definitely the former. It&#39;s of no consequence in the way that old sitcom repeats are of no consequence: it&#39;s entertaining and stupid, but if it disappeared tomorrow no one would really give a shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not pretending anything.  I think even if Russian bots are out in full force with memes and hashtags BFD.  They have a small part in the online manipulation game yet we don&#39;t mention any of the other players.

<p>Also yes I grew up in small town America but I don&#39;t typically divulge personal information on the internet.

<p>As for your huge concern for people finding out about any part of your patriotic american life, I could have easily predicted that answer. Vegas wouldn&#39;t have even given me odds for a bet on such a common, weak excuse. </p>

<p>Let me tell you about mine, though. I grew up in New England and i couldn&#39;t be prouder of it. Cape Cod has the most beautiful lighthouses, set on landscapes that couldnt be more perfect for a postcard. I also didn&#39;t live far from a beach right outside Boston: the water of which had disgusting amounts of kelp and the sand was horrendous. But the view of Boston from the beach could not be beat. I was last there almost a decade ago; I was forced to move as a kid in a military family. I now live in a shitty cookie-cutter military town, the cost of my dad&#39;s sacrifice to this country and everything it stands for.</p>

<p>Tell me, what makes you think that I&#39;m anything but a warm-blooded american? I&#39;m only here talking about my historically American beliefs. Why don&#39;t you give me a call so we can chat about it?</p>

Instead I will just describe your generic small town America as mine is just one of many.  One or two stoplights or possibly not any if the town is not located an highway intersection. Even the smallest towns usually have some sort of grocery store and/or place to eat.  Sometimes they are combined into one place like you can buy sandwiches or often hot foods as well.  In bigger &quot;small towns&quot; you&#39;ll have a dedicated grocery store, a general store, few gas stations, hardware store, Autoparts/heavy machinery parts store,few restaurants/bars, insurance, and some other random businesses.  Usually a school and a high school.  Sometimes smaller towns will combine towns into one school. I don&#39;t know what else you&#39;d want me to go on about.  Small towns are called small towns for a reason.</p>

<p>How did you learn about the twin towers on 9/11? </p>

<p>I had to hear it from my family after school closed early. My aunt in the NYPD spent the day covered in the dust of the world trade centers and all it&#39;s contents, including the undetectable fragments of the people who were still inside. I spent the rest of the day watching the news in disbelief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you really go around being some bot detective? You act like this is a regular conversation to have.  But I will humor you anyway just because I&#39;m curious what your deal is.  I actually first heard if from a girl I crushed on at school.  I didn&#39;t know what was going on yet.  She was kind of a goof but passing her in the hallway she said something along the lines of &quot;an airplane just crashed into a building&quot;  Then once back in the classroom the teacher briefly tried to explain what was happening.  We had cable access in the school so we pretty muched watched it unfold on TV all day.  I did have one teacher/hour who wouldn&#39;t let us watch saying that watching would just be letting the terrorists win.  Of course we resented him for it because we got to watch TV in all the other hours/classes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, I do. I consider it like being a reddit Voight-Kampff test administrator. I think you pass, sorry for the unpleasant experience.</p>

<p>I like to look for a shred of humanity in people who typically seem not to have an ounce. It usually says more about someone than their position on some petty political decision. When I actually do find someone claiming to be American yet, for instance, makes grammar mistakes no native born American ever would and only posts in GMT daylight hours, upon this kind of questioning they tend to respond in a similar way <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Umc9ezAyJv0">depicted in the movie</a>. They usually freak out in rage, eventually deleting their comments. Then I add another tally on my laptop and roam the digital underworld for more trolls.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a shame that it&#39;s considered normal for American compatriots to have such incredibly heated arguments over things that should be considered simple fact. It&#39;s too easy to forget that we&#39;re still all under the grand old flag.</p>

<p>The comments I had bookmarked are either deleted by now or too subtle to make any obvious point. So I told you to google it, because that&#39;s what I&#39;d have to do anyways.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been through this dipshit charade too many times before, just tell me why the source I gave you is fake or whatever so I can call you an idiot and move on.</p>

<p>Why exactly are you relying on me of all people to prove to you something that is already incredibly well studied? The fact is that if you had a critical, neutral bone in your body you&#39;d already have noticed enough odd posts to at least make you unsure.</p>

<p>The &quot;evidence&quot; that would somehow satisfy you is inherently hard to find. The best a user can do is out a shill and watch him delete his comments, but that&#39;s not so great for evidence is it? But you&#39;re so dumb that you think that somehow proves it doesn&#39;t exist? Amazing how little you give a shit about this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>We do not tolerate the harassment of people on our site, nor do we tolerate communities dedicated to fostering harassing behavior</strong>.</p>

<p>Harassment on Reddit is defined as systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person conclude that Reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.</p>

<p>Being annoying, vote brigading, or participating in a heated argument is not harassment, but following an individual or group of users, online or off, to the point where they no longer feel that it&#39;s safe to post online or are in fear of their real life safety is.</p>

<p>Best Practices for Reporting Harassment</p>

<p>In order for us to process your report quickly and efficiently, please include the information below: </p>

<p>Direct links to the instances of harassment you are reporting. We cannot accept screenshots of reports. Screenshots can be manipulated and more importantly, we need to review the complete context of the issue in order to make a determination, context is often lost in a screenshot. 
Account/s involved in the harassment.
A brief description of the issue.
We need to see examples of how the harassment manifests on Reddit. A first party report is always preferable due to the nature of the investigation that may take place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You consistently champion the Trump agenda and dive into political, partisan fights, in spite of your promise to step away from such fights. People disdain you because you refuse to moderate neutrally, and will post as a mod in your own threads complaining about brigades.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I see. No, I&#39;m what I&#39;m saying is not that his views should be silenced, but that he is blending his position as a moderator with his position as a user. He is using his moderator status to leave comment accusations of shilling and brigading in his post, and just in general had promised not to join in the political wars anymore. </p>

<p>Basically, he can&#39;t stop being a high-ranking mod of this subreddit (short of stepping down), and even were he not posting as a mod in his threads there is still an issue, which he acknowledged in his big comeback post a little bit ago. </p>

<p>So, I see my mistake, I read the post before he went back on his statement and acknowledged that he would not be abstaining. So, this resurgence of political partisanship, while regretful, was apparently announced.</p>

<p>From the way TMoR tells the tale, this sub is of little consequence. Test it out by making a post about paid shills attacking this sub on a daily basis. I guarantee you that it will be spammed with comments saying that this sub is so irrelevant that no one would waste their time or money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the time I am writing this, there are 390 TMOR on the recently viewed an 3626 for conspiracy, nearly 10x as much. Maybe TMOR can dogpile on an already unpopular post, but for the most part they are much smaller than the user base for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe, just MAYBE <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> many users of this subreddit are tired of the inconsitent moderation from the modteam, particularly when it comes to pro and anti POTUS posts. And maybe many of the users here are tired of your whining and political posts. I dunno its just a (conspiracy) theory. </p>

<p>Why not trigger the TMOR and resign from modding?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit only considers it harrasing when you ping users with insults or actually encourage sending people insults (on- or offplatform).<br/>
Same with briading, a sub has to actively encourage people to vote or comment in theads to be considered briading.  </p>

<p>If the admins feel like the rules aren&#39;t  enforced, most of the times they will contact the mods and tell them to cut their shit. But linking and moking people is allowed, otherwise most meta-subs and a whole bunch of other subs could be banned too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit banned fph for doxxing and harasment.
Imhur banned fph first, fph then started harrasing and doxxing imgur employees. Doxxing is a hard limit for reddit admins since the boston bomber debacle and fph got banned. All doxxing stuff gets removed by admins quickly if the mods don&#39;t step in. That&#39;s why most subs are quite strict with censoring names on facebook screenshots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whichever position uses real people. If you’re in a position such as an admin, you will eventually develop a certain hate towards certain people regardless if they are saying truth or not. People eventually wear other people down and to prevent this people should continuously be rotated. If they are indeed employees, then they should never bitch about how much content they have to sift through and delete/censor. If you can’t take the heat, then get out of the kitchen more or less. I didn’t ask for anybody to sift through the comments of every thread just so I can have everything nice and tidy for my viewing pleasure. Sure it’s nice to see some of the asshole comments removed once in a while but it’s getting to a point where people just trying to express their own voice are getting shut down and I draw a line at that. That’s fucking bullshit. People have a right to be heard even if their name is something like Xxmountaindewyourmom420xX</p>

<p>Im not saying there is or isnt brigading, I am saying there is also the possibility that some posts and comments do not have the substance to stand on their own. </p>

<p>Lets look at the linked article and submission comment in a questioning manner, much as we normally would in the conspiracy sub.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7u1py5/how_come_washingtons_in_a_rush_to_rig_russias/dtgtyld/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7u1py5/how_come_washingtons_in_a_rush_to_rig_russias/dtgtyld/</a></p>

<p>The New Eastern Journal is literally a product of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Which has been completely co-opted by the Russian government.</p>

<p>&quot;Putin tightens control over Russian Academy of Sciences&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/06/putin-tightens-control-over-russian-academy-sciences">http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/06/putin-tightens-control-over-russian-academy-sciences</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the downvotes were from people who arent wild about literal government propaganda being shared as truth in a conspiracy sub?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The reform proposal has been strongly criticized by the 1st July Club, an informal union of regular and corresponding RAS members named after the day when they first protested in 2013. </p>

<p>In a letter to President Putin and members of both chambers of the parliament earlier this month, the group calls the three-candidate limit &quot;absolutely unacceptable.&quot; <strong>It notes that elections can go forward even if only one candidate has been approved, effectively making the process a &quot;fiction&quot; and replacing it with a presidential appointment.</strong></p>

<p>RAS&#39;s &quot;scientific level and reputation have been irreparably damaged - Gelfand says. “It has no muscle for resistance.&quot; &quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lets take a look at some of that authors other work, while bearing in mind his work at New Eastern Journal:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It won’t be too much of an exaggeration to state that the latest presidential election in the United States exposed the criminal nature of America’s ruling elites more than any other event in the US history. Western journalist would love to claim that such statements are nothing but some kind of response to the blatant propaganda campaign they’ve unleashed against a number of US competitors on the international stage, including Russia and China,</p>

Assassinations are dangerous as that means you get the same back from the highly dangerous opposition, but the stakes are rising all the time, so unless they come to a deal this will get very nasty.  The deal the Zionists want is that the UN leaves Israel alone, doesn&#39;t criticize, allows them to get away with whatever they want.  The Globalists don&#39;t want this, as then the Muslim world will not respect the UN&#39;s authority, so the Globalists want to be fairly tough with Israel so as the Islamic world will be happy with the new Globalist UN world government.</p>

<p>Btw the democrats wanna use identity politics to gerrymander districts, they dont actually give one flying fuck about black youth - they&#39;d have legalised weed under obama if they did, as it stands the democrats are COMPLETELY  fine with black youth bumping into out of control officers/judges. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of the people screaming Racists! the loudest are ironically racist themselves.  If someone thinks it&#39;s impossible to be racist against a white person, that ironically makes them a racist. The definition of racism is</p>

<blockquote>
<p>prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one&#39;s own race is superior.</p>

<p>the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can one say &quot;it&#39;s impossible to be racist against a white person&quot; if they don&#39;t assume whites to be the superior race in the first place?  I just find it ironic.  They also see racism in everything even where it isn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Multiple points I&#39;ve got here. Please read with an open mind that this is how I and I&#39;m sure many other people see this sub and you. This is not an attack on the sub or even you.</p>

<hr/>

<p>You&#39;ve made many enemies by banning people for no reason other than you having the power to do so. People get banned after &quot;many warnings&quot; yet the person says they&#39;ve never received one before. Silently removing posts isn&#39;t a warning, yet you treat it as one.</p>

<hr/>

<p>When topics don&#39;t go the way you think they should, they get put in contest mode after being up half a day. This one was put in after an hour, I can only guess it&#39;s cause it wasn&#39;t going how you wanted it to. For a sub that has the statement of </p>

<p>&quot;This is a forum for free thinking and discussing issues which have captured the public’s imagination. Please respect other views and opinions, and keep an open mind. Our goals are a fairer, more transparent world and a better future for everyone.&quot;</p>

<p>contest mode sure does go against that. You&#39;ve seen it time and time again. Once put in contest mode after being up for multiple hours, the discussion turns to that and a conspiracy forms against the mods. It hijacks any discussion.</p>

<p>And &quot;respect other views and opinions&quot; is, well, that never happens here. It is literally one side vs another now. Both sides are to blame as they feed off each other and blindly support those who say what they want to believe. </p>

<p>You obviously get attack for your views and opinions, but you also take it out on others for their views and opinions and many times it leads to you banning the person. Making topics like this, actually multiple topics like this, only encourages that behavior from those who don&#39;t agree with you. You are admitting they are getting to you and each time they see a post like this from you, it feeds them to do more. You got downvoted. So what? Really who cares? And being head mod, you should be the one with the thick skin. I know it happens daily, but that&#39;s part of what being a mod does in any sub that has thousands of users.</p>

<p>Of course this submission got targeted. You called them out. Why would anyone expect them to not respond the way we know they do for this submission especially? This topic should have been put in contest mode on submission. </p>

<hr/>

<p>You&#39;ve let many users stay on for things that others would be banned for after one or two warnings and it appears that is cause they agree with you on various conspiracies so they&#39;re allowed to stay on. </p>

<p>Almost daily you can go onto the mod log page and see multiple posts by flytape being removed after calling people fuck heads, cunts and just blatant abuse cause he knows he wont be banned by you. Coyote has been warned numerous times and a few bans of multiple days. Yet he is always welcomed back. I must admit though, he seems to have got a little better lately, at least I&#39;m not noticing him as much anymore. This is probably why there is the feeling by many that he is your or some other mods alt. Cause he is allowed to stay while doing the same things other get banned for. If I wanted to spend the time I could name off many more users that appear the rules don&#39;t apply to them. All cause they agree with you on things. </p>

<hr/>

<p>A shill is not anyone who doesn&#39;t agree with you or believes a conspiracy that you don&#39;t, yet that is the definition this sub runs on.</p>

<p>Blame is on all sides. TMOR, TD, legit people here for conspiracies, and mods. With 575,000 accounts subscribed here (prob a hundred thousand banned lol) there WILL be opposing views and it honestly seems like most people here can not fathom that and expect everyone to be on the same page as them. That&#39;s what happens with any sub once so many people subscribe. Either it turns into bitchfest or a giant circlejerk about everything. This is why the fault can&#39;t be placed on one group.  </p>

<p>Would you rather have people with opposing views or an echo chamber like politics? If you&#39;d rather have opposing views then you need to accept that and really that seems like something this sub can not handle. </p>

<hr/>

<p>and that was way too much </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i have pretty solid reasons for not trusting putin, yes. i guess a good starting point would be how he brutally quells all dissent and blatantly subverted Russia&#39;s attempt at democracy by ending term limits. Both of those are major pillars of American democracy, and indicate that he governs from the top down rather than the bottom up. Russia listens to Putin, Putin does not listen to Russia. Could not be farther from American, so the real question here is why do <em>you</em> trust him so much? </p>

<p>What has he done for the USA that gives him such a great standing over even our own damn allies, besides successfully make our president jealous of his power? Are you even american in the first place, so that you would even know what makes the US distinct from the ex-USSR?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why should Russia be a democracy? And why do you care. The reason I ask is that I prove in my subs there&#39;s a pretty fairly huge campaign of Jewish Russophobia in American and the World. I&#39;m just trying to wake as many gentiles as I can about it. The truth of the matter is that Americans didn&#39;t truly have a problem with Russia until Russia came down to help Assad in Sept. 2015. I can show you all the American Jewish Journalists that went apeshit. American didn&#39;t have a rabid Russophobia problem until the morning after Hilary Lost.</p>

<p>TL:DR RussiaGate is a Zionist Jewish tantrum because Russia is the check on Israel</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what are you talking about? we&#39;ve had a problem with the USSR for decades, and after it&#39;s fall Putin himself managed to destroy our attempts at true alliance. He leads the largest propaganda campaign on earth, and you&#39;re so caught up in it that you probably don&#39;t even believe it exists. Why don&#39;t you travel to crimea and see what happens after you say something critical of Putin.</p>

<p>Go try it, tell me how it goes. I can guarantee you wont have a very american expreience, and that lack of freedom is why reasonable americans want nothing to do with them. regardless of how much their voice is drowned out by Trump and his minority of loyal demogogues, that will never stop being the difference between putin&#39;s soviet-dreaming Russia and the freedom of the US of A</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an American, Crimea is none of your business and also none of mine. It is solidly in the Russian sphere. You&#39;re being told by <em>Media</em> that Crimea is your business. It&#39;s not. What is the logical conclusion to alienating Russia? The USSR has nothing to do with today&#39;s Russia. All the communists went to Israel. Russia should be a partner but the fact of the matter is that every single sanction on Russian was pushed by the Jewish Lobby, period. Russia hate is being pushed on you. I&#39;m not overly fond of Russia either, but I hate the people pushing Russia on us. </p>

<p>Go hold up a sign with Putin&#39;s head in crosshairs, just for fun. Tell me how you would guage the level of freedom you have there while you&#39;re sitting in a jail cell with two black eyes and no possibility for respite.</p>

<p>do you know what that type of treatment of people does to a society? in America it&#39;s called a chilling effect, and it stifles free speech among a community-- the core thing that America believes in. it&#39;s what all americans believe in above all else, and Putin has no regard for it whatsoever.</p>

<p>THAT is why I don&#39;t trust him-- there&#39;s nothing you can say that will change these facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the same way i feel about most religions: the extremists who take religion too literally are fucking crazy. nobody would put on a suicide vest if they saw books like the Quran or Bible figuratively as a work of fiction intended to instill certain cultural morals in people.</p>

<p>religion as I see it is meant to supplement life, not control it entirely. the majority of people on the planet seem to understand this, but as with everything it seems there always must be people who miss the point and take it far past the point that made it good in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>maybe you&#39;re right. but right now with Trump we&#39;re having a war in the middle of washington, DC. the fact is that 60% of the country did not vote for him and do not support much of what he&#39;s trying to do. i&#39;m not saying that because he should have lost or something, or because I&#39;m butthurt. I&#39;m saying it because he refuses to even acknowledge that those people exist. i gave him a solid chance to do so, but he refused and shit on people like me. many tens of millions of us get home every evening expecting to see a critical take on the day&#39;s political events-- but Trump entirely disregards what we see and believe as &quot;fake news&quot;. you know what, even if it is &quot;fake&quot; somehow, there&#39;s nothing American about disenfranchising people because you disagree with them. Even Obama catered a bit to people like Trump himself and those at Fox News, even though they often did nothing but spread blatant lies about the president. Now that Trump is in charge though, he&#39;s literally about to disassemble the justice department because he wants people to stop talking about something critical of him. He&#39;s a huge hypocrite and defines the idea of &quot;do as i say not as I do&quot;. That is what I mainly have a problem with, regardless of the complaints I have with his individual decisions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i saw someone make a distinction recently and i think it applies here. i have nothing but love for the russian people. my contempt is solely for our governments. The current conflict stemming from Putin&#39;s relationship with Trump, no matter how real or imagined it is, from my perspective has done nothing but brought division between my friends/family as well wrought fear and terror in the few Europeon friends I have. again, i&#39;m leaving out my political opinions-- this is just my take as to how it has personally affected me. I just don&#39;t see the benefit in putting our relationship with the Russian govt ahead of all of our historical allies who aren&#39;t quite as cozy with Putin as Trump seems to be.</p>

<p>I have had my comments deleted before. I&#39;m not even sure which rule they broke, because every time I message the mods to get clarification, they ignore my appeals. One of the mods has a giant chip on his shoulder and constantly stickies his own posts, puts threads in contest mode, and marks legitimate news as &quot;Unverified,&quot; but lets bullshit 4chan LARPS proliferate. It&#39;s really disappointing that they silence free speech, especially when they profess to be &quot;a forum for free thinking&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, the Trump folks who push their political agenda here usually seem to be trying to productively add to the discussion. Even when they&#39;re pushing for terrible things I hate, at least it seems like they&#39;re intending to do good. They&#39;re not the ones that go out of their way to try to disrupt the community with toxic behavior. </p>

<p>Why would r/the_donald downvote here? </p>

<p>They don’t because this sub has differing views and they don’t mind that outside of r/the_donald.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of people will dismiss this because they don&#39;t understand statistics, and they think that 100 people could just show up randomly, when the normal number would only be 4-5 upvotes or downvotes on comments at that point.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t understand that a variance of 20 times the normal expected value is, on its own, statistical proof of probably trillions to one against.</p>

<p>When you see weird vote totals on reddit, especially r/conspiracy which is the 2nd most manipulated sub besides r/politics, it is usually <em>not</em> a result of random chance. It is <em>usually</em> vote bots or admins themselves outright changing the votes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahem... I may in fact be banned for this post, but I will make it anyway since the moderators here seem beat down.</p>

<p>You banned me, a long time poster here, for calling someone a shill. Someone who was already breaking the rules. I guess they reported me but I didn&#39;t report them so I was banned permanently even though it says usually a warning will be given. I&#39;ve never posted here since until now. Now here we are, months later, mods are quitting, head mods are complaining about unfair behavior, harassment, and so on.</p>

<p>How about you stop banning your regular years old users for calling out the people you&#39;re complaining about? I mean, what the fuck? Honestly? You ban people and invite the shills and trolls in then complain that the community is a pile of shit being made fun of by all the shills and trolls elsewhere on Reddit who run freely.</p>

<p>How about you DM me, unban my main account, change rule 10 to allow us to insult each other, and we&#39;ll take care of it. I drive these fuckers wild and work for free but you ban me then I watch as more mods post about how much these trolls/shills are ruining the board.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re tired of being brigaded stop creating a board full of shills who laugh in your face. I can&#39;t even tell you the number of times I&#39;ve wanted to respond here, remembered I&#39;m banned, and walked way to watch a thread get ruined and derailed. Feel free to look at my comment history, 1 year ago, lets get SH fired for being a piece of shit who edits users posts, 2 months ago, conspiracy is rigged now and the NSL is gone. Nothing has changed except more people are discussing things off Reddit now and more trolls/shills are moving here to commiserate.</p>

<p><strong>That is my story of this egregious and manipulative behavior. You encourage it and now denounce it. You wonder where the admins are that you likely try to please so they won&#39;t ban you when others won&#39;t play fair. The whole fucking site is rigged, its a government sponsored propaganda outlet. The NSL canary is GONE. Is this not a conspiracy board? This might as well be a well recognized fact at this point. Reddit is run by PR outlets, government agencies, and profit seeking executives who want to turn it into Facebook. You&#39;re not welcome here anymore, wake the fuck up. You obviously know this given the admins lack of action. Were you not here when subreddits were banned but ShitRedditSays was allowed to stay? TMOR is just SRS. Its all the same people and the same agenda, to drive non-commercial friendly users off the site with administrator assistance.</strong></p>

<p>Brigading is a &#39;coordinated&#39; effort. Simply posting a link doesn&#39;t count as brigading. You have to actually encourage people to follow it and vote.</p>

<p>Where did I admit that? </p>

<p>Mocking them doesn&#39;t mean I haven&#39;t considered them. It&#39;s actually why I mock them. They&#39;re usually so absurd that anyone who reads basic news or the odd book would react the same, which is why it&#39;s such an echo chamber sub.</p>

<p>Have fun with your attempts at critical thinking. (Hint: it involves criticizing your own ideas, not assuming anyone else who does is just a troll).</p>

<p>If you have a contribution to the discussion, for or against the topic, how about write up a well sourced rebuttal and make your argument? </p>

<p>Instead, you&#39;re in here calling everything bullshit and insulting people for their beliefs. From my perspective, you&#39;re a trash, useless contributor who can&#39;t reason beyond ad hominems and strawmen fallacies. How about just go somewhere else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMHO you are one of the few good remaining mods, and they know this. This is also why we keep seeing posts about how much &quot;everyone misses the <em>old</em> r/conspiracy&quot; and complaining about how we need new mods, etc. every fucking day. </p>

<p>Even when reddit sucks as much as it does, r/conspiracy is one of the few remaining places on the web where you can still talk about these things almost freely and (arguably) without censor. But, more importantly, r/conspiracy exposes A LOT of corruption (and not only in politics, e.g., pharma). </p>

<p>Corruption can&#39;t be easily dismissed as other conspiracies can. Corruption is a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; without the &quot;theory&quot; part. It is fucking real. This is also why every goddamned day we see posts about &quot;how political this sub has become&quot;. You stop talking about politics, you also stop talking about corruption. r/conspiracy is a threat because it discusses corruption, and this CAN make a difference in real life.</p>

<p>And if anyone thinks I&#39;m exaggerating when I say that r/conspiracy is one of the &quot;few&quot; places of its kind, just take a look at the state of the Internet right now. Google is no longer a search engine, but a propaganda tool; search the wrong term and they&#39;ll send you to Snopes. How about the Youtube demonetization of alternative media and the &quot;misterious&quot; channel unsubscribing? Facebook telling you what you should and should not post, and deciding what &quot;fake news&quot; are. The mining of our collective data. Honestly I can only think of /pol/ and Voat anymore.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant... Keep the good fight Axo, there aren&#39;t many places like this anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thought is this: r/conspiracy is heavily focused on political conspiracies this year BECAUSE there is so much corruption in politics being exposed currently. Like the floodgates have open, so many threads, so many players, so many angles. People that haven&#39;t previously been exposed conspiracy theories are finding it easier to believe because events are playing out in front of their eyes and it&#39;s undeniable. </p>

<p>Also, when there are updates on other theories we do discuss here in real time. Alien Disclosure, Bigfoot, Moth man, Antarctica, Flat Earth, Moon Landing, Ancient Aliens, Ancient Civilization, Climate Change..</p>

Putin has had dissidents  killed. I&#39;m not talking about Clinton body count killed, I&#39;m talking about 98% evidence. Yet you find it important to post a news article making Putin seem like a hero of the people. Step away from reddit for a few days. Do some self reflection. Figure out why you are wasting time defending Russia. Ignore TMOR. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to be real with you and I hope you take this as just me being honest since you brought it up, not a violation of rule 10.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t read TMOR, only ever think about it when it gets brought up here. And I refuse to downvote things I don&#39;t like as a matter of principle, I reserve that for things that actually serve to kill conversation. </p>

<p>But if I were the type of person that downvoted things I didn&#39;t like, I would downvote most everything I&#39;ve ever read from you. Your posts make it sound like you are incredibly upset by perceived persecution but still somehow think your enemies (and it definitely seems like you see them as enemies) are not persecuted enough.</p>

<p>So maybe instead of making a giant stickied post about how a (TINY) sub is targeting you, maybe think about why you keep being targeted. If I had to guess, it would be because you are a mod that doesn&#39;t even bother with the illusion of impartiality. The entire reason I like this sub is because I fucking hate the political subs that have mods like that.</p>

<p>Just as a final postscript, don&#39;t take this as me accusing you of being anything in your real life. I know I personally keep whatever discussion I have on Reddit mostly out of my day-to-day interactions, and my personality here is not even close to my personality with family, friends or even strangers. I assume most people here do the same thing.</p>

One of the Left&#39;s primary forms of psychological warfare is to attempt to use vindictive mockery in order to make their opponents feel ashamed of themselves.

<p>Try to ignore it, if you can.  The sub is one of the Left&#39;s equivalents of <a href="/r/coontown">/r/coontown</a>.  If there was genuine justice around here, TMOR would be shut down as well; but Reddit&#39;s bias is Left, just as Voat&#39;s/4chan&#39;s is Right.</p>

<p>Banning /user/TotesMessenger from this subreddit would help, as well; as it posts in here when threads have been crossposted to TMOR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but some, if not all by default, admins are certainly in the pocket of whatever group is funding the narrative opposition control operation taking place in this sub. I say &quot;by default&quot; because it is likely this is coming down from Conde brass.  Content control is probably the most important tool in a psychological manipulation operation. A media giant like the owners of this site is certainly part of the broader conspiracy of this type we know to exist.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very hard, though not impossible, to think outside the box and have your thinking be <em>factually correct</em> despite public knowledge, in such an environment.</p>

<p><a href="/u/Moranall">/u/Moranall</a> even had the audacity to message the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods yesterday calling for us to remove all posts on the 2nd &quot;person of interest&quot; in the Las Vegas shooting case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Glad you mentioned my name. Here is literally what I sent to the modmail: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, we&#39;re back to doxxing with regard to the LV shooting. The judge unsealed some police documents which revealed a second person of interest, but I don&#39;t think this makes someone a &quot;popular&quot; person that can now be identified by the masses.  </p>

<p>Is this something you really want on the sub? I get that you&#39;re conspiracy-minded individuals, but this is really towing a thin line.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sorry I had the wherewithal to be concerned about the doxxing of what was, in my mind, a non-public figure. However, u/Balthanos replied: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/us/las-vegas-attack-paddock-shooting.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/us/las-vegas-attack-paddock-shooting.html</a>
It&#39;s in a MSM article, no?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was not aware of this article but the point was valid, so I conceded my point:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ah, my apologies. I did not see that article nor was aware that the press was that far along. I guess that kind of kills my argument.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So where in that chain of messaging did I call for you to remove all posts on that? I literally called out the posts that were doxxing the second person of interest. And then backed down on my argument when presented with the news source. </p>

<p>The only one creating drama here is you. If you weren&#39;t posting about this incessantly, we wouldn&#39;t have material to work with. </p>

Same with briading, a sub has to actively encourage people to vote or comment in theads to be considered briading.  </p>

<p>If the admins feel like the rules aren&#39;t  enforced, most of the times they will contact the mods and tell them to cut their shit. But linking and moking people is allowed, otherwise most meta-subs and a whole bunch of other subs could be banned too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>maybe you&#39;re right. but right now with Trump we&#39;re having a war in the middle of washington, DC. the fact is that 60% of the country did not vote for him and do not support much of what he&#39;s trying to do. i&#39;m not saying that because he should have lost or something, or because I&#39;m butthurt. I&#39;m saying it because he refuses to even acknowledge that those people exist. i gave him a solid chance to do so, but he refused and shit on people like me. many tens of millions of us get home every evening expecting to see a critical take on the day&#39;s political events-- but Trump entirely disregards what we see and believe as &quot;fake news&quot;. you know what, even if it is &quot;fake&quot; somehow, there&#39;s nothing American about disenfranchising people because you disagree with them. Even Obama catered a bit to people like Trump himself and those at Fox News, even though they often did nothing but spread blatant lies about the president. Now that Trump is in charge though, he&#39;s literally about to disassemble the justice department because he wants people to stop talking about something critical of him. He&#39;s a huge hypocrite and defines the idea of &quot;do as i say not as I do&quot;. That is what I mainly have a problem with, regardless of the complaints I have with his individual decisions.</p>
