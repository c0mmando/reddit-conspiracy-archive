       Perhaps emboldened by the admin's apparent apathy to behavior that
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be considered as going against the core ethos of this website, the stalker/hate sub known as TMOR has significantly increased their attacks against me and
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7u1py5/how_come_washingtons_in_a_rush_to_rig_russias/dtgtyld/">
        this submission statement of mine
       </a>
       from yesterday has managed to achieve an impressive -101 in comment karma.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Curiously, the thread never got very popular (it hit 0 fairly quickly) and only a dozen or so other users actually commented at all.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       For those familiar with reddit, that would
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       account for over -100 comment karma, with well over +100 comment karma for the top comment (which was a TMOR-esque ad hominem attack against me). To reiterate, a few comments that disagree with a post does
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       equate with
       <em>
        over 100 downvotes on a mere comment in the thread
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7u309p/top_mod_goes_full_comrade_and_posts_literal/">
        Here's the explanation
       </a>
       . Notice how this TMOR thread has
       <em>
        significantly
       </em>
       more activity than my thread: it's at 300 points with 55 comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO this is
       <em>
        irrefutable
       </em>
       evidence of a TMOR induced/inspired brigade that created a -100/+100 discrepancy in the voting of my post.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a similar example from yesterday,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7u1n3e/reaction_to_recent_iranian_protests_reveals/dtgudou/?sh=bf98fd55&amp;amp;st=JD290RBE">
        another comment of mine
       </a>
       was downvoted dozens of times
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7u5737/top_mod_at_it_again_complains_about_his_blatant/">
        and it just so happens it was linked
       </a>
       by TMOR as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       And hey look,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7u410z/top_mod_posts_political_thread_weeks_after_saying/">
        they linked to
        <em>
         another
        </em>
        one of my posts yesterday.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And last night,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7u86iz/rtopmindsofreddit_tmor_is_actively_and/">
        when I submitted a similar post
       </a>
       , the brigading
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7u8gwp/top_mod_is_whining_and_crying_about_imaginary/">
        continued
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       As of late, TMOR has decided to honor me with multiple links to my posts and comments on their front page on a regular basis (there have been at least a half a dozen in the last 24 hours).
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7t536z/stand_up_to_the_mod_abuse_axolotl_peyotl_sets_a/">
        Their current sticky
       </a>
       is even some sort of perverse call to arms against me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scanning through these threads is a fascinating experience...they don't even know me, and yet it's palpable how they delight in their obsessive disdain, and all over some person on the internet!
      </p>
      <p>
       This thread should serve as a good reference point for those who accuse us of spouting baseless accusations against what very clearly is despicable behavior being regularly carried out by hate-oriented subs like TMOR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please take the opportunity to provide your stories/evidence of this egregious and manipulative behavior.

       Wow, thanks. I can't wait to be banned again for "not being entertaining" enough. See you over there!

       By the way, are you going to keep the 10 minute restriction on comments from folks without enough karma? You should lift that.

       Also, in fairness, as excited as I am about being granted entrance to your swill pond, ought you not grant the same privilege to anyone else that is mentioned or x-posted in your sub? Or do you admittedly believe that people do not have an inherent right to defend themselves?

       During our last conversation you literally said there was no evidence against a child pornographer and that the accusations against them never went to trial.  Why would you deliberately outright lie about something like that unless you were trying to defend a child pornographer???

       No, wait... you're the dude who just sent me that loony lawsuit message. Dude, I was a print reporter for nearly 25 years; I've been sued by actual people with actual money, given depositions that weren't imaginary for laws that actually exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I jointed TMOR about a year ago, I'd say about 90% were just reasonably sane people who, frustrated by the amount of sheer unreasonable stupidity on reddit, decided to start mocking it where it appeared most often, which was conspiracy and the_donald.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since then, the group seems to have morphed into half people mocking the insanely stupid, and half people banned by flytape or axotl from your forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the answer is most definitely the former. It's of no consequence in the way that old sitcom repeats are of no consequence: it's entertaining and stupid, but if it disappeared tomorrow no one would really give a shit.

       I don't know (I've never been banned from anywhere). But if those were the site-wide rules, surely the site would just be set up so that if you're banned, you can no longer up/down-vote? At least when signed in with the banned account, I would think.

       Yup. Its the shill nerve-center where their goal is to stamp out anything that doesn't align with the Reddit Hivemind narrative. TPTB want forums like Reddit to be echo chambers where the NWO narrative is amplified and distributed to the normies. Dissent gets people thinking, and it can't be tolerated.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of their new and favorite tactics is to project by calling any dissent "Russian shills/bots." Once you become aware of their tactics and vote manipulation, its as clear as day when they arrive on the scene.

       I'm not pretending anything.  I think even if Russian bots are out in full force with memes and hashtags BFD.  They have a small part in the online manipulation game yet we don't mention any of the other players.  I don't like being manipulated regardless of who is doing it or what nationality they are. I think it is silly to pretend the Russians are the only entity seeking influence online.  But I'm also not scared of it as it isn't anything new.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also yes I grew up in small town America but I don't typically divulge personal information on the internet.  I wouldn't want to say anything that could potentially narrow down my location.  Don't really care if you want to imagine I'm a Russian. For all I know I could just be talking to a bot anyway.

       As for your huge concern for people finding out about any part of your patriotic american life, I could have easily predicted that answer. Vegas wouldn't have even given me odds for a bet on such a common, weak excuse.

       Let me tell you about mine, though. I grew up in New England and i couldn't be prouder of it. Cape Cod has the most beautiful lighthouses, set on landscapes that couldnt be more perfect for a postcard. I also didn't live far from a beach right outside Boston: the water of which had disgusting amounts of kelp and the sand was horrendous. But the view of Boston from the beach could not be beat. I was last there almost a decade ago; I was forced to move as a kid in a military family. I now live in a shitty cookie-cutter military town, the cost of my dad's sacrifice to this country and everything it stands for.

       Tell me, what makes you think that I'm anything but a warm-blooded american? I'm only here talking about my historically American beliefs. Why don't you give me a call so we can chat about it?

       I don't even know who you are bud.  I am a huge privacy advocate.  I would never post the kind of information you posted there.  I don't expect you to believe me and I think it's silly to think I have to prove where I grew up to you.  Instead I will just describe your generic small town America as mine is just one of many.  One or two stoplights or possibly not any if the town is not located an highway intersection. Even the smallest towns usually have some sort of grocery store and/or place to eat.  Sometimes they are combined into one place like you can buy sandwiches or often hot foods as well.  In bigger "small towns" you'll have a dedicated grocery store, a general store, few gas stations, hardware store, Autoparts/heavy machinery parts store,few restaurants/bars, insurance, and some other random businesses.  Usually a school and a high school.  Sometimes smaller towns will combine towns into one school. I don't know what else you'd want me to go on about.  Small towns are called small towns for a reason.

       woah, I think i might have been there before! it sounds just like Annapolis! it's a pretty beautiful place isn't it? I had to go there while I was at the national institute of health. pretty boring though, you're right. do you remember the lan cafe that was there a few years ago though?

       Since you refuse to say a single word about your personal life, as if you're some sort of Terminator with only enough knowledge to combat liberals, let me ask you one last thing. Something all American patriots freely feel comfortable talking about.

       I had to hear it from my family after school closed early. My aunt in the NYPD spent the day covered in the dust of the world trade centers and all it's contents, including the undetectable fragments of the people who were still inside. I spent the rest of the day watching the news in disbelief.

       Do you really go around being some bot detective? You act like this is a regular conversation to have.  But I will humor you anyway just because I'm curious what your deal is.  I actually first heard if from a girl I crushed on at school.  I didn't know what was going on yet.  She was kind of a goof but passing her in the hallway she said something along the lines of "an airplane just crashed into a building"  Then once back in the classroom the teacher briefly tried to explain what was happening.  We had cable access in the school so we pretty muched watched it unfold on TV all day.  I did have one teacher/hour who wouldn't let us watch saying that watching would just be letting the terrorists win.  Of course we resented him for it because we got to watch TV in all the other hours/classes.

       I like to look for a shred of humanity in people who typically seem not to have an ounce. It usually says more about someone than their position on some petty political decision. When I actually do find someone claiming to be American yet, for instance, makes grammar mistakes no native born American ever would and only posts in GMT daylight hours, upon this kind of questioning they tend to respond in a similar way

       . They usually freak out in rage, eventually deleting their comments. Then I add another tally on my laptop and roam the digital underworld for more trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a shame that it's considered normal for American compatriots to have such incredibly heated arguments over things that should be considered simple fact. It's too easy to forget that we're still all under the grand old flag.

       Lol it's all good. I don't remember what we where originally talking about but I think it was probably Trump/Russia.  The reason I get involved in debates about this is because this is the only conspiracy that has ever been forcefully rammed down our throats and I don't like the taste of it.  I don't like anyone telling me what I should believe without presenting real undeniable facts.  There are all these half truths being paraded around as absolute fact and nobody dare say otherwise.  So I am here to say otherwise.  At least until something real significant comes out about it anyway.

       I'm only saying that Russia, with a long history of and plenty of training in maliciously swaying the public opinion of other countries in a long game of political gamesmanship and also head by a man who worked in that very agency, that they very easily could be doing it still.

       It's like you're saying there's no fish in the ocean, using the fact that I'm not a fisherman to prove It. In fact, there's plenty of proof of fish at the fish market and there's plenty of research by experts of the ocean-- but you, a
       <em>
        civilian know-nothing conspiracy theorist with intense personal bias
       </em>
       , seem to know much better than them. Very rational of you.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS, yes I'm clearly very intensely angry. I can't help but rage wank over your utter lack of rational thought. I love dismantling people like you because it makes me incredibly angry, not because it's my sick personal fetish.

       Pretty easy: proof of what you said. If you accuse someone of a crime, provide evidence of said crime. If you accuse users on here of being obvious Russian shills, provide evidence of said claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       A playbook that theoretically proves the existence of Russian shills does not support your claim that you’ve interacted with many that were so obviously Russian that it bled through the screen.

       And you know this. So again: put up or stfu.

       Guess what, pal: I don't live to collect and catalog evidence for random dipshits like you. Like I've said this whole time, you're clearly more committed to ignorance and disbelief than you are reason and historical trend, regardless of what I say. If not, why not prove me wrong and keep your eyes open for some of the many "patriotic americans" that infest these places, with strangely broken english and even stranger avoidance of conversation with any real American value

       Watch as I prove my point by giving you the little that could exist of this precious evidence that you're obsessed over, so you can then say it's not acceptable as if that's not exactly what I tried to tell you:

       Yes, but not everything can have easily producable proof. Nobody has proved that gravity even exists, and they have had billions in funding to do so. Why don't you be a little consistent and start claiming gravity theorists are embarassing too?

       It
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       easy to spot a shill when you happen to come across one and know what to look for. Again, it was your own clueless assumption that I would be able to just find one on command. It's like you'd call out a fisherman for claiming to have easily caught a few fish in his day, all because he isn't able to produce a fish on your personal whim. The fact that you refuse to accept such an incredibly basic concept is pretty good
       <em>
        evidence
       </em>
       that something is preventing you from following logical train of thought. Maybe you're just another fanatical stable genius with no interest in meaningful argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, have you seen any liberal shills nearby? I hear they're a major problem around these parts.

       Bud, your refusal to understand anything but this abstract mythical concept of proof you have will not lead you anywhere in life. Maybe if I

        was
       </em>
       paid to do this shit, I'd find the time to write a study about my findings and back up all my reddit interactions. Unless you want to pay me instead, your "proof" can not anywhere but on the actual reddit server logs.

      <p>
       Why don't
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       tell me what kind of proof you're looking for? I never said I had any, but you're so obsessed over it. Surely you have something in mind?

       Why exactly are you relying on me of all people to prove to you something that is already incredibly well studied? The fact is that if you had a critical, neutral bone in your body you'd already have noticed enough odd posts to at least make you unsure.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "evidence" that would somehow satisfy you is inherently hard to find. The best a user can do is out a shill and watch him delete his comments, but that's not so great for evidence is it? But you're so dumb that you think that somehow proves it doesn't exist? Amazing how little you give a shit about this.

       You could ask the mods of asktrumpsupporters for help with the contest mode setting. Every post in that sub is automatically (afaik) set to contest mode. I don't know if they can revert it back after 48 hours though.

       I think contest mode would be enough to make them bored here and go away. As they aren't interested in actual discussion and are just here to disrupt, if you take away their primary power, vote manipulation, they won't be able to disrupt and will get frustrated an leave eventually.

       They can't suck each other off if they can't upvote their comments to the top and bury everything else.  I really don't care if they suck each other off as long as we can resume balanced discussion and not have to dig for actual rational/logical comments.  Without the power to control the conversation via upvotes/downvotes I think they will lose interest.

       The difference is that TMoR is a sub with the singular and express purpose of disrupting and harassing others, primarily this one.  Under reddit's TOS it should have been banned when it was revealed that they were constantly brigading, but the admins have decided to allow it.

       Then ask the admins to get rid of the sub.  I still absolutely disagree with banning anyone from this sub based on where else they post.  This sub should be concerned with what is posted here, not somewhere else.  Anything else and you’re letting them win.

       Contest mode certainly will, it makes brigading pointless.  TMoR will just start up as something else (TMoR is just a relabeled conspiritard)  but it will disrupt them and make them have to do a whole lot of extra work.

       Oh, I’m sure they do.  I’m sure many other subs do the same thing, maybe on more of a quieter level.  I know a while back there were accounts in here just recycling posts and conversations from t_d before someone caught them.  I didn’t save the post where they got caught, but I’m guessing if you’ve been around you might recall that.

       The problem, to me at least, is that by allowing these people to get under your skin you just encourage them.  I advocate for completely ignoring them in order to not get caught up in the drama, which is a method of distracting us.

       The top two or three threads of the average post consist of two teams of shills arguing talking points and manipulating votes.
      </p>

       If propagandists are no longer able to push a single thread to the top because the threads are sorted randomly then the discussion is broken up into a whole bunch of smaller discussions with a much greater variety of subjects, and no forced narrative.  Brigading becomes much more labor intensive when they can't just target the top thread everytime.

        The top two or three threads of the average post consist of two teams of shills arguing talking points and manipulating votes.

       Sounds like a PERFECT opportunity for a mod like
       <strong>
        axolotl_peyotl
       </strong>
       to step in and BAN THE SHILLS, which is a better...MUCH BETTER idea than punishing EVERYONE for what the shills are doing here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is banning shills not a thing and if it is a thing, why isn't axolotl_peyotl doing that instead of posting "muh Russia" threads?

       I think after enough people contact the admin about this blatant violation of TOS, they will eventually get shut down. Reddit cannot afford to have such a hateful group of people roaming the site harassing and brigading innocent users, especially after they go public. Their time will come. Until then, I recommend everyone report them to the admin for every single offense.

       From what I have observed Reddit picks a chooses where to selectively enforce the rules.  I'm afraid a blind eye will be turned against attacks against
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .  It's up to users like you and me to stick up for OP and this sub as a whole.  It is the last place on Reddit you can still have balanced discussion without massive vote manipulation and meaningless bickering though that is what these attackers are trying to devolve this sub down into.

       They can turn a blind eye all they want to, it will catch up with them. You cannot simple enforce rules on some subs/users and not others before it comes to a head. Use their own rules to force them to do something. Every fucking time. If enough people do it enough times, something will give eventually.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       is doing as a whole.  Don't get worn down by their constant attempts at character assassination.  Just look at where this post is sitting, 58% with 6 points.  This post is calling out obvious fuckery and vote manipulation/brigading which is something I would think regular conspiracy users would be interested in seeing.  There is an obvious
       <em>
        conspiracy

       <p>
        Harassment on Reddit is defined as systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person conclude that Reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Being annoying, vote brigading, or participating in a heated argument is not harassment, but following an individual or group of users, online or off, to the point where they no longer feel that it's safe to post online or are in fear of their real life safety is.

       <p>
        In order for us to process your report quickly and efficiently, please include the information below:
       </p>
       <p>
        Direct links to the instances of harassment you are reporting. We cannot accept screenshots of reports. Screenshots can be manipulated and more importantly, we need to review the complete context of the issue in order to make a determination, context is often lost in a screenshot. 
Account/s involved in the harassment.
A brief description of the issue.
We need to see examples of how the harassment manifests on Reddit. A first party report is always preferable due to the nature of the investigation that may take place.

        Harassment on Reddit is defined as systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person conclude that Reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.

        Being annoying, vote brigading, or participating in a heated argument is not harassment, but following an individual or group of users, online or off, to the point where they no longer feel that it's safe to post online or are in fear of their real life safety is.

       You consistently champion the Trump agenda and dive into political, partisan fights, in spite of your promise to step away from such fights. People disdain you because you refuse to moderate neutrally, and will post as a mod in your own threads complaining about brigades. They disdain you because your often incredibly partisan threads seem to get hit with especially heavy handed moderation. Personally, I find your obsession with shills and TMOR to be repulsive, but that one may just be me.

       There are reasons people disdain you, but you would rather blame some external force than acknowledge your own failure to follow through on your promises.

       You are basically saying he is being rightfully silenced because he has right leaning posts/comments and has been
       <em>
        accused
       </em>
       of partisan moderating even though it is the brigading that is partisan, not the moderating.

       Oh I see. No, I'm what I'm saying is not that his views should be silenced, but that he is blending his position as a moderator with his position as a user. He is using his moderator status to leave comment accusations of shilling and brigading in his post, and just in general had promised not to join in the political wars anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, he can't stop being a high-ranking mod of this subreddit (short of stepping down), and even were he not posting as a mod in his threads there is still an issue, which he acknowledged in his big comeback post a little bit ago.

       I have seen mods in other subs post about brigading and otherwise unsavory behavior on certain posts.  I see it as being transparent rather than saying nothing and pretending brigading isn't happening when it obviously is.

       So, I see my mistake, I read the post before he went back on his statement and acknowledged that he would not be abstaining. So, this resurgence of political partisanship, while regretful, was apparently announced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you'll need to link something equivalent to AP's mod participation, because while I've seen threads are occasionally locked due to brigades or getting out of hand, it's not equivalent.

       Hmm, sympathetic is the word i'd choose. Sympathetic to the needs of corporations. You think they fuel reddit to make the world a better place? Its so you buy(or not) their stupid ass products

       The Admins are complicit. They want Reddit to be a perfect little politically correct echochamber that aligns with the narrative, for advertising revenue and probably other perks that we aren't aware of.

       At the time I am writing this, there are 390 TMOR on the recently viewed an 3626 for conspiracy, nearly 10x as much. Maybe TMOR can dogpile on an already unpopular post, but for the most part they are much smaller than the user base for
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .

       many users of this subreddit are tired of the inconsitent moderation from the modteam, particularly when it comes to pro and anti POTUS posts. And maybe many of the users here are tired of your whining and political posts. I dunno its just a (conspiracy) theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not trigger the TMOR and resign from modding?

       TMOR is just the tip of the shill iceberg, they will be mass emailing each other, using software for automatically keyword deployment, they have other places to meet too.  They are actually foolish for letting us catch any glimpse into their shill world, allowing us to watch them in TMOR.

       Reddit only considers it harrasing when you ping users with insults or actually encourage sending people insults (on- or offplatform).
       <br/>
       Same with briading, a sub has to actively encourage people to vote or comment in theads to be considered briading.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the admins feel like the rules aren't  enforced, most of the times they will contact the mods and tell them to cut their shit. But linking and moking people is allowed, otherwise most meta-subs and a whole bunch of other subs could be banned too.

       Reddit banned fph for doxxing and harasment.
Imhur banned fph first, fph then started harrasing and doxxing imgur employees. Doxxing is a hard limit for reddit admins since the boston bomber debacle and fph got banned. All doxxing stuff gets removed by admins quickly if the mods don't step in. That's why most subs are quite strict with censoring names on facebook screenshots.

       Whichever position uses real people. If you’re in a position such as an admin, you will eventually develop a certain hate towards certain people regardless if they are saying truth or not. People eventually wear other people down and to prevent this people should continuously be rotated. If they are indeed employees, then they should never bitch about how much content they have to sift through and delete/censor. If you can’t take the heat, then get out of the kitchen more or less. I didn’t ask for anybody to sift through the comments of every thread just so I can have everything nice and tidy for my viewing pleasure. Sure it’s nice to see some of the asshole comments removed once in a while but it’s getting to a point where people just trying to express their own voice are getting shut down and I draw a line at that. That’s fucking bullshit. People have a right to be heard even if their name is something like Xxmountaindewyourmom420xX

       I don't really consider it "policing". I was reaching out to them, as another moderator, of a concern I had. I personally find that doxxing of someone that is not a public figure is a far bigger concern than any sort of meta drama between our two subs. That's why I pointed this out to them though when u/Balthanos showed the NY Times articled that had pretty much already revealed these details, it made my point moot.

       People have been harassed by conspiracy-minded individuals IRL (see Sandy Hook, Boston Bombing, etc.) and it's something I personally stand strongly against.

       If you're an active TMOR user (or mod) you've got to realize that you're going to be perceived as trying to harass rather than as some altruistic do-gooder. No fan of AP, think he is making the situation worse for himself and the sub--also appreciate the transparency you've tried to provide, however, its difficult believe you did not act in-part to harass the mod team a bit.

       The problem is that they use alts. Mods can't see IPs, only admin can, and admin won't help the mods on this.

       What would help is what u/accountingisboring suggests, and alert admin when you are harassed. It worked for me.

       This is exactly what they want.  It’s also what people who want to push fear, division, and hatred along with exacerbating a persecution complex would do.  I’m not saying that the mod who posted this is siding with them intentionally, just that their posts about this fully fall in line with that end.  Maybe they want the drama.  Sure seems like it.

       As an active subscriber to both here, I agree. But just because people disagree with the idiot mod here and don't feel like typing a page long argument every time they support things I disagree with or put threads I find interesting in fucking contest mode (Thanks mods!) doesn't mean the place is infiltrated and targeted. Think it just means the mod is an over sensitive asshole.

        In a letter to President Putin and members of both chambers of the parliament earlier this month, the group calls the three-candidate limit "absolutely unacceptable."
        <strong>
         It notes that elections can go forward even if only one candidate has been approved, effectively making the process a "fiction" and replacing it with a presidential appointment.

       TMOR are far more Globalist than Zionist, they are against Trump for example.  The JIDF are more likely involved with The Donald, and they were previously involved with Conspiritard, until they came up with their plan to make use of conspiracy communities.

       Currently they are not getting on very well, the split is getting very big.  In the past they've tried to get on, there are some people who switch between the two sides, historically the sides have cooperated on a lot of things e.g. 9/11 and the recent attempts for regime change in Syria.

       It really is fascinating what's going on, they live in mostly the same countries, so they cannot nuke each other, instead they leak information about each other mostly and write propaganda.  Assassinations are dangerous as that means you get the same back from the highly dangerous opposition, but the stakes are rising all the time, so unless they come to a deal this will get very nasty.  The deal the Zionists want is that the UN leaves Israel alone, doesn't criticize, allows them to get away with whatever they want.  The Globalists don't want this, as then the Muslim world will not respect the UN's authority, so the Globalists want to be fairly tough with Israel so as the Islamic world will be happy with the new Globalist UN world government.

       They are definitely pro Isreal as you say, they just want to tell off Israel a bit purely to gain power over the Islamic world, but Israel don’t accept any kind of humiliation like that, they see themselves as top of the food chain, UN is for control of others not them.

       If I were an admin, I wouldn't do much either. You create the drama. This sub Im sure is a PITA for the admins because of all the reports and complaints it generates. I complained about the mods of this sub before the big shakeup, Im sure people are still complaining.

       And further, while its allowed, you are pretty active in submitting content to this sub. You are going to be scrutinized heavily when you do that. There are ways around it, but you seem to be very stubborn.

       We get banned from r/conspiracy if we go to TMOR and harass them.  We also get banned from TMOR.  Why can't we do the same?  TMOR is a shill shop and their behavior is detrimental to this sub and all of Reddit.  I've experienced the same shit as OP plus many threatening PM's.   Most of us have taken measures to stop the cyber stalking but the harassment and spamming continues.  Nothing in this sub is organic.  Why ignore it?

       They are effecting the type of material we'd see on the frontpage. reddit admins aren't steppin in and banning that entire sub. Its obvioulsy what the admins want, to see a bunch of racists downvoted into oblivion.

       Im a native american who thinks water rights are more important than hollering "black lives matter" because all lives matter.

       Btw the democrats wanna use identity politics to gerrymander districts, they dont actually give one flying fuck about black youth - they'd have legalised weed under obama if they did, as it stands the democrats are COMPLETELY  fine with black youth bumping into out of control officers/judges.

       Tmor likes to go ahead swatting racists on the heads but it the same damn thread you'll see TMOR swatting down the opinions of colored folk because "that is not factually correct, you should get a better education".

       Mofoker don't ya'll understand that this is by design ,so I say, tmor are the biggest group of racists on reddit, they are so smug they cant detect it.

       Some of the people screaming Racists! the loudest are ironically racist themselves.  If someone thinks it's impossible to be racist against a white person, that ironically makes them a racist. The definition of racism is
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.
       </p>
       <p>
        the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How can one say "it's impossible to be racist against a white person" if they don't assume whites to be the superior race in the first place?  I just find it ironic.  They also see racism in everything even where it isn't.

       Multiple points I've got here. Please read with an open mind that this is how I and I'm sure many other people see this sub and you. This is not an attack on the sub or even you.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       You've made many enemies by banning people for no reason other than you having the power to do so. People get banned after "many warnings" yet the person says they've never received one before. Silently removing posts isn't a warning, yet you treat it as one.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       When topics don't go the way you think they should, they get put in contest mode after being up half a day. This one was put in after an hour, I can only guess it's cause it wasn't going how you wanted it to. For a sub that has the statement of
      </p>
      <p>
       "This is a forum for free thinking and discussing issues which have captured the public’s imagination. Please respect other views and opinions, and keep an open mind. Our goals are a fairer, more transparent world and a better future for everyone."
      </p>
      <p>
       contest mode sure does go against that. You've seen it time and time again. Once put in contest mode after being up for multiple hours, the discussion turns to that and a conspiracy forms against the mods. It hijacks any discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And "respect other views and opinions" is, well, that never happens here. It is literally one side vs another now. Both sides are to blame as they feed off each other and blindly support those who say what they want to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       You obviously get attack for your views and opinions, but you also take it out on others for their views and opinions and many times it leads to you banning the person. Making topics like this, actually multiple topics like this, only encourages that behavior from those who don't agree with you. You are admitting they are getting to you and each time they see a post like this from you, it feeds them to do more. You got downvoted. So what? Really who cares? And being head mod, you should be the one with the thick skin. I know it happens daily, but that's part of what being a mod does in any sub that has thousands of users.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course this submission got targeted. You called them out. Why would anyone expect them to not respond the way we know they do for this submission especially? This topic should have been put in contest mode on submission.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       You've let many users stay on for things that others would be banned for after one or two warnings and it appears that is cause they agree with you on various conspiracies so they're allowed to stay on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost daily you can go onto the mod log page and see multiple posts by flytape being removed after calling people fuck heads, cunts and just blatant abuse cause he knows he wont be banned by you. Coyote has been warned numerous times and a few bans of multiple days. Yet he is always welcomed back. I must admit though, he seems to have got a little better lately, at least I'm not noticing him as much anymore. This is probably why there is the feeling by many that he is your or some other mods alt. Cause he is allowed to stay while doing the same things other get banned for. If I wanted to spend the time I could name off many more users that appear the rules don't apply to them. All cause they agree with you on things.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       A shill is not anyone who doesn't agree with you or believes a conspiracy that you don't, yet that is the definition this sub runs on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blame is on all sides. TMOR, TD, legit people here for conspiracies, and mods. With 575,000 accounts subscribed here (prob a hundred thousand banned lol) there WILL be opposing views and it honestly seems like most people here can not fathom that and expect everyone to be on the same page as them. That's what happens with any sub once so many people subscribe. Either it turns into bitchfest or a giant circlejerk about everything. This is why the fault can't be placed on one group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you rather have people with opposing views or an echo chamber like politics? If you'd rather have opposing views then you need to accept that and really that seems like something this sub can not handle.

       There isn't blame on all sides though.  This place was fine for many years.  TMOR harasses mods and users, and brigades topics.  It's easy to see from voting.  Look at the story about the dude that tried to breach the Clinton Foundation.  Top comments were all hijacked to paint him as a "conspiracy nutjob", and you get downvoted for mentioning the Clinton Foundation at all.

       And for every TMOR example you can find, there can be a counter example of TD stuff here too. Look at anything Trump related and half the comments are people calling others shills if they believe it. How does that help anything or stick to the sub statement on the side bar about free thinking, discussions that have captured the public's imagination, respecting others opinion and keeping an open mind?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at Coyotes submissions. 9 out of 10 times they are cross posted from TD within a couple hours of them being posted there. This is easily spotted by the "other discussions" tab.

       TD don't belittle YOU. I guess that means they don't exist here then, huh? Maybe they don't belittle you cause you post stuff they agree with? Do you think TMOR belittle people they agree with or disagree with? Look at submissions that are about Trump. Many times the comments that are from people who are calling the people who believe it shills also have comments in the TD sub.

       No, they've said things about me that were completely false and in non-political threads.  TD DOESN'T DO THAT.  They don't make up threads about other people.  And I don't care for TD either, btw.  Just that TMOR goes outta the way (and out of bounds) for
       <em>
        fun

       Just cause TD doesn't do the same as TMOR means they aren't part of the problem? I guess calling people shills and stuff like that perfectly fine and creates well thought out discussions. Do you not realize that problems can come in many forms?

       I don't have a problem with contest mode if that is what they set everything to or set the submission to once it is made. Coming back hours later cause the submission isn't going the way the mods want and then setting it to contest mode is pure childish. Literally not getting their way so they do what they can do stop it.

       You don't have to be much of a critical thinker to realize there is some natural overlap between TD and conspiracy.  TD was practically started on conspiracies.They are here in high numbers probably but they aren't disruptive to productive conversation because they are actually here to engage, and that is the difference.

       Exactly.  Also, there's no "natural overlap" between TD and conspiracy.  I would argue that it should be a conflict because worshipping the president means overlooking how most people in power in government are corrupt or in on some deep shit.

       Honestly im an outsider I just come to laugh at the more insane things. Most of which is caused by axolotl_peyotl/flytape If you got rid of him and his gang of friends respect for this sub would go way up, but instead you got a guy who stickies anti vax, and is extremely pro trump to the point have disrupting any anti trump things. One of the biggest reasons people come to laugh at this sub is flytape and his vaping bird mask.

       i have pretty solid reasons for not trusting putin, yes. i guess a good starting point would be how he brutally quells all dissent and blatantly subverted Russia's attempt at democracy by ending term limits. Both of those are major pillars of American democracy, and indicate that he governs from the top down rather than the bottom up. Russia listens to Putin, Putin does not listen to Russia. Could not be farther from American, so the real question here is why do
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       trust him so much?
      </p>
      <p>
       What has he done for the USA that gives him such a great standing over even our own damn allies, besides successfully make our president jealous of his power? Are you even american in the first place, so that you would even know what makes the US distinct from the ex-USSR?

       Why should Russia be a democracy? And why do you care. The reason I ask is that I prove in my subs there's a pretty fairly huge campaign of Jewish Russophobia in American and the World. I'm just trying to wake as many gentiles as I can about it. The truth of the matter is that Americans didn't truly have a problem with Russia until Russia came down to help Assad in Sept. 2015. I can show you all the American Jewish Journalists that went apeshit. American didn't have a rabid Russophobia problem until the morning after Hilary Lost.

       what are you talking about? we've had a problem with the USSR for decades, and after it's fall Putin himself managed to destroy our attempts at true alliance. He leads the largest propaganda campaign on earth, and you're so caught up in it that you probably don't even believe it exists. Why don't you travel to crimea and see what happens after you say something critical of Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go try it, tell me how it goes. I can guarantee you wont have a very american expreience, and that lack of freedom is why reasonable americans want nothing to do with them. regardless of how much their voice is drowned out by Trump and his minority of loyal demogogues, that will never stop being the difference between putin's soviet-dreaming Russia and the freedom of the US of A

       As an American, Crimea is none of your business and also none of mine. It is solidly in the Russian sphere. You're being told by
       <em>
        Media
       </em>
       that Crimea is your business. It's not. What is the logical conclusion to alienating Russia? The USSR has nothing to do with today's Russia. All the communists went to Israel. Russia should be a partner but the fact of the matter is that every single sanction on Russian was pushed by the Jewish Lobby, period. Russia hate is being pushed on you. I'm not overly fond of Russia either, but I hate the people pushing Russia on us.

       I don't care about the crimean conflict, you dolt. You gleefully missed my point. I care about Russian treatment of the people. Again, go and try to accomplish one of America's traditional inalienable rights: the right to protest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go hold up a sign with Putin's head in crosshairs, just for fun. Tell me how you would guage the level of freedom you have there while you're sitting in a jail cell with two black eyes and no possibility for respite.
      </p>
      <p>
       do you know what that type of treatment of people does to a society? in America it's called a chilling effect, and it stifles free speech among a community-- the core thing that America believes in. it's what all americans believe in above all else, and Putin has no regard for it whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       THAT is why I don't trust him-- there's nothing you can say that will change these facts.

       You sound young and untraveled. The word is provincial. You're not at a point in your life to know the geopolitical reasons you're made to hate Russia. Because you sure as hell have never been there. Everything you know about Russia and Islamic countries for that matter is brought to your eyeballs by dishonest people.

       the same way i feel about most religions: the extremists who take religion too literally are fucking crazy. nobody would put on a suicide vest if they saw books like the Quran or Bible figuratively as a work of fiction intended to instill certain cultural morals in people.
      </p>
      <p>
       religion as I see it is meant to supplement life, not control it entirely. the majority of people on the planet seem to understand this, but as with everything it seems there always must be people who miss the point and take it far past the point that made it good in the first place.

       maybe you're right. but right now with Trump we're having a war in the middle of washington, DC. the fact is that 60% of the country did not vote for him and do not support much of what he's trying to do. i'm not saying that because he should have lost or something, or because I'm butthurt. I'm saying it because he refuses to even acknowledge that those people exist. i gave him a solid chance to do so, but he refused and shit on people like me. many tens of millions of us get home every evening expecting to see a critical take on the day's political events-- but Trump entirely disregards what we see and believe as "fake news". you know what, even if it is "fake" somehow, there's nothing American about disenfranchising people because you disagree with them. Even Obama catered a bit to people like Trump himself and those at Fox News, even though they often did nothing but spread blatant lies about the president. Now that Trump is in charge though, he's literally about to disassemble the justice department because he wants people to stop talking about something critical of him. He's a huge hypocrite and defines the idea of "do as i say not as I do". That is what I mainly have a problem with, regardless of the complaints I have with his individual decisions.

       i saw someone make a distinction recently and i think it applies here. i have nothing but love for the russian people. my contempt is solely for our governments. The current conflict stemming from Putin's relationship with Trump, no matter how real or imagined it is, from my perspective has done nothing but brought division between my friends/family as well wrought fear and terror in the few Europeon friends I have. again, i'm leaving out my political opinions-- this is just my take as to how it has personally affected me. I just don't see the benefit in putting our relationship with the Russian govt ahead of all of our historical allies who aren't quite as cozy with Putin as Trump seems to be.

       Followed this comment tree to say hell yeah brother.  Im tired of having anti-Russia shoved down our throats as well.  My personal life has been impacted by anti-russia propaganda significantly compared to Russian memes and hashtags.  Just look how effective the anti-Russia propaganda is. It's ironic how the people that eat that up the most are always talking about how Putin is the propaganda master.

       Yeah it's getting at the heart of human nature to know why a controversy more or less splits the populace. Some people callously use this to grim effect. Unfortunately we can't get past inverting our accusations almost in mirror images and projecting our inadequacies on the other. Be strong out there.

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Users from /TopMindsOfReddit account for less than 4% of comments on /conspiracy from the last 3 years. It's been around 2% (per day) for the last few months.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There's been a significant increase in the average comment scores of TMOR users compared to everyone else, with a large surge in December.

       I have had my comments deleted before. I'm not even sure which rule they broke, because every time I message the mods to get clarification, they ignore my appeals. One of the mods has a giant chip on his shoulder and constantly stickies his own posts, puts threads in contest mode, and marks legitimate news as "Unverified," but lets bullshit 4chan LARPS proliferate. It's really disappointing that they silence free speech, especially when they profess to be "a forum for free thinking"

       Yeah, the Trump folks who push their political agenda here usually seem to be trying to productively add to the discussion. Even when they're pushing for terrible things I hate, at least it seems like they're intending to do good. They're not the ones that go out of their way to try to disrupt the community with toxic behavior.

       I think we should elimitate vote tallys. Meaning, we can still up vote and downvote, but only thread score should be visible. I think individual comments score should be hidden. I just think we are more about gathering information than who's got a cooler answer and by how much.

       Lots of people will dismiss this because they don't understand statistics, and they think that 100 people could just show up randomly, when the normal number would only be 4-5 upvotes or downvotes on comments at that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't understand that a variance of 20 times the normal expected value is, on its own, statistical proof of probably trillions to one against.

       When you see weird vote totals on reddit, especially r/conspiracy which is the 2nd most manipulated sub besides r/politics, it is usually
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a result of random chance. It is
       <em>
        usually
       </em>
       vote bots or admins themselves outright changing the votes.

       Ahem... I may in fact be banned for this post, but I will make it anyway since the moderators here seem beat down.
      </p>
      <p>
       You banned me, a long time poster here, for calling someone a shill. Someone who was already breaking the rules. I guess they reported me but I didn't report them so I was banned permanently even though it says usually a warning will be given. I've never posted here since until now. Now here we are, months later, mods are quitting, head mods are complaining about unfair behavior, harassment, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about you stop banning your regular years old users for calling out the people you're complaining about? I mean, what the fuck? Honestly? You ban people and invite the shills and trolls in then complain that the community is a pile of shit being made fun of by all the shills and trolls elsewhere on Reddit who run freely.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about you DM me, unban my main account, change rule 10 to allow us to insult each other, and we'll take care of it. I drive these fuckers wild and work for free but you ban me then I watch as more mods post about how much these trolls/shills are ruining the board.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're tired of being brigaded stop creating a board full of shills who laugh in your face. I can't even tell you the number of times I've wanted to respond here, remembered I'm banned, and walked way to watch a thread get ruined and derailed. Feel free to look at my comment history, 1 year ago, lets get SH fired for being a piece of shit who edits users posts, 2 months ago, conspiracy is rigged now and the NSL is gone. Nothing has changed except more people are discussing things off Reddit now and more trolls/shills are moving here to commiserate.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        That is my story of this egregious and manipulative behavior. You encourage it and now denounce it. You wonder where the admins are that you likely try to please so they won't ban you when others won't play fair. The whole fucking site is rigged, its a government sponsored propaganda outlet. The NSL canary is GONE. Is this not a conspiracy board? This might as well be a well recognized fact at this point. Reddit is run by PR outlets, government agencies, and profit seeking executives who want to turn it into Facebook. You're not welcome here anymore, wake the fuck up. You obviously know this given the admins lack of action. Were you not here when subreddits were banned but ShitRedditSays was allowed to stay? TMOR is just SRS. Its all the same people and the same agenda, to drive non-commercial friendly users off the site with administrator assistance.

       The mods here are almost unanimously corrupt or completely inept. Both are inexcusable and the vast majority should step down. I've been in favor of purging the mod team since before the elections. The only issue is finding able (and willing) people to mod quickly enough to end the power vacuum before total chaos ensues, but I don't think that will be hard to do.
       <em>
        Whoever/whatever
       </em>
       is the true guiding force behind the moderation team of one of the largest conspiracy forums on the surface web, we can only assume that its enemy is transparency and its aim is to suppress the flow of information and free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love to know who the mods are and what they do, who they work for, and how they became mods. I bet it would be eye opening.

       Stop enabling his bullshit. He clearly doesn't know the definition of 'brigading' despite being a mod.

       Brigading is a 'coordinated' effort. Simply posting a link doesn't count as brigading. You have to actually encourage people to follow it and vote.

       That doesn't happen on TMOR, yet over and over this individual cries like a frightened child every time one of his insane posts -- the last one a piece of propaganda directly from a Russian-government owned website -- is voted down.

       It's not 'betraying' anything; it's direct. 'Betraying' suggests giving up something secret, by definition. I called them nuts and lunatics, which is openly contemptuous. But there's nothing in the rules of Reddit that says you have to like other posters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't go to 'hard core feminism' subs because there's no such thing as "hard core feminism." Feminism by definition means you want women to have equal rights and opportunities as men. Most countries now enshrine that in labor law, so it's hardly 'hard core' anything.

       No it’s because you admit that you unilaterally condemn everything posted here as false and beneath your “intelligence” yet you admittedly refuse to actually consider any points of any discussions. You’re only here to call people morons and cause trouble. You’re either a fool or a shill and not worth any more of my time.

       Mocking them doesn't mean I haven't considered them. It's actually why I mock them. They're usually so absurd that anyone who reads basic news or the odd book would react the same, which is why it's such an echo chamber sub.

       I was banned about a month ago for accusing someone of shilling. I messaged the Mod asking why he didn't just DM and give me a warning. He said banning for accusing someone of shilling was at his discretion. He then proceeded to block me from being able to DM them.

       Is this, indeed, theatre being carried out to justify putting every thread in contest mode (which kills discussion and hides quality posts)?

       They probably have a forum behind authentication where coordinated brigades and downvotes are planned.  Pretty simple to implement.  The problem is in trusting the individuals.  Or even one member does the dirty work and has a bot net interfere with a thread or comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw I just posted (rarely happens) here to conspiracy and its at a comfortable zero.  Thats actually interesting to me because I dont know if a bot net is pinging this url and  freezing it at zero by matching upvotes with downvotes ... or if no one gives a shit.  If you think about it this is a more sneaky plot compared to suspiciously bringing a singke comment down to -100.  Thats just stupid. A gigantic digital blip.

       Yeah maybe people are downvoting your posts because they’re bad? quick look through your history and it seems to be mostly anti-vax bullshit and links to extremely biased pseudo-news sites.

       Well, you happen to be posting in a fucking
       <strong>
        conspiracy
       </strong>
       forum where people want to talk about these things.

       If you have a contribution to the discussion, for or against the topic, how about write up a well sourced rebuttal and make your argument?

       Instead, you're in here calling everything bullshit and insulting people for their beliefs. From my perspective, you're a trash, useless contributor who can't reason beyond ad hominems and strawmen fallacies. How about just go somewhere else?

       I cant recall a post of yours I agreed with, but I also dont recall one that I didnt learn from. If someone is going to war with you they are also going to war with me. I honestly dont agree with you on anything except for the fact your right to disagree supercedes a group of children trying to stop you. Hang in there and know that even in people you may believe to be enemies are your friends when it counts, free speech is a fight worth winning, and I am with you.

       IMHO you are one of the few good remaining mods, and they know this. This is also why we keep seeing posts about how much "everyone misses the
       <em>
        old
       </em>
       r/conspiracy" and complaining about how we need new mods, etc. every fucking day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even when reddit sucks as much as it does, r/conspiracy is one of the few remaining places on the web where you can still talk about these things almost freely and (arguably) without censor. But, more importantly, r/conspiracy exposes A LOT of corruption (and not only in politics, e.g., pharma).
      </p>

       Corruption can't be easily dismissed as other conspiracies can. Corruption is a "conspiracy theory" without the "theory" part. It is fucking real. This is also why every goddamned day we see posts about "how political this sub has become". You stop talking about politics, you also stop talking about corruption. r/conspiracy is a threat because it discusses corruption, and this CAN make a difference in real life.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if anyone thinks I'm exaggerating when I say that r/conspiracy is one of the "few" places of its kind, just take a look at the state of the Internet right now. Google is no longer a search engine, but a propaganda tool; search the wrong term and they'll send you to Snopes. How about the Youtube demonetization of alternative media and the "misterious" channel unsubscribing? Facebook telling you what you should and should not post, and deciding what "fake news" are. The mining of our collective data. Honestly I can only think of /pol/ and Voat anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the rant... Keep the good fight Axo, there aren't many places like this anymore.

       Yeah, by sharing our knowledge here we could potentially even come up with ways of beating TPTB. That's the reason they do all they can to attack the sub. They also don't like the corruption going on behind the scenes to be exposed like you say.

       My thought is this: r/conspiracy is heavily focused on political conspiracies this year BECAUSE there is so much corruption in politics being exposed currently. Like the floodgates have open, so many threads, so many players, so many angles. People that haven't previously been exposed conspiracy theories are finding it easier to believe because events are playing out in front of their eyes and it's undeniable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, when there are updates on other theories we do discuss here in real time. Alien Disclosure, Bigfoot, Moth man, Antarctica, Flat Earth, Moon Landing, Ancient Aliens, Ancient Civilization, Climate Change..

       Also a lot of regular posters on this sub get immediately downvoted to 0 on every post. I believe there is a conspiracy that they're on some sort of list. The list shows all regulars who never make posts that sound like below:
      </p>
      <pre><code> "Totally...I agree, Drumpf is for real SATANHITLERSPAWN!!! Plans to kill us all undisputable hard science fact manmade global warming!! Nancy says he has Russians standing in the desert using blow dryers set to high heat! Thousands of Russians manmaking heat! Resssist!"
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Don't believe me? Watch a regular post new then watch their votes immediately drop to 0 or lower, then  maybe they might eventually climb up  a little thanks to normal lurkers.  But usually they'll never hit all thanks to constant brigade downvotes.

       I downvoted your submission because your post seems like it was written by the Kremlin. You seem as obsessed with being a Putin apologist, as CNN is with Trump/Russia. Putin has had dissidents  killed. I'm not talking about Clinton body count killed, I'm talking about 98% evidence. Yet you find it important to post a news article making Putin seem like a hero of the people. Step away from reddit for a few days. Do some self reflection. Figure out why you are wasting time defending Russia. Ignore TMOR.

        What if there isn't really much of a topminds brigade and you're at the point now where axo and other mods have banned so many legitimate users you have created a nascent rebellion with users pissed off at the blatant biases displayed? What if it's that?

       What brings you to this conclusion?  You could be right, but I hardly ever see anyone vocal about this sort of thing.  I feel like if this was the case many more people would be screaming about this.  Especially with the new rules put into place recently.  Most people seem to be on board and want them to be even more strict.

       I'm going to be real with you and I hope you take this as just me being honest since you brought it up, not a violation of rule 10.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't read TMOR, only ever think about it when it gets brought up here. And I refuse to downvote things I don't like as a matter of principle, I reserve that for things that actually serve to kill conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if I were the type of person that downvoted things I didn't like, I would downvote most everything I've ever read from you. Your posts make it sound like you are incredibly upset by perceived persecution but still somehow think your enemies (and it definitely seems like you see them as enemies) are not persecuted enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe instead of making a giant stickied post about how a (TINY) sub is targeting you, maybe think about why you keep being targeted. If I had to guess, it would be because you are a mod that doesn't even bother with the illusion of impartiality. The entire reason I like this sub is because I fucking hate the political subs that have mods like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as a final postscript, don't take this as me accusing you of being anything in your real life. I know I personally keep whatever discussion I have on Reddit mostly out of my day-to-day interactions, and my personality here is not even close to my personality with family, friends or even strangers. I assume most people here do the same thing.

       TMOR has zero credibility, as far as I am concerned.  One of the Left's primary forms of psychological warfare is to attempt to use vindictive mockery in order to make their opponents feel ashamed of themselves.  They've tried to do that to me on multiple occasions, and I've seen them do it to many others.

       Try to ignore it, if you can.  The sub is one of the Left's equivalents of
       <a href="/r/coontown">
        /r/coontown
       </a>
       .  If there was genuine justice around here, TMOR would be shut down as well; but Reddit's bias is Left, just as Voat's/4chan's is Right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banning /user/TotesMessenger from this subreddit would help, as well; as it posts in here when threads have been crossposted to TMOR.

       Well just answer, are you a Putin supporter? Do you think Putin is out of the left-right paradigm?
       <br/>
       I obviously don't buy in the whole russia meddling with elections cause it's fucking United States, this big countries don't get their elections rigged, they rig other elections, and I'm talking high level players because saying "Russia, Putin, USA..." is simplifying it to the point of ridicule.

       Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but some, if not all by default, admins are certainly in the pocket of whatever group is funding the narrative opposition control operation taking place in this sub. I say "by default" because it is likely this is coming down from Conde brass.  Content control is probably the most important tool in a psychological manipulation operation. A media giant like the owners of this site is certainly part of the broader conspiracy of this type we know to exist.

       It's very hard, though not impossible, to think outside the box and have your thinking be
       <em>
        factually correct

       despite public knowledge, in such an environment.

      <p>
       The very fact this is going on is a

       It's not opposition. It's brigading to post links and bring hundreds of people to attack a post in another sub. TD doesn't brigade. It does that thing others are defending, which is participating in communities and commenting and voting how they please.

       Participating in other subreddits is something you're allowed to do. You can browse and vote and comment. What's not allowed is posting links to posts and users with the assumption that people will follow the link and brigade.
      </p>
      <p>
       When your sub posts links and hundreds of people follow them and vote, that's brigading. TD doesn't post links to anywhere. They aren't even allowed to say politics as a subreddit exists. When TD users use other subreddits as is their right as a user of reddit, they aren't following links and brigading. It's not a fucking brigade to browse other subreddits and have an unpopular opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your definition of opposition is equivalent with brigading, since it relies on links from your home subreddit.

       Its time to auto ban TMOR subscribed users from being able to vote/participate in this sub.  I know that is technically against reddit rules, but its not enforced.  If the mods of this sub care about it they'll do this and if the admins of reddit have a problem with it then perhaps they should just ban TMOR from reddit altogether.  It's nothing more than another hate sub like the others that they've banned (fatpeoplehate, incels)

       I think contest mode would be enough to make them bored here and go away. As they aren't interested in actual discussion and are just here to disrupt, if you take away their primary power, vote manipulation, they won't be able to disrupt and will get frustrated an leave eventually.

        It's in a MSM article, no?

       I was not aware of this article but the point was valid, so I conceded my point:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Ah, my apologies. I did not see that article nor was aware that the press was that far along. I guess that kind of kills my argument.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So where in that chain of messaging did I call for you to remove all posts on that? I literally called out the posts that were doxxing the second person of interest. And then backed down on my argument when presented with the news source.

       The only one creating drama here is you. If you weren't posting about this incessantly, we wouldn't have material to work with.

       Reddit only considers it harrasing when you ping users with insults or actually encourage sending people insults (on- or offplatform).
       <br/>
       Same with briading, a sub has to actively encourage people to vote or comment in theads to be considered briading.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the admins feel like the rules aren't  enforced, most of the times they will contact the mods and tell them to cut their shit. But linking and moking people is allowed, otherwise most meta-subs and a whole bunch of other subs could be banned too.

       maybe you're right. but right now with Trump we're having a war in the middle of washington, DC. the fact is that 60% of the country did not vote for him and do not support much of what he's trying to do. i'm not saying that because he should have lost or something, or because I'm butthurt. I'm saying it because he refuses to even acknowledge that those people exist. i gave him a solid chance to do so, but he refused and shit on people like me. many tens of millions of us get home every evening expecting to see a critical take on the day's political events-- but Trump entirely disregards what we see and believe as "fake news". you know what, even if it is "fake" somehow, there's nothing American about disenfranchising people because you disagree with them. Even Obama catered a bit to people like Trump himself and those at Fox News, even though they often did nothing but spread blatant lies about the president. Now that Trump is in charge though, he's literally about to disassemble the justice department because he wants people to stop talking about something critical of him. He's a huge hypocrite and defines the idea of "do as i say not as I do". That is what I mainly have a problem with, regardless of the complaints I have with his individual decisions.
