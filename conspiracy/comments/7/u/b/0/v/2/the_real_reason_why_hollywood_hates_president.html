       Now I say president trump, not actor Trump, because it all started when he started being  vocal. Alright let's get going down the rabbit hole. So what I believe is that Trump is one of those people who tried to expose Hollywood and it's "famous toxicity"(1 phrase, not an adjective and a descriptive word) or how being famous is toxic. So let's review Trump's words during the "grab her by the Pussy" thing. Now people focus on the "grab her by the pussy" part and say "oh the humanity, this man is a misogynist, a sexist" but if you dig a little deeper, you see him say before and after the phrase "And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything." focus in the phrase "when you're a star, you can do anything" he says that (you can do anything) twice, there's some obvious emphasis on that part, but everyone focuses on the Pussy part, so it's not in focus as much, but still, based on context,  he's emphasising the portion. And remember how I mentioned he was part of the minority of people exposing Hollywood(before it was cool), remember that time that that one dude went on the view and talked bout sexual harassment in Hollywood and the ladies on the view were basically saying "shut up,  you're going to ruin a multi billion dollar industry"(help me find it, I forgot who was the guest was)now what I'm summing up here is, the unreasonable (somewhat unreasonable, there's some reason to the hate, but outright slander and misinformation spreading, clips with no context, jeez, I wouldn't wish that upon my worst enemy)hate for Trump is that he is one of the few who expose Hollywood for what they are and this is their retaliation while in attempt to keep face with the public.(and it sort of working because it's rallying up the more vocal half the US population). And lastly, the minority of those who exposed Hollywood were right, hence the big controversy going on.(opened the eyes of the world on their small world)
So that's what I think what's going on, feel free to discuss, I'd like to hear what's going in your minds :)
Edit: an adjective
Also, I forgot to correlate why I differentiated president trump and actor Trump, truly sorry about that. So the difference between actor Trump and president trump first is reputation, Trump had a good reputation as an actor, known well enough to know his name, and that's he's a billionaire. And now he has a "bad" reputation and media are trying to expose him, and they're also exposing new information that's been pushed off like its nothing. Ty age of information

       Also, context "I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful—I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait." it's weird to read this, the tenses are all mixed, first sentence is now for later, then its past tense. And the context for this is even weirder, stating they're about to meet the actress they(trump and b Bush) we're waiting to meet. I get what you mean but this is weird to figure out.

       What is there to figure out? There is no mystery to unravel and all the women standing up to sexual predators are doing it, in large part, as a reaction to this man who publicly proclaimed that he has and continues to assault women and they "let him" because he's rich and famous. Women are actual people and they are sick of this shit and I don't blame them. Trying to parse this and acting like he's really standing up for women in some kind of 5D chess move is the same kind of aggressive ignorance that now characterizes the state of governance in the US.

       You mean the country where the major of its capital city saying that terrorism is part and parcel of living in a big city or the country where in the capital city where in some areas, women can't go outside without legitimately fearing for their safety(even in broad daylight)

       What you're saying after the initial comment and the 1st replay isn't relevant to what I'm replying. I wasn't even looking for a emotional response, I was just looking for a relevant one, but clearly it doesn't exist
