<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/hhwOPEQ.png?1">Just because I am using my critical thinking skills</a>, and questioning what I was <strong>FORCED</strong> to learn through public education, I am being told that I should jump off a building and kill myself.</p>

<p>Is that how people should react to questions and opposing views?</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/g4FDThc.png">Look here, I just asked what was the accepted explanation</a> for why things fall before gravity, and behold! Negative 112 points and falling!</p>

<p>Are there really 112 people thinking...</p>

<p>HOW DARE HE ASK THAT QUESTION!</p>

<p>We are being forced to think only what we are allowed to think.</p>

<p>I am very afraid for the future of free speech.</p>

<p>History is written by the winners, and we, the blind public, are becoming the losers.</p>

<p>DO NOT QUESTION</p>

<p>OBEY</p>

<p>CONFORM</p>

<p>Is it so ludicrous that I ask for evidence for things that I am expected to believe!?</p>

<p>If the Bigfoot was taught as fact, and all they ever showed was a plaster cast of his foot and a photo, but you never ever saw one, heard one, or knew anyone who has seen one or has their own photo, would you sit there and believe it? Maybe, when you were five you would! And thats exactly when they inject all the thoughts you are allowed to think for the rest of your life. You live on a globe, you will work to uphold this globe, and you will die upholding this globe.</p>

<p>War has become peace.</p>

<p>Ignorance has become knowledge.</p>

<p>I will not sit idly by and let my ability to simply ask questions be demolished.</p>

<p>I implore others to look in to this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If a person is &#39;manic&#39; or has questions, talking and asking and trying to understand is better than holding it in. Over the years ive had many questions, and exploring them thoroughly and objectively was the best that helped me~ while many of the questions may seem incredible to some, so does much of what comes across this sub. As they say in the X-Files, the truth is out there. Im sure study of the topics at hand and why they are supported or questioned will be better understand the more sources and research op does into the topics. ~</p>

<p>You seem to believe in not just in 1 conspiracy, but ALL of the conspiracies and any time someone refutes any of your claims, you laugh at them and tell them they are being lied to, without providing any proof other than what you &quot;think&quot;.</p>

<p>Anyone that disagrees with you is a shill.</p>

<p>Im sorry, but you could be 100% true in everything you say and people will still be acting this way towards you, because like others have mentioned, you come off as &quot;maniac&quot; and a &quot;douche&quot; in your writing and no matter how many cute pictures you draw and post to a sub you created yourself and named after yourself, you are going to continue to get the same responses here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think part of the problem is that you THINK you are writing them convincingly, but they actually are coming off as a rambling, preachy, evangelical, New Age jumble of words.</p>

<p>You seem to believe in not just in 1 conspiracy, but ALL of the conspiracies and any time someone refutes any of your claims, you laugh at them and tell them they are being lied to, without providing any proof other than what you &quot;think&quot;.</p>

<p>Anyone that disagrees with you is a shill.</p>

<p>Im sorry, but you could be 100% true in everything you say and people will still be acting this way towards you, because like others have mentioned, you come off as &quot;maniac&quot; and a &quot;douche&quot; in your writing and no matter how many cute pictures you draw and post to a sub you created yourself and named after yourself, you are going to continue to get the same responses here.</p>
