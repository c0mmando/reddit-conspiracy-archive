<p>Communist Goals (1963) Congressional Record--Appendix, pp. A34-A35 January 10, 1963</p>

<p>Current Communist Goals EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. A. S. HERLONG, JR. OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 10, 1963 .</p>

<p>Mr. HERLONG. Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Patricia Nordman of De Land, Fla., is an ardent and articulate opponent of communism, and until recently published the De Land Courier, which she dedicated to the purpose of alerting the public to the dangers of communism in America.</p>

<p>At Mrs. Nordman&#39;s request, I include in the RECORD, under unanimous consent, the following &quot;Current Communist Goals,&quot; which she identifies as an excerpt from &quot;The Naked Communist,&quot; by Cleon Skousen:</p>

<p>[From &quot;The Naked Communist,&quot; by Cleon Skousen]</p>

<ol>
<li><p>U.S. acceptance of coexistence as the only alternative to atomic war.</p></li>
<li><p>U.S. willingness to capitulate in preference to engaging in atomic war.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop the illusion that total disarmament [by] the United States would be a demonstration of moral strength.</p></li>
<li><p>Permit free trade between all nations regardless of Communist affiliation and regardless of whether or not items could be used for war.</p></li>
<li><p>Extension of long-term loans to Russia and Soviet satellites.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide American aid to all nations regardless of Communist domination.</p></li>
<li><p>Grant recognition of Red China. Admission of Red China to the U.N.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up East and West Germany as separate states in spite of Khrushchev&#39;s promise in 1955 to settle the German question by free elections under supervision of the U.N.</p></li>
<li><p>Prolong the conferences to ban atomic tests because the United States has agreed to suspend tests as long as negotiations are in progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow all Soviet satellites individual representation in the U.N.</p></li>
<li><p>Promote the U.N. as the only hope for mankind. If its charter is rewritten, demand that it be set up as a one-world government with its own independent armed forces. (Some Communist leaders believe the world can be taken over as easily by the U.N. as by Moscow. Sometimes these two centers compete with each other as they are now doing in the Congo.)</p></li>
<li><p>Resist any attempt to outlaw the Communist Party.</p></li>
<li><p>Do away with all loyalty oaths.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue giving Russia access to the U.S. Patent Office.</p></li>
<li><p>Capture one or both of the political parties in the United States.</p></li>
<li><p>Use technical decisions of the courts to weaken basic American institutions by claiming their activities violate civil rights.</p></li>
<li><p>Get control of the schools. Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current Communist propaganda. Soften the curriculum. Get control of teachers&#39; associations. Put the party line in textbooks.</p></li>
<li><p>Gain control of all student newspapers.</p></li>
<li><p>Use student riots to foment public protests against programs or organizations which are under Communist attack.</p></li>
<li><p>Infiltrate the press. Get control of book-review assignments, editorial writing, policy-making positions.</p></li>
<li><p>Gain control of key positions in radio, TV, and motion pictures.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue discrediting American culture by degrading all forms of artistic expression. An American Communist cell was told to &quot;eliminate all good sculpture from parks and buildings, substitute shapeless, awkward and meaningless forms.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Control art critics and directors of art museums. &quot;Our plan is to promote ugliness, repulsive, meaningless art.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Eliminate all laws governing obscenity by calling them &quot;censorship&quot; and a violation of free speech and free press.</p></li>
<li><p>Break down cultural standards of morality by promoting pornography and obscenity in books, magazines, motion pictures, radio, and TV.</p></li>
<li><p>Present homosexuality, degeneracy and promiscuity as &quot;normal, natural, healthy.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with &quot;social&quot; religion. Discredit the Bible and emphasize the need for intellectual maturity, which does not need a &quot;religious crutch.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Eliminate prayer or any phase of religious expression in the schools on the ground that it violates the principle of &quot;separation of church and state.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Discredit the American Constitution by calling it inadequate, old-fashioned, out of step with modern needs, a hindrance to cooperation between nations on a worldwide basis.</p></li>
<li><p>Discredit the American Founding Fathers. Present them as selfish aristocrats who had no concern for the &quot;common man.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Belittle all forms of American culture and discourage the teaching of American history on the ground that it was only a minor part of the &quot;big picture.&quot; Give more emphasis to Russian history since the Communists took over.</p></li>
<li><p>Support any socialist movement to give centralized control over any part of the culture--education, social agencies, welfare programs, mental health clinics, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Eliminate all laws or procedures which interfere with the operation of the Communist apparatus.</p></li>
<li><p>Eliminate the House Committee on Un-American Activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Discredit and eventually dismantle the FBI.</p></li>
<li><p>Infiltrate and gain control of more unions.</p></li>
<li><p>Infiltrate and gain control of big business.</p></li>
<li><p>Transfer some of the powers of arrest from the police to social agencies. Treat all behavioral problems as psychiatric disorders which no one but psychiatrists can understand [or treat].</p></li>
<li><p>Dominate the psychiatric profession and use mental health laws as a means of gaining coercive control over those who oppose Communist goals.</p></li>
<li><p>Discredit the family as an institution. Encourage promiscuity and easy divorce.</p></li>
<li><p>Emphasize the need to raise children away from the negative influence of parents. Attribute prejudices, mental blocks and retarding of children to suppressive influence of parents.</p></li>
<li><p>Create the impression that violence and insurrection are legitimate aspects of the American tradition; that students and special-interest groups should rise up and use [&quot;]united force[&quot;] to solve economic, political or social problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Overthrow all colonial governments before native populations are ready for self-government.</p></li>
<li><p>Internationalize the Panama Canal.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeal the Connally reservation so the United States cannot prevent the World Court from seizing jurisdiction [over domestic problems. Give the World Court jurisdiction] over nations and individuals alike.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>In the legislative hierarchy there are three basic types of rights: 1) Statutory rights, 2) Civil rights and 3) Constitutional rights.</p>

<p>Statutory rights are the lowest. Statutes change all the time.</p>

<p>Civil rights are slightly higher, but not much. Change the civil code and the &quot;right&quot; disappears. For instance, oppression of blacks and Jim Crow was originally part of the civil code.</p>

<p>Of the three Constitutional rights are the highest and the hardest to challenge.</p>

<p>Since kids are so dumbed down, they passively accept the premise of a &quot;civil right&quot; trumping a Constitutional right. For instance, in the Constitutions, freedom of religion is expressly protected. Homosexuality, of course, is not.</p>

<p>Yet kids nod passively when a religious baker doesn&#39;t want to participate in the religious rites of a gay couple, and he&#39;s punished. &quot;Of course, the gay&#39;s civil rights should take precedence over the baker&#39;s Constitutional rights.&quot;</p>

<p>Wrong!</p>

<p>Constitutional rights trump civil rights--in every and all cases.</p>

<p>Yet young people are trained to hear the term &quot;civil rights&quot; and they assume that they&#39;re supersede all else. In fact, they are lower [and less protected] than Constitutional rights. Any court, actually following the law, would have to side with the baker [whose right to religious freedom] trumps someone else&#39;s claim to civil rights.</p>

<p>Gays are NOT protected in the Constitution; the religious are.</p>

<p>Hence the religious win.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed, too, that the usage of &quot;civil rights&quot; as a concept to erode and erase Constitutional rights is a staple of the Bolshevik Left. They&#39;re trying to use civil rights to take away free speech, too (by creating the made-up, fake &quot;hate speech&quot; concept).</p>

<p>&quot;If you hurt someone&#39;s feelings you lose all Constitutional rights!&quot;</p>

<p>Wrong!</p>

<p>(Yet we see this pattern of disinformation taking hold of the next generation. It&#39;s depressing. They&#39;re so uneducated, they&#39;re losing their freedoms--and cheering all the way into slavery.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No they&#39;re not. Only one is, and the others are either completely unimplemented or only partially implemented.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Break down cultural standards of morality by promoting pornography and obscenity in books, magazines, motion pictures, radio, and TV.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of those mediums are strictly regulated as to what degree of obscenity they may contain. There are virtually zero major motion pictures containing pornography, same with television. Pornography is a kind of production contained within its own world, and has largely stayed outside of mainstream media production. In fact, films used to be allowed to contain full frontal nudity and explicit sexual acts, but there have been subsequent bans on such content, so in some meaningful ways our media has become <em>more</em> conservative/sexually repressed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Present homosexuality, degeneracy and promiscuity as &quot;normal, natural, healthy.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only homosexuality is considered normal/natural of that group, and not without excellent reason.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with &quot;social&quot; religion. Discredit the Bible and emphasize the need for intellectual maturity, which does not need a &quot;religious crutch.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Literally couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. Despite decades of progress, we will have not managed to make much ground in regards to discarding the vestige of organized religion, much to my chagrin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eliminate prayer or any phase of religious expression in the schools on the ground that it violates the principle of &quot;separation of church and state.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True, the supreme court has ruled that it is unconstitutional, and it is. Some local governments take this further than others. In my book, leading official prayer in school is not okay, but people should always be allowed to practice their beliefs, such as prayer, even if they are a teacher or other government employee tasked with fulfilling a social service. </p>

<p>Absolutely not.</p>

<p>But can you seriously tell me, that women wearing make-up, short dresses, and high heels would have been acceptable to in 17th century colonial America? Can you seriously tell me that <em>today</em> it would be acceptable for doctors to stimulate the clitorises of women with vibrators to cure <em>hysteria</em>. Usually, over time, culture changes. &quot;Degeneracy&quot; is something that has evolved over time. What is acceptable has always been fluid in the medium of time. 20 years from now, displays like Miley&#39;s may be just as unacceptable as they were in the 1950s. Hell, today even it is largely regarded as unacceptable. She gets a lot of flack for her arbitrarily scandalous antics, not just because it isn&#39;t entertaining or of any inherent worth, but because it is, in our modern times, still regarded as &quot;degenerate&quot;, even by leftists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;as was done in the 1950s and 1970s, would have been acceptable to in 17th century colonial America?&quot;</p>

<p>This is not relevant to the discussion as the material provided in the post specifically pertains to breaking down the cultural standards of the 50/60s in America. Nothing to do with comparing those standards to the 17th century.</p>

<p>&quot;Can you seriously tell me that today it would be acceptable for doctors to stimulate the clitorises of women with vibrators to cure hysteria.&quot;</p>

<p>This is more about accepted medical practice/knowledge at the time. Or degenerate Doctors and an unknowing public, take your pick, still irrelevant to this discussion.</p>

<p>&quot;20 years from now, displays like Miley&#39;s may be just as unacceptable as they were in the 1950s&quot;</p>

<p>Sure, I can concede that, but again, see my first point as it also applies to this one.</p>

<p>&quot;She gets a lot of flack for her arbitrarily scandalous antics, not just because it isn&#39;t entertaining or of any inherent worth, but because it is, in our modern times, still regarded as &quot;degenerate&quot;, even by leftists. The biggest difference is, we don&#39;t lock her up in prison for it, or ruin her career for making these bad decisions. Perhaps she is glorified too much, but that doesn&#39;t discount her criticism from the mainstream.&quot;</p>

<p>All irrelevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People see what they want to see. I see plenty of mainstream resistance to &quot;degeneracy&quot;. The biggest difference between 1950s America and now isn&#39;t the degeneracy of American culture-it&#39;s the breaking apart of a homogenous culture. Today large segments of the population believe in completely different things from each other and are not shunned and ostracized from the whole of American society for holding their beliefs, because there is no longer a whole of American society.</p>

<p>this has been known since it was declassified in the 1990s.</p>

<p>the CIA thought that by promoting the US as a bastion of modern art, modern thinking, modern everything, to propagandize soviet citizens so they would see their own countries as backward. communist countries, esp the CCCP, conde,ned modern art and only allowed representational art, think diego ravera, because sokidarity and the plight of others can only ve transmitted with realism,  think picaso&#39;s guernica. most have no idea that was created to commemorate the destruction of a town in spain. those that do, don&#39;t tind to feel anything like they do actually seeing photographs of the devastation.</p>

<p>the list is full of shit. most of it is neoliberal objectives, which is why they scare you. the neolibs won. and you, and me, and everyone else on this planet is their bitch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So another possible way to read this list, because I really don&#39;t believe communists are trying to take over the USA (just my honest opinion, were as capitalist as capitalist can be.) How many of the things on this list are actually things done or could be done by corporations in order to expand their power and influence in the USA? In my guess, 4, 5, 14, 15, 17-20, and maybe more. I think it&#39;s more likely that, not communists, but large moneyed interests have done, and will continue to do, the things on this list so that the moneyed elite design the USA in their chosen image</p>

<p>Yeah, I don&#39;t remember that line of thinking being aligned with the constitution.</p>

<p>Correct. The constitution is precisely constructed to give the people ample means to overthrow their government whether violently or non-violently, and in large part would not exist if the Federalists had their way. The founding fathers were not saints. The anti-federalists fought for us to enjoy the freedoms we have been increasingly stripped of in modern times. As with any period of history, people were divided politically.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) real and potential influence over higher education outside its borders came to the public’s attention last month when The Economist featured CCP “sharp power” influence – including in higher education – on its cover. Its briefing article drew its terminology from a report by the US-based National Endowment for Democracy. The Woodrow Wilson Center published a detailed report about the CCP’s effort to curry political influence abroad, including in academia. Observers are increasingly paying attention to CCP influence in areas of publishing, student exchange, classroom instruction, and research.</p>

<p>This is further Proof of the increasing influx of Cultural Marxism, Censorship, Hatred, Division, the whole SJW/Snowflake&#39;ism that has been prominently showing its initial beginnings at the Universities. Those same kids then enter into Tech, Gov, Fortune 500 Companies, Gaming Sector, and continue to establish these trains of thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never claimed that China wasn&#39;t trying to influence our public opinion by funding our universities. The U.S.S.R. also did this, until their collapse, and now I am not surprised that China is doing it.</p>

<p>The Frankfurt School was responsible for far more than just the SJW overkill we are seeing today. It is a legitimate area of study that has spawned less extreme and respectable studies than that of the domain of snowflakes.</p>

<p>Universities have always been a place for students to be challenged with competing ideologies and ways of thinking. At one point critical theory was as oppressed, just as those advocates of critical theory are now oppressing others. In large part, humans haven&#39;t changed, they just think differently. Instead of monitoring and coercing people that believe in leftist ideology, we now do this to the right. It&#39;s definitely inexcusable, but it doesn&#39;t inherently strip leftist ideology of its merits anymore than the oppressive government of the early 20th century stripped conservative ideology of its merits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh jeesh</p>

<p>first, communist here is referring to soviets, not ideological communists, i.e. those who believe that ownership 100% of the means of production (i.e. capital) and 100% of the profits are the inealienable right of those whose labor and toil utikizes the means and generates the profit.</p>

<p>second, i grew up in the 80s. living during the cold war was terrifying. genX seriously grew up assuming the world was going to die under the red-orange glow of a mushroom cloud.</p>

<p>third, most of the things on this list are literally CIA projects confirmed by declassification. the rest are neolibs objectives that they have been striving for since 1945 and shit that pisses off bible thumpers who can&#39;t cope with the fact that there are people in the world who don&#39;t care about their big book of boring jewish horror stories, and want to be left to live in peace without it.</p>

<p>so here goes:</p>

<p>1) is the sane opinion. coexistence in a nuclear world is the only option. </p>

<p>2) is the sane option. capitulation in the face of global thermo nuclear war is the only option.</p>

<p>3) even reagan woke up that disarmament is the only viable path forward</p>

<p>4) free trade is the literal mantra of neoliberalism. free trade has one meaning, a globalized labor (i.e. employee) market with absolutely no restrictions on the movement of capital. people who neither understand economics, nor capitalism, nor communism see &quot;global labor&quot; and think communism solely because of the word labor. communism has no labor market. the soviets had no labor markets. everyone had a job, even if they had to invent one. communism has no capital markets, thus free movement of capital is completely arrested. capitalists and communists both address labor, but only one addresses markets. if you see markets, it is capitalism.</p>

<p>5) if the soviets wanted loans from us, they were subordinating themselves to us, not enslaving us. always be the lender.</p>

<p>6) USAID promotes neoliberalism and was always a propaganda tool of our govt to win &quot;hearts and minds,&quot; while we plunder them with our private contractors. this is why it was created. </p>

<p>7) there is no reason for china to not be part of the UN</p>

<p>8) kruschef called off the vote because we back stabbed him, and he had OPERATION BARBOROSA PTSD. he was at the battle of stalingrad after all. if you want to understand the soviets back then and russians today, you have to understander OPERATION BARBOROSA and the price the red army and the people of russia paid saving the world from hitler. they still haven&#39;t recovered.</p>

<p>9) prolonging conferences to forestall a-bomb tests is admirable</p>
