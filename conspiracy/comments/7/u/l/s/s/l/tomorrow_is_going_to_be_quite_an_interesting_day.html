       I have noticed an abnormally large amount of noise attempting to smear the content of the upcoming memo before its released, which lead me to believe it was going to be something that would shake this Republic to its very core.
      </p>
      <p>
       But today, it seems even outlets like the BBC have been forced to come to terms with the fact that there is about to be open revolt by members of Congress (and even the President himself) if it is indeed true that
       <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42910377">
        a domestic political campaign was spied on by intelligence agencies
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       What is perhaps most fascinating about the entire situation is that if Republicans in Congress become disillusioned and angered over the actions of the intelligence community, it then becomes entirely possible that they would refuse to support a vote for impeachment were Trump to fire Muller.
      </p>
      <p>
       One would imagine that these kind of programs have no bounds, but many in Congress no doubt feel that campaigns (including their own!) should be sacred in some sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that there is impending confirmation that domestic intelligence agencies not only spied on a political campaign, but did so by way of manipulating a rubber stamp FISA court with a lie related to the origin of certain evidence in the case, one wonders if this might be one fight that the intelligence agencies are unable to win by way of their stranglehold over conventional media outlets.
      </p>
      <p>
       In almost every possible way this Republic is being put to the test, and I don't know how far the checks and balances can bend before the entire house of cards begins to collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       This could be quite a wild few weeks.

       American workers get fucked over whether there's a R or a D in office. We're always getting fucked no matter what, that doesn't mean some good things can't happen too. And Trump disrupting the corrupt system has led to some good. Look at all the members of Congress deciding to retire unexpectedly, for example. Trump being a spanner in the works creates a lot of opportunities. Exposing crimes by spy fucks is one positive opportunity we've been afforded even though the government keeps fucking us just as hard as it did when Obama was president

       So, let me get this straight....
      </p>
      <p>
       A Republican presidential candidate makes unfounded claims of being wiretapped.
      </p>
      <p>
       A long-term investigation into that Republican presidential candidate, now president, which is being run by a Republican I might add, is beset by allegations of bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another highly-partisan Republican writes a secret memo that claims to show illegal actions by intelligence communities and the previous administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, somehow, this unvetted document is supposed to dismantle and protect the president against the year-long methodical investigation?

      <p>
       How incredibly convenient....

       I don't really see them as mutually exclusive, it is entirely possible that Trump engaged in collusion and that the Intelligence Community abused 702 programs domestically in order to spy on a political campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       My insight in the OP is only that were such spying to occur, the saftey net preventing Muller from being fired (the Republicans supporting impeachment if that were to happen) would cease to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that way, its not that the investigation would get dismantled or that Trump would be ehonroated...its simply that Muller would be fired and the Republicans would then refuse to support impeachment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't necessarily like the state of real politik in relation to this issue, I am only explaining it from my perspective.

       So you are essentially saying that if Muller finds that Trump obstructed justice that he is not going to be held accountable for it?  Is that right?
      </p>
      <p>
       But if Trump
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       engage in collusion, isn't that the entire basis for using 702?  It's about collecting on US persons that are in association with foreign surveillance targets.  So that really wouldn't be abuse?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        If
       </strong>
       that is the case, then the real conspiracy is this memo being used as a coverup to hide potentially one of the greatest crime ever committed by a President.
      </p>
      <p>
       Arguably, the opposite is true as well.  If Trump didn't collude and 702 was used abusively, then Obama committed one of the greatest crimes by a President.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the timing of this memo, it leads to a certain conclusion however.  Trump has been President for over a year now.  Why is the abuses of FISA only
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       being revealed?

       The biggest shit show would be if both were true. Lets say that people in the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians, maybe even the Mercers. The FBI catches them by using illegal surveillance methods. In order to make the evidence legal, the FBI lies to the FISA courts and maybe even manufactures some evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically FBI does something illegal in order to catch Trumps campaign doing something illegal. Now that would be a shit show.

       Yes, he was. Trump Tower was wiretapped, and the NSA director Admiral Rogers had to tell Trump that, which caused him to immediately move his operation. They also wiretapped the White House, which is why there were

       You're referring to Nunes, yes? The man who ran out of an uber in the middle of the night so he could inform the President on the investigation? Yeah. That's totally the type of thing I expect from the unbiased head of the committee on the investigation. Oh, and let's not forget that his own republican colleagues admit he invented the unmasking drama.
       <em>
        And
       </em>
       he just admitted to editing sections of the memo
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       it was voted on and before it was sent to the President for review. In other words, he lied to the committee and sent the President a document that they did not agree to send.

       But his claims were not unfounded. The Nunes memo is based on a report by Admiral Rogers (performed March 2017) that reportedly details the wiretapping. Rogers reported this to Trump in August 2017. We just don't know the details of either the report or memo yet.

       With no access to the outside world other than land-line phone calls or the evening news. No 24 hour news, no internet in your pocket. I remember it as a much simpler time because it was for most people. We sat around talking and doing things. But little was ever accomplished compared to now. People can communicate throughout the day, updating shopping lists, where to meet instead of having to set up a time the day before, going over plans with family, the list goes on. We are way more productive, but also somehow miss the simple things more.

       back in the early 80s in houston when i was a kid, we used to have blue laws that prevented any businesses from being open on sundays. then they were struck down as a violation of the 1st amendment. i remember how excited everyone was that we could now do stuff on sundays.
      </p>
      <p>
       now i wish they'd bring the blue laws back. it doesn't have to be sunday. odins day works for me. right smack dab in  the middle of the week.
      </p>
      <p>
       after irma in sept i was out of power for about 6 days and ATT and comcast were out for almost a month. other than the heat and humidity that made it feel like the 7th rung of hell, i really liked how quiet it was. how dark it would get. people strolling around at night with flashlights just to get out of the house. not having internet or tv for three weeks showed me how evil the internet and tv are. if i could have had the air conditioner, it would almost have been pleasant.

       I'm not sure that pouring over and being inundated with far more information than you actually want or need to be able to do the same things that we did in the past is necessarily being any more "productive" when it comes to getting them done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life was far more spontaneous and lively with many choices made on the spot and on the spur of the moment. Far happier when they worked out and far more accepting and willing to shrug them off and try something completely different when they didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       More direct face to face and impromptu meetings and conversations with other human beings simply as a matter of course. A more homogenous view of ourselves and our society because it actually was far more homogenous and far less fragmented, divided, and contentious than it is now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover we did get things done and actually were more inventive and creative as matter of necessity. If there was more or better information we lacked we didn't have the time it would take to track it down and find it. So you did your own best thinking and what your strongest intuition suggested and ran with it and the more you did the better you simply got to be at it.

       If you believe the leaks/rumors the memo says that the FBI obtained a FISA warrant using the Steele dossier as evidence without informing the court of the Hillary campaign's involvement in the creation of that dossier.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe the leaks/rumors the memo omits mentioning all of the other evidence that was used in obtaining that FISA warrant and gives a distorted picture that the Steele dossier was the only evidence used to obtain that warrant when it might not have been even the most materially important piece of evidence used in that FISA hearing.

       No, I'm saying it's objectively false because it doesn't exist and the "intelligence sources" have already been revealed to have actively fabricated stories about the president in order to keep him out of office, or undermine him.

       We'll have to agree to disagree over whether it is a fabricated political smear document for now.  If that is, however, an accurate description of the Steele dossier, and the FBI knew and/or believed that the dossier was fabricated at the time they used it in the FISA hearing, then under those circumstances, I'd agree that using it at all was an egregious abuse of the system.

       There is 0 chance of a Trump impeachment, and everyone know it. Not only do they not have the votes, it would lead to civil unrest because it would be done without any legal basis that Trump's supporters would accept. You can't just remove a sitting president because of some contrived technical violation when he has all of the cops, military, and the gunowners on his team.

       Does that not sound like a dictator to you?  Cops on his side, military on his side, some citizens with guns on his side, all preventing the legal removal of him.  Doesn’t sound like a leader that values the rule of law.

       None of those are relevant to whether he is a dictator, and he is objectively not a dictator. Donald Trump was elected by a strong majority of the people (wait until they unravel the millions of fake votes from the 2016 election) and is being opposed by the dictatorial forces in the intelligence community, which are a proxy for the oligarchy that really runs things.

       You're saying that Donald Trump laundered money for russians? Please, post all of the evidence you have for this. And if you don't have any evidence, I'd suggest not libeling litigious individuals like Donald Trump in the future.

       That's not illegal, and Hillary Clinton did the
       <em>
        exact
       </em>
       same thing, except worse. She paid a British intelligence agent, Steele, to craft a document to not only discredit her opponent, but to justify wiretapping him.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, that's not even problematic. If the Russians could prove criminality on Hillary's part (I'm sure they can), the American people deserve to know that, don't they?

       As for clinton, if there's something she could be charged for, why hasn't she been charged? Fully within the ability of sessions to do. Still nothing. By all means, go for it though. The only people who still care about clinton are trump supporters.

       We have plenty of facts indicating that the whole "Russian collusion" narrative was fabricated by Hillary and British intelligence. People need to be charged with treason and seditious conspiracy, and sanctions need to be considered against Britain.

       Honestly, this shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to this scandal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nearly a year ago, I was explaining to my co-worker how the Obama admin and our IC's likely abused FISA to commit political espionage on Hillary's opponents, and how this scandal was far more egregious than Watergate. Our MSM is such blatant propaganda that most people still don't realize this, and many still wont accept it even after the Memo. In truth, nothing would convince many people. That's the power of propaganda.

       Regardless of my dislike for Trump my ears perked up a lot the last few days because Democrat politicians and those in the MSM on the left politically have raised an all mighty stink about this memo—full tantrum mode at times. Why? That just makes me believe that there's actually something tangible in this memo and they are freaking out and attempting to distract. If the memo were nonsense and easily disputed then why freakout? All the MSM big newspapers are plastered with headlines already stating that the memo is just Republican smoke and mirrors and is meaningless and just political even before anyone has seen it.....why? Why the fear? Maddow is whining on and on about it, even though she lives off leaks and propaganda and innuendos.

       Same can be said for the Steele Dossier. Were you whining about that, huh?

      <p>
       If the information is so easily taken down then why the temper tantrum? The Democrats in Congress can release their own "memo" whenever they want, giving their "version"—even before the Nunes memo is released. What's stopping them?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny to me that Democrats are freaking out over this memo and are making the same arguments that correlate to why the Steele Dossier should never have been leaked and published, but then again those in Congress actually leaked it to the press.

       Prove me wrong. Nothing is truly stopping anyone from creating and releasing that memo. Republicans are in control of the intelligence committee involved and they had a procedural vote to release the Nunes memo but they didn't have to do that vote in order to release it. Just like Feinstein releasing the Fusion GPS transcripts wasn't illegal but it went against the Republicans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, prove it. Schiff and others can leak it whenever they want to but they are holding back because the Republicans "blocked them", which is BS and you parrot the official Democrat line like it's actually real.

       Are we going to play this game? Really? Why aren't unverified accusations by a third party that was paid by the Clinton campaign through Fusion GPS—whose founder actually met with the Trump Tower Russian lawyer the day
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the Trump Tower meeting with Don Jr—similar to a memo who Democrats claim is partisan and unverified and comes from a former member of the Trump transition team (Nunes)? O come on. The same claims that Republicans lobbied at the Dossier are the same claims Democrats are making to stop the release of this memo. You can't put 2 + 2 together? Okay.....

       The dossier has already been confirmed in several places and Steel, as well as the FBI and democrats, have acknowledged that the information within the dossier was unconfirmed but likely due to the credibility of the investigator who complied the document.
      </p>
      <p>
       The memo has not been confirmed, and is based on the writings of a man who ran out of an uber in the middle of the night to have a meeting on the white house lawn so he could inform the president on the investigation whose committee he heads, whose own republican colleagues admit invented the wiretapping bullshit, and who just admitted to altering the memo before giving it to the white house after the committee voted on it.
      </p>

       The mere fact that he literally used and is still using his position as the head of a committee investigating the president, to inform the president on this investigation, is proof enough that he is the farthest thing from credible.

      <p>
       This part frustrates me. Not only do the politicians feel this way but so do their most rabid supporters. If you supported Obama when he was running you probably thought the birth certificate scandal was offensive. If you supported Trump you maybe though he had a right to keep his tax returns private. Why? I understand the tabloid-esque nature of the news coverage can seem offensive, but why should someone running g for public office not be thoroughly scrutinized? Serious backgrounds checks and disclosures should be the norm. Maybe they should have to pass some sort of poly-graph or enhanced interrogation (after all it's not torture, just information gathering, doesn't hurt). I live close to Seattle where Mayor Ed Murray just resigned under the cloud of a pretty horrific scandal. How the background info on him didn't come to light years ago is baffling. A simple background investigation would have yielded the info needed to disqualify him from office.

       I'd like to take a moment to point out to everyone following this story that there's still no evidence that directly implicates Trump in colluding with Russia or working on behalf of the Kremlin. AND YET here we are talking about how a FISA memo that points to abuses by our intelligence agencies in the pursuit of said evidence is partisan and inaccurate. Funny how we skipped over real evidence of the "crime" of collusion and went straight to this.

       Giving Nunes the benefit of the doubt that he's not being purposely deceptive, if the FBI went to court with a list of 40 pieces of evidence, and the Nunes memo implies that the FBI presented only one, do you think that the memo presents an accurate and complete picture to Americans of the FBIs actions?

       You know Nunes voted to reauthorize the FISA court in January without the restrictions that some members of the house and senate proposed.  Seems the only person's civil rights he cares about are Trump's.

       We’re talking about collusion, it isn’t really the kind of thing where you’d find hard evidence. That is, unless Trump’s emails were somehow hacked like Hillary’s. Unlikely considering the hackers appear to be on his side, and even if they weren’t he probably isn’t dumb enough to leave incriminating evidence on his emails like Hillary was.

      <p>
       That's because collusion isn't a crime - it doesn't indicate criminality in and of itself. It's really just a branding of the investigation to discover if Trump did anything nefarious with regard to releasing the DNC emails and affecting the election. It evolved into investigating all sorts of other things along the way as other information became available. There would most certainly be evidence of things like accepting payments from Russia for promises of easing economic sanctions, however.

       Please point out how Obama did anything that actually hurt political adversaries.... Obama directed the IRS to take a look at NEARLY EVERY SINGLE tax exempt charity in the Nation not just conservative leaning charities. The IRS used shortcuts by looking at names to determine the focus of the groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be tax exempt charities have to be primarily concerned with the social welfare of the nation NOT politics. That’s why I never understood the outrage of them “going after” republicans.... they shouldn’t be banking on funding their political campaigns from any of those orgs anyways.

       What gets me is how so many people who haven't read the memo are calling it "partisan". How can they even know that? This is supposed to be a massive overreach of power, kept secret and hidden from the public eye, and intended to stay that way. If its fake, then how could they possibly even know what the memo alleges?

       As someone that isn't fond of Trump or the intelligence community/rampant domestic spying, the question in the back of my mind this whole time is: Should anyone involved in a challenging party's campaign be immune from any investigations? I feel like that is a dangerous road to go down, but it seems to be a possible conclusion of the argument Trump supporters are making.

       The problem isnt as simple as who watches the watchmen. The issue is theyre running a propaganda campaign (in general that should be a red flag) to discredit the media as well as the branches of government that deal with this. This propaganda campaign should be the target of conspiracy ire. It leads to an empirical cat and mouse game where nobody can investigate the president, the highest and for some reason therefore the least corrupt office in the land. This is false, nobody should be above the law.

       Yeah another really good point in all this. The Lynch and Bill stuff seemed pretty egregious to me. I agree that it seems that political parties have way too much power and influence over how things are actually run as opposed to the individuals holding those positions.

       Don't hold your breath. It'll be as wild as the last year, with a revolving crew of political actors, plenty of fresh allegations of wrongdoing, thousands upon thousands of articles and expert "insight", swirling around a ever-spinning whirlpool that will ultimately only waste your time and attention. Wake me up when anything of
       <em>
        actual importance
       </em>
       comes of this.

       I got 2 buddies who work in FBI, there are rumors of an attack on the SB and Minneapolis has little Mogadishu community Muslims near the stadium, perfect for a false flag or psy op.
