       Idk if this is against the rules or not. If it is, I'm sorry. But I'm pretty sure I found a legit bot account today that copy/pastes other people's comments. It could just be for karma.. who knows. But I wanted to show it to everyone and get their opinions on it because it's pretty interesting. It posts all over the place.
      </p>
      <p>
       It basically all started in a comment I posted:
Not a bad idea actually. Regardless of where you ...

       SS: found a bot. i wanted to see what others thought about it and if they can dissect anything from it. I thought it was interesting how it just posted varying political opinions and stances. What could it be used for?

       I was talking about the specific bots that copy pasted comments.

      <p>
       After I had pointed one out, those accounts copied my comments till some were banned sitewide.

       I know not one side has a monopoly, I was just stating the usual M.O. of these bots.

       To me it looks like they are bots copying and pasting posts from other legitimate users, looking to farm karma.  There doesn't appear to be any political reason, since they did it in subs on both sides.

       Somebody suggested that maybe this bot is in an "early phase" where it's just collecting karma so it can be activated later. I thought that was very interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Man. You see bot and shill accusations all the time. When you actually see one face to face in real life and in real time. Wow. I always thought the bot thing was kinda over-hyped. Over blown.... I had never seen just how sophisticated they can be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not tech savvy, so pardon my ignorance. But had the other user never brought it up and had it not been my own fucking comment, I would have upvoted this bot and been like, no way it's a bot. Seems like a rational enough comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always assumed bots were the flamers. They intentionally made super ridiculous, trollish comments. This one seems like just an ordinary person with a mildly controversial comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you look at the other comments it copy/pasted, they're even more innocuous.

       Yeah I'm blown away by the sophistication. Especially the ones that can make it seem like they are having a full on conversation.  I've mostly seen that on twitter.

      <p>
       Whatever the intention is, financial or political, it's good to see them called out.

       If you look closely at its submissions, you'll notice it doesn't argue. It doesn't reply back. It just keeps on posting.

       You would think that, by now, a user simply copy/pasting would have fired back. But it's still active and chugging along, ignoring the people hounding it

       You don't think bots exist in order to farm karma, so they can turn around and resell those accounts to people.

       I know bot discussion is sensitive topic for some that look at everything through partisan lenses all the time, but what OP is showing here isn't a partisan reasons for bots.  It's financial most likely, and should be called out

       There's been a surge in this kind of bot lately.

      <p>
       Karma farmers usually only do a few posts a day on each account. 
I suspect this is one person trying out their bot script.

      <p>
       I think this was their first attempt: u/karadzic95 (shadow banned)

       Here's the full list I've found so far. There may be more. I was kind of  sloppily looking through recent histories for each using redditsearch.io
      </p>
      <p>
       I really want documentation of the related subs they are posting to and from and how well the copied comments do. I think it will, at least, show how closely the subs are in attitudes.

       Of interest. Idk if they're both bots or if one is authentic and socalhayd copied it too. But maybe another lead

       I can't be sure. But I and some other users have collected a list of users engaging in the same exact behavior of copy/pasting comments all over Reddit. The list can be found in the text of this post, as well as in comments here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unusual behavior suggests these accounts are bots. For one, this post and previous posts stirred up an army of people who have dug deeper into the users profile and replied to its other comments, asking why it's botting and outright accusing them of being bots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not once have any of the accounts replied. It seems like they're only programmed to post, not reply. No matter how antagonizing other users can be to it. Not once have the accounts even whispered a response. It's as if they're not there at all. Nevertheless, we can all see they're active and continuing to post copy/pasted comments around various subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is highly unusualy behavior. We can never be 100% sure they're bots. But it's a reasonable conclusion given the facts. I encourage you to investigate more yourself and see.

       Yeah I'm blown away by the sophistication. Especially the ones that can make it seem like they are having a full on conversation.  I've mostly seen that on twitter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever the intention is, financial or political, it's good to see them called out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish there was a "good bot" out there that would just reply to every post of a known bot like this, and let people know.
