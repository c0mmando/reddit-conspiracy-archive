    <div class="md"><p>Honestly the memo had no credibility until Schiff and Pelosi started blindly tossing out every possible deflection on the issue, even if the deflections were seemingly contradictory.</p>

<p>I agree nobody should read the memo and take it at face value, but I don’t think it’s objective to just deny it 100% out of hand. Truth usually lies somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>Hopefully we end up at the truth. It’s been 2 years and they’ve had the US intelligence apparatus involved from the get go so surely something definitive has to come out at some point, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the DOJ/FBI responses to potential publication fueled the Democrats desire to get Nunes out of the picture. They assumed that rebukes by agencies normally trusted by the public would provide the boost needed. Alas, they failed to realize that the majority would back Nunes 100% of the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this is a fair line of thinking.</p>

<p>I’m not trying to criticize you for saying people should read this memo with a critical eye for things being skewed, it’s absolutely appropriate to scrutinize this memo. I just don’t believe it’s proper for people to say it’s 100% not to be believed before even reading it.</p>

<p>The main argument against Nunes is his role in the unmasking saga. But there was unmasking and Susan Rice lied about the knowledge before coming around and saying “ok there was, but it was harmless.” So should we just believe her even though she lied first? Or is the truth probably somewhere in the middle?</p>

<p>This is politics and no one should be trusted completely and no one should be denigrated completely because both sides do everything possible to present the version of truth friendliest to their party.</p>

<p>The memo is hopefully a first step towards getting to the shade of grey area down the line where, hopefully, there’s some semblance of truth.</p>

<p>Right now everyone wants to be black and white. That’s never how things work, especially in politics and especially when the stakes are what we have here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t understand why there is dissent about something that hasn&#39;t even been released yet. And what bothers me is that, even if the Memo is 100% factual and illustrates blatant corruption and political espionage, the same people will find something to complain about and dismiss it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m looking forward to analyzing every detail of the Memo. If there are parts that are in dispute, I&#39;ll look at the arguments being made and decide where I stand. And I know there will be people making bad arguments, demanding that I interpret things in a certain way. </p>

<p>But what it comes down to, to me, is that I think these preemptive attacks on the source are pretty telling. Yes, Nunez is a Republican. Yes, he has his own bias.  But so does everyone, and someone needs to bring some accountability to the unaccountable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nunes isn&#39;t just a republican. He was a member of Trump&#39;s transition team. He has already shown that he&#39;s more interested in protecting Trump than exposing any sort of truth. </p>

<p>It all boils down to who you believe the snake is in all of this. If you&#39;re like me, and the snakes are Trump and Nunes, then this memo wreaks of propoganda. If you believe Obama is the true snake here, then Nunes and Trump are patriots fighting for truth. Only time will tell which is the case. </p>

<p>For me, the sum of the information points to the most likely conclusion being that they thought they could get away with spying on political opponents, including Trump. Honestly, it seems almost obvious to me and I have trouble understanding how people can see it any other way. I think the Memo will most likely just confirm what I already thought.</p>

<p>I feel the same way, just in the opposite direction. It seems like we&#39;re as politically divided as we&#39;ve ever been. I get to watch some Fox News with my parents sometimes and they seem to be reporting from another planet. </p>

<p>It absolutely will. It&#39;ll confirm everything you think it will. It&#39;ll just leave out some key details. </p>

<p>But that means out of Schiff and Pelosi, only one one could’ve gotten a direct look at the materials, and it’s possible neither had a direct look, yet both are doing everything conceivable to prevent the release or cast doubt.</p>

<p>By the same logic it’d be fair to cast out their arguments as illegitimate.</p>

<p>My take, don’t believe either side, read the memo critically, and start pushing for release of the underlying documents.</p>

<p>The memo will get released, only positive thing that can happen is a push to release the source material/report.</p>

<p>The United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, also known as the House Intelligence Committee, is a committee of the United States House of Representatives, currently chaired by Devin Nunes. It is the primary committee in the U.S. House of Representatives <strong>charged with the oversight of the United States Intelligence Community</strong>, though it does share some jurisdiction with other committees in the House, including the Armed Services Committee for some matters dealing with the Department of Defense and the various branches of the U.S. military.</p>
