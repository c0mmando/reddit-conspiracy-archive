<p>But I think that this policy will do much to reduce the spam, and agitators.</p>

<p>Like why the fuck do you need so many new accounts? What kind of vitriol are you spewing at your fellow humans that you end up so hated that you get banned? Or so harassed that you have to make a new account?</p>

<p>Be courteous and thoughtful in your discourse and diction and you can enjoy a long life on Reddit with but one account.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah if you&#39;re going to engage in team sports as anything but a spectator, don&#39;t be surprised when you get tackled!</p>

<p>Political debate is not conspiracy theory. It&#39;s theater, or to keep with the sports motif, a football. And when it&#39;s picked up and thrown back and forth by frothing partisans, the real issues get missed.</p>

<p>I mean, I&#39;m not American but one thing I have noticed is nobody discusses any policy... just who&#39;s gonna go to jail first, or who tweeted what about whom. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s hoping they <strong>all</strong> go to jail though :) The common folk need a big win.</p>

<p>Not so much viewpoints as methods of arguing, which is how the shills differentiate themselves from everyone else. If you come in here spewing talking points calling other people a &quot;Trumpet&quot; when discussing an unrelated topic, or saying &quot;not everyone who disagrees with you is a shill, REEEE!&quot; when people are talking about the factual existence of shills, you&#39;re gonna get tossed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good, but let&#39;s not pretend that Reddit is the bastion for free and open speech.  Posts are subject to the discretion of the moderators, and no offense to the moderators here, but that means the flow of information is subject to that same discretion.  I have no reason not to trust the mods here, but I would never know if they were actively preventing a certain topic or post from reaching us.  </p>

<p>Combating shills is a difficult thing to do.  I can&#39;t think of a better way to fight against polarization and shilling than to moderate the content here, but moderation requires discretion, and discretion is never perfect.  </p>

<p>Users in good standing who have requested approval via modmail will get their comments/posts approved.</p>

<p>Suggesting that the mods are selectively approving comments with political motivatios is disingenuous at best, and at worst is the same tired rhetoric employed by those who seems obsessed with fracturing the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community.</p>

<p>Also, the vast majority of spam comes from accounts that are 2 months old or less, so you may be surprised just how much this new policy will positively effort the discourse and content on this sub.</p>
