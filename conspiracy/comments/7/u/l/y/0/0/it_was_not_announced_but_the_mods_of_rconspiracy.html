       Limiting accounts can be a good thing, certainly. But it is quite clear there is a difference in the application of the rule if they are allowing certain view points to skirt the requirements.

       Agreed. Rules are important, but they must be applied evenly, lest we become the very same as those we despise.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think that this policy will do much to reduce the spam, and agitators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like why the fuck do you need so many new accounts? What kind of vitriol are you spewing at your fellow humans that you end up so hated that you get banned? Or so harassed that you have to make a new account?
      </p>
      <p>
       Be courteous and thoughtful in your discourse and diction and you can enjoy a long life on Reddit with but one account.

       In this atmosphere I don't think it takes much that you get hated or harrassed.  Alts are a common practice if your main account has a lot of personal info and you don't want to be doxxed.

       I suppose, depending on what topics you engage on. I mean if you're a bigot I can definitely see those problems arising.

       I'm not even saying bigoted stuff. I mean everyone is just so pinned on this left right shit and who is right and wrong that people end up being attacked. It's nonsensical and immature. Young people today are the group that have probably been in the internet the longest.  But you are right at the end of the day don't be an asshole.

       Oh yeah if you're going to engage in team sports as anything but a spectator, don't be surprised when you get tackled!
      </p>
      <p>
       Political debate is not conspiracy theory. It's theater, or to keep with the sports motif, a football. And when it's picked up and thrown back and forth by frothing partisans, the real issues get missed.
      </p>

       I mean, I'm not American but one thing I have noticed is nobody discusses any policy... just who's gonna go to jail first, or who tweeted what about whom.

       The scary part about them all going to jail is at least now we kind of know what we are getting into with the devils we know.  If a whole bunch of new ones come in we don't know what we are going to get.

       I've never really understood this approach.  It always leads to trouble.  Case by case doesn't work here becayse there will always be the impression of being biased.  I'm ok with limiting accounts, but block them all, or block none.

       Not so much viewpoints as methods of arguing, which is how the shills differentiate themselves from everyone else. If you come in here spewing talking points calling other people a "Trumpet" when discussing an unrelated topic, or saying "not everyone who disagrees with you is a shill, REEEE!" when people are talking about the factual existence of shills, you're gonna get tossed.

       Good, but let's not pretend that Reddit is the bastion for free and open speech.  Posts are subject to the discretion of the moderators, and no offense to the moderators here, but that means the flow of information is subject to that same discretion.  I have no reason not to trust the mods here, but I would never know if they were actively preventing a certain topic or post from reaching us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Combating shills is a difficult thing to do.  I can't think of a better way to fight against polarization and shilling than to moderate the content here, but moderation requires discretion, and discretion is never perfect.

       I have suggested to mods to out a minimum 3 month ban to stop the abuse of throwaway accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a step further, I have suggested a minimum karma threshold as well for the same reason.

       This is a great idea. Those posting in good faith with accounts &lt;60 days appear welcome to contact the mods to approve their post. Seems very reasonable.

       The two month age restriction went into effect last night.
      </p>
      <p>
       Users in good standing who have requested approval via modmail will get their comments/posts approved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suggesting that the mods are selectively approving comments with political motivatios is disingenuous at best, and at worst is the same tired rhetoric employed by those who seems obsessed with fracturing the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the vast majority of spam comes from accounts that are 2 months old or less, so you may be surprised just how much this new policy will positively effort the discourse and content on this sub.

       will have the net effect of helping shills.  if they're any good at their job (and they're getting paid right, i'm sure they're told what they need to do) they'll have alts ready for just this kind of event.  so it doesn't really stop shills.  it stops people who want to spin up an account and make a comment.  the reasons for wanting to do such a thing you can imagine on your own.
