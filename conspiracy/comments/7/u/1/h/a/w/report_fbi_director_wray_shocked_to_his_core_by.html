    <div class="md"><p>It was expected that McCabe would step down in March, and since it&#39;s unclear why he stepped down yesterday, the pundits have been working overtime in their high octane speculation.</p>

<p>Some take this as evidence that Wray is &quot;cleaning house:&quot;</p>

<p>Further, the committee set a deadline of May 19 for Page to also supply: “A list of all meetings of which you are aware between any individual with the Trump campaign and any Russian official or representative of Russian business interests which took place between June 16, 2015, and January 20, 2017. For each meeting listed please include the date, location, and all individuals present.”</p>

<p>By the same deadline, the committee demanded: “All communications records, including electronic communications records such as e-mail or text messages, written correspondence, and phone records of communications which took place between June 16, 2015, and January 20, 2017, to which you and any Russian official or representative of Russian business interests was a party.</p>

<p>“All communications records, including electronic communications records such as e-mail or text message, written correspondence, and phone records, of communications related in any way to Russia, conducted between you and members and advisors of the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>“All information regarding your financial and real estate holdings related to Russia between June 16, 2015, and January 20, 2017, including those financial securities or real estate holdings which you sold or from which you divested in that time period.”</p>

<p>Similar information requests reportedly have been sent to other Trump campaign advisers, including Roger Stone, Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn.</p>

<p>Given the extent of Page’s dealings in Russia, which included having lived there for several years, the broad information demand amounts to a perjury trap because even if Page tried his best to supply all the personal, phone and email contacts, he would be sure to miss something or someone, thus setting him up for prosecution for obstructing an investigation or lying to investigators.</p>

<p>Also, since the Obama administration reportedly obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant against Page last summer, the U.S. government may well have more complete records of Page’s contacts and communications than he would, thus putting him into even greater legal jeopardy for an omission.</p>

<p>The FISA warrant was allegedly obtained, in part, because of a speech that Page delivered in Russia on July 7, 2016, that was mildly critical of U.S. foreign policy toward the countries of the former Soviet Union. Beginning in late July, that FBI investigation then expanded into a much wider probe of people connected to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign with possible links to Russia</p>

How is Trump draining the swamp? By filling cabinet positions with Steven Mnuchin (OneWest Bank), Wilbur Ross (N M Rothschild &amp; Sons), Rex Tillerson (ExxonMobil), Mike Pompeo (former CIA Director) or Betsy DeVos (connections to Amway and Academi/Blackwater)? Is that what we need, more bankers and oil tycoons in positions of power?</p>

<p>The Clintons, the Bushes, and Trump are all the same, none of them give a shit about you and will do whatever will make them and their corporate donors more money, even if countless people will suffer, this sub used to understand this until a bunch of Trump supporters like you started using this sub as TD 2.0, this sub was never full of pro-Obama or pro-Clinton posts, yet you guys claim that everyone else is the shill.

<p>That was 100% for my own entertainment in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, I&#39;m not proud to say. I&#39;d never say that in this sub, because I do see it as divisive. But I legitimately do see what is happening with the FBI and the DOJ as draining the swamp. This exactly the sort of Deep State corruption we have been referring to.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t you just accept that many people disagree with you on this, without calling us &quot;brainless Trump supporters?&quot; I don&#39;t think Trump is the same as Clinton/Bush/Obama, and I&#39;ve honestly explained why probably a hundred times.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am 100% serious when I say that he has been exceeding my expectations so far. I really don&#39;t understand what you guys hate about his so much, besides his blunt way of speaking. My only guess is that its the massive amount of propaganda that has been going on for over a year now. Nobody wants to believe that they are influenced by propaganda, but there can be no doubt that its effective.</p>

<p>relax. sometimes sarcasm is healthy. wait til the memo drops and we will see a portion of the deepstate revealed.</p>

<p>Other than that, I&#39;ve spent the last year and a half debating with both sides, trying to find unity and middle ground, and have realized that the hive mind in r/politics wont even discuss, debate, look at facts or consider things. I used to be a democrat, but what that side has descended into is beyond hope at this point, it would just be better for it all to collapse and start from scratch </p>

Rod Rosenstein approved to extend surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. James Comey, bureau, Andrew McCabe and Rod Rosenstein are officially named in the “shocking” FISA abuse memo.</p>

<p>You mean negotiating sanctions and policy with a hostile government while another administration is in office, in exchange for dirt about one of the candidates running for president, and then after winning, doing everything possible to appease this country, which has stated goals of doing all it can to harm the US and NATO?</p>

<p>Oh, also, how about the administration those men were working for burning Israeli and Dutch intelligence sources to the Russians? Because that&#39;s really good for our country and our standing internationally.</p>

<p>Sure I think Hillary broke the law and should&#39;ve gotten into trouble for her actions. &quot;I didn&#39;t know C meant &#39;classified&#39;&quot; is about the most bullshit excuse I&#39;ve ever heard, but there&#39;s a huge difference between being careless with classified materials and working with a hostile government to influence our elections, and then rewarding that government by not punishing them, when your own CIA chief is acknowledging they influenced our elections, and are planning on continuing to do so in the future.</p>

<p>My favorite part about all of this - the GOP line that &quot;it was really the Dems and Christopher Steele working with the Russians and paying them&quot;. Okay, so if that&#39;s true, then wouldn&#39;t you want to punish Russians for spreading &quot;false&quot; info? Wouldn&#39;t you want to punish them for &quot;working with&quot; the DNC?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>First and foremast, we have seen plenty. Second, the reason we don&#39;t have a &quot;smoking gun&quot; or all the info is simple - it&#39;s a fucking FBI investigation, run by one of the most qualified, best investigators you could possibly ask to do the job. When all the info Mueller has is one day released (hopefully), everyone&#39;s going to look back and realize how obvious this all was.</p>

<p>Again, let me repeat what I said before - the NSA (!!!!) Michael Flynn, the Campaign Manager Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, and Foreign Policy Advisor George Papadapolous have all been indicted or are cooperating with the investigation. Some of the charges right now may not look like they have to do with the election, but it&#39;s all part of the same investigation, and there will be more charges for these individuals. Plus, Flynn and Papadoplous pleaded to a much lesser charge of &quot;lying to the FBI&quot; because they are cooperating with the investigation. Take a step back and look at those names and their roles in the Trump campaign, and then tell me that an investigator flips the NSA and doesn&#39;t have a higher target in mind. What info would Mueller want out of Flynn that he&#39;s willing to strike a deal with him? Flynn&#39;s only boss was Trump, there&#39;s no one else he can sell out or provide info against.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Mueller investigation isn&#39;t just focusing on the election and possible meddling by the Russians, but is going much deeper into Trump&#39;s finances and the money laundering he&#39;s been doing for the Russian Mafia for close to 2 decades. The first people Mueller hired were investigators famous for going after money launderers and with experience in mafia/rico type investigations.</p>

<p>Finally, for anyone that really thinks there&#39;s nothing to Trump-Russia (negating the fact that Trump all but literally kisses Putin&#39;s ass any chance he gets), take the words of the Trumps themselves:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, <strong>Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets</strong>; say in Dubai, and <strong>certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York</strong>. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia. There&#39;s indeed a lot of money coming for new-builds and resale reflecting a trend in the Russian economy and, of course, the weak dollar versus the ruble.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don Jr. admits it in 2008, and Trump SoHo is a major part of the investigation.</p>

<p>These investigations take time, most FBI investigations of this nature take <em>years</em>. I wouldn&#39;t expect any recommendation for charges against Trump for at least 6 months to a year. However, Kushner, Don Jr, Sessions, and others are probably going to be indicted relatively soon.</p>

<p>Bullshit.</p>

<p>If Flynn has only plead guilty to lying to the investigators, he can still be charged with any other crime he admits to.</p>

<p>These sorts of plea deals work like this. Someone murders someone else. The murderer&#39;s friend was at the scene and helped cover it up.</p>

<p>That friend pleads guilty to a crime directly relating to the murder, for example &quot;accessory after the fact&quot;, in order to be able to testify against the murderer.</p>

<p>If that friend pleads guilty to some unrelated crime, then admits to having helped cover up a murder, he can then be charged with the murder. No lawyer with any sort of brain would allow that.</p>

<p>If Flynn plead guilty to lying to investigators, its because they did not have any more serious charge to file against him. His lawyer will have made it clear to him that admitting to any other crime would result in prosecution and conviction.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why nothing else has come of it.</p>

<p>I can see your point - it&#39;s either a &quot;nothing-burger&quot; (though given that there&#39;s now another tape that backs up the Steele dossier, I think that&#39;s unlikely), or it&#39;s a massive massive deal one way or another. Right now I&#39;m leaning towards it being much more of a big deal for the GOP.</p>

<p>With that said, I&#39;m not from the US (I&#39;m from <del>Macedonia</del> <strong>the UK</strong>), and most of my understanding of it comes from Twitter, forums, and r/politics, but I like to think I&#39;m a fairly independent thinker.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re building a big case, you&#39;ll keep as schtum as possible on it until it&#39;s important. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing has been leaked or shown to us however</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My (personal, but informed largely by Seth Abramson) take on this, is that they&#39;re just a lot better at not leaking than <em>some</em> other people.</p>

<p>Case in point: George Papadopoulos was co-operating with the Trump-Russia investigation from July last year, and this wasn&#39;t made public until October, when it had to as part of his plea-bargain. That&#39;s almost three months.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to be skeptical of all your news sources, as there are always financial interests and vested interests at play, but there are good journalists out there. Shep Smith seems alright (from what little I&#39;ve seen of him), but I&#39;ve not seen much else on Fox that gives me confidence. Who&#39;s worth watching?</p>

<p>For the record, I&#39;m in the UK rather than USA, but Rachel Maddow seems fairly sharp.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel is a rogue state that acts on its own volition, greatly harming relations in the area, and we let them get away with it. While the country has a right to defend itself, unless it gives Palestine autonomy, it has a right to provide for those people as well and does not.</p>

<p>I fully acknowledge and understand the US is a fucked up place, but there&#39;s no arguing that the standard of living is better here than it is in Russia, and that we are awarded more freedoms than the Russian people. While greed and money play a huge role in controlling our elected officials, we have nowhere close to the level of corruption that Russia has. Not to mention that the Russian Mafia is essentially state sanctioned and operates closely with the FSB.</p>

<p>which has stated goals of doing all it can to harm the US and NATO?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do you have to so blatantly lie? Russia does <em>not</em> have such &quot;stated goals&quot;... in fact the complete opposite.</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t you make your argument without filling it with untruths?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, also, how about the administration those men were working for burning Israeli and Dutch intelligence sources to the Russians?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that something like the time the Israelis sold the Russians classified US technology? Geopolitics is a big boys game. I&#39;m sure the Israelis can more than handle themselves on the field.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but there&#39;s a huge difference between being careless with classified materials and working with a hostile government to influence our elections</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean like hiring an ex-spy to travel to Russia and talk to &quot;confidential informants&quot; to produce a dossier of dirt on your political opponent?</p>

<p>Or is it only bad if Trump does it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when your own CIA chief is acknowledging they influenced our elections, and are planning on continuing to do so in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, if <em>anyone</em> knows about influencing another country&#39;s elections, it&#39;s the CIA! But that&#39;s different, right? Apparently Trump is a criminal for not being a hypocrite.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Okay, so if that&#39;s true, then wouldn&#39;t you want to punish Russians for spreading &quot;false&quot; info? Wouldn&#39;t you want to punish them for &quot;working with&quot; the DNC?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe the current admin is a little more grown up, and realises that the game the Russia and the US are playing is following rules the US itself laid down. Maybe the current admit sees that escalating the situation this time, will only give Russia more cause to escalate the situation when the roles are once again, inevitably, reversed.</p>

<p>The US has been attempting to influence Russian elections for decades. If the Russians escalated the situation every time the US was caught doing it, we&#39;d be living in a radioactive dust bowl by now.</p>

<p>Now tell me... why are Democrats so desperate to stoke the flames of war against Russia?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In April 2016, the authors writing as &quot;Durden&quot; on the website were reported by Bloomberg News to be Ivandjiiski, Tim Backshall (a credit derivatives strategist), and Colin Lokey. Lokey, the newest member revealed himself and the other two when he left the site.[1] Ivandjiiski confirmed that the three men &quot;had been the only Tyler Durdens on the payroll&quot; since Lokey joined the site in 2015.[1] Former Zero Hedge writer Colin Lokey said that he was pressured to frame issues in a way he felt was &quot;disingenuous,&quot; summarizing its political stances as &quot;Russia=good. Obama=idiot. Bashar al-Assad=benevolent leader. John Kerry=dunce. Vladimir Putin=greatest leader in the history of statecraft.&quot;[1] Zero Hedge founder Daniel Ivandjiiski, in response, said that Lokey could write &quot;anything and everything he wanted directly without anyone writing over it.&quot;[1] <em>On leaving, Lokey said: &quot;I can&#39;t be a 24-hour cheerleader for Hezbollah, Moscow, Tehran, Beijing, and Trump anymore. It&#39;s wrong. Period. I know it gets you views now, but it will kill your brand over the long run. This isn&#39;t a revolution. It&#39;s a joke.&quot;[1]</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post will get a lot of partisan attention. I really dont care what side of the political spectrum people are on, but one thing is clear to me:  Faith and trust in government is eroding fast.  Each team might think they are scoring points and winning the political battle, but the reality is, neither side is going to win and we are all going to lose.</p>

<p>If we think that by exposing corruption is going to save the government, we are wrong.  Exposing corruption will destroy the government because it is destroying faith and confidence in government and without faith and confidence, the government is illegitimate.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, however, the governments corruption must be exposed even if that means the end of the government. </p>

<p>So carry on Trump and Hillary shills. Keep playing your fun little game while you can because you are both working toward the same result and it will be a result you will not like. </p>
