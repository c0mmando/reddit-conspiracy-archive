        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is this place really so saturated with evangelical propaganda now, or is this some sort of response to challenging the Patriarchy?  </p>

<p>I can understand a stance against pornography, pedophilia (obviously!), sex trafficking, overt sexual content in entertainment and the rise of apps like Grindr and Tinder, but how does the LGBTQ community get swept into that category? </p>

<p>Why are there multiple users who are accusing people who &quot;defend&quot; or explain the queer culture of being pedophiles? </p>

<p>There are many people here who seem to understand this is the fundamental illogical jump of the Pizzagate theory, that gay/artistic humor is being perceived as pedophile covert conversations. </p>

<p>I expect your downvotes, but I appreciate anyone who wants to discuss this trend. TY.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well. this is just my personal conspiracy. The large uptick in overtly anti-Semitic and generally bigoted, divisive posts is so any people just checking out the sub think this is just T_Dv2 and discredit everything and anything that comes out of the sub. And damn, it&#39;s effective. It really sucks, this sub has a really excellent mix of everything, from truther-trollers to loony never-globers. The politics are relatively matched, organically that is.</p>

<p>So, while some posts you may see that are rather off putting are real posts, usually they&#39;re spam to derail people and get a rise. The names and patterns stick out realllllly quickly when you see it.</p>

<p>As a member of that &quot;brigade,&quot; if you must call it that, I do downvote any posts about anti-Semitism because I see them as nothing more than an attempt to silence those who want to discuss very real issues associated with Judaism and Zionism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what you are seeing is a push back against some of the loud SJW voices from the LBGT community, that have grown louder still in since the election. Trans in particular has really been pushed towards a more normative status in line with the rest of the LBG recently and I think there are still a lot of general misconceptions about trans people. There are also some people who wish to push the limits and normalize things like pederasty and &quot;non contact&quot; pedophilia. That is a small minority of people, but they exist and if you spend any time on twitter/tumbler you are likely to see such things. Coupled with the paradigm shift towards conservatism in the US it makes sense there would be a push back against so called &quot;degeneracy&quot;. I agree with what you&#39;re saying in that its not really logical to lump people into a monolith and label it (good or bad)... but I also understand why people would be inclined to do so.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes most people aren&#39;t militant SJW lunatics nor are they fascist white nationalists. There are plenty of people on all sides of the spectrum that have started railing against the lunacy of identity politics run amok. People on the right love to find the most outrageous examples of things they disagree with and hold that up as an example of whats wrong with the left.... same with leftists who screech about everyone being a Nazi. Same shit different ideology. In reality most people are in the middle and substantially more reasonable than all the tumbler edge lords.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something I have found difficult is separating the extremists out due to the amount of noise they make. </p>

<p>I live in a rural community as well, but it is only about an hour from one of the counties bluest cities. As a result we have a decent mix of opinions. I have heard some pretty racist/sexist/homophobic rhetoric around here, but I have also heard strait up communist talking points in casual conversation and some pretty extreme views on &quot;white cis privilege&quot;. I&#39;ve been called a disgusting centrist by people I considered friends a few times lol. Funny they never bother to ask me were I stand they just assumed because I don&#39;t subscribe to hyper polarized view of everything. Sadly I have pretty much given up having any kind of rational conversation about politics, gender, race, ect with anyone but the most trusted of friends and naturally strangers online. </p>

<p>I suspect people will calm down over the next couple years when the world doesn&#39;t end/become a utopia because muh&#39; Trump. </p>

<p>I would say my views haven&#39;t changed much in the last couple years but it sure feels like I&#39;ve all of a sudden been labeled by both sides as the other when it suits them.        </p>

<p>First of all with Christianity, the reaffirmation of Hebrew law, the omnipotence of God, the role of women, the duty of men, the amount of dogma that revolves around shame and the use/ownership of the body, the possession of peoples, land, materials and cultures, the numerous wars and genocides in its name and most recently, the push by radical right evangelicals that completely police the body through legislation, yet also allow immoral banking, environmental and liberties to all be abused.

<p>I would imagine most &quot;transphobic&quot; content you read is not actually &quot;transphobic&quot; but rather reasonable people voicing concern over an extremely new, and challenging phenomenon.  If you&#39;re holding a hammer, everything looks like a nail and any word with &quot;phobic&quot; at the end is not meant to start a discussion, but rather to hammer the opposing viewpoint into silence. </p>

<p>You also have no presented absolutely no cases that support your initial claim, which reinforces my belief that you just want to start a fight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a response to feminism, not a rise in the number of trans people, clandestine or not. I guarantee you have met someone passing and never realized. The real issue is male possession of &quot;lustful thoughts&quot; as transference to the celebrity. You don&#39;t posses a famous person, nor are they imposing their sexuality on you. You consume the product of entertainment or media. This mentality is the direct influence of porn programming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t really disagree with anything there.  The porn industry is full of inverted people as well.  I know for sure you are right about passing by people and having no idea.  I work with someone who a few year ago was a man and has done the full transition.  He got his Adam&#39;s apple shaved and is doing all the stuff and is very passable.  I guy guy started in my group and had no idea.</p>

<p>The thing is though there is a differnce between the type of transgender that most people think about.  These are pople who transitioned sometime in their life and the ones who are transitioned beginning in the womb by their parents.  This creates a kind of human freemartin that comes out with the other gender&#39;s parts.  Those are the clandestine ones I&#39;m more talking about and what I think Hollywood elites are into.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have wondered about the rise of Trans issue going to front page news as well. It’s been pretty sudden, seeming more like a trendy issue. But I do have some friends who work for community resources for LGBT youth, and those kids definitely face a disproportionate amount of strife in their lives as a result. Many are homeless and forced into lifestyles they would never have chosen for themselves just to get by. I suppose, in the end if we can raise awareness to this issue and help kids have a better life as a result, it’s not a bad thing. Regardless of whether it is biology or someone just has things mixed up in their head, no one should have to struggle just to get by as a result. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>open homosexual behavior (like a gay parade in the middle of a city, or prolonged promotion and normalization of it in the msm) is inflamatory and threatening to any normal and healthy society and normal and healthy individuals respond accordingly.  its a simple action-reaction mechanism.  </p>

<p>anyone with family or with plans of having a family in the future acts out of self preservation and self interest when combating public displays of homosexuality.  everyone knows that if their children turn out homosexual, due to these abnormal influences, they will lose all hope of having grandchildren, meaning they will be removed from the gene-pool.  </p>

<p>it is also viewed as a societal gateway &#39;drug&#39; to pederasty, paedofilia, rape, necrophilia and all the other deviations and fetishes, which will certainly doom even the strongest society in the long run.</p>

<p>the gay and trans movement broke the unspoken and ancient golden rule and even the &#39;live and let live&#39; principle formed during the sexual revolution which was caused by the introduction of the anti-baby pill.</p>

<p>iow, it is resisted for its life-threatening effects and artificial support by tptb.</p>

i am, of course, against throwing people off roofs and whatever is going on in chechnya as i am also against ‘strait sex stuff’ in all those places that you listed.  i wish the world to be way, way, way less sexualized than it is, regardless of orientation.</p>
