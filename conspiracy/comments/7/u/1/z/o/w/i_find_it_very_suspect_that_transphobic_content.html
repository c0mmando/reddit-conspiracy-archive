       Is this place really so saturated with evangelical propaganda now, or is this some sort of response to challenging the Patriarchy?
      </p>
      <p>
       I can understand a stance against pornography, pedophilia (obviously!), sex trafficking, overt sexual content in entertainment and the rise of apps like Grindr and Tinder, but how does the LGBTQ community get swept into that category?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are there multiple users who are accusing people who "defend" or explain the queer culture of being pedophiles?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many people here who seem to understand this is the fundamental illogical jump of the Pizzagate theory, that gay/artistic humor is being perceived as pedophile covert conversations.

       I expect your downvotes, but I appreciate anyone who wants to discuss this trend. TY.

       it's the Patriarchy, yo.  c'mon!  get with the program.  it's the feminist's big Theory of Everything - Men!  don't think too hard about it, might not fit all the data and you might find yourself creating even more absurd enhancements to the core thesis to shoehorn in the gaps, which every increasingly pop up like that finger in the dyke theory (aptly named!).

       yes that's exactly what Patriarchy is.  a false model that's obviously false, and is used as the basis, incorrectly, to analyze a problem domain.

       The fact that you're looking at the duality as
       <em>
        male vs female
       </em>
       and not
       <em>
        oligarchy vs plebeian
       </em>
       is indicative that you adhere to the model.

       Yes, in the sense of days of viewership and the resulting community downvoting ignorant discussion. I'm talking about the immediate voting (which indicates multiple people/alts being present in a short time) and really, the fact that many here may downvote, but they don't refute or verbally reject the content.

       well. this is just my personal conspiracy. The large uptick in overtly anti-Semitic and generally bigoted, divisive posts is so any people just checking out the sub think this is just T_Dv2 and discredit everything and anything that comes out of the sub. And damn, it's effective. It really sucks, this sub has a really excellent mix of everything, from truther-trollers to loony never-globers. The politics are relatively matched, organically that is.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, while some posts you may see that are rather off putting are real posts, usually they're spam to derail people and get a rise. The names and patterns stick out realllllly quickly when you see it.

       As a member of that "brigade," if you must call it that, I do downvote any posts about anti-Semitism because I see them as nothing more than an attempt to silence those who want to discuss very real issues associated with Judaism and Zionism.

       I think what you are seeing is a push back against some of the loud SJW voices from the LBGT community, that have grown louder still in since the election. Trans in particular has really been pushed towards a more normative status in line with the rest of the LBG recently and I think there are still a lot of general misconceptions about trans people. There are also some people who wish to push the limits and normalize things like pederasty and "non contact" pedophilia. That is a small minority of people, but they exist and if you spend any time on twitter/tumbler you are likely to see such things. Coupled with the paradigm shift towards conservatism in the US it makes sense there would be a push back against so called "degeneracy". I agree with what you're saying in that its not really logical to lump people into a monolith and label it (good or bad)... but I also understand why people would be inclined to do so.

       Thank you for this response. But within the LGBTQ community and much of these YouTube/Tumblr teens, there's definitely a vocal push against the SWJ, Indivisible and other neurotically-liberal folks. The average Women's Marcher is not an SWJ.

       Yes most people aren't militant SJW lunatics nor are they fascist white nationalists. There are plenty of people on all sides of the spectrum that have started railing against the lunacy of identity politics run amok. People on the right love to find the most outrageous examples of things they disagree with and hold that up as an example of whats wrong with the left.... same with leftists who screech about everyone being a Nazi. Same shit different ideology. In reality most people are in the middle and substantially more reasonable than all the tumbler edge lords.

       Something I have found difficult is separating the extremists out due to the amount of noise they make.
      </p>
      <p>
       I live in a rural community as well, but it is only about an hour from one of the counties bluest cities. As a result we have a decent mix of opinions. I have heard some pretty racist/sexist/homophobic rhetoric around here, but I have also heard strait up communist talking points in casual conversation and some pretty extreme views on "white cis privilege". I've been called a disgusting centrist by people I considered friends a few times lol. Funny they never bother to ask me were I stand they just assumed because I don't subscribe to hyper polarized view of everything. Sadly I have pretty much given up having any kind of rational conversation about politics, gender, race, ect with anyone but the most trusted of friends and naturally strangers online.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect people will calm down over the next couple years when the world doesn't end/become a utopia because muh' Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say my views haven't changed much in the last couple years but it sure feels like I've all of a sudden been labeled by both sides as the other when it suits them.

       I don't care what people do to themselves, with their own money, and in private. I'm against it being pushed on the public so overtly, though. And it is pushed, primarily through Jewish media, along with adultery and other forms of degenerate behavior. This has been an ongoing problem for over a century, and many see it as a tool used to destroy the moral fabric of society. This furthers the goals of the NWO.

       First of all with Christianity, the reaffirmation of Hebrew law, the omnipotence of God, the role of women, the duty of men, the amount of dogma that revolves around shame and the use/ownership of the body, the possession of peoples, land, materials and cultures, the numerous wars and genocides in its name and most recently, the push by radical right evangelicals that completely police the body through legislation, yet also allow immoral banking, environmental and liberties to all be abused.

       See how the word Trans engages a specific person, very quickly? Notice not many in this sub want to discuss the pervasive sexual discrimination of women and will now recoil if I even mention the word Feminism.

       None of that is applicable to each other, though.  You're just mishmashing pet causes and making no point at all.  I don't think you really have a strong enough grasp of theology to make a cogent criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would imagine most "transphobic" content you read is not actually "transphobic" but rather reasonable people voicing concern over an extremely new, and challenging phenomenon.  If you're holding a hammer, everything looks like a nail and any word with "phobic" at the end is not meant to start a discussion, but rather to hammer the opposing viewpoint into silence.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also have no presented absolutely no cases that support your initial claim, which reinforces my belief that you just want to start a fight.

         Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponent's argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues.

       I find it suspicious that trans issues in general are on the rise and they are leading to actual free speech killing laws being passed on “gender pronoun” usage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trans people make up less than 0.3% of the population yet somehow their “issues” are front and center on the Democrat platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if anyone says anything to protest these new free speech killing laws, the Democrats use these same trans people they purport to represent as human victim shields.

       Government and entertainment are full of secret transgenders that are part of a cult that worships the Baphomet.  Michelle Obama is one of the most obvious transgenders recently but most A list celebs have been since you were born.  The current transgender propaganda and political agenda is just to normalize their cult's practices.  There are way more than you think:

       This is a response to feminism, not a rise in the number of trans people, clandestine or not. I guarantee you have met someone passing and never realized. The real issue is male possession of "lustful thoughts" as transference to the celebrity. You don't posses a famous person, nor are they imposing their sexuality on you. You consume the product of entertainment or media. This mentality is the direct influence of porn programming.

       I can't really disagree with anything there.  The porn industry is full of inverted people as well.  I know for sure you are right about passing by people and having no idea.  I work with someone who a few year ago was a man and has done the full transition.  He got his Adam's apple shaved and is doing all the stuff and is very passable.  I guy guy started in my group and had no idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is though there is a differnce between the type of transgender that most people think about.  These are pople who transitioned sometime in their life and the ones who are transitioned beginning in the womb by their parents.  This creates a kind of human freemartin that comes out with the other gender's parts.  Those are the clandestine ones I'm more talking about and what I think Hollywood elites are into.

       It's what the elite Baphomet worshiping cult do to their kids.  They blast them with hormones in utero and they come out with working (kind of) parts of the opposite sex.  It's their religion.

       I have wondered about the rise of Trans issue going to front page news as well. It’s been pretty sudden, seeming more like a trendy issue. But I do have some friends who work for community resources for LGBT youth, and those kids definitely face a disproportionate amount of strife in their lives as a result. Many are homeless and forced into lifestyles they would never have chosen for themselves just to get by. I suppose, in the end if we can raise awareness to this issue and help kids have a better life as a result, it’s not a bad thing. Regardless of whether it is biology or someone just has things mixed up in their head, no one should have to struggle just to get by as a result.

       The backlash you're seeing is from the LGBTQATSGAXXX lobby pushing harmful drugs, surgery, and sexual deviancy on children. Many people think this is mental and physical abuse. For a good write-up on this position, read this from the ACPeds:

       open homosexual behavior (like a gay parade in the middle of a city, or prolonged promotion and normalization of it in the msm) is inflamatory and threatening to any normal and healthy society and normal and healthy individuals respond accordingly.  its a simple action-reaction mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyone with family or with plans of having a family in the future acts out of self preservation and self interest when combating public displays of homosexuality.  everyone knows that if their children turn out homosexual, due to these abnormal influences, they will lose all hope of having grandchildren, meaning they will be removed from the gene-pool.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is also viewed as a societal gateway 'drug' to pederasty, paedofilia, rape, necrophilia and all the other deviations and fetishes, which will certainly doom even the strongest society in the long run.
      </p>
      <p>
       the gay and trans movement broke the unspoken and ancient golden rule and even the 'live and let live' principle formed during the sexual revolution which was caused by the introduction of the anti-baby pill.

       Being exposed to gay and lesbian persons does not make anyone gay. Someone else being gay does not hurt your fertility or ability to get married. There is no reason to fight against or oppress someone who has literally no impact on the way you conduct your life.

       children at a young age are infinitely impressionable. they view others, but especially adults as role models and perceive their behaviours and otheer qualities as valuable input in forming their own worldview and social norms.
      </p>
      <p>
       they have no firm concepts of right and wrong and tend to go along with adult agenda without even voicing an articulate concern.  silence however is not a sign of consent.
      </p>
      <p>
       all this results in untold emotional abuse and hardship for the children.

       Gay parents don’t raise gay children at a higher rate of strait parents, though they do raise children that aren’t homophobic. And strait parents can raise gay children, which has been seen throughout history, despite cultural acceptance of gay persons.

       I’m very normal. And the experience was very real. As it turns out, someone else’s sexuality does not really have an impact on anyone else. My being strait does not hurt gay people and vice versa.

       I have lived a run of the mill, happy life. I have my own successful business. Made good grades, went to college. Have only ever been in long term, loving relationships. Have long term friends who are supportive and successful too. It’s crazy how easy life is when from free from the bizarre stressors of being caught up on others sexuality.

       And yet you mind the business of others. I can kiss my partner in public and no would say shit, but you would cry “gay Agenda” is a gay person did the same things the rest of us did. It’s a double standard. If we all just let people live and do their thing, none of this is an issue.... and the kids will be alright.

       depends what kind of kiss.  i am going to kiss in public, yes, but it will be a simple kiss of affection not what you can see at mardi gras, thats for the photgraphers and press and just for display - for a show, acting it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       whether i will react will depend what kind of kiss i see.  if they hold their hands i dont mind so much. what i am saying there are limitations to tolerance and there should be limitations for it.
       <br/>
       i am, of course, against throwing people off roofs and whatever is going on in chechnya as i am also against ‘strait sex stuff’ in all those places that you listed.  i wish the world to be way, way, way less sexualized than it is, regardless of orientation.

       Your understanding of homosexuality in history isn't great, shit even in ancient Greece it used to be much more integrated part of society. Look up the Sacred Band of Thebes, which was 150 pairs of gay lovers that were sworn to fight and protect each other in battle. Can you ever imagine stuff like that today?

       yes you are right, there is no golden rule about homosexuality because the golden rule has nothing to do with it, its about a basic moral principle.

       | Is this place really so saturated with evangelical propaganda now, or is this some sort of response to challenging the Patriarchy?

       I'm not a religious guy and I'm not anti-trans. I just don't want to know about your sex life or medical challenges any more than you want to know about mine. I down to respect anyone for the person they are, but if the only way you can define yourself is as a "trans person" then you're not bringing much to the table in a non-trans sub.

       that goes to the heart of it... "why would anyone care if they weren't?"   So simple: stay out of a debate that doesn't matter to them.

       As a non-"evangelical", the people being targeted are my concern.    Please don't target "evangelicals", since I rather not have to speak up for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion the "evangelicals" posting here have not been sincere.   One here even confessing to it.  And then called me a "jew" and left the thread.  Or mod stepped in?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that that rise of "evangelical" churches is a bigger conspiracy.  Spreading hate in the name of Jesus via mass media has led to massive traditional church attendance decreases.

       I'm not a big fan of labels and I'm not sure how particularly accurate they are when it comes to predicting behavior. This sub attracts all sorts of people, each walking their own path, many times experiencing completely different realities than one another. People may identify as one religion or ideology or another and they play the part of someone that has made that choice, but then maybe they'll change their mind and make a different choice.

       The reality to them, and to you, is all the same. It's early; there is still time to become that person you can't begin to understand now. It happens to a lot of us.

       I've noticed it too, and some claim it's not transphobia but they're concerned about them, which is utter bullshit, because they want them to be ostracized.  Oh, and they think if a person is gay or trans they must be pedophiles.
