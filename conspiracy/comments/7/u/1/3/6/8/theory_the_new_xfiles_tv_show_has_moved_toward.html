    <div class="md"><p>So that&#39;s why The Simpsons went all slapstick and nonsense. Because of the derp state conspiracy.</p>

<p>Or it could be due to Flanderization where characters become parodies of themselves which is a well known tv trope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There has always been one &quot;funny&quot; episode per season. There weren&#39;t any before last week and there likely won&#39;t be any more for the next two months before it ends.</p>

<p>Not a lot of people are watching. It lost a ton of viewership by sucking so bad last year. I don&#39;t think &quot;X Files&quot; carries much traction with society any more on any level but entertainment. Reality is too persuasive. </p>

Rubs in your face the absolute mastery of cover-up by mass confusion / ridicule playing off the human primal weakness of fear of ostrization from the social group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was brilliant. It used the &#39;unreliable narrator&#39; ploy to a very amusing and enlightening degree -- what <em>CAN</em> we believe anymore? This is our informational landscape now. It goes way beyond &#39;fake news&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not retarded, it&#39;s a hat tip to the old shows like The Outer Limits and The Twilight Zone -- some of them <em>were</em> that cheesy. What the show brilliantly did was make you look at that diner scene and say, &quot;Wait a minute! This can&#39;t be real? This is too silly to be real!&quot; and then they showed you, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just Mulder watching an old Outer Limits&quot; so your butt can unclench and you relax a bit and then they take a swipe themselves and at the old conspiracy talk of &quot;They&quot; (TPTB) and they bring up a ridiculous premise that it&#39;s a &quot;Dr. They&quot; who looks cartoonishly/Outer Limitsy evil with the purple eye mask effect ~ with a glorious montage that lets them not only reminisce about old x-files episodes, but reinvent them as a result of the Mandela effect (&quot;real&quot; ~ at least what we call it)/Mengele effect (&quot;fake&quot; ~ nobody calls it that... until now). And when they show Mulder back in the day they don&#39;t even attempt to get a kid to play him - they just stick his current head on a child&#39;s body. That&#39;s brilliant. That&#39;s not only clever, but it&#39;s also more hat tipping to an unreliable narrator; can we really believe his memories if it&#39;s really just his recall and not his actual memory that we&#39;re looking at?</p>

<p>Robert Anton Wilson wrote a book called &quot;The Illuminatus&quot; where he keeps getting you to believe something and then later he&#39;ll debunk it in his own book or get you to believe something else. He&#39;s doing it on purpose. He&#39;s trying to teach you not to trust everything you hear. This is the same thing. We&#39;re in a crazy informational landscape where we don&#39;t know what to believe anymore. Now if you&#39;re divorced from actual facts then what matters anymore? Can you find something that still matters? Who you are maybe... how you treat people... what frequency you project. It&#39;s all you have left.</p>

<p>(Bonus: Here&#39;s something even weirder: old UFO accounts were just as weird as the old Outer Limits episodes! Before people saw the grays they saw turnip monsters, terrible boxy robots, and UFOs that look like dumb models that we used to think were futuristic; look up the Flatwoods Monster. It&#39;s ridiculous! Does that mean all those people who interacted with UFOs were just imagining it? No, they were presented with a visual that they could comprehend. Just as the people in the bible were presented with &quot;angels&quot; ~ because it made sense to them at the time. This is all about consciousness.)</p>

<p>The derp state got to them. It&#39;s a conspiracy! Or it&#39;s just bad writing that most shows suffer from, you ever see the shit on Netflix? Nope, that makes too much sense. </p>

<p>This has to be due to the deep machinations of the global elite shadow brokers. Only they can control the masses by cleverly convincing producers to cut costs (and increase their own profits) by hiring shitty writers. It&#39;s a conspiracy!</p>
