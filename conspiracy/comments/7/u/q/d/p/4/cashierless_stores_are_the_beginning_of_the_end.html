        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I edited this to get my point across a bit better.</p>

<p>Attention: this is about the Amazon Go store in Oregon, which happens to be the only store of its kind in the nation, maybe the world. The only way you can get into the store is by scanning a code on your phone, which in turn is the way you will end up paying because the code is tied to your card. There are no cash transactions whatsoever.</p>

<p>My main concern with this is privacy, and here is why:</p>

<p>There is no way to anonymously purchase items here even if you tried. There are hundreds of cameras packed into this small store so they know exactly what you look like. The absence of cash payment makes it impossible to pay anonymously. They want to know exactly who you are at all times. </p>

<p>This is alerting to me because this could evolve into something much more intrusive. Potentially evolving into finger print scanning and eye scanning (5-10 yrs from now) in order to access the store/purchase goods. </p>

<p>The problem doesnt lie with the fact that there arent cashiers, the problem lies with the invasion of privacy that occurs.</p>

<p>In the past, payment with cards have switched to chips, now phones with this method. And of course this will evolve into something bigger. Essentially making cash obsolete. Which will make anonymous payments obsolete in the long run.</p>

<p>People these days will buy into any idea that is fast and efficient without question, which will probably be the reason why this will become very successful for Amazon. Which will in turn eventually make stores like these more common than stores with actual employees.</p>

<p>Cashier-less Stores are The Beginning of The End To OUR Privacy.</p>

<p>Edit:
btw why is noone upvoting this? i feel like everyone in this sub-reddit should see this. </p>

<p>Boiled down, it means an attempt to use the combination of psychology, statistics, social science and recent history to come up with an, hopefully, accurate future prediction of coming events. Sort of a best guess, based on <em>some</em> facts, on the near future. Fortune telling using the excuse of that there are facts to support the predictions. In reality, psychohistory is a good guess and nothing more, but it is used by some people to try to sound more intelligent and/or important than they really are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty ok with it. I&#39;m basically cashless as it is and on the rare occasion where I&#39;m in a store paying cash, I insist on a tax invoice. I have noticed though, that Australia is far more cashless than pretty much any other country and we&#39;re generally a lot quicker to adopt new payment technology than other countries. We&#39;ve been using chips on our cards since pre 2004 and got rid of signatures for credit card transactions around 2012. </p>

<p>Even for Gumtree and Facebook purchases I neither buy nor sell using cash. </p>

<p>I was just thinking today how great it&#39;ll be when I no longer need to carry a wallet around. </p>

<p>For me, I get far more suspicious when someone wants to pay cash when buying something off me than if they want to do a bank transfer. My opinion is that cash is far more dodgy. </p>

<p>It can also happen if you inadvertently receive a fraudulent transfer.  First step the bank straight locks your account.  They don&#39;t call you, you have to realise and call them.  </p>

<p>If you jump through the hoops just right you regain access.  Then quietly in a few months they&#39;ll permanently close your account, no reason given, and bar you from that banks services for 7 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They do it more than you think. I had a Chase Manhattan account that was frozen in 2014 with a substantial amount of money in it. Why? Well getting to that answer took a long time. I had to talk to maybe 10 different people before I finally got someone to tell me it was because I was trading this funny new currency they didn&#39;t like called Bitcoin and they thought that was suspicious. </p>

<p>They told me I couldn&#39;t even go into a branch to get my money and held my money for 10 days and then finally cut me a check. This was after being a customer with them for over 10 years and also holding 2 Chase credit cards. I was an ideal customer yet they decided that I was to go. </p>

<p>Now I work with a credit union and a tiny local bank. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure it is, but at the same time my money in the bank is also leveraged by the debt I&#39;ve got owing to the bank in the way of loans and mortgages. On a micro level It&#39;s not in their interest to block my account. </p>

<p>On a macro level, it&#39;s really not in their interest to block accounts as that would damage their credibility and share price for their investors. </p>

<p>On an even bigger level, banks are the most powerful shares on the ASX and are pretty much keeping the country afloat; so if something happened that caused banks to collapse and block funds, you&#39;d have far bigger things to worry about than access to your money. </p>

<p>Also, bringing it into the micro again, the physical cash you have (unless its physical gold) is losing value each day in terms of buying power. Cash is for unstable 3rd world economies. In a stable developed world your money needs to be working for you either earning interest or invested in debt. I&#39;m still on the fence as to which of those two is more beneficial at the moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I do mean investing in assets, but at the same time not being afraid to go into debt for those assets; even shares. 
It won&#39;t sound like a great argument currently because wage growth and inflation are fairly stagnant but in an ideal world with inflation at a few % and wage growth matching, having debt can work for you. </p>

<p>If I buy another house today, the money I borrow and the debt I go into is locked away at today&#39;s value. As wages and inflation go up, the real value of that debt declines. The repayments become easier to manage, and on a long enough timeline, negligible. </p>

<p>Imagine today, if you were in debt for a home loan of $250k that you took out in 1998. In 1998 $250k would have bought you a pretty comfortable house in Sydney. The repayments are roughly $1300 a month and in today&#39;s market, that house is now worth $1.5m. Even if you ignore the current value of the house, just in inflation $1300 a month is nothing. </p>

<p>Now what if you took that same $250k and had it as cash in the draw since 1998? What could have bought you a house back then will now only get you a nice car. Having cash in a drawer, or money sitting in a bank account doing nothing is useless. </p>

<p>I get that today, it&#39;s not the greatest argument because inflation and wage growth are stagnant, but fingers crossed that won&#39;t be the case for much longer. </p>

<p>Your also being a bit naive about accounts being blocked, yep they probably won&#39;t care about you but start using your accounts in a way they don&#39;t like then bye bye.</p>

<p>If the banks when bust you would have bigger things to worry about like the fact that you have no cash to buy essentials...</p>

<p>Lastly, I dunno about interest rates in Aus but for EU, UK and US good fucking luck getting an account to beat or even come close to the rate of inflation. Personally I wouldn&#39;t invest in debt as I put my money where my mouth is when it comes to my beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the interest rate is lower than the rate of inflation, go get into some serious debt. You&#39;d be crazy not to. Unfortunately here in Aus that&#39;s not the case. </p>

<p>Inflation is at 1.28% currently and you should still be getting around 2.5% interest for money in the bank.</p>

<p>If the opposite were the case, I&#39;d be borrowing every last cent that the bank would lend me and throwing it on the share market or in property. </p>

<p>Inflation in the US is currently at 0.82% and banks are generally giving 1% interest on money deposited. I&#39;ll give it to you, with those shitty numbers my argument for not keeping cash in a draw is pretty thin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes a transfer can be reversed, but a lot of responsibility comes down to judging the person. If a transaction feels dodgy, I don&#39;t go through with it. If some great con artist gets me, then well played to him. So far in my 30+ years I&#39;ve not been successfully conned. Generally speaking, most people are honest, and I mean that society wide not just in my own encounters. </p>

<p>The conclusion that cash is dodgy is my own. Many years ago I used to manage a chain of retail stores. In wealthier, more refined areas, the primary transaction method was cards. In lower SES areas, more cash was used. I prefer to align my principles and economic tactics with the wealthier areas. </p>

<p>Also, cash is the easiest tool used for tax evasion. I don&#39;t want any part of that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m ok with it. </p>

<p>I have massive social anxiety and prefer using self service kiosks over small talk with a largely disinterested cashier. On the flip side of that, I have also <em>been</em> a cashier for many, many years. Thankfully I got out of retail last year, but that job is soul destroying and machines don&#39;t have souls so they&#39;re more better equipped at dealing with rude customers for hours on end. </p>

<p>Joking aside, I get what you mean. A colleague was showing me his new phone which unlocks using facial scanning recently, he thought it was really cool but I found the idea terrifying. It&#39;s bad enough unlocking my own phone with my fingerprint...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, once more we are being told not to talk to each other. No more chats with the village butcher. Everything is becoming so impersonal. People do not even talk on the phone to each other anymore. We are becoming less and less social. TO the point that any interaction is giving people anxiety.  Hell call a person and you may trigger an anxiety attack in them.  Try to say hi to a person on the street and they think you are the weirdest motherfucker they have ever met. This store is a symptom of something far worse than the invasion of privacy. It is a testament to how much we no longer communicate to one another. </p>
