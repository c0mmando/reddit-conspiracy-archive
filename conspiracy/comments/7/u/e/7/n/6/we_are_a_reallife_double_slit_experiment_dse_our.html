        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It started with etymology...</p>

<p><strong>theo-</strong>, such as in &#39;theocracy&#39; or &#39;theology&#39;, comes from the Greek <em>theos</em>, which means &#39;god&#39;.  There is also the feminine form &#39;goddess&#39;, <em>thea</em>.  Coincidentally (perhaps), from Greek mythology, Theia was the Greek titan goddess of sight, who consequently birthed Helios (Sun), Eos (Dawn), and Selene (Moon)--i.e. the Cosmos.  Interestingly, Theia&#39;s name was derived from the Greek <em>thea</em>, which means &#39;sight&#39;.</p>

<p>Now, <em>thea</em> is the root of another Greek word: <em>theoros</em>, which means &#39;spectator&#39;.  This etymology leads to the <em>theoroi</em> who were &#39;sacred ambassadors&#39; or &#39;spiritual envoys&#39; sent to &#39;consult oracles, to give offerings at famous shrines or attend festivals&#39;--bottom line, these guys were important in theological/religious and societal/scientific ways.  So what did these <em>theoroi</em> do when they were attending festivals and such?  They would perform <em>theoria</em>, which is &#39;deep contemplative observation&#39;.</p>

<p>What does <em>theoria</em> lead to?  Well, to <strong>theor-</strong>, such as in &#39;Theory&#39; or &#39;theoretical&#39;.</p>

<p>So, we can see that the Greek <em>thea</em> had a weird, circular/associative link to religion...</p>

<pre><code>***thea* (&#39;sight&#39;) -&gt; titan Theia -&gt; *theos/thea* (&#39;god&#39;/&#39;goddess&#39;) -&gt; theology**
</code></pre>

<p>...but also to science...</p>

<pre><code>***thea* (&#39;sight&#39;) -&gt; *theoros* (&#39;observer&#39;) -&gt; *theoroi* (&#39;sacred/spiritual envoys&#39;) -&gt; *theoria** (&#39;contemplative observation&#39;) -&gt; theoretical**
</code></pre>

<p>How does the Double Slit Experiment (DSE) relate to all of this?  The DSE illustrates the fundament of quantum mechanics:  fields are only quantized upon observation.  That is, without an observer, the Universe might as well not exist.  In reality, the Universe is a matrix of probabilities and likelihoods where events are only invoked upon interaction by an external operator/observer.</p>

<p>So, if the DSE applies at an atomic level, and we are just made of atoms, then the DSE applies to our scale too, no?  In that case, we have clearly been quantized and events have occurred.  Wouldn&#39;t that necessitate a larger-scale observer to invoke the original event...the Genesis?  LOL, I am not even religious, but it&#39;s hard to ignore the incest going on here between science and religion, theories and faith.</p>

<p>Bottom line:</p>

<p><em>Who is our observer?
*Were ancients spot on in believing that &#39;seeing/observing is creating&#39;?
*Does that imply (unquantized) consciousness exists *beyond the material world</em> (i.e. &quot;afterlife&quot;) or <em>simultaneously within it</em> (i.e. &quot;shared world mind&quot;)?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that viewing the Universe in this way somewhat implies that we as humans, can operate in both a wave and a particle.  We can be particulate (individual human beings) or we can be a continuum (hive mind, society, social networking).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  Does this theory allow for the concept of &quot;free will&quot;?</p>

<p>How does this influence feelings?  I know that might seem like a simplistic question, but let me expand:</p>

<p>One of the major differences between us (organic) and AI (inorganic) is our ability to feel and then make decisions using our intelligence based on those feelings.  Fear, pain, love, hate, jealousy all contribute to our decision making.</p>

<p>How does this theory affect this aspect of our existence?</p>

<p>I love this stuff and really appreciate your input!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interestingly enough, I think the programming/statistics/computing concept of &quot;degrees of freedom&quot; applies. In any solid and powerful statistical system, varied parameters produce varied outcomes. If you produce a perfect model of this statistical system, you know what parameters produce what outcomes. So, due to natural constraints, if you vary all but one parameter, the last parameter is known. That is, in order to maintain the integrity of the model, the final parameter must be constrained to be a feasible value. </p>

<p>In our &quot;system&quot; (life), you can think of it like functions within functions. Each person is their own function that accepts &quot;inputs&quot; (e.g. sensory stimuli, thoughts, food, etc.) and produces &quot;outputs&quot; (e.g. speech, thoughts, excrement). We can absolutely vary certain &quot;parameters&quot; of our existence (e.g. what we wear, where we live, etc) but only to a certain &quot;degree of freedom&quot;.</p>

<p>What dictates the relationships and workings of all these functions together is, an algorithm. For humans, this algorithm is evolution and, even better, it&#39;s self-learning. It&#39;s taught itself to produce the chemicals that induce fear, courage, sadness, happiness, etc. based on a simple Boolean: &quot;do these emotions help me survive? Yes or no&quot;. It&#39;s trial by fire. </p>

<p>In AI, we hope to program algorithms that, by trial and error, learn tasks. How do you know a semiconductor doesn&#39;t use fear to coax its threads into working faster? How do you know an integrated circuit doesn&#39;t recognize its own mortality in the form of circuit degradation?</p>

<p>So, ultimately, everything has free will. Just how free does that make you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The term “observer” in quantum mechanics is deceptive. It’s intuitive to us that observations do not effect an event at the macroscopic scale, because on this level light and our eyes are what we use to make these observations. At the quantum level we are investigating light itself and objects like electrons that are on the scale such that they significantly interact with light. Thus we cannot treat light as a non interacting tool to investigate at this level. If we want to learn about something we make an “observation” or simply a measurement that has no choice but to interact with the process we want to study.</p>

<p>Imagine that you wanted to find out the height of a bullet fired from a gun out at 100yards from the barrel. On our macroscopic scale, we could use a camera, but on the microscopic quantum scale our tools become so clunky that to make same measurement we are forced to do the equivalent of building a wall out at 100yards and letting the bullet stop itself in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Introductory physics classes (which this guy has apparently never taken) usually start with the notion of making an <em>arbitrarily gentle</em> measurement. This is purely a teaching tool. When you&#39;re talking about cannonballs and such, it&#39;s easy to imagine measuring their positions and velocities gently enough that their motion is unaffected. But when you get down to small scales, there is no such thing as a gentle measurement. For instance, say you want to measure the spin of an electron. You have to put the electron in a magnetic field and watch for a photon to come out. If a photon was emitted, that means the electron&#39;s spin was <em>not</em> parallel to the magnetic field, but now it is because the electron precessed into alignment. If a photon <em>wasn&#39;t</em> emitted, that means the electron was <em>already aligned</em> with the magnetic field. This is the closest thing you&#39;ll get to a gentle measurement — effectively no measurement at all — but you&#39;re still torquing the electron around half the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If you replace the two observers in your example above with two unmanned spaceships with clocks on them, the same relativistic scenario will result</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t like my explanation. It&#39;s highly unconventional. But here goes anyways.</p>

<p>The speed of light is absolute and constant. It&#39;s a property of physical reality. It&#39;s not a material thing you can see. It&#39;s a thing that can be measured though. So we all agree that it is real.</p>

<p>If you went a billion light years away to another place, the speed of light would be the same. If you waited for a billion years, the speed of light would still be the same. If we&#39;re moving in a crazy way changing both our speeds and directions (rapidly and by huge amounts) the velocity of light between us would still be the same.</p>

<p>The speed of light is the exact opposite of randomness. It moves in an absolutely straight line (following spacetime) at a constant velocity at all times in all places.</p>

<p>The velocity of light is also orthogonal to the passage of time. If you move at C, you stop moving through time. If you&#39;re not moving at all, time passes at &quot;full speed&quot;.</p>

<p>Now try and imagine making a physical object that can serve as a visual representation (a symbol) of these qualities. What would it look like?</p>

<p>You&#39;d want to use perfectly straight lines (linearity of light&#39;s path), some right angles (light related to time, relationship between light, energy and mass E-MC<sup><sup>2</sup></sup> ) Your symbol should also have perfectly smooth surfaces (constancy of properties over time and distance).</p>

<p>Now you&#39;ve got your symbol that represents the properties of light (or physics in general). </p>

<p>Does this object look like something that just randomly got to look that way, or does your object look like something that was made by an intelligence with intent?</p>

<p>This is my way of describing what some physicists have realized. That the laws of physics imply an ordered universe. That order represents intelligence and intent. Some of the most brilliant scientists have noted that there are over a dozen constants, values and forces that have to be balanced to an incredible degree of precision for our universe and life to even exist.</p>

<p>So I stopped thinking of consciousness as some kind of byproduct or secondary effect arising from matter. I flipped things around and gave conditional acceptance to the view that consciousness was the fundamental phenomenon and started wondering how matter could be a secondary effect of it.</p>

<p>When I come at it from this direction, all kinds of things seem to make a lot more sense. Sorry if this line of reasoning seems wacky. I&#39;m not trying to trick anyone into becoming &quot;a believer&quot;.</p>

<p>But once you see consciousness as being fundamental and light as a type of information, the properties of light seem to make more sense.</p>

<p>How can you say this with any degree of certainty?</p>

<p>If consciousness is primary, the observer came first. Or you could say that observer and observed are part of the same system and both are eternal.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see if this whole Big Bang thing is still in fashion a hundred years from now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can say this with a fair degree of certainty by observing the cosmic microwave background, which is clear evidence of a universe that is billions of years old. Once the temperature in the early universe cools to below 3,000 degrees, the electromagnetic force comes into play, sending electrons around the nuclei and thus creating the first atoms, hydrogen and helium. The disappearance of these free elections makes the universe transparent, and it the subtle difference in the rate of cooling of different regions of space that result in the picture we see when we observe the cosmic microwave background. Therefore the CMB is in essence a snapshot of the early universe. Light from the CMB takes 13.7 billion years to reach us - so long, in fact, that it isn&#39;t even light anymore - its blue-shifted all the way to the microwave spectrum. It is via the same observation-based scientific reasoning that we know the age of the planet, our sun, as well as how long ago the first multi-cellular organisms evolved. These facts are much more well-established than the theory that conscious is primary or that human observers came first. And where then would you draw the line? At the first modern homo sapien sapiens? At the first members of the homo genus? At the first mammals? The first animals with a nervous system? Prefrontal cortex? The first single-celled organisms? Or when we switched from RNA to DNA? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is precisely what I am getting at. The &quot;observer&quot; is purely a measurement tool. At our scale, it&#39;s our eyes. At the atomic scale, scientists use other techniques that attempt to produce results that are normalized for our plane of existence.

Similarly, at the cosmological scale, there could be a metaphysical origin. </p>

<p>That is, <em>we</em> are as &quot;meta-atomic&quot; as <em>our</em> observer is &quot;meta-physical&quot;. Who is to say the measuring device our observer uses isn&#39;t as crude as our own atomic instruments? Who is to say at the center of an atom is a universe just like ours?</p>

<p>Well no, it&#39;s a distinct mathematical object with certain rigidly defined characteristics. Observables are linear operators on state space. The results of observables — observations — are eigenvalues of their operators.</p>

<p>But there are. If it&#39;s not an eigenvalue of an observable operator, it cannot be the result of an experiment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>QM Skeptic here... 
I believe that 1/d<sup>2</sup> is the first derivative of the actual primal force of nature... the strong nuclear force, which is a naturally quadratic system of primal charges.</p>

<p>Gravity, weak and em are simply derivatives of the imbalance in these systems... imho.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve mastered a lot of disciplines in my time. AI, encryption, electronics, calculus, geometry, statistics... They all &quot;click&quot; after 2-3 years of intense study... except for QM.</p>

<p>The Equations of QM are right. You can derive such equations with a neural network, or a LOT of patience. If they are the primal equations, then the world is magic. Spooky action is a thing, and either the Copenhagen or the Unlimited Universes interpretation is correct.</p>

<p>If, however, we are measuring a complex system and treating it as basic, then we are exactly NOWHERE on the path of transposing those equations onto the real world.</p>

<p>If gravity and electromagnetic attraction are derivative effects, we are getting equations for the first or second derivative of reality, which does not describe reality.</p>

<p>The first or second derivative of a very complex system can manifest itself in something as simple as the Maxwell equations or F=1/d<sup>2.</sup></p>

<p>The speed of light may only be a speed limit for complex particles.</p>

<p>IMHO, when you create an entangled pair, the components of the resulting particles are synchronized at the base level. Between this particle and most of the universe, we get second order interactions because the subatomic components of the photon are moving at a speed that makes light look lethargic. Since these sub-components of all atoms are moving randomly with respect to each other, all we see is the imbalance that escapes the &quot;dipole moment&quot;.</p>

<p>In a photon pair, the subatomic components have their motion synchronized, and so they interact at the primal level with their pair, at a base level. This seems to be faster than light because it is.</p>

<p>In this model, derivative forces would be systems which can move the speed of light, transversely, while the components of these complex systems are moving with respect to each other, at a speed that transcends that of the transversely propagating photons that establish the constant (C).</p>

<p>This will convince ZERO professional physicists. 
This is for the science nerd who doesn&#39;t give a shit about the orthodoxy. Einstein, Tesla and Feynman were all skeptical about the physical conclusions of QM. I&#39;ll throw my had into that ring, any day :).</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like doing intuitive exploration and development of models, because it is time consuming... consider these classical theories as good starting points.
Millsian - Mostly mathematical - GUT-CP. Does not explain the physical nature of matter, but has superior eqations (in terms of predicting actual electron orbitals and molecular bonds).
SuperGravity theory - Stoyan Sarg - This is a more elaborate theory that attempts to explain the &quot;atom&quot; in classical physics terms. Intuitively, it seems he is onto something. A good theory should be beautiful (imho), and it should clarify things that were previously mysterious. Keppler, Maxwell, Curie, Newton... good models.</p>

<p>And as a bonus, AlienScientist is enamored with a theory he believes will supplant QM. Look him up. I haven&#39;t had a chance to do more than a 2 hour overview of his chosen model... but I have to say... it doesn&#39;t look bad.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a QM fan... I am, too. My computer runs on technology that is the result of the QM equations. PHYSICALLY, however... I think it is a shit model.</p>

<p>Nikola Tesla - My Inventions</p>

<p>Every effort under compulsion demands a sacrifice of life-energy. I never paid such a price. On the contrary, I have thrived on my thoughts.</p>

<p>After a while this effort grew to be almost automatic and I gained great facility in connecting cause and effect. Soon I became aware, to my surprise, that every thought I conceived was suggested by an external impression. Not only this but all my actions were prompted in a similar way. In the course of time it became perfectly evident to me that I was merely an automaton endowed with power of movement, responding to the stimuli of the sense organs and thinking and acting accordingly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could the self not be the observer? Do you not observe yourself, especially your own thoughts? You can only assume another person is thinking as they are constructed similar to yourself, however you cannot know what their thoughts comprise of unless they share them and assure you they&#39;re being honest. I feel the universe was birthed and then become self-aware, thus allowing further complexity to emerge as the quality of it observing itself. I would say then that whatever exists outside and above, a supernal entity, then it is not controlled solely by quantum mechanics but can initiate such a phenomenon to exist and may do so in order to subsist its own self-preservation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am postulating that we are the equivalent of an operator to some larger-scale entity. When we &quot;observe&quot; quantum dynamics, we are not controlling them necessarily. We are simply quantizing the fields and path of least resistance and probabilities handles the rest.</p>

<p>Sure, we can &quot;coerce&quot; or &quot;entice&quot; quanta to go a certain direction, hold a certain charge, or merge with others. But this is insofar as we can entice someone with money to move across the country for a new job. It&#39;s not always a guarantee. </p>

<p>Perhaps, unquantized fields are just &quot;sleeping&quot; quanta. There are always enough awake to keep the whole Universe populated, but when at rest, they entangle and communicate, which attracts each other from infinite distances. And maybe <em>we</em> can tap into that when we dream. While sleeping (unquantized) we dream about where we want to go, where we <em>can</em> go and we have infinite potential. When awake (quantized), we always know where we are, but don&#39;t necessarily know where we&#39;ll end up. </p>

<p>My take on the link provided:</p>

<p>So, something is permeating space on the cosmic scale then, which gives the planets the orbits they have. That, or the sun, being high frequency plasma is interacting with this field, and the planets being lower frequency, lock around it.</p>

<p>There is a connection to be made here.</p>

<p>They say quantum and cosmic can’t be properly corroborated, but look at this video, then the links provided in this post, then look at the patterns the planets make as they travel around the earth and sun, and you get “exotic orbits” just like in the links.</p>

<p>So, we have quantum evidence, as shown in the videos. We have evidence of the in between of quantum and cosmic with cymatics we can produce at the human scale. Last but not least we have evidence on the cosmic scale, based off every orbital pattern each planet makes in the sky, as can be viewed from earth over time.</p>

<p>So, we can see the similarities between the scales, how is there not someone that’s been able to link them together with the evidence presented in this thread, whether it’s a jumping off point to start linking them, or they literally can be evidenced as being linked with what’s shown?</p>

<p>How does this influence feelings?  I know that might seem like a simplistic question, but let me expand:</p>

<p>One of the major differences between us (organic) and AI (inorganic) is our ability to feel and then make decisions using our intelligence based on those feelings.  Fear, pain, love, hate, jealousy all contribute to our decision making.</p>

<p>How does this theory affect this aspect of our existence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not really true. The delayed-choice quantum eraser (which is what you&#39;re talking about) just demonstrates that a photon exists in superposition until it interacts with something.

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that we live in a seemingly intelligently-ordered universe could very well be due to a number of causes, such as the multiverse theory. The reason it appears intelligently designed is due to the anthropic principle.</p>

<p>But as to the claim to which I originally replied, how do you explain the evolution of the universe and all the events that occurred 13.7 billion years ago up until the time when Homo sapiens first walked the earth? Or until intelligent life evolved? The universe wouldn&#39;t have ended up like it is, the planets wouldn&#39;t have formed, and early chemical reactions on earth would not have given rise to the organic molecules necessary for life, without light acting as it does today, and yet observers came billions of years later.</p>
