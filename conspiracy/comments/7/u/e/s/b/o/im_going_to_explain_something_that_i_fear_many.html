        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is probably not going to be popular, on either side of the dialectic. But I don&#39;t care, I&#39;ll deal with the downvotes. The truth is what karma capital is meant to be spent on anyways. Hopefully people who are meant to see this still will. If you think it is a worthwhile idea, even if you disagree with it, please help.</p>

<p>Here goes. Zionism is the most prominent antisemitic ideology alive today. Indeed Zionism <em>embodies</em> antisemitism, and always has.</p>

<hr/>

<p>First of all: ordinary Jews are among the most propagandized and brainwashed people on the planet. The Zionists see them as human shields.</p>

<p>If you think you&#39;ve been force-fed the Holocaust, realize this is <strong>nothing</strong> compared to what the ordinary Jew endures, especially in Israel. There isn&#39;t a day where he doesn&#39;t hear about it. I mean this quite literally.</p>

<p>This can be understood by the fact the Holocaust is front and center to the Zionist deception. The promise to Rothschild (&quot;Balfour declaration&quot;) was about getting the British onboard. The Holocaust was about getting Jews onboard (and move to Palestine).</p>

<p>Indeed, contrary to popular belief, the Holocaust narrative is <em>not</em> mostly aimed at Gentiles. It was essential to populate Palestine, and nowadays it is crucial to inculcate and sustain the victim complex within the Israeli population and get ordinary, decent Jews to support a murderous supremacist ideology.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The origin of all society is to be found in the mutual fear of all its members (Hobbes, as quoted by Hegel)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An artificial nation must rely on a strong artificial fear in order to survive.</p>

<p>The Zionists <em>would profit from</em>, and indeed <em>are looking to foster</em> renewed persecution of the Jews. As I will show this is not something new.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I will now propose a few quotes by historical Zionist leaders, just so one can grasp their morbid antisemitism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jewish national character has been at fault since time immemorial. We (Jews) have never been a creative people. We’ve always lived lives of gypsies and dogs. What do you expect from the anti Semites?” The Jews are Gypsies, contagion, slop and decay, a rotten egg. We are remotely humane. scum of mankind. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Josef Haim Brenner (Zionist leader and author - the Brenner Prize, one of Israel&#39;s top literary awards, is named after him).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Transforming humanoid raw material (the Diaspora Jews) into a cultural nation is not an easy task.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>David Ben Gurion (first Israeli prime minister)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When they ask me, can you not use funds to rescue Jews in the Diaspora? I said No and I repeat No!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Itzhak Greenbaum (the Zionist leader in charge of the rescue efforts, he said this in 1943)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The hope of six million Jews is focused on rising up from the depth of tragedy. I wish to save two million youth. The elderly will perish and await their final destiny. They are, economically and ethically –sub human-in cruel world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chaim Weizmann (leader of the Zionist Organisation and later the first Israeli President, he said this in 1937)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The priests of the Christians are at the top of the scale and the simple Christians are better than the Jews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Theodor Herzl (father of modern political Zionism)</p>

<p>And of course there is this infamous quote by Ben Gurion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I knew it was possible to save all [Jewish] children of Germany by their transfer to England and only half of them by transferring them to Eretz-Yisrael, I would choose the latter—because we are faced not only with the accounting of these [Jewish] children but also with the historical accounting of the Jewish People.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>David Ben Gurion (first Israeli prime minister, he said this in 1938)</p>

<p>There are many more examples; these are just the most famous. I recommend this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vlJscu9LRM">must-watch Israeli documentary</a> [Theodor Herzl and the anti-semitic side of Zionism, 1:23:26].</p>

<hr/>

<p>Here is another piece of little-known history. </p>

<p>In 1933, while Germany was facing a <a href="https://s10.postimg.org/lr2qytdo9/judea_declares_war_on_germany_2.jpg">worldwide boycott</a>, the Zionist Federation of Germany signed a little-known (and barely publicized) deal with Nazi Germany. At the time, German Jews were being coerced, through various means, to leave Germany. Zionists were favoring these policies, and agreed with the Nazis that the Jewish refugees could recuperate their confiscated assets but <em>only if they moved to Palestine</em>. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haavara_Agreement">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haavara_Agreement</a></p>

<p>Upon arrival in Palestine, expelled German Jews could convert their confiscated assets into German industrial goods. This greatly contributed to helping Hitler&#39;s effort of rebuilding Germany&#39;s war industry.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I highly recommend Sutton&#39;s book <a href="https://www.voltairenet.org/IMG/pdf/Sutton_Wall_Street_and_Hitler.pdf">Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler</a> [full book pdf]. I will not attempt to summarize it here. You should read it. Needless to say, these banks were not lead by Seven-Days Adventists; they were Zionists and their allies.</p>

<hr/>

<p>How is the Zionists&#39; morbid antisemitism apparent today?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They conflate Zionism and Judaism - typically by saying criticizing Zionism is akin to criticizing Judaism. Therefore they are implying that all Jews do (or should) share their horrendous supremacist ideology. It is <em>extremely</em> antisemitic to suggest this, of course.</p></li>
<li><p>They harass and persecute Haredi Jews. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haredim_and_Zionism">You should know</a> that a vast majority of Haredim were against the creation of Israel before 1948; to this day, many groups do not recognize the usurpers&#39; country. This is <a href="http://www.nkusa.org/">especially true in the USA</a>. They are regularly beaten, defamed and imprisoned when they dare speak up (demonstrate) against Zionism. </p></li>
<li><p>The Zionists are <em>purposefully</em> doing everything they can to foment antisemitism worldwide. As a tiny example, do you think this obvious, blatant and vulgar shilling in favor of Israel&#39;s warcrimes all over the Internet is meant to convince anyone? If so, please read <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5rnvup/the_conspiracy_of_opinions_or_how_the_state_is/">my post on common knowledge.</a>. Next time you see an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Internet_Defense_Force">obvious JIDF hasbara troll</a>, ask yourself whether it isn&#39;t a bit <em>too obvious</em>. Articles <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Mowing-the-grass-in-Gaza-368516">such as these</a> serve the same purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>You will see that Trump will serve his Zionist allies (masters?) well, by overseeing a massive increase in antisemitism worldwide. This has already started on the left, with the Jerusalem decision (remember to watch the media while understanding common knowledge, not taking everything on the 1st degree). On the right, anyone who turns against him (and they will, in increasing numbers, as people on the left have turned against Obama/Hillary) will blame the Jews, because after all, Trump is surrounded by Jews (in reality antisemitic Zionists).</p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Realize what we&#39;re dealing with here. These are master propagandists. That&#39;s by the way pretty much the only thing they&#39;re creative at. They <em>want</em> Jewish persecution, they <em>incite</em> antisemitism, in order to sustain the victim complex, and to get the pseudo-moral cover for more Arab democide and land grab. </p>

<p>Zionists <em>have nothing to do with Judaism</em>. They are using Judaism as a cover, and Jews as human shields. Indeed they are either morbidly materialist, or are involved in some sick and perverted occultism. Also as I have shown they are <em>profoundly</em> antisemitic.</p>

<p>So what should we do? </p>

<p>In my own humble opinion: advocate for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-state_solution">one-state solution in the near East.</a> That is what they fear most. Democracy. Non-violence. Equal rights for the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine. It also happens to be the only viable solution to the conflict (which is no longer a territorial dispute, but a civil rights issue).</p>

<p>They have turned the truth upside down. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TG0vdzrmt4">They have used</a> the &quot;two-State solution&quot; scam and the &quot;Oslo Accords&quot; machination to advance their nefarious agenda. We can rehabilitate the truth, if only we understand what&#39;s going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might seem unrelated but since you have knowledge - I thought I&#39;d ask.</p>

<p>So I bought a book on magick (spelled this way to differentiate it from the performing art of magic tricks).  Magick is defined as performing an action so as to receive an expected result that is out of the flow of the continuation from present position.  In other words, making shit happen that you expected but wouldn&#39;t have occurred if you hadn&#39;t performed said magick ritual.</p>

<p>One of the things it wants you to do is to learn Hebrew.  WTF?</p>

<p>In fact it talks about how the author&#39;s own magickal abilities grew in direct proportion to his skill at using Hebrew.  </p>

<p>Seems very odd to me.</p>

<p>He even went on to say most magickal abilities could be performed using English but there were many that couldn&#39;t and he had greater and greater success the more he used Hebrew for all his ritual work.</p>

<p>Any ideas why this might be?  Were Jews somehow seen as sorcerers or something?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the European Middle-Ages the go-to sorcerer you’d go to for a spell would typically be Jewish. That is not only because of the Zohar; it is mostly because they were in a unique positio to acquire (and retain) knowledge from different cultures. But let me back up a bit.</p>

<p>We Europeans had completely forgotten, during the Middle Ages, about Classical Antiquity and its philosophers. We rediscovered it thanks to Islamic scholars (which led to the Renaissance).</p>

<p>The Jews, to a relatively large extent, never suffered from this collective amnesia. Because they were dispersed, they actually enhanced their own mystical understanding (which originates back to the time they were in Babylon). Their own mystical teachings are a patchwork of knowledge they’ve borrowed from different places across history. It is my own impression they’ve twisted it somewhat, but that’s my personal assessment (although I guess one can still find beauty in the Kabbalah).</p>

<p>Now with all that being said, to your question: all mystical traditions (and hermetic philosophy) come from ancient Egypt (a misnomer, the actual name is Khem). Actually it probably comes from the forgotten global civilization that preceded the Egyptians, but that’s another story. It was then imported to various parts of the world under the name “mysteries”, and re-taught in the West from the 12th-13th centuries in various esoteric lodges (some evil, some good).</p>

<p>So if you want to learn about “magick”, you absolutely don’t need to learn Hebrew, especially if you rely on source documents. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetica">Corpus Hermeticum</a> was written in Greek, and many translations are available.</p>

<p>If this interests you beware that most modern “lodges” were infiltrated in the 20th century by the offenders I mention in my OP, and no longer serve the true purpose of enlightenment. It is therefore probably preferable to learn by yourself, and with the Internet you can do that. I’d also start with actual hermetic philosophy, which will unlock the keys of nature (the universe) for you - so-called “magick” is a fairly vulgar consequence / corollary to a more fundamental truth. By starting with it you risk getting caught in the hubris/arrogance/illusion that will accompany the promise of power it provides, and you will be set on a wrong path (not congruent with Truth, Love).</p>

<p>If you’re wondering where to start I could suggest the Kybalion. <a href="http://www.hermetics.org/pdf/kybalion.pdf">Full PDF</a>.</p>

<p>Cheers my friend, and good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can vouch for the Kybalion — I have read it a few times and every time there is something new which gets me to kind of stop and think, “woah...this makes sense.”</p>

<p>And while we are on the subject of magick I may as well vouch for the idea of Hermetic Philosophy, something that one of my very good friends (who happens to be Jewish) introduced me to. It took me nine years to finally settle down into it but I really think it’s the real deal.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the idea of Hermeticism helps me make sense of the world around me. I use it for some stuff but ultimately it gives me a greater peace of mind in seeing the world a different way.</p>

<p>And I guess, while we are at it, I’ll suggest a few other books too: Tetrabiblos (by Ptolemy) and the Occult Philosophy books by Agrippa. I’ve looked at those more times than I can count.</p>

<p>I didn’t mean to hijack this post Murph but magick is one of my favorite topics which I can’t really talk to people about daily and I saw this so why the hell not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem. If anyone else wants more I can happily suggest more but I highly suggest starting with those. The rest are kind of different than your ordinary read.</p>

<p>And I guess if I may I suggest another book by one of my favorite people of this area: The Complete Herbal by Nicholas Culpeper. This is a book on a very large amount of plants by a doctor who started his own practice and got tons of other doctors pissed off at him for essentially helping (and curing) patients of natural illnesses through plants. He died early though from tuberculosis and I think getting shot at during a battle didn’t help either. His work, to me, is revolutionary and I don’t think there is anything else like it that has existed to my knowledge. It seems a little off because <em>plants</em> but between what I study for fun and the empirical evidence I’ve seen throughout reading, I would say it helps make sense of the world just as much as the others, but in their own way.</p>

<p>I can’t really not talk about this stuff and make it short so apologies for the long responses. If anybody has any other book requests I’d be happy to suggest some.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve got 21 books on this stuff. Believe it or not I don’t know how to set up a torrent but would greatly appreciate any instructions so I can package these in a torrent.</p>

<p>Keep in mind I haven’t read them all completely as most of the time I just need a few excerpts and then I go and do something else. That doesn’t at all mean they aren’t useful though, I think you could really make something of yourself (anyone) if you take time to read them all.</p>

<p>One of my favorite hobbies is indexing and reviewing books and music (sometimes I just collect them and never listen to or read them) but <em>having</em> them is what I care about because you never know when you want to check them out. I say this because in my opinion it reinforces the strength of my collection; I don’t collect shit sources, is what I’m saying.</p>

<p>While I don’t really know what the audience in r/conspiracy looks like for occult magic, personally it is my favorite subject to read about and in my opinion it permeates all of existence whether we are aware of it or not. I’ve realized the truth doesn’t matter if you believe in it or if you don’t, it’s still there regardless.</p>

<p>Anyway yeah sorry for these chunks of text, usually I prefer to lurk but if I can get some info on how to create a functioning torrent I will create a package for others to download if there is interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this — I tried once years ago making a torrent and just kind of gave up. I’ll do this when I get home. I’ll probably just send to you personally (unless, like I said, there are others interested).</p>

<p>I think I’m close to 200 books both epub and PDF, and I forgot about the 30 some odd lessons that can go with the other books I mentioned.</p>

<p>I personally distrust nearly any information disseminated by most people these days and typically try to do investigation on whether a source is a) valid b) what I’m looking for, and usually all of these are gut-checked to make sure I’m not wasting my time. I can’t tell you how many books I thought were what I wanted, only to download them and scan them to find not only poor sources, but downright unhelpful.</p>

<p>Maybe I’ll just compile my entire collection. I do recommend the 30 some lessons on top of the others. This stuff isn’t light and sometimes I can’t really stomach it because it’s pretty exhausting, but it’s the closest thing I have to that Hermetical stuff that was discussed earlier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This (again, my opinion) is <em>extremely</em> difficult to provide any clear answer, as it opens a freezer full of cans of worms.</p>

<p>First of all, we would have to know what we are looking for. Symbols are weird in that they really only are meaningful to those who know what to look for. So like, if you know the language, you can figure out what they might indicate. But then, what symbols actually mean things, and which ones are red herrings? I could put 666 somewhere on my car and go hueheheieheueheu and it might make other people think I’m up to something, but really I just put it there to be a shitter, without any meaning behind it. It’s very hard to weed out stuff that has a track record of intentional symbolism vs stuff that <em>seems</em> like it might fit within what you’re looking for.</p>

<p>Then you have to consider exactly what and why the symbol was there in the first place. I remember someone made a post somewhere saying the cursive Coca Cola logo said “cocaine” or something weird in it. How!? How would I know to actively find something like that!? You have to turn it 183 different ways to figure out what they’re saying? Who’s winning then — you, who invested countless hours following a crumb trail, or the potential conspiracy trolls at Coca Cola, making false flags for us to be occupied with?</p>

<p>Personally, I think if the symbol is significant — take the planetary glyphs, for example, which have been used for aeons to represent the celestial bodies — and it has a track record of being used consistently for similar stuff — then perhaps it has some merit. But like...I don’t know. That whole pizzagate triangle pizza stuff was interesting to me because I don’t know a lot about it and it did look like it meshed correctly. But then I always go back and consider that TPTB <em>want</em> to put themselves out in the open, but not easily noticed. I think that’s a huge deal. Hell, if I were in such powerful positions, I would certainly try to put something out there that says “Hey I’m watching you and you don’t know because you don’t know what to look for”.</p>

<p>Symbols can mean different things for everyone, and their subjectivism is what makes them such a slippery topic. Symbols can mean ANYTHING that someone makes them out to be. Oh you have a cat tattoo to ward off bad luck? I have a cat tattoo to remember that time Whiskers walked in front of my grandma’s legs and accidentally caused her to trip and fall, breaking her hip, so I know to never buy animals again.</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s better to narrow your focus on stuff that has at least some history. Apple, or Google, or whatever, probably have symbols somewhere, but they’re relatively new so they could have literally <em>any</em> meaning behind their stuff. It’s crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But when it starts to be a pattern then there may be some objective meaning to the TPTB? or even deeper meaning, like sigils ? Check <a href="https://www.newparadigm.ws/my-blogs/occult-symbolism-in-corporate-logos-pt-1/">this</a>

    <div class="md"><p>This seems interesting and I like some of the topics he is bringing up. But I am heavily, heavily skeptical whenever I read something along the lines of:</p>

<p><em>”Remember, it has been said that anything occult does not come from God and is therefore satanic”</em></p>

<p>This is a completely erroneous statement and makes me question the author’s narrative through this. The term “occult” means <em>”to conceal or to be hidden”</em>. While I guess you could assume people that practice occultist matters might have some sinister undertone, it is incorrect to think/label that if someone is performing occult work that it is inherently evil. It <em>may</em> be, it may <em>not</em> be. However, occult work tends to be just...concealed, or out of sight from most other people. Trust me on this.</p>

<p>And, while I can definitely see where the author is coming from, I just don’t know. Sometimes I’m skeptical of stuff like that cause it makes somebody look like they’re grasping at straws.</p>

<p>Again, all my opinion (minus the occult terminology).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a non-religious person, I found it interesting when I recently contrasted Islamic and Judaic views on Jesus:</p>

<p><strong>Islam:</strong></p>

<p>Jesus is the penultimate prophet and messenger of God.  </p>

<p>Jesus is a Messiah (Christ), sent to guide the Children of Israel with a new revelation.  </p>

<p>Jesus is the most mentioned person in the Quran.</p>

<p>The Quran teaches Jesus to have been born a &quot;pure boy&quot; (without sin) to Mary as the result of virginal conception, similar to the event of the Annunciation in Christianity.</p>

<p>In Islamic theology, Jesus is believed to have performed many miracles.</p>

<p>Muslim belief is that Jesus did not physically die, but was instead raised alive to heaven.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Islam">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Islam</a></p>

<p><strong>Judaism</strong></p>

<p>Jesus is viewed as having been the most damaging of all false messiahs.</p>

<p>Judaism has never accepted any of the claimed fulfillments of prophecy that Christianity attributes to Jesus. </p>

<p>Traditional views of Jesus have been an account that portrays Jesus as an impostor who committed blasphemy.</p>

<p>The Talmud teaches that Jesus is being punished for all eternity by being boiled in semen and his followers will boil for all eternity in their own excrement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I literally feel like I&#39;m in the novel 1984.  I feel as though I should give all my valuables to my wife.  As soon as I reply, I&#39;ll be on a list, whisked away at night, and taken to Guantanamo.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s break this down to the most basic level.  The average person, be they Jew, Christian, Muslim, Black, White, homo, hetero, binary, handicapped or handicappable just wants to raise their family in a loving environment with clean water, healthy food and to practice religion if they choose.</p>

<p>Before Israel was created in 1948, the Jews and Palestinians lived in peace with one another.  If TPTB truly wanted peace, it could be done in a day.  It really is that easy.  At this point, in 2018, it&#39;s a lot of work to keep stirring the pot of discontent, but yet that continues, because that is the policy/vision in place.</p>

<p>Absent any change in TPTB&#39;s heart, the punishment of the Palestinians will continue.  It&#39;s exactly what we did as a country to the Native Americans.  However, there were no press or Indian neighbors to stop us.  We continually made treaties, nullified them, and killed as many Indians as possible.</p>

<p>Any power we, the populous had, disappeared when TPTB realized we weren&#39;t going to stand up to them.  That we care more about the NFL, Playstation, and the Kardashians than we do about them dropping bombs wherever/whenever.  We haven&#39;t pushed for clean water in our cities, pushed Nestle to pay their water, made Monsanto label GMO foods, why would TPTB think we would care about kids in Palestine?  Even 9/11 passed right on by.</p>

<p>Why is Palestine till on the map?</p>

<p>Palestine has Arab neighbors, the press is ready to report on aggression 24/7, and Iran is going to lose their shit if Palestine is leveled.  So the Palestinians will get beat on until the CIA/NSA/Mossad can destabilize/topple Iran.  </p>

<p>Once that happens, Syria and Palestine are literally parking lots.  They will eliminate as many enemy combatants as possible.  Leaving people alive with that level of resentment isn&#39;t in their game plan.</p>

<p>Please understand, I&#39;m a peace, love, live and let live person.  I&#39;m just saying, this is what will occur.  It&#39;s just a question of timing.</p>

<p>If they both didn&#39;t exist, we wouldn&#39;t be able to tell the difference &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah if ISIS wasn&#39;t man created by the Israelis to CREATE wars.. just like Al Qaeda.. and then 9/11. It all ties together. These extremists are all hired and work for the CIA / Us government.. there&#39;s so much proof. The acronym ISIS can stand for Israel Secret Intelligence Service.. </p>

<p>The tactic of the Israelis / US to take over the world is starting war within 2 nations and funding both sides of the war to create hate.. the frequency of fear projected into the world as a collective really puts a toll on our consciousness as a collective so the more they instill fear, hate and propaganda amongst us, it&#39;s gonna be so much harder for people to be able to become conscious of these things and remain mind puppets.. and so much easier for them to create the New World Order</p>

As for Lucifer and Baphomet most intellectuals are aware of the fact that supernatural entities are just stories. No such thing as a god, no such thing as a devil, they’re metaphors. There’s no secretive cabals worshipping the devil in gothic rooms. Only secretive cabals who attempt to subvert the liberty and intellectual fiber of society through means which are actually possible like propaganda and military dominance. The amoral and hateful people who control our societies are still intelligent and rational people, they laugh at the stupid plebs who actually believe they are beholden to the whims of some supernatural masters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry i am well versed in religion but i would pretty much consider myself a near atheist today.</p>

<p>Heres my question:</p>

<p>What if there is no lucifer? Or there is no satan. I&#39;m not sYing its true or not. Doesnt matter.</p>

<p>But what if (more important) the ideas represented by &quot;evil&quot; and the actions taken by &quot;evil&quot; people - are just the actions of greedy humans operating off something similar to animalistic instincts - more like the law of the jungle than the laws of god *(or the laws of man)</p>

<p>So i mean - if they <em>(tptb....zionists.....evil doers - whoever) what if they are not worshipping anyone - but are instead just working together to be the most powerful &quot;pack&quot; and carry on *(survival of the fittest)</em> and they are destroying people places and earth itself along the way without regards. They are not doing satans work. They are doing what animals do. Kill or be killed. Hunt of be hunted. The most powerful will be crowned king of the jungle.....and reign supreme.</p>

<p>Oooooh..... That lust for power </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From a political perspective, it wouldn&#39;t matter if it was lucifer or greed. We&#39;d need to free ourselves and our government from their clutches just the same. From a religious or spiritual perspective though, it may matter a great deal, or maybe not so much, I won&#39;t venture to guess. But it comes down to knowing your enemy, in order to stop them and understand their attacks and motivations. Maybe they think Luciferianism is evil cool and just do it to mess with us. I guess for me seeing was believing:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting to reflect on how before this movement every major city from Spain to India, all over Europe, North Africa, Middle East, etc had a Jewish Quarter of some sort. I know it obviously wasn&#39;t paradise and every minority gets persecuted at one point or another. But at least they managed to essentially live out there lives for thousands of years. Each community having its own personal history, culture, language, flavor and unique relationship with the majority community.</p>

<p>What is a more Nazi idea than, every Jew in the world should leave the nations their parents, grandparents, etc have lived for hundreds of years and all concentrate in one tiny segregated heavily militarized micro state. Russian? Algerian? Iranian? German? Polish? Armenian? Yemeni? Apparently none of that matters anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting post. For the sake of argument, let&#39;s say the Holocaust was a fraud, or at least large parts of it were embellished, such as the number who died, or the manner in which they died (disease and starvation vs. gassing and furnaces)... What would happen to society if it were to be revealed to the world that it was a sham? How would civilization proceed? I imagine that there would be a serious reckoning but I&#39;m wondering if TS and others could outline what that reckoning might look like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have just painted the difference between individualism and collectivism. I fully agree with you. All individuals are sovereign, born with a sacred and inalienable right to life and liberty, and ultimately bound by natural law alone. We are all infinitely different with another, which is what makes supremacism/racism absurd (not that we are “all the same”).</p>

<p>Whenever one “identifies” with a collective, be it represented by a race, culture, nation, political affiliation, class, book, authority figure, identity group, etc. one is thus delegating his discernment, conscience, mind and senses; thus one is renouncing what makes him human; and one is thus lead to commit evil.</p>

It lead me to this <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=f0H_LClxnsw">other short video/interview of his</a> (3:34). He very eloquently explains the necessity of democracy (one-state solution), and tells how the Zionist position of “you should move out of Israel if you’re a non-Zionist Jew” is problematic and self-refuting (in addition to being akin to Nazism).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the very kind words. My prediction about the next collapse is that it is going to be blamed on Trump or Trump-like ideology, forcing the world to embrace globalism as the one true path. (They always create two artificial and extreme positions of which we are forced to choose one, as if there are no less extreme alternatives.)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve learned more about how the world really works from Miles Mathis than from any other truther. I don&#39;t agree with every conclusion he draws, but I am a big supporter of his work. He has published other research of mine on his site. In addition to the paper on Dreyfus there is one I wrote on <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/fakir.pdf">Gandhi</a>, a two-part paper on the New Deal and Smedley Butler (<a href="http://mileswmathis.com/butler2.pdf">here</a> and <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/butler2.pdf">here</a>), and a more recent one on <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/rabin.pdf">the Rabin assassination.</a> </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t recommend you read them now. Instead, you should go to Miles&#39;s <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/updates.html">updates page</a> and scroll down to his papers from 2013. Start with &#39;From Theosophy to the Beat Generation&#39; and move forward from there (you may wish to skip his next paper on the painted word, although his art criticism is also provocative). The reason is that he makes discoveries along the way, so later papers build on earlier ones. It&#39;s quite a journey. Then you can read my papers in the order in which he published them. If you jump in at the end, it will probably be very hard to swallow. I&#39;m happy to dialogue further.   </p>
