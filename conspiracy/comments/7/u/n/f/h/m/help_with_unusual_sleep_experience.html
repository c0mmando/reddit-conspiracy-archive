       I went back to bed this morning after my husband left for work and something weird happened. At some point in my sleep cycle, I became acutely aware of a high pitched frequency. It was really strong and disconcerting. Then the frequency became accompanied by alternating flashing red and green lights viewed through my closed eyes (as if they were happening outside my body and not bright or in my face, just bright enough to see the colors through closed eyes.) As that continued, I got kinda scared and remained calm and chanted the Tara mantra in my head to help center myself and move through my fear. Eventually through the chanting the frequency and lights subsided and I "woke up" and threw my phone which was under my pillow. Then I remembered my phone was plugged in in a different room and I actually woke up to what sounded like a plane flying overhead. At that point I wondered if anyone else in the house had been disturbed, and the baby started stirring in her sleep but did not wake up. So then I went back to bed and it didn't happen again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm usually a pretty lucid dreamer, but this was very atypical of my normal sleep experience.

       I have found the combination of melatonin, B-complex, and ashwagandha very effective for vivid, profound dreaming.  YMMV.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, living near high-voltage power lines has induced very strange lucid dreaming events.

       I've always had very vivid, nearly lucid dreams my whole life. I am not disturbed by them, in fact I've become very fascinated by them. I think they can be very informative. :)

       Did you intend to post in this subreddit?  It simply sounds like a simple hypnopompic/hypnogogic hallucination with possibly a dose of sleep paralysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had sleep issues relating to sleep terrors over the years and the symptoms mentioned.  I've taken quazepam from time to time, which helps.  My issues were fairly severe at one time.

       I highly recommend mindfulness meditation.

       FYI - No conspiracy.  Weird shit happens when you wake up from extended sleep and then go back to sleep.  I have a shit ton of knowledge and experience on sleep issues from personal experience.  However, I've never posted on a Reddit forum.  Hope I helped!

       It sounds like you have been getting into the new age stuff which opens you up to the spiritual realm.  That is Lucifer's world and he controls all the unclean spirits and devils (demons) that inhabit it.  They will represent themselves as aliens, angels, ancestors etc.  Basically anything you would want to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       2Co_11:14  And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end though they will try to torment you usually in lucid dreams or semi conscious states.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ever feel afraid just shout at them to leave you alone in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.  That will cause them to flee.  I hope you try this sometime when you are experiencing a spiritual attack and it helps you to realize that he is real and has power over them.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be saved by his grace simply repent and believe his gospel which is:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
      </p>
      <p>
       He paid our price for us.  There is nothing for us to do but accept his blood sacrifice and receive salvation through his imputed righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peace.

       Eph 2:2  Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:
      </p>
      <p>
       He's controlling all the principalities and powers that govern the Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eph 6:12  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luk 4:6  And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. 
Luk 4:7  If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.

       You have to consider if there were a God and he wanted us to know what he wanted he would have the power to preserve his word to us.  If there was nothing TPTB could do to stop the word from being there the next best thing is to create countless versions of it and false religions to dilute it which is exactly what's going on.  The King James Bible is the true word of God.

       It's a fairly recent Gnostic text.  Mainstream media made a big deal of it during the dead sea scrolls hoax.  Anything pushed by the media at any time is a complete deception.

       I did mean to post it here after my own research left a lot to be desired on an answer. I'm not frightened by dreams, just perpetually trying to continue to learn and grow.

      <p>
       To the poster about demons and Jesus, I think all religions are basically the same thing and are typically just a way for people to manipulate the masses by disempowering them and keeping them ignorant to their own abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point in my life, I identify more as a Buddhist than anything, but I don't typically like labels and Buddhism is more of a way of using your mind then deity worship. I think we all are "God" and, individually and collectively, shape reality with our thoughts and subsequent actions.

       I love the exploration of the dream realms. I think it's our consciousness shifting to another one of our bodies in a subsequent dimension. I remember previous dreams during my dreams and am able to interact with my dream worlds as I would during the waking one. If I had unlimited funds to study this, it would be my chosen field of research. I rarely meet others who speak this way of their own dream experiences.

       I felt aware, not quite awake per se, but I wanted to explore what was happening, hence the active meditation through the experience. Once it passed, my sleeping mind was quick to write it off as disturbance from technology and my mind generated my phone being under my pillow, which I "woke up" to get rid of. Then I remembered it was charging another room at which point I actually woke up and checked on my surroundings.

       I will give you an opinion:
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets just say your a lucid dreamer but not an astral projector.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being lucid within a dream is like playing with thoughts in your subconscious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Astral projecting is something different. You can think of it as dimensional, frequency densities, spiritual, etc, but whats happening is that you are hearing the actual frequency of your body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coincidentally, their are 2 electrical nodes in your heart that cause the double "thump", my personal opinion is you were actually hearing the frequency of your heart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sleep paralysis is considered many things, but its something a long the lines of being conscious while your body is asleep, as per google:
      </p>
      <p>
       "During rapid eye movement (REM) sleep the brain has vivid dreams, while the muscles of the body are essentially turned off. While sleeping, the muscles are unable to move so that the person won't be able to act out dreams with their body. Sleep paralysis happens when a person wakes up before REM is finished."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is theoretically a person going into an astral state, but being unable to channel the frequencies of their soul/dimensional/frequency/etc being. Anything they see is a product of their mind as they are still in REM sleep as well. The threat is perceived due to basic instincts of not being able to move, its subconscious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds like you were hearing the frequency of something, either your being, or your heart, or something spiritually like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't care as I am not able to astral, or lucid dream, but I believe true astral projection is the key to ascension upon death.
      </p>
      <p>
       People speak of reincarnation, I believe reincarnation to either be caused by people who ascend and choose to come back, or people who are unable to ascend altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember reading somewhere waaaay back that tried to explain how reincarnation and having children are very much linked, I didn't read into it and wish I would have just for shits and giggles.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter what anyone says, we are extremely powerful beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have the ability to nurture each other and bring a great amount of love, we will risk our lives to protect something that is meaningless in the long run, but something we love regardless, we are evil, if there are truly "demons", they must have to take notes from humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe there is something more and simply like to look at all sides of everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or it could be as another redditor states and be some type of auditory hallucination, but unless that is something you have experienced before, and have experienced it in other contexts besides sleep/waking up, then I wouldn't read to much into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You were resonating with some type of frequency, the phone is questionable, as I have a personal opinion about archons/demons/frequency beings and technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually a bit of weirdness here.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will be okay in my opinion, the baby didn't respond negatively and you were able to get through it, it is obvious your thoughtful and nurturing, don't worry about a thing, but don't sleep with your phone close to you (at least 10 feet away on a desk or something).

       Thank you so much for such an awesome response! It's been years since I've astral projected and had many OBEs. I understand that our consciousness is not only confined to this realm, but is actually an intrinsic part of the nature of all realms. I'm also a believer in reincarnation, both by choice and by karmic circumstance. I think it's up to all of us to raise our awareness and karmic position in order to help lift the collective consciousness out of its cycle of suffering, Samara, and create "heaven on earth" if you will.
