<p>All the fentanyl on the streets originates from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-opioid-indictments/u-s-indicts-two-chinese-in-fentanyl-trafficking-case-idUSKBN1CM22B">Chinese drug manufacturers</a></p>

<p>Drawing parallels from the <a href="https://g.co/kgs/uDTZrr">opium wars in the 19th century</a> I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a far stretch to suspect that these facts are correlated. </p>

<p>As a leading member in the international community, holding a seat at the security council, China is limited in its options to attack the West by military force but as a large scale producer of opioid drugs, it can, and I believe has created equivalent human and economic casualties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought about that but if docility were the goal, the drug of choice wouldn&#39;t have shifted to something as volatile as fentanyl. Much higher rate of overdoses, rock bottom productivity.</p>

<p>I can see how maybe the government allowed pain killer abuse to slide under the radar for so long because it suited them but fentanyl is ravaging the population and is dirt cheap to score. In this scenario it&#39;s hard to make a buck off a junky or a dead person.</p>

<p>The idea was to scare people into giving up illicit drinking. Instead, by the time Prohibition ended in 1933, the federal poisoning program, by some estimates, had killed at least 10,000 people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fentanyl and other analogues have pretty much taken over the illicit opiate market. Addicts prefer it more, it&#39;s cheaper to produce, and since it&#39;s dose is way more potent by weight and has little smell it&#39;s much easier to smuggle. </p>

<p>The only downsides are the drug is now fully synthetic, meaning effect and strength vary wildly, it has to be cut and mixed perfectly for sale, and the ratio of recreational effect to respiratory depression is much closer together. Oh and I guess it also causes a build up of tolerance much more quickly and has a shorter half life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to run a research chemical business and my sources were almost exclusively China. Chinese labs have always been willing to do what it takes to get shipments through. Whether that&#39;s accepting money annonymously, lying on customs declarations and mislabeling packages, hiding the substance inside an item, and free replacement / reshipping until it makes it through customs.</p>

<p>These Chinese suppliers are usually willing to send you anything that is legal in China, doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s scheduled in the destination country.</p>

<p>The Chinese government has stepped in at times and changed the laws as well as increasing monitoring and inspection. This is usually do to political pressure. </p>

<p>For example when China wanted to host the Olympics people like the IOC, &amp; WADA said wait a minute you&#39;re the guy that manufacturers and supplies nearly 100% of the banned &amp; illicit performance enhancing &amp; steroidal drugs...wtf clean up your act! And so China did for awhile.</p>

<p>During the period when research chemicals and synthetic marijuana drugs were blowing up all over the world and countries started changing their laws I don&#39;t believe China ever did.</p>

<p>During the beginning of the Fentanyl crisis I believe Fentanyl was always illegal in China however the analogues and the precursors were not. About a couple years ago China tightened the laws on Fentanyl precursors which had a marked effect on supply in North America.</p>

<p>The thing you have to understand about China is that there are ENTIRE CITIES where the only industry is chemical and pharmaceutical production. There&#39;s entire warehouses just running away with small scale rotary evaporators, drying tables, while the precursors come delivered every day via truck and the big blocks of dry chemical are broken up by hand. It&#39;s impossible to regulate.</p>

<p>The way most of drugs like Fentanyl come over now is either in legal precursor form, small networks of acquaintances, or basically just under the table shipped in the mail. Westerner&#39;s travel to China and befriend someone who is already producing one of the grey area semi legal drugs they saw advertised on the clear net and owns one of these small scale production facilities or leases space there...then they ask em to produce whatever and boom it&#39;s in the mail scheduled delivery.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a conspiracy. Unless you think the whole chinese milk poisoning debacle was a conspiracy as well. </p>

<p>I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s a conspiracy,  I can however imaging the govt laughing their tits off while the USA struggles with this.   To be honest the USA has a culture of drug taking made legitimate through constant pharma advertising.</p>

<p>As someone from the UK I find it disturbing the amount of advertising on TV for what are essentiall drugs.  Even childrens channels on youtube sometimes feature medicine as the adverts. </p>

<p>There is more to the drug war than meets the eye. “Recent Chinese doctrine articulates the use of a wide spectrum of warfare against its adversaries, including the United States,” according to an Oct. 13, 2014, report from U.S. Army Special Operations Command.</p>

<p><strong>“Drug warfare” is one piece of this “wide spectrum of warfare,”</strong> the report states, noting that it ties to a broader Chinese military strategy meant to “destabilize an adversary.” It falls under the umbrella of “culture warfare,” which is an unconventional warfare strategy meant to decay the moral fabric of a rival nation, and thereby weaken it.</p>
