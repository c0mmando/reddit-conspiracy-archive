    <div class="md"><p>I forgot the password to my account.  There was no email associated with it.  A month ago or so, I simply created a new one.</p>

<p>Earlier today, I discovered the two month requirement.  Some of my comments were getting removed.  This was prior to the announcement.</p>

<p>I messaged the mods, explained the situation, and they unlocked my privileges. </p>

<p>I was caught by surprise.  However, they posted the new rule post haste, and fixed my situation.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see this being a real issue for most people.  It comes down to people skills.  For instance, some people wind up with a lot of traffic tickets.  I get pulled over from time to time, but no tickets.  The mods are just doing their best to police the forum.  </p>

<p>However, the second is where the possibility for mod bias comes into play. We&#39;ll see if it&#39;s truly to keep out the trolls (which I&#39;ll stupidly have good faith in it being) or if they&#39;re just using it to approve Trump dick sucking accounts. Either way, you can follow along in the <a href="https://snew.github.io/r/conspiracy/about/log">modlog</a> and see. Just look out for &quot;addcontributor&quot; as it&#39;s what allows them to whitelist an account for posting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s next approval for every comment ?
 Will be controversy when people notice comments from accounts that are less then 2 months old that disagree with stand point . I bet people&#39;s first argument will not be against the other person comment but how old there account is. </p>

<p>This sounds like Trump asking are you one of my guys before approval someone. If I&#39;m 1 month old account and I get a GOP/DEM support mod my post might get approved depending which way my comment is. If I don&#39;t believe 911 is a inside job but the mod does my post might not get approved etc. </p>

<p>I thought this sub would be against to much big brother control. Sounds like it has a deepstate controlling the strings from behind the scene :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ehhh, there&#39;s trolls from both sides.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen the obvious 4chan &quot;right wing to be edgy&quot; troll posts here and I&#39;ve seen the left wing &quot;riling up the conspiracy community to create drama&quot; troll posts.</p>

<p>They almost always come from accounts less than two months old.</p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to see how this plays out, because I think rule 13 was a great addition to cut down on the absolutely shitty posts from people who just &quot;hit and run&quot; with the self posts and shit sources.</p>

<p>But I am hesitant to see who gets whitelisted here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This whole thing is insane. The rule was changed with no notice or input from the sub, nor announced. When confronted with that uncomfortable fact from multiple users, AP creates a thread. Then makes it sticked and an announcement. Then puts it in contest mode. Then closes it for comments. </p>

<p>We put up with Flytape&#39;s brigade persecution and shenanigans after. But this is crossing some weird lines. I know for a fact there are several conversations simultaneously happening, about the moderation of this sub, and not in mod mail, with other users input. This is a conspiracy within r/conspiracy to control content and filter out &quot;undesirable&quot; content. It&#39;s a fuckin fringe sub. Some shit is going to be &quot;lacking context&quot; or inflammatory. Of course we will be trolled and brigaded. But more rules, bans handed out without discretion or explanation and more, this is really starting to stink. </p>

<p>I defended AP when he relayed all the death threats he was receiving, but either he&#39;s gone on a power trip, or this is a PTSD response. This is fucked up and I&#39;m not happy and I&#39;m even fearing that saying this will end up getting my knuckles slapped.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. They&#39;ve created a non-existent problem out of thin air and now done this to &#39;solve&#39; it.  They banned meme&#39;s because they were exactly the kind of thing that were likely to be spread quickly and to all kinds of people and open a few eyes, Took the impact away from top comments by sticking the archive link at the top so that they essentially don&#39;t exist anymore and the casual sometimes fun feel of the sub was eroded, have forced the very kind of people who are into conspiracy theories to make fucking &#39;submission statements&#39; instead of just being able to post a link which suggests something itself to like-minded folks without the need to write something out that could get them in hot water with authorities(!!!) depending on their location or future changes in law and more recently, have set their sights on eradicating &#39;politics&#39; from a conspiracy subreddit.  It&#39;s absolutely fucking clear to anybody what&#39;s going on.  Any move designed to destroy the sub sees a few supportive comments from (ironically enough) the johnny come lately users with a few token conspiracy themed submissions but generally just a post history in subs to do with sports or some shit. In fact, just after that last announcement, a few appeared and the fucking comments were locked. Time for a purge.  You would have my vote as a new mod for starters.  I&#39;d keep Mastigia but the rest need to go. Long overdue.  They are successfully sabotaging this subreddit to the point that it&#39;s becomming unrecognisable from the great place that used to function perfectly well without all their tinkering. </p>
