       SS: If the memo is a summary of a report — a ‘Cliff Note’ version — as I understand to be the case, why not release the entire report instead of just someone’s summary of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems to me the devil is always in the details. If we have an entire report we can decide what is in it rather than have someone cherrypick select parts of it to make conclusions for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which would you rather be released? Or why not release both? I dont get it. Help me understand.

       There is a procedure for releasing both and the procedure for releasing the memo is a lot easier. It could take months for the report to be declassified.

       Has the procedure to release the report been initiated? Have those with the power to do so said ‘We’re going to get the memo released now because it’s a quicker procedure but the move to declassify the entire report has begun and you can expect it by (whenever)”?

        For the last 12 months, the inspector general of the Department of Justice has been conducting a review of the FBI and DOJ’s actions related to the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.

       They're never going to release the report because it doesn't say what they claim it does. If it did it would have been released a long time ago.

       But secret meetings serve a purpose. The gov't doesn't know exactly what will come out in them. To mandate that they can only have open door meetings would have a chilling effect on investigations, and probably just lead to a lot of even

       I don't understand why everything needs to be a secret. If we are open and forthcoming about what is being discussed why the need to hide behind a closed door?Just go ahead and rip the band aid off and tell the American people what you've been doing with our tax dollars the last 100 years.  Why does the government get a free pass? They are allowed to operate without any restrictions and until the American people wake up and stop following the narrative that there are a certain amount of meetings and back room dealings that are acceptable then nothing will ever change.

       In some cases, lives are at stake. Some Russians who are suspected sources of the Steele dossier have been... mysteriously killed. Releasing sources indiscriminately would absolutely get people killed and damage the US's spying capabilities.

       The memo leaves out key details about interactions between Carter Page and Russian intelligence officers that would be considered highly classified. The Nunes memo that is being released is going to try and portray Carter Page as an innocent civillian that never engaged in clandestine activities.

       The memo is going to allege that the FISA warrant application on Carter Page included information from the Steele Dossier, without disclosing that the Dossier was paid for by DNC and Clinton sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       The memo is not going to include any information that the CIA or any other foreign intelligence community have collected on communications that Carter Page had with Russian agents before the period that the FISA warrant was approved in 2016. The memo is not going to include anything from the 2013 SVR spy ring that was used to recruit Page and collect intelligence about Page's desire to get rich through energy deals in Gazprom.

       The intel community hasn't put anything official out about Carter Page being recruited in 2013. Carter Page himself confirmed he was a target of recruitment efforts back in 2013.

       Absolutely nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carter Page was acting as an agent of a foreign government during the 2016 election and the dossier was very accurate reporting on that claim. The FISA warrants presented for Page specifically were able to get renewed into 2017 and for good reason.

       He doesn't have to be a "dangerous super spy" for there to be enough evidence to legally justify a FISA warrant on him, which is literally the only thing that matters in this situation. He could be completely absolved of all wrongdoing at this point, and still have the warrant be valid.

       Well according to some reports, the report is going to prove the Dems (Killary, Obama, DOJ, FBI heads colluded in something worse than Watergate and justified spying on Trump during the campaign and bugging the Trump tower)
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is true, absolutely 100% the people need to know and criminal charges/indictments need to happen asap. Mccabe just stepped down yesterday and the CEO of the DNC as well, so basically they know whats coming and its bad, so bad they both stepped down

       I have a YT channel where I drop videos where I discuss how a number of things are connected, for example the estrogen mimicry chemicals in Soy (Soy Lattes, Soy Milk), the chems in plastics leeching into our food/drinks, the big pharma pills that get pissed out into toilets which ends up back in the ground water and in the water supply, and the herbicide finding its way into the food supply as well, this combo of being bombarded from every angle in American food/water supply is creating a chain reaction of feminization in the culture that can be seen in a number of ways and statistics that back it. So I go on this 45 minute rant with links, sources, studies etc about, for example a topic like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       My channel ended up relatively blowing up pretty big, so I put a book out that's both free or you can buy a copy, just as a way to give back, and have 3000 downloads and sell about 3-5 a month (after amazon takes its cut though, its just peanuts, like $7 a book, plus have to pay taxes.
      </p>

       ooooof course there are

       I was looking into it for political reasons (Green Party) but didn't find any organic civic response to encourage. Lot's of angry people pointing fingers, not very many people bagging stinky slime. Always disappointing to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a pretty complex case. The ineffective civic response came when the slime started showing up in the parts of the inland irrigation system that run through populous areas. It's all ACE stuff--straight as an arrow and ugly as sin--but its been there a long time and doesn't look so bad with some growth.

       This has nothing to do with the FBI investigating Trump for colluding with Russia to help him get elected in exchange for favors. Favors such as not enforcing sanctions that were passed by Congress. Congnitative dissonance is a strong thing.

       Theres 2 memos. A democrat version and a republican one (the one being released). It seems that they both want to keep some information secret and frame what they do show to their advantage. So ya know... the usual politicing going on.

       Yeah, the difference is the Democrat memo was not reviewed by Congress, whereas the real memo showing FISA abuses by corporate slaves in FBI DOJ. Democrat memo was written to deter the actual memo requested overwhelmingly by AMERICANS.

       Well both have been under attack for political motivation. So I'd rather just wait to see what each says and in a best case scenario we get the actual report. When it comes down to it I don't think this is the silver bullet to end the Mueller investigation. I also don't think the democrats version is going to completely absolve them of some kind of wrongdoing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real problem is that these things aren't the report and we are going to get an incredibly skewed snapshot through the memo.

       There would be no Democratic memo if there were not a Republican memo. You need to calibrate your "both" sides meter. They are not the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Republicans have chosen to write up and make public a conclusory memo of cherry-picked data and interpretations (to put it as nicely as possible), so Democrats wrote up a response.
      </p>
      <p>
       Incredibly, Republicans have gagged Democrats and will only allow their partisan political propaganda out.

       Me too. I am one who has always been reasonably suspicious of "intel." I think most everything secret should be released. This current situation is the absolute worst of all worlds though. One sided releases are worse than no releases at all.

       I’ve been wondering if various leaks are happening because of the Nunes memo.  Maybe some people who saw it considered it biased and leaks are happening to counteract inaccuracies, or it’s accurate and the leaks are meant to distract/deflect/defend ahead of its release.

       Your total comfort with just spewing baseless bullshit is so revealing. You have no evidence  for literally anything you said, and apparently no grasp on reality or what actually has been factually established or has occurred in relation to Nunez's sham of a memo. But sure your being brigaded, not just down voted for having your head shoved so far up Trump's asshole that you forgot what the truth smells like.

       Trump and his Republican cronies are the ones who have been caught lying over and over again for the entirety of this, and now they're trying to push out a partisan line of bullshit while stifling the other side of the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Full transparency would be no memos and instead releasing the entirety of the underlying documents with no editorializing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second best option is to allow both memos to be released. Only releasing one is bullshit.

       Oh freaking please.  Facebook, Twitter, and all the likes of social media have come out to say their are def bots from outside countries influencing what's being read.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is just WAY too much evidence out there that supports the Russian bot theory, especially when other countries are collaborating it.  Enough with this BS "Cabal" is controlling the world, if a Cabal it is, it's probably got Russian influence considering how many billions of dollars Putin's lackey's control inside and outside of Russia.

       I don't think the hashtag was a big deal until it was publicized as a big deal.  Personally I don't see hashtags as having that much power.  There are partisan politics at play here and I'm sure this memo will do good to make the authors look better than the dems.  However, dems do the same thing so i's just politics as usual IMO.  What we need to hope is that there are facts that expose corruption.  If there is corruption on either side it needs to be seen by the people.

       They voted to release Schiff's memo to the entire House, the same process the Nunes memo went through. Schiff wanted them to vote on releasing a memo to the public that the committee hadn't even seen yet.

       Schiff lied in the press conference to make it seem like his memo was struck down. And of course his bullshit is being parroted on r/conspiracy.

       False. Schiff's memo was voted to be released to all the House members yesterday. It's going through the same process as Nunes' memo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Schiff wanted a vote on a memo that he didn't even share with the committee that was voting on it's release. He's saying he doesn't want the Nunes memo released because it's careless, but he wanted his memo released to the public before it was reviewed by the House.
      </p>

       Schiff is purely playing politics. He also said he wanted neither memo released and would only release his if the other was.

       Nice rebuttal.  Really proved me wrong there.  It's a strange phenomenon when someone's argument doesn't have ground to stand on they resort to ad hominem.  Consider my question and then try to think how a memo could protect Trump in an investigation that is based on EVIDENCE, not the feels of the American populace.

       You're misunderstanding me.  You said the FBI would do the "White House's bidding" which would mean, if guilty, they would be going against their own evidence to please the WH and not prosecute Trump.  This would imply a corrupt and partisan FBI.  That was my point.  I don't argue with your last statement.  That is correct.

       Because the memo is intended to be 1)a summary that doesn’t compromise sources and methods of the FBI and 2)a shortened version the public can read directly.  Like almost everything I’m sure it’s to some extent a political document - but that doesn’t make it false.  Can’t wait to read it!

       It's probably more of a political document than anything I would assume. Especially when you take into account that they aren't letting the minority party release a memo at the same time. Partisan fuckery at it's finest.

       The biggest problem with the memo is who is releasing it. Nunes is massively biased and as such this memo cannot be taken on faith alone. Besides this, the Republican memo is unsourced which means nothing can be independently verified.

       I won't go that far, but Nunes is obviously shilling for Trump as he has been since Trumps inauguration.

       Even before the inauguration.  He was on the transition team.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nunes was elevated to head of the Intelligence Committee by Boehner to run the Benghazi hit job on Clinton.  Disassembling facts to drive a political narrative is the only thing he knows how to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a guy who was on the transition team has crafted a memo to attack the FBI who are investigating wrong doing by the transition team.  It blows my mind when Trumpsters assert that his memo will be unquestionable fact and truth.

       He created it..... Well his staffers did at least, at his behest. It's called The Nunes Memo. The "facts" in this memo are not verifiable and thus should be taken with a huge grain of salt as it relies on the credibility of the author. Nunes has no credibility so this memo is bunk until it's verifiable.

       If you’ve paid attention to any of the news you would have seen (months ago) that he fbi and doj cleared Nunes of any wrong-doing and actually said he didn’t have to recuse himself in the first place.

        Several leftwing activist groups have filed accusations against me with the Office of Congressional Ethics. The charges are entirely false and politically motivated, and are being leveled just as the American people are beginning to learn the truth about the improper unmasking of the identities of U.S. citizens and other abuses of power. Despite the baselessness of the charges, I believe it is in the best interests of the House Intelligence Committee and the Congress for me to have Representative Mike Conaway, with assistance from Representatives Trey Gowdy and Tom Rooney, temporarily take charge of the Committee’s Russia investigation while the House Ethics Committee looks into this matter.

        Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has crowed that the House Ethics Committee "completely" cleared him in December of sharing classified information with reporters, but three people with knowledge of the investigation told The Atlantic that
        <strong>
         the panel was never able to review the relevant information and that's likely the reason the case was closed
        </strong>
        .

       <p>
        ...
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the committee was unable to figure out if the information was classified, or what exactly Nunes had seen, that's likely why they decided to close the investigation, one person told Bertrand. When asked about the accuracy of Nunes claiming he's been vindicated and how thorough the investigation really was, a spokesman for the Ethics Committee declined to comment and Nunes' office did not respond.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Hill reported on Thursday that the FBI has launched a new investigation into the Clinton Foundation which focuses on whether the Clinton’s engaged in any pay-to-play politics or other illegal activities during Clinton’s time as Secretary of State in the Obama administration.

        Clinton’s Use Of A Private Email Server
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On Thursday, The Hill published a report from John Solomon which featured former FBI director James Comey’s original draft on the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server. The draft showed that the term “gross negligence” was used multiple times and specifically said that there was evidence to conclude that Clinton committed a felony. Anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok, who texted about having an “insurance policy” against Trump’s election, softened the language in Comey’s draft so Clinton could avoid possible criminal charges.
       </p>
       <p>
        A senior law enforcement official told Solomon that the DOJ “was exploring whether any issues from that probe should be re-opened but cautioned the effort was not at the stage of a full investigation.”

        Uranium One
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered federal prosecutors at the DOJ in December to begin interviewing FBI agents about the evidence they collected during a criminal investigation into the controversial Uranium One deal, which directly involved the Clintons.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are multiple aspects at play in this investigation, from the Obama administration threatening a witness to stay quiet because they did not want him testifying to Congress because it would impact the 2016 presidential election, to the Russian officials who were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion, and money laundering directly connected to the Uranium One deal.

        The Obama Administration Ending Investigations Into Hezbollah
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In December, Politico published a bombshell report about how the Obama administration ended a massive federal investigation, dubbed “Project Cassandra,” into the Iranian-backed terrorist organization Hezbollah. The Obama administration’s decision to sabotage the investigation so it could secure the Iran nuclear deal allowed Hezbollah to traffic hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cocaine into the United States and allowed them to operate “the largest material support scheme for terrorism operations the world had ever seen.”
       </p>
       <p>
        A little over a week after the report came out, congressional leaders announced that they were launching an investigation into the Obama administration’s efforts to end the Hezbollah investigation.
        <strong>
         This could include investigating Clinton because she was Obama’s Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013 and the State Department was involved in the Obama administration’s efforts to end the investigation, according to the report.
        </strong>
        Politico reported, “Further complicating the picture was the role of the State Department, which often wanted to quash both law-enforcement actions and covert operations due to the political backlash they created.”

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Nunes and other key Republicans on the Hill sent aides or went themselves to review documents at the Justice Department, and Nunes' senior committee staffers compiled a comprehensive review of points of concern. They focused on the information the agencies used to prompt applications for warrants, Republicans familiar with their work said. Those analyses eventually became the memo

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Justice Department has suggested publicly that Nunes himself did not review the materials that formed the basis for the memo - apparently instead relying on staff to brief him. One key player is a Justice Department alum: Kashyap Patel, who had worked as a prosecutor in the Justice Department's National Security Division and was famously berated by a federal judge in Texas over his failure to wear a suit and tie.

       You can't keep demanding evidence and explanations, ignoring the responses you get, and then continue demanding more. I mean, I guess you can, but you'll very clearly paint yourself as a dishonest partisan hack.

       Here's a scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Republican who is charged with chairing a committee that oversees the FBI, writes a memo that may claim that the FBI has been corrupted and politicized by the Democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is true, it'll be a scandal that will dwarf Watergate and J Edgar Hoovers corruption scandal put together. This shit is major shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But.. the Democrats, predictably, say bullshit, the Republicans are being partisan and are attacking the FBI unfairly and abusing their power just to go after the Dems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, it's a bit of a political standoff, isn't it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do we do now? Ignore it? Take the Dems word for it? Not bother with it? Say, oh okay, not to worry, we believe in the Dems and the FBI despite the emails and the text messages, and ignore the FISA warrant that allowed Obama's administration to spy on the opposition candidate and his campaign?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are we gonna just accept that this is a corrupt banana republic and out govts can spy on any political opponent?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are we going to investigate and see where the investigation takes us?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think at the very least this warrants a fair and impartial investigation. Don't you?

       Here's another scenario:
      </p>
      <p>
       A Republican who is charged with overseeing an investigation into his superior writes a memo which implicates the very investigatory agency that is investigating his superior. This Republican has
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       proven himself to be willing to protect that very superior, and had to recuse himself for doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which scenario is simpler? Trump having committed a crime, or
       <em>
        an entire agency
       </em>
       framing him for committing a crime?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nunes has already shown himself willing to protect Trump.

        framed

       Are you suggesting that Mueller and the members of his team are all above the law?

       But I don't think Mueller was involved in Fusion GPS, the fake dossier, and the resulting FISA warrant that allowed the FBI to spy on an opposition campaign. Was he? And I don't think he was involved in the FBI's pre-determination to absolve Hillary during the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the issues involve people like Comey, McCabe, Strozk and his colleague and main squeeze. And several others.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not concerned about Mueller at all. It's the guys he hired that's the problem.

       You see, the reason I ask is that until he was investigating Trump, Mueller was well respected on both sides of the aisle. He's a lifelong Republican, and has served the country with distinction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until he started investigating Trump, that is. Now, according to the people he's investigating, he's biased and very likely a traitor. When he found out that someone on his team had written a text critical of Trump, he fired the guy... but apparently that wasn't enough. Apparently, Mueller's entire investigation is now tainted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because he did the

       of investigation into Hillary Clinton if she'd won. But now we've got Republicans complaining that any investigation into their President is a witch hunt? Please.

       They have been suggesting this. The Dems have been resisting it and accusing Trump of attacking the FBI without reason and committing an abuse of power. The DOJ and Sessions have been slow to act on it. They seem to not be ready to act on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The memo lays it all out and people who read it can determine if there is nothing to it all, like the Dems claim, or there's enough smoke to investigate if there's fire. Maybe when the facts, or at least Nunes version of the facts, are made public, maybe Sessions and the DOJ will have to act on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for all we know, the memo might be a big nothing burger. Or it may have enough in it to justify an investigation. And that investigation may come up with nothing. or it may come up with enough to put some people in jail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I find it suspicious when people resist investigations. If you're innocent, you invite investigations. If you're guilty, the last thing you need is an investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the importance this has to the very democratic foundations of the USA and the serious nature of the threat of deep state actors in the FBI and other agencies, I don't see how anyone can resist an investigation. It's too damned important to the functioning of democratic institutions.

       He's not. As far as I know he's going along with it. Even tho he's got the constitutional power to shut Mueller down any time he wants to. If Trump feared an investigation, he would have shut it down months ago. Like I said, innocents welcome investigations. Obviously he finds it a pain in the ass, but he hasn't shut it down.

       The guy is a tad busy. And he knows the Mueller investigation is a big nothing burger. I've no doubt that he will do it if the Mueller investigation doesn't self-implode shortly.

      <p>
       He still has the power to shut it down. It's been done before. I know the vast majority of people will not give a rats ass if he shuts it down. Or if his lawyer quit. In the end, the voters will get the last word in the next election. Which he is very likely to win even with Muellers circus.

       Was he not the minority chair on that committee. The Democrat majority "found nothing wrong". There was lots wrong. And if Hillary had been elected, that would have been buried even deeper.

       I can't tell if this is serious... Democrats paid 12.4 million dollars to Russian collaberators who spied on Trump. There is zero evidence of Democrats (who call Wikileaks "Russian") being right about any of this.

       Except for the evidence Mueller has to have to get multiple indictments, the guilty pleas from Flynn and Popodopolus,  Trump's sons own statements admitting meeting with Kremlin agents and getting getting funding from Russia, Steve Bannon's admissions about  treasonous and unpatriotic activities at Trump Tower, the FISA court warrant from Federal Judge,  the Trump's banking records at Deutch bank, Trump's own admissions to obstruction on twitter and on TV, the fact that Trump refuses to implement the sanction on Russia even though he is legally required to do so....... but yeah totally no evidence at all, but some hypothetical explosive blatantly partisan memo Nunez wrote to himself is legit

       The release of the memo will lead to a call for releasing the full report which shows the underlying facts. You have to start somewhere. It's all part of the plan. The democratic rebuttal memo will be released when it goes through the same process that the Nunes memo did. Should be a lot of interesting reading.

       No, they voted to not release it at the same time as the memo that has already been made available to members of Congress for the past several weeks and gone through the same vetting process.

       As stooge Cuomo (a Democrat shill) pointed out to Pelosi, she is more than welcome to read their memo on the house floor today. She refused claiming national security.

       If the memo is consistent with the rumors then it is also consistent with the evidence that has been public for coming up on a year now. The revolutionary press has covered it from the instant it began ... as a direct attack on WikiLeaks. The right-establishment press has broken dozens of major stories related to this. By choosing to publish thousands of stories base on anonymous "IC insider" stories, the left-establishment press has let its readers down badly.

       Because the democrats are allowing the DOJ to look at their memo to make sure that none of what they say actively harms an ongoing investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But either way, Republicans voted to allow house members to read it, but not allow Democrats to release. This is because Republicans want their memo to be released with no opposition to do as much damage as possible before the other side can respond.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully people will realize this and take the memo with a huge grain of salt, at least until we get the other side.

       I think it has to do with the idea that specific elected officials are in the positions to oversee the system. They sit on congressional and/or senate committees to oversee this stuff. A lot of the stuff they look at is very very sensitive. They represent or are supposed to represent the citizens best interests. It is set up this way to allow for oversight without making all the details public and possibly hampering these agencies sensitive activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm guessing that the memo is general enough to give us a good idea of what was going on, and the sources and some of the sensitive details of all this information is not out there for everyone to see. While the report will likely contain stuff that is pretty sensitive but not really important to know to understanding what went on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's about protecting legit sensitive info while still giving the true story of what's been going on at the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea is to expose the corruption without wrecking any legal cases that will need to be pursued subsequently and while not spilling state secrets or harming or exposing legitimately good sources.

       Something like that.

       If things are as bad as claimed then literally everything should be published and the American people should get to decide on how to proceed.

      <p>
       This memo and any source materials behind it, the Inspector Generals upcomming report on politicization of FBI/DOJ in lead-up to 2016 election, Trump's tax returns, Steele Dossier sources, private testimony to any judiciary/intelligence committees, literally everything that gives context to either Russia/Trump collusion or politicization of FBI/DOJ needs to be published.

       sorry, but that talking point falls flat on it's face and it's sad that so many actually buy it.

       The memo is a brief of what's in the documents without the "national security" stuff that cannot be released to the public. The DoJ has signed off on it, the Dems have seen it and as King said, he stands by it. The Dems are upset that they just don't get to edit it the way they want to edit it.

       The memo on its own is completely worthless. It was written as a partisan summary of events to fit a specific narrative. It's obvious that it's going to be inflammatory and accusatory and contain all kinds of claims that will be unverifiable unless the underlying documents are released.

       Once the memo's released, there will be a push to declassify the supporting documents. That's the ultimate goal here, and your post is proof that that's already starting to happen.

       It seems so strange to me that this entire sub wasn’t basically saying this instead of just the memo. For a sub that’s so much about just getting to the truth of something why even bother with either parties memo? Fuck it just release it all and leave it open for any jackass in the world to write a memo about the information. If it shows what Nunes says then no big deal plenty of people on this sub and everywhere will find it and post it across the web.
      </p>
      <p>
       My only question on this entire topic is what happens if the memo isn’t truthful? What if that memo is basically like some posts on here drawing random strings and connections that the source document doesn’t and it’s all just nonsense? We would never know unless the whole report gets released. I just don’t see how that benefits the truth in any way to release any partisan version?

       Republicans have wide control over what gets released. A partisan memo can spin and cherry pick data points, whereas the full report may undermine the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a classic tactic for people in power. Hype an event to set the narrative before the full story comes out. This creates a basis for confirmation bias, and people will see what they were told to see before being allowed to reach their own conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see this at work in subs like politics or TD. When bombshell reports come out of nowhere there's always confusion and misalignment. However, if people are prepped beforehand, narrative can be controlled

       Has the procedure to release the report been initiated? Have those with the power to do so said ‘We’re going to get the memo released now because it’s a quicker procedure but the move to declassify the entire report has begun and you can expect it by (whenever)”?

       The dems can go through the same steps to release their memo, as well. I would really like to see both but it doesn't seem that they are taking the steps needed to make that happen.

       That is very true. I’m curious about the memo as well. But I’m even more curious about all the documents being released. Not just the things cherry picked by a trump stooge.

       So you don't think it is HIGHLY suspicious how much Trump is resisting his own investigation?
      </p>
      <p>
       How Republicans are digging and tearing into the whole government system to defend him?

       I mean sure if evidence surfaces (and no Nunes' prepared by staffers statement isn't enough) that really provides unbiased information I'm down for it.

       Hell I have no love of Clinton or the FBI I just find it obvious how they ramp up their attacks as more suspicious things come out.

       Today Trump refused to put it bipartisan sanctions but this is a big distraction from that.

       The release of the memo will lead to a call for releasing the full report which shows the underlying facts. You have to start somewhere. It's all part of the plan. The democratic rebuttal memo will be released when it goes through the same process that the Nunes memo did. Should be a lot of interesting reading.

       Oh freaking please.  Facebook, Twitter, and all the likes of social media have come out to say their are def bots from outside countries influencing what's being read.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is just WAY too much evidence out there that supports the Russian bot theory, especially when other countries are collaborating it.  Enough with this BS "Cabal" is controlling the world, if a Cabal it is, it's probably got Russian influence considering how many billions of dollars Putin's lackey's control inside and outside of Russia.
