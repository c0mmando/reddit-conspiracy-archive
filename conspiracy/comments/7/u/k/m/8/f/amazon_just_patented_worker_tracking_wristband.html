<blockquote>
<p>What if your employer made you wear a wristband that tracked your every move, and that even nudged you via vibrations when it judged that you were doing something wrong?</p>

<p>What if your supervisor could identify every time you paused to scratch or fidget, and for how long you took a bathroom break?</p>

<p>What may sound like dystopian fiction could become a reality for Amazon warehouse workers around the world. The company won two patents on Tuesday for such a wristband, though it was unclear if Amazon planned to actually manufacture the tracking device and have employees wear it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. VPN masks traffic between source and destination. If someone on either end has access, they have your info. </p>

<p>Example: My computer &gt; VPN &gt; Work Computer (SSO) </p>

<p>Someone on my computer can see potentially everything I&#39;m doing with a keylogger/spyware. They see a lot of traffic going to <a href="http://www.corporatedomain.com">www.corporatedomain.com</a> with, potentially, my UN and PW attached. It hits the VPN, gets translated to encrypted data, forwarded to <a href="http://www.corporatedomain.com">www.corporatedomain.com</a>. And then on my company&#39;s network it now has to be checked and verified at the corporate level to make sure I have the proper access control. IT has access to this information, and it can be shared within org on a need-to-know basis. </p>

<p>The only person that can&#39;t see it is my ISP at home and the office ISP at work. My VPN sees &quot;request from detached09 to &lt;dns associated with my corp&gt;&quot; and my corp sees &quot;Request from &lt;my VPN with the login detached09 and password lulzhackme&gt; to &lt;corporate network&gt;&quot; </p>

<p>Between my VPN and the corp VPN, all that is translated is &quot;&lt;data from computer 12&gt; for &lt;Computer 842&gt;&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is more than likely for safety reasons. </p>

<p>They use a lot of automated fork trucks in their warehouses and having something on your person to tell it you are there is much safer than relying on AI to analyse video input.  I would also be useful for it to vibrate when you were about to cross the path of one of those robots.  That way you would keep yourself out of danger when walking around corners and the robots would be able to slow down before it got that close so that it can stop if it needs to.</p>

<p>I could be wrong, but I don&#39;t think this one is conspiracy material.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is an episode of Electric Dreams on prime I think that kinda is along these lines. Guy freaks out and is having some issues his employer gives him a wrist like fitbit device and ultimately near the end of the show its shown they can manipulate endorphin, adrenali etc in the body as well as monitor blood pressure, movement, blood sugar etc. If Amazon gets this through i would hazard a guess more employers would take this path in the coming years, albeit not as sci fi but yea. Also another thing concerns me is if you decide not to consent to this method of &quot;productivity tracking&quot; or w.e you could not be hired, face termination, potential loss of promotion etc. Technology, big data and corporations are slowly eroding our privacy and we are complacent. By the time we decide enough is enough the boot will already be pressed to our head.</p>
