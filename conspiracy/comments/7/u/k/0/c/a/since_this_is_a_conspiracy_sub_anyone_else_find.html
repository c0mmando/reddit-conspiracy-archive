        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So this may be all tin foil hat - but, anyone else think it&#39;s interesting that:</p>

<p>1) The FISA memo may be released today
2) Congress is starting a retreat with their families at the Greenbrier Resort.  The one with the bunker.  Which I&#39;m sure is equipped for pretty good security.
3) The GOP chartered train ran into a garbage truck yesterday.  Tunes and the families of the congressman were on the train etc.  If &#39;someone&#39; wanted to send a threatening message to the GOP congress over the release of the memo - seems like a good way to do it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know - it&#39;s interesting, surprised this sub is not really talking about this too much.  Legit or not, seems like a good topic!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How are these people &#39;on notice&#39; and who exactly is bringing them down. All I&#39;ve heard for months and months is how these deep state criminals are finally gonna get their due (which would be great but unlikely). It just seems this new demographic of under informed &#39;politics as pop culture trend&#39; types have been and continue to be duped by this bullshit and are falling for it in the worst ways. </p>

<p>The fact that there is ANY partisan arguments here is so fucking insane, but the fact that most of this place is bombarded with the exact same posts of bullshit partisan talking points is laughable. </p>

<p>It&#39;s heartbreaking to see these psyops have made a conspiracy board nothing more than a partisan shit slinging ground, while at the same time nurtures a strong anti-critical thinking culture.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not partisan. Don&#39;t give a xxxx about what party, If Burnie had ran may have voted for him. Glad I didn&#39;t -as he is part of problem, too. The core problem is extreme graft in D.C. Robbing you and me. Who is puppet masters? Why long trail of &quot;suicides&quot; following Hillary. Here is a start: I agree this is like finding out your preacher just got your 12 year old daughter pregnant. Have to overcome violation of trust before accepting reality. If only believe what above preacher says, reality is painful, at some point the truth comes out. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=arkancide&amp;amp;t=h_&amp;amp;ia=web">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=arkancide&amp;amp;t=h_&amp;amp;ia=web</a></p>
