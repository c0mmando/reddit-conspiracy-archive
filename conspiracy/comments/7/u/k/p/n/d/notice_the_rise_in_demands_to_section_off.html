       We all should already know the effectiveness of compartmentalization. Understanding how most conspiracies tie together to expose the bigger agenda is what the conspiracy community has always been about.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want to cast an extra veil to hide the bigger picture. Send in the annoying partisan shills and use that as justification to call for compartmentalization. Just as the deep state sends in their mercenary terrorist groups into a country so they can then call for invading and overthrowing a country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit...   notice the new accounts and older accounts that you have never seen before, that are cheer leading for the compartmentalization of this sub. They love to talk as if THEY represent the majority voice of this sub. Don't fall for it.

       I come here to see the shit that I CAN'T find on mainstream news sites. The last thing I want is to wade through that same garbage here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't mind seeing content here that includes US political drama but only if it's original and alternative to the drivel in the MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       We absolutely do not need this to become a news feed for every damn headline and even after sub statements that's still a lot of what's left. While there could be a bit of validity to OP statement, the "spirit" of the sub was always to spur discussion and post interesting, alternative, or original resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of these headline-oriented posts don't add much, particularly if they just link to something I can easily find on any other site.

       See what he said to you is in the same vein as this other provocateur bullshit. In one stroke he is making it seem as if you are unworthy to have input, and at the same time making himself the gatekeeper.

       Thats not whats happening though, and you are proclaiming yourself a gatekeeper. You realize what kind of low-IQ bullshit that is, right?

       Its funny how you argue against the only sarcastic thing I said and then the important part: Me calling you a gatekeeper. Which is exactly what you are doing. And you are such a troll that you wont reply to me with a retort on that point. You are defying hard-laiden concepts on this board that

       I gladly welcome your other actual political scandals that don’t regurgitate unverified claims. The things I listed are actual discussions taking place in amongst our leaders.

       What we have right now is people coming here simply to cause problems and not have discussions. Picking apart someone’s comments to pin them to a side of politics isn’t very constructive. If you agree with Donald Trump that Diet Coke tastes good, you’re a Russian bot. That’s the level we’ve sunk to on Reddit in general and especially here.

       Unverified claims in our current state of politics. Not everything is a literal or an absolute and I encourage you to understand that speech/internet commentary can be fluid. All you’re doing by choosing to interpret what I said this way is making an actual conversation more difficult. This is the type of comment dissection I was referring to. You’ve taken something I said into a context that suits your desire to downplay another user. What purpose does this serve when you easily knew what I meant?

       I agree. I love to talk about real political conspiracies. CIA dope smuggling. The Bush family and their history, etc... All these things are great topics. It becomes annoying when you are critical of Prescott Bush’s involvement in various things and then you get brigaded and called a Trump supporter.

       I despise all facets of politics in America to the point that I would consider myself somewhere between libertarian and anarchist. This country is beyond corrupt.

       It's funny you assuume I'm a liberal cause I'm critical of Trump. Just so you know I lean right. Just like Mueller that was appointed to FBI head by George W and considered for the job again by Trump.

       I see where you're coming from, but if we want to start dividing up conspiracies to a set of categories, we might as well do away with
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and use a sub like
       <a href="/r/fringeconspiracy">
        /r/fringeconspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I don't think dividing it up in that manner is necessary, but it's up to the mods and community as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm here for all the conspiracies, and if there's something I don't find interesting, like chem trails or reptilian illuminati, I just don't look at it. That's the ability of freedom of choice we all have.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate the censorship in places like /r/ politics, or
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       , and I know I see a lot of people here saying the same thing about those subs. Do we really want to sink to their level because some people can't get over seeing political conspiracies in their feeds?

       Nobody wants to censor political conspiracies. People want to clean the sub of political partisanship because the vast majority of r/conspiracy members intuitively know that both sides of the political spectrum are bought, paid for and corrupted by corporate, financial and

       So your two replies so far: one claiming there are a bunch of political shit posts (there aren't,) and one calling people low IQ provocateurs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the nature of a sub that focuses on the criminality of the ruling class, there will be many different kinds of attempts to stifle discussion and the flow of information, as we all are aware.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stream of concern posts about politics on r/conspiracy has been constant since the last presidential election. There are several conspiracies that have been spawned from these events. The influx of people who want to focus on political conspiracies is something we should accept and take as an opportunity to introduce new layers of conspiracy culture.

       Of course there are political conspiracies…lots of them. But partisan bickering about which self entitled, elite douche-bag is better is not a conspiracy. It's a fn circle-jerk which completely misses the point…which is…neither party cares more about you than they do their financial backers.

       Im not an american. Dont live in america. Dont particularly care who you voted in as your pres. All the other stuff, US politics related republicans democrats its not a part of my life in any way.

       Its tiring seeing never ending posts about the minutia of detail about american politics. People are still bitching about how obama was not an american. O.F.F.Sakes. he was your president for 8 years. I dont get it.

       Anyhow. Keep the american politics to an american sub.

       Thats my opinion.

       As a Canadian, every time the elephants smarts we smell the stink…so it's old hat for us to be inundated with US politics…but you make an excellent point.

       Conspiracy traverses all borders and boundaries and the constant influx of partisan US political posts would be most annoying to those outside of N.A.

       Yes, agreed. The recent "cheerleading" for removal of politics doesn't pass the "Who benefits?" smell test.

       A member of the community? Isn’t that how subreddits work? You’re free to do the same, which is exactly what you’re doing in the op. And yet you are attacking him for disagreeing?
