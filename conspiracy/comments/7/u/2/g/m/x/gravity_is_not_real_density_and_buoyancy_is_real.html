       The Theory of Gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets dissect this theory, shall we?
      </p>
      <p>
       First, I ask for evidence that mass attracts mass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oops! It does not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no real experiment to prove that mass attracts mass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats why it is called the
       <em>
        theory
       </em>
       of gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I am sure there are people reading this just screaming in their heads, but things fall!
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, but its just due to density.
      </p>
      <p>
       A microphone will drop because it is more dense than the air around it.
      </p>
      <p>
       A balloon will float up because it is less dense than the air around it.
      </p>
      <p>
       A rock will sink in water because it is more dense than water.
      </p>
      <p>
       A chunk of wood will float up in water because it is less dense than water.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is measurable, observable and repeatable.
       <em>
        That
       </em>
       is science.
      </p>
      <p>
       But saying that things fall because there is a force pulling them down to Earth is not provable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Cavendish experiment allegedly shows gravitational forces at work.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is basically a rod suspended from a string with weights on either end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, more weights are placed near the suspended ones, and all the weights are supposed to touch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Presumably due to gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, in most videos I have seen displaying the Cavendish experiment, every person had a lot of trouble getting the suspended rod in the middle to stay put. It was always moving, even without the extra weights that are placed near the suspended ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       So is gravity really at work?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does this experiment really prove anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.school-for-champions.com/science/gravitation_cavendish_experiment.htm#.WnCfhZM-eRs">
        Here is a link
       </a>
       to an article explaining the experiment and a quote from the link below
      </p>
      <p>
       "The setup consisted of a torsion balance to attract lead balls together, measuring the torque on a wire and then equating it to the gravitational force between the balls. Then by a complex derivation, G = 2π2LθRe2/T2M was determined."
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pSkz4zmcpY">
        Here is a link
       </a>
       to a video allegedly displaying the force of gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if this is gravity at work, is it counteracting Earths supposedly massive gravitational pull?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is the gravity from Earth not simply keeping the weights where they are, as the pull downwards should be much greater than the pull left or right, should it not?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11sLusnVZwM">
        Here is a link
       </a>
       to another video attempting to re create the cavendish experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym6nlwvQZnE">
        Here is a link
       </a>
       to a much older video displaying the cavendish and other experiments
      </p>
      <p>
       If this experiment is so easy, why is it that I have only heard about it after my own research?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is this experiment not shown in every school?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are too many variables at play, in my opinion, and it is not reliably repeatable, that's why.
      </p>
      <p>
       Experiments aside, I have questions about how science views gravity in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Earths gravity is strong enough to hold millions of gallons of ocean water to the sea floor, then how can a little sparrow fly high over the oceans?
      </p>
      <p>
       How does gravity even effect water?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do they say the Moon is held in by Earths gravity, but the Moon is strong enough to pull on Earths oceans?
      </p>
      <p>
       Gravity is not holding the universe together.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is just a lie.

       i think rotating frames of reference will probably be shown to have a much more significance than we currently place on them.  btw, the cavendish experiment also involved rotating frames of reference - just a smell.

       I am a fan of the theory that rotational velocity does indeed have an effect on the surrounding space time in such a way that there is an effect created. Theoretically with enough velocity, and a large enough 'object' there would be a vortex like distortion where the outside edges of say a spiral galaxy would, even at the speed of light, 'lag' relative to the rotation at the galaxies core, placing a stress or stretch on the very fabric of space time... And you could theorise that the pull inward is due to a literal sort of buoyancy or density difference in the fabric of space time itself along this plane of rotation... Just some thoughts.

       yeah.  if you model out a thing accelerating in a circle you get a component vector that's radial, orthogonal to the motion itself.  so right off the bat you have, with rotation, the characteristic of creating forces that are at right angles to each other.  then if you look at empirical work like the stuff john hutchinson was doing, he demonstrated that the interactions between rotating mag fields that intersect (btw, i think this is the fundamental design underlying physics) you get levitation amongst other things (ie. forces orthogonal to the fields).  and similarly if you look at conservation of momentum (including angular momentum) you see that it enables things like gyroscopes which seem to also not obey what we'd traditionally think of as newtonian laws.  and this is because as you tilt a spinning thing and you restrict its degree of motion on one axis, it will start to spin in an orthogonal axis.  this is very fundamental, imo, to the actual model of everything.  you have spinning frames that are intersected with other spinning frames, such that the axis of rotation of the second thing goes thru the centre of rotation of the first thing.  and in terms of things like time travel.  if you restrict degrees of freedom in all 3d dimensions with a thing with high angular momentum (and i think you can do this with magnetic and electric fields) you would theoretically create movement along an axis orthogonal to those 3 dimensions - in other words, time.  which lends to the idea that timespace is a mutable hypercube.  which i think it is.

       You are dumb. That's the reason. You didn't have an attention span in High school so when the physics test came up you were sitting there wondering why all these letter where numbers are suppose to go. You dont understand it so you refuse to try and learn it. Its easier to call it fake and made up because thats all youre able to come up with. Put me or anyone else who is willing to learn in a physics class next to you and we'd pass. You would fail. Actually come to think about it you did fail because you don't know what gravity is. Your dumbass probably doesn't believe in oxygen cause you can't see it.

       think about what you are saying.... you are "some guy on reddit" dismissing millions of scientists' work, research, and re-work--building on centuries of the same process--but also you are convinced of your own belief? how arrogant. you are either a troll or a fool.

       That's science, you think you'll get anywhere without questioning everything? You'll take us back to the dark ages with your inability to think outside of the box without thinking everything is right or wrong. Thinking and doubting and making sure those trying to convince you are right is the job of those "scientists".

       Personally I believe institutional science is currupt and not being real with the public about new findings and theories.

       i think questioning everything generally will find that parts of our model are correct and parts could sustain vast improvement. that's literally what science is---questioning everything. you question the bible though, right? science me some bible real quick, but break out the old testament and tell me about lot and his daughters, if you would.

       sure dude. apparently you've not seen space station videos inwhich zero G conditions allow water to gravitate towards itself (its own mass), or the largest object to which it is connected. go look up any ISS video with water involved and you can observe mass attracting mass with the control of Earth's gravitational field removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       let me guess tho, the videos are all faked and so they don't count as evidence?

       It is the theory that most accurately explains our observations, it has been used to predict future movements of planets, can predict the speed of a dropping ball, I challenge you to come up with a more accurate theory. This is why it's accepted.

       What I am trying to tell you is yes, the theory of gravity explains what we see, things fall, things fall faster the longer they fall yada yada, but then you are expected to take that and believe it holds water to a ball. Or holds planets in perfect synchronous motion for millennia. Or allow planes to fly level all around a ball without adjusting their trajectory. Its a magic force that you have been duped in to believing holds the universe together when a much more simple explanation exists, but we are brainwashed in to dismissing as incomplete and wrong.

       No. You can create logical steps to explain all of those things using gravity/other forces. You just haven't bothered to even look it up/do some real fucking research. You just dismiss it as bullshit on surface value.

       You have given multiple theories in your ramblings on this thread, like in your OP "Yes, but its just due to density." Are you fucking serious? Do you have any data to back up these claims you're making? It's all laughable.

        but then you are expected to take that and believe it holds water to a ball.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That ball would need sufficient mass, and you'd need enough water. You'd also need to counteract any overwhelming gravitational fields in the vicinity, so this doesn't work on planetary surfaces since both the ball and the water will be pulled far harder into the planet than into each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also more complicated because gravity is not a strong force compared to the other three. If you took a golf ball and some water droplets outside the ISS, they'd stick together, but that's intermolecular forces, which is much stronger than gravity at that scale. For gravity to be significant we're talking about lakes and moons really, like what you see on Titan, not golf balls and droplets.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also need to be aware of the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit">
        Roche Limit
       </a>
       at this point. This is essentially explained the same way as the explanation why you can't be on a planetary surface. If you get too close, the whole thing gets torn apart into rings.

       Our solar system is estimated at
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System">
        4.6 billion
       </a>
       years old, so millennia is a very short timescale. That said, orbits are not
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_of_the_Solar_System">
        predictable over the long term
       </a>
       because small gravitational perturbations and are chaotic in nature.

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariable_plane">
        invariable plane
       </a>
       of the Solar system (the orbits are nearly concentric), as well as the consistent rotational direction is not a gravitational effect. Rather, it's because the nebula that collapses and eventually formed the Solar system
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System">
        was spinning
       </a>
       , so conservation of angular momentum kept things relatively in line and spinning the same direction.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They do adjust their trajectory. This is based on the
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_indicator">
        artificial horizon
       </a>
       in the cockpit. That instrument is one of the most important for any pilot and uses gyros and a bit of other mechanical fancy to tell the pilot where his nose is pointing with respect to the horizon. This requires down on the instrument always being the direction of gravitation, which means that this instrument is key to the adjustment.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't really noticeable on long haul flights because planes are not moving anywhere near fast enough for this to cause much of an acceleration. Rest assured though, if this adjustment was not made, gravity would slowly pull everything towards the back of the plane until the plane eventually reaches too high an altitude and stalls. Obviously this is an undesired event for any pilot.

       I'm asking because I'm getting convinced you're not open to questioning that belief. If you can't be open minded about the problem then there's no point in discussing.

      <p>
       So again, what specifically are you looking for as proof of gravitation? And I mean something that you can't explain away as fabricated evidence. 
Because if that's what you're going to do, no point in discussing.

       Finally, what's the huge difference to you between observing an existing planet with water stuck to it and building one? It's not like humanity goes around building stars to experiment with them.

       One suggestion I have for you is that if you're attempting to convince other people of something, you have to be willing to meet them at their level. It doesn't mean accepting their views, but it does mean at least entertaining them. This is why I refer back to buoyancy so much when talking with you.

       If a single grain of sand is heavy enough to sink to the bottom of my glass of water, then why does my 1 Inch cube of ice float?
      </p>
      <p>
       Birds can fly because they are light and are able to propel themselves with their wings and air flow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as water evaporates, gets lighter, floats up and becomes clouds. Once it is too heavy, it comes back down again as rain.

       I truly honestly believe you should kill your self. You are part of the willful ignorance that this world is full of. If you're too close minded to go buy a basic textbook while claiming we are parrots repeating what we learn, there's nothing we can do you for you. May I suggest falling off a building. Right before you splatter everywhere you'll blissfully be thinking I'm not going to die because gravity doesn't exist.

       Gravity is not real. It's electrostatic holding everything to the earth. The earth is a battery more than a magnet. The battery creates a magnetic field which attracts evrything, including water, also in a vacumm things fall at the same speed and if they were being pushed down because of density they would otherwise float(although I believe the density of the object co-relates with the weight of the object because the object would be more highly charged (more electrons) thus pulled with more force from the electromagnetic pull).

       What happens to shielded object? We can stop EM and magnetic fields, dow objects blocked from these fields lose weight or float?

       It's pulling the electrons in your atoms, what are you gonna make which will shield that?
      </p>
      <p>
       The earth is structurally very similar to an atom. We live in the nucleous of the atom, ionosphere is most likely the second valence shell on the earth. More?
      </p>
      <p>
       The sun is also the nucleus of another atom, obviously in a "higher level" we just see it differently from our perspective but it's probably a huge atom, and planets are "electrons". Higher level sun's have more planets is what I'm guessing. And finally.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are probably atoms who decided to experience life, from the perspective of humans( still working on this theory), the "chakras"  are energy balls "electrons" and as we grow in conciousness, our "selves(atom/Adam)" gains electrons and so we "unlock/open chakras".  Interesting new perspective.

       I have a theory on this which I'm still trying to figure out, it's a great question and atoms probably do fall apart when they lose all electrons. Obviously I don't agree with all of mainstream science, so you trying to prove me wrong with their numbers instead of logic is kinda futile.

       Don't worry about the haters. Their reality is based on theory and clever manipulation of mathematical formulas not based on the real world; handed to them by occultists who decided to call it a sphere prior to having the rocket technology to fly up high enough and confirm. Sun worshippers in disguise.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought the Scientific method was empirical or measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning; and very repeatable. What happened to going out to prove your theories in the real world? Nope, it made sense on paper, so we called it a day!
      </p>
      <p>
       P.s. Water lays flat in our cup, in our tub, in our pool, in our lake, and it is thus safe to say, in our oceans as well...since 70%+ of the planet is ocean, then it should be clear, obvious, and simple to conclude that we are on a flat surface. What kind of flat? I don't know, but it is definitely not a rotating sphere.

       I didn't ask you to believe that Jesus Christ is Lord and Savior did I? I do not subscribe to that; however, believing in The Creator is no longer an option at this point. To each their own. Have a good life.

I've got 8 years of martial arts under my belt, and believe me, I would not hesitate to use all 6' 195 lbs of disciplined muscle to put you and weasels like you in your place for the dirty, insulting mouths you have. You little big tough keyboard warrior. Proud of yourself?

       It's a small point, but observation cannot be a priori. Since a priori means before experience. A posteriori is the one you're looking for.

       I'm no conspiracist, the earth is round and gravity is real, but those photos look badly photoshopped to me for whatever reason. I think it's the way the light hits the bases of the pylons, they look superimposed on the water.

       I think he chose a bad fixed camera position, he could've drove a bit further from East through West.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly it's a
       <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/attachments/20170722-185524-apvma-jpg.27881/">
        very distorted picture
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       They should take a

        pic and video
       </a>
       with the building clear in the background,  and better equipment with MUCH better zoom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the curvature becomes apparent at
       <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/data/MetaMirrorCache/d3024eed228cdb781223b0c872643aaf.jpg">
        the end of the horizon.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The direct video that you linked seems a bit dishonest to me. And I tell you why
      </p>
      <p>
       The video starts of with the 'globe shill' picture that is cropped and already far far zoomed in on the horizon. Because it's cropped it seems like it starts from the car.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just where the 'flat earth' shill' starts his video at that point in the video, which is completely zoomed out.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the viewer it's like both were started from the same perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except he never even reaches the zoom and  level of resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pause the video at
       <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/attachments/20170722-185524-apvma-jpg.27881/">
        2:13
       </a>
       It is after that endpoint where he should zoom in. Compare 2:13 and the pictures for yourself, you'll see it because of the towering building.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is MUCH MUCH farther away by the way then it looks 
.  That is the furthest he could zoom..much farther after that point you would
       <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/data/MetaMirrorCache/d3024eed228cdb781223b0c872643aaf.jpg">
        clearly see the curvature
       </a>
       and rule out any distortion.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end of the video he is playing with perspective again and comparing it with their blurry flat pic.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you're right, your second video proves the Earth is flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this video proves Earth isn't flat. They need to bring better equipment.

       That's a pretty plain sentence. Humans exist at a single observational level, an infinitely large circle is going to look like a straight line to anyone observing it.

       A person looking at a sufficiently large circle will not be able to perceive any curvature. It will effectively be a straight line to them as long as the scale is large enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why you are talking about an "infinite circle" or how you (or anyone) would have a concrete idea of what that means to observe.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that you are expecting people to except you bizarre language as matter of fact. And in that way I see how some flat earthers or other idiots would be put off from science when you are carrying forward this pretention that everyone should automatically understand what you are saying when you say something crazy. That's what I mean by speaking plainly. Your hypotheticals help no one. And at the end that's all communication is, trying to help another person understand you.

       Why does the ocean need to curve exactly?

       My point is that a circle can be be so big that the only part we can see will be flat. That doesn't make it any less a circle just because we don't have the frame of reference or tools to to observe more.

       Until you realize ballins pop at a certain altitude and crash back down. Not nearly enough time and enough equipment to gather any amount of viable data they are looking for. That's why they use a satellite, it's bigger, has more equipment, can stay in orbit for far longer, and has little threat of destruction.

       We have Livestreams and videos taken from satellites that orbit earth. Satellites are incredibly small compared to earth so taking a image from space or from earth isn't gonna show any satellites. But that doesn't mean they don't exist. You're on the verge of "if I don't see it myself, it doesn't exist" mentally.

       But what difference does that make? Sounds like Nasa issues not gravity issues.  All satellite orbits degrade over time, so if its not gravity, what causes that to happen?

       Drag. Space isn't a perfect vacuum, there's still air. For a satellite to stay in orbit it has to be going fast enough horizontally to "miss" the earth (that's an over simplification of orbits but works enough for this). If it's running into air that is going to exert a small horizontal force slowing the satellite down, like how a baseball slows down after you throw it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more the satellite slows down the lower it sinks into denser air and the more it's slowed down. There's not a lot of air but satellites are big and moving at pretty damn fast so it's smashing through a lot of air and over time that's enough

       If density is what pulled things to earth then their acceleration would be dependent on their density vs the density of environment they are "falling" in. In a vacuum, things fall at the same rate. This shows that density does not dictate the rate at which things fall. If your argument is that creating a zero density environment negates differences in density, then you can run an experiment outside of a vacuum. If you drop a bowling ball and a baseball, different densities, they would fall at the same rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a "law" of gravity. The law basically stating there is a force of attraction between two objects with mass and it can be calculated and proven.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is a "theory" of gravity. The "theory" part is trying to explain why the "law" of gravity works.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL/DR:
      </p>
      <p>
       Gravitation Law (what): There is a force of attraction between objects
Theory of Gravity(why): What drives the force of attractions between objects

       Err non-vacuums will produce drag. If you used a regular size bowling ball and a regular sized baseball and then dropped them, you'd see a (very slight) difference in fall rate, just because of their size and shape difference.

       Just take two objects of equal shape and size, but different densities, and then drop them in a non-vacuum.

       You assume there exists only 1 flat earth model (dome). This is not a valid assumption, although it is the most popular model out there, it is not the only one. For example:

       Ah yes forgive me, I forgot about the "two giant spacetime portals" option. Occam's razor be damned.
      </p>
      <p>
       The model still doesn't work though since viewing angles of stars (if they worked like this) wouldn't match with reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I just want to point out a mistake this guy made about the Sphere model. He stated that the celestial equator should follow an individual from latitude to latitude if we were living on a sphere. This is false. An observer would be tilted by an angle equal to whatever latitude they were at. This would change the apparent position of the celestial equator. What he disproved was whether or not Earth was a cylinder. I mean for gods sake, he pulls away at 6:20 and reveals that we were looking at things from the inside of a cylinder, not the surface of a sphere.

       <em>
        tilted
       </em>
       , spinning globe model, everyone, from all latitudes, would observe the same celestial equator, as we do in reality? Silly question perhaps: isn't that impossible knowing the planet is a ball with 2 sides not able to view the same sky at one time? And what about time-lapse showing perfect separation between the stars? Constellations in perfect order for all of recorded history? Oh, yeah, they're "infinitely far away", right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok. Perhaps his model might not be 100% accurately representing the stars as viewed from all angels around a spinning globe, but the concept doesn't change, or at least not to where you can prove that everyone on a spinning ball sees the same celestial equator. The opposite is true on a spinning ball; you should have a unique celestial equator. In fact, how many different directions are we rotating? 3? 4?

        EDIT: I believe you confused the rotating circles with the shape of the planet. The rotating circles are stars as viewed from the planet, according to your spinning ball theory. How should they be represented instead?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You're right I was confused. I thought the guy was arguing about where in the sky an individual at a certain latitude would view the celestial equator, not that people would be viewing a DIFFERENT celestial equator depending on the latitude. Yes though, it does have to with the distance between us and the stars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step into my world for a second. The Earth has a radius of about 6,371 km. Let's use Alpha Aquarii as our target star. It's nearly directly on top of the Celestial equator and 520 light years (4.92x10
       <sup>
        15
       </sup>
       km) away from Earth. If a person views Alpha Aquarii from the equator, and then travels to a pole, how much will the viewing angle change? You'll have an increase of 6371 in both the X and Y directions. Using trigonometry that works out to 1.29×10
       <sup>
        -12
       </sup>
       degrees. From pole to pole you've got 2.57×10
       <sup>
        -12
       </sup>
       degrees. That is the maximum amount of "uniqueness" when it comes to that star. Good luck discerning that with the naked eye. It doesn't get much better even when you're dealing with much closer stars. That's why the celestial equator looks the same to everyone.

       'Astronomical numbers,' eh? Things no human can actually confirm. And have not confirmed. Or am I mistaken? How can you say that with confidence? I know I couldn't, however, if you do take that as truth, then I would definitely agree that the math would then confirm that a change in latitude would not cause a significant effect on the viewing angle of said star. This is where the math ends up confirming assumptions, which is the case with your specific example. Obviously, the globe model works, if and only if, your assumption that 'stars are infinitely far away'. How do they make these 'light year' measurements? What instruments are they using?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you read "Kings Dethroned" by Gerrard Hickson? I think you should check it out. It will show you how they couldn't figure out distance to stars, even after they accepted the helio model, and where, why the method of triangulation fails. No one questioned this issue, yet assumed and promoted that stars were 'infinitely' far away. One thing I noticed about modern astronomy is: no one can confirm the claims being made without assumptions. Even a thing as simple as a picture of the spinning ball gets you CGI, photoshop, or fisheye. This to me is disturbing. I do admit that, by making assumptions (i.e. stars are 'x light years away'), then you would plug your numbers in math formulas that confirm your assumptions.

       Based on assumption of distance to stars? Maybe. It is not as simple as you made it seem, although you are giving it a fair attempt. That's all you can do, really. Thanks.

       Then you probably shouldn't be trying to argue against it when clearly you don't understand basic definitions.  Work in physics is a pretty basic concept. It's like when someone up higher in this thread was saying orbits are too perfect, clearly they don't know the theories (and theory in this context means more than just a guess) behind how orbits form cause they were saying angular momentum and conservation of  energy/momentum arent that accurate, but actually the idea is pretty straightforward.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you ever hope to gain traction to disprove a major tenant of modern science if you don't even understand some of these basic principles?

        Now, in most videos I have seen displaying the Cavendish experiment, every person had a lot of trouble getting the suspended rod in the middle to stay put. It was always moving, even without the extra weights that are placed near the suspended ones.

       Looking at relatively shitty recreations of the experiment is a bad idea. More modern, professional recreations attempt to reduce any other outside variables.

       <strong>
        Now it's time for my questions.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say for a moment that gravity doesn't actually exist and that the forces we usually attribute to gravity are the result of Density and Buoyancy. Firstly, buoyancy is dependent upon gravity, so I don't even understand how you can argue that. So let's instead focus on Density. Why is it that all objects choose to go towards the ground? Why not up? Why not to the left? Imagine a circular object with a certain density. Imagine it was in a fluid with a lower density and that this fluid went on for infinity in every direction with no changes in density. Where would the ball go? Would it start moving? Why? Why would it choose any one direction over any other possibility? If you want, go perform an experiment. Isolate a ball in some homogeneous fluid. Regardless of how you tilt the container, the ball will always go towards the ground. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh ya also things still fall in vacuums. Why?

       The Moon turns. It's just tidally locked with the Earth. The time it takes to orbit Earth is the same time it takes the spin on it's axis.

       What exactly is improbable? Orbits? Those are everywhere. Earth's orbit isn't all that perfect either. The Moon is moving away from us, tidal forces are slowing down our rotation and we're progressively moving away from the Sun. They're all slow processes, inconsequential from the perspective of a single human lifetime, but they exist.

       So precision is why you doubt that gravity exists? What would make it any better if gravity didn’t exist? It would still be just as unlikely, except we wouldn’t even be able to explain it because there would be no unifying force. Density and buoyancy don’t work how you think they do.

       I'm not saying gravity is density and buoyancy. Also I'm not saying I know what the answer is but it's obvious that gravity is just a place holder for something else, and yes it would be great if people accepted and understood that we actually don't understand how gravity works.

       no we actually dont. we can predict/describe effects gravity has, aswell as proove that gravity exists, etc.

       but how gravity in itself works is still being studied. The most accepted theory is probably the graviton, wich we still need to confirm/find.

        how do you explain the earth going AROUND the sun and the moon also going AROUND the earth so precisily that it doesn't even turn.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm not sure what you mean by "doesn't even turn," but the reason why planetary objects orbit stars/larger planetary objects is because they are traveling at immensely high speeds but are being pulled on by the gravity of the larger object.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, if there was no gravity, the object would be going straight (or relatively straight). The gravity is pulling on it, but it's speed/momentum is so strong that it becomes locked in a roughly circular path.

       There are a literal ton of things wrong with the density claim. The fact that some people believe it as a valid explanation as to why things fall... is mind blowing.

       It all goes back to the Flat Earth. They don't like Gravity since it breaks their model.

       Neither of the videos you show are good videos, neither of them are in a vacuum. simply the air moving around the room is free to push the object around. but that does not disprove gravity.

       The sparrow is using uplift to be lighter than air. the same way airplanes do, or the same way fish are for that sake.

       If you put the sparrow in a vacuum it would plummet to the ground.

       I think what OP is doing is applying some the properties of gravity to density. I'm guessing OP thinks that density is perhaps a force, that a humming bird can perhaps overcome with it's wings to perhaps overcome that force pushing it down which is
       <del>
        gravity

       density.

       Because only only applies/knows some of the theories of gravity to density. He isn't aware that the bigger the masses, the more they attract to one another, and the more weight force is applied downwards. So yes, the humming bird is attracted to earth, likewise is the earth attracted to the humming bird, but when you do simple equations such f = m x d, the force of the huming bird attracting the earth is miniscule, and through f = m g the force that earth is attracting the huming bird is also pretty small(doesn't require much to overcome that), whereas in comparison, the ocean's water would be huuuuge

       Because it has nothing to be buoyant against. Unless you are suggesting objects are attracted down because of other forces.

      <p>
       So which is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do objects fall down because they are heavier than air or because of another force attracting it down?

       What effect does a vacuum have on an object?

      <p>
       If I splashed some water on a balloon and the balloon still sat on the ground should I say that the balloon is heavier than water?

      <p>
       No...

       Not at the same time, one is magnitudes more dense than the other and still falls at the same speed. You're saying this weight differently because of different densities, how do you explain different weights then?

       Adding more air to the chamber WOULD make the object buoyant. Once you get enough WEIGHT of air into the chamber it will become heavier than the object and the object will float.

       A theory is a web of interconnected, provable and repeatable facts which, when taken together, lead you to a logical conclusion. The theory of gravity says that all objects in the universe are attracted towars each other, the scale of the force depending on how near they are, and how massive they are. The Earth is very near and very massive, so it exerts a large gravitational force, pulling us towards it. We conclude that gravity is the Earth pulling us 'downwards'. A theory is not some bizarre idea a bunch of scientists came up with after a night drinking tequila.

       Also if this is to do with density then they are claiming a Sparrow is less dense than air? How do they explain a Sparrow landing? It changes it's density? Why even bother with wings?

       If your theory holds true, then I should be able to float objects in bottles of super compressed air. Making the air extremely dense does not allow light objects to float within it. Gravity wins.

       You know what, this pisses me off. Listen you stupid piece of shit, if you want to sit here and claim that Gravity isn't real then you need to go ahead and break down every single use of gravity that we've used, and create a new system of equations that literally explains everything. You want to sit here and pretend like the Universe doesn't have gravity, show me the math.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't tell us that we have to prove to you that gravity is real because we already know gravity is real. We literally used gravity to launch a satellite beyond Pluto. Please explain in mathematical form how we did that, without the use of gravity. Or are you one of those stupid mouth breathers who thinks we live on a giant sky pizza protected in a snow globe created by your magical sky wizard.

       The direction things go when they're more dense than other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine you were above a flat table top and dropped something. If it's heavier than air (?) It goes down through the not very dense air and rests on the table top (the Earth) because the table top is more dense. Density works almost the same as gravity but gravity is fictional apparently so we just take the properties of gravity and apply them to density (i.e idiot gravity) and boom! Things go down.

       <p>
        While the law lets us calculate quite a bit about what happens, notice that &gt;it does not tell us anything about WHY it happens. That is what theories &gt;are for. In the language of science, the word "theory" is used to describe &gt;an explanation of why and how things happen. For gravity, we use &gt;Einstein's Theory of General Relativity to explain why things fall.
       </p>
       <p>
        A theory starts as one or more hypotheses, untested ideas about why &gt;something happens. For example, I might propose a hypothesis that the &gt;object that you released fell because it was pulled by the Earth's magnetic &gt;field. Once we started testing, it would not take long to find out that my &gt;hypothesis was not supported by the evidence. Non-magnetic objects fall &gt;at the same rate as magnetic objects. Because it was not supported by the &gt;evidence, my hypothesis does not gain the status of being a theory. To &gt;become a scientific theory, an idea must be thoroughly tested, and must &gt;be an accurate and predictive description of the natural world.
       </p>
       <p>
        While laws rarely change, theories change frequently as new evidence is &gt;discovered. Instead of being discarded due to new evidence, theories are &gt;often revised to include the new evidence in their explanation. The Theory &gt;of General Relativity has adapted as new technologies and new evidence &gt;have expanded our view of the universe.
       </p>
       <p>
        So when we are scientifically discussing gravity, we can talk about the law &gt;of gravity that describes the attraction between two objects, and we can &gt;also talk about the theory of gravity that describes why the objects attract &gt;each other.

       The point is, we as people have proven to understand almost everything of gravity (Moon landings, Voyager, planes). Or buoyancy, whatever you want to call it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thousands of people have archieved insane things, with the use of our understanding of gravity. You have not archieved a single thing, with your "understanding" of buoyancy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that seems unfair. But people predicted orbits were possible long before we actually reached orbit. So I challenge you to predict something that is possible in your world.

        Ok, wow, that is VERY flat.  Maybe a little too flat?
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I have no idea if their distance measurements are correct.  I seriously doubt that is only 2.9 miles to the horizon, my bet is closer to 10 miles total although the last several miles of that is going to be just a few pixels in this image and you can probably only make out details for about 1 mile.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don't trust memes, Flat Earther memes least of all, so I did an image search and found this was the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway taken by Robert Holmes.

      <p>
       You can find that image in several locations, for example, at
       <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iN_JuJwb63c/WECeYyid9sI/AAAAAAAACsk/SEewA47dE1w9NvheKRbh5SdTForKYDLJgCLcB/s640/lake-pontchartrain-causeway-15.jpg">
        Travel and Leisure here:
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet you can ALREADY see the issue.  When we compress the width down to 10% on this image
       <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kMvv2MmnqyQ/WECfVij_WfI/AAAAAAAACsw/n3PcuY53nc8uneJPSGDRSWV0JnwB5VyzwCLcB/s200/lake-pontchartrain-causeway-curved.jpg">
        we can readily see the curve in the image, as plain as day.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So someone took this image and FAKED IT to make their little meme work.  That had to be a purposeful act so this is a Flat Out Lie.

       This is actually super easy to disprove, all I need is a glass of water, a pebble, and a piece of wood. So, we know that the wood will float on the water, and the pebble will sink, so clearly the pebble is more dense than the water, so the pebble will sink through the wood according to your hypothesis. Since this doesn't happen your hypothesis is false. Some people in here are making this way too complicated.

       Why do you think a pebble should magically phase through wood?
      </p>
      <p>
       Air and water are very similar, both are fluids, both conform to shapes, allowing things to pass through them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wood is not a fluid. Wood is hard and dense. Wood passes through things, not the other way around. Same with pebbles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Water is more dense than air, so water is always at the bottom of things, flat and level. Air is less dense than water so it is above the water, but does it pass through it? No, because it is less dense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our atmosphere is stacked in layers of density.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most dense layers are closest to the water, the least dense layers are high up in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will wood pass through air? Yes. It is more dense than air. Will it pass through water? No. It is less dense than water. Will a pebble pass through water and air? Yes, it is less dense than both air and water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will a pebble pass through wood? No, because wood is a solid, and a pebble is a solid, both are dense objects, they are not fluids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know there are multiple stages of matter and they effect how that object interacts with its surroundings?
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeez, its like you threw common sense out the window.

       Oh, so now you are trying to say "states of matter" are real?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, water can't pass through wood? How do trees not dry out?
      </p>
      <p>
       If air just passes through water, how do you explain frothy foam on the ocean? Shouldn't the air just pass right through instead of getting captured?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do some displaces of density seem to rectify immediately yet others take much longer? Like why do dust particles get suspended in the air?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, if I shoot a pebble at wood with a sling shot it will go through it, is the slingshot magical?

       It seems as if you have not thought about why this phenomenon even occurs.  Consider the possibility that buoyancy is a
       <em>
        secondary effect
       </em>
       - it is caused by gravity and is affected by density.  If not for gravity, how would this mysterious force of "buoyancy" know which way is down?  Do you just assume that buoyancy exists and chooses "down" as the ground for some reason?

       According to your theory, I beg that you attempt to answer this question:
       <strong>
        why would a bowling ball fall at approximately the same rate in a near vacuum as in 1atm of air pressure
       </strong>
       ?  Wouldn't the absence of air make the bowling ball fall slower, since there are not as many air particles pushing on it to lower it down?

       You treat magnetic north and south as if they are absolute themselves - they are not!  The earths magnetic field varies as much as its gravitational field does.  Two people on earth may disagree at any given point on what north or south may be, based on the local magnetism of the area they are in.  Much like up and down are different in one spot or another - typically based on the composition and mass of the earth under them. 
 These both are a
       <strong>
        measurable phenomenon
       </strong>
       .  Much like magnetism.  These are both forces which are generated from fields, where the field is a continuous sum of the vectors of the particles involved.  We are then able to measure the field through its secondary effects on objects within it.  I find it incredibly ironic that you cite magnetism, as magnetism itself is almost as mysterious and "unexplainable" as gravity.

       This has always intrigued me.  It is not hard to perform thought experiments which disprove a lot of what you are saying.  I'm afraid it is you who is blindly afraid - and possibly delusional - to accept the truth.  Contrary to your opinion, most of your arguments greatly complicate the things we have observed in real life.  As an example, you ignored my question in the last post when in fact it is a simple thought experiment that I believe is unexplainable by your world view.
       <strong>
        Please address my question in the previous post if you would like to begin convincing me about your gravity theory

       I'm actually intrigued by what you're saying, but I'm having trouble with just one part. You say there is a definite up and down, but why do denser things go down? Why don't more dense things go up, or left, or east? How do you explain this property, that denser things go down, without some sort of force to act on them in a downwards manner? Buoyancy and Density after all are not forces, they are properties of matter. The heliocentric model uses gravity, if we accept that gravity isn't real what do we substitute?

       Do you think there's a fundamental flaw in the mainstream understanding of how motion works? If so, could you say exactly how you think Newton's laws of motion are flawed and what the correct understanding of motion is?
      </p>
      <p>
       I find this all very compelling except for this one detail that I can't seem to find a solid justification for, hopefully you can explain it to me.

       Typically when someone tries to prove a theory wrong, they propose a counter-theory. Unless you have one, there is nothing really to debate. Your points show that you don't understand how gravity works. You don't have to learn physics if you're too woke for them. Just tell me: Why do things fall towards the center of earth? Why do planets orbit sun? Why do all physics work as theorized? Then we have someting to debate.

      <p>
       The main reason that science uses the word theory is because there's no epistemologically valid way to
       <em>
        prove incontrovertibly
       </em>
       any particular theory. There is no way we can even prove that a reality exists, or that our observations are connected to such a hypothetical. We could be in the matrix, or under the control of God, or any other anternate, and there would be no way we could prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pragmatic argument is to accept the body of consistent observed evidence as supporting scientific theory. This is not to suggest that this is proof positive of an absolute truth, but rather that the theoretical model has not been substantially disproven by any new evidence. It makes no claim to perfection and is subject to revision in the future, but that is

        precisely what makes science valuable
       </em>
       . It is a predictive model of the universe based on empiricism, not an edict of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science doesn't deal in the confirmation of absolute truth, because that is just not possible without the use of base assumptions, a model. It does the next best thing, which is to reject models where contradiction with observations are found.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why gravitation is accepted as rigorous science. It is a disprovable theory that simply hasn't been substantially disproven by any empirical evidence. Relativity did a great deal to improve our model of it, and allowed for investigation beyond Newton's model, but is far from the final word. This does not make it false though. It's the best, most rigorous model we have.

       That's not what my post said. Not at all. What I meant here was that it's impossible to prove anything. But that's not really a useful argument because absolute proof isn't really necessary for practical purposes.

       fg=mg is a fundamental Newtonian equation. How do you propose buoyancy should cause things to rise? And from what are these things rising? What force is being counteracted by buoyancy?

       Things are massive, and massive things attract each other in our observations. We can point telescopes at the sky and see that. Galileo essentially founded modern science after doing that. Einstein picked up the problem in the 30s and gave us an improved model that by and large was proven.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last question - how do you suppose gravitational waves were recorded if gravity isn't real? How does density affect that experiment?

       I am a fan of the theory that rotational velocity does indeed have an effect on the surrounding space time in such a way that there is an effect created. Theoretically with enough velocity, and a large enough 'object' there would be a vortex like distortion where the outside edges of say a spiral galaxy would, even at the speed of light, 'lag' relative to the rotation at the galaxies core, placing a stress or stretch on the very fabric of space time... And you could theorise that the pull inward is due to a literal sort of buoyancy or density difference in the fabric of space time itself along this plane of rotation... Just some thoughts.

       I think he chose a bad fixed camera position, he could've drove a bit further from East through West.

       They should take a

        pic and video
       </a>
       with the building clear in the background,  and better equipment with MUCH better zoom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the curvature becomes apparent at
       <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/data/MetaMirrorCache/d3024eed228cdb781223b0c872643aaf.jpg">
        the end of the horizon.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The direct video that you linked seems a bit dishonest to me. And I tell you why
      </p>
      <p>
       The video starts of with the 'globe shill' picture that is cropped and already far far zoomed in on the horizon. Because it's cropped it seems like it starts from the car.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just where the 'flat earth' shill' starts his video at that point in the video, which is completely zoomed out.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the viewer it's like both were started from the same perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except he never even reaches the zoom and  level of resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pause the video at
       <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/attachments/20170722-185524-apvma-jpg.27881/">
        2:13
       </a>
       It is after that endpoint where he should zoom in. Compare 2:13 and the pictures for yourself, you'll see it because of the towering building.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is MUCH MUCH farther away by the way then it looks 
.  That is the furthest he could zoom..much farther after that point you would

        clearly see the curvature
       </a>
       and rule out any distortion.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end of the video he is playing with perspective again and comparing it with their blurry flat pic.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you're right, your second video proves the Earth is flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this video proves Earth isn't flat. They need to bring better equipment.

       I'm asking because I'm getting convinced you're not open to questioning that belief. If you can't be open minded about the problem then there's no point in discussing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, what specifically are you looking for as proof of gravitation? And I mean something that you can't explain away as fabricated evidence. 
Because if that's what you're going to do, no point in discussing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, what's the huge difference to you between observing an existing planet with water stuck to it and building one? It's not like humanity goes around building stars to experiment with them.

       Proof beyond a reasonable doubt isn't absolute. Specifically isn't absolute because absolute proof of anything doesn't exist.

       Ah yes forgive me, I forgot about the "two giant spacetime portals" option. Occam's razor be damned.
      </p>
      <p>
       The model still doesn't work though since viewing angles of stars (if they worked like this) wouldn't match with reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I just want to point out a mistake this guy made about the Sphere model. He stated that the celestial equator should follow an individual from latitude to latitude if we were living on a sphere. This is false. An observer would be tilted by an angle equal to whatever latitude they were at. This would change the apparent position of the celestial equator. What he disproved was whether or not Earth was a cylinder. I mean for gods sake, he pulls away at 6:20 and reveals that we were looking at things from the inside of a cylinder, not the surface of a sphere.
