       Looks like we may be getting closer to the truth here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tuesday, January 30 2018 the FCC released a preliminary report into the Hawaii false missle alert.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        According to a written statement from the day shift warning officer who initiated the alert, as relayed to the Bureau by the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, the day shift warning officer heard “this is not a drill” but did not hear “exercise, exercise, exercise.”
       </p>
       <p>
        At 8:07 a.m., this officer responded by transmitting a live incoming
ballistic missile alert to the State of Hawaii.
       </p>
       <p>
        The day shift warning officer seated at the alert origination terminal, however, reported to the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency after the event their belief that this was a real emergency, so they clicked “yes” to transmit the alert.
       </p>
       <p>
        But it is worth noting that they accurately recalled after the event that the announcement did say “This is not a drill.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The report can be found here:

       (Google Doc PDF)
      </p>
      <p>
       They have conducted key interviews with representatives of the HI-EMA, representatives of wireless providers that offer service to Hawaii, the President of the Hawaii Broadcasters Association and the Hawaii State Emergency Communications Committee, alert origination software vendors, other state and local emergency management agencies and
key stakeholders. Unfortunately, the individual who transmitted the false alert has refused to speak with the FCC investigators.

       They wouldn't. This whole thing is political manipulation.

       It seems to be the MO for their false flag events. Keep everyone in a state of not knowing if things are real world or exercise, just like 9/11.

       I don't think there's a conspiracy here.  Literally while this was going on people were discussing how odd it was that an excercise was happening.  The guy who released the phone message stated that he didn't hear the exercise part.  Entirely plausible that one hand isn't completely informing the other and that this person heard the portion of whatever was broadcasted wasn't an exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Typically when something militarily is going down it's proceeded and ended with the statement "EXERCISE EXERCISE EXERCISE". You miss that portion and you'd think the real deal is happening.  Sounds like protocols weren't in place to notify the person on watch that this was going down or he wasn't paying attention.  It's happened before without it affecting such a large audience.

       My issue isnt with them saying "Exercise", my issue is that preceding that with the words "This is not a drill" seems idiotic. The chances for monumental fuck-ups are quite high.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm not military, so maybe they really are just bungling morons who will risk starting a war for the sake of their exercises.

       Maybe I'm missing something, didn't the guy use that in the text blast?  If that's the case then it makes sense with what I was saying.  He didn't think it was a drill.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they broadcast that and he heard it, then well, that's a poorly coordinated and worded exercise.  Honestly I'm open to conspiracy theories, but I've also seen how bad mistakes can happen in a military environment when things are left up to one person and this story seems entirely plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, North Korea isn't shit when it comes to any part of the US, even Hawaii.  They could mess up Japan and SK but they would be mutual suicide.  The real conspiracy is the US ramping up talks about how dangerous NK is, theyve been on a campaign about giving the country a "black eye".  I think they're just grooming us to accept a proecdural military strike to keep them in line without any blowback.

       It's gotta be a real mindfuck to be an unknowing cog in some shit like this. I think the "button masher" in this case never did, does or will know what the hell happened. It's easier to make someone worth little more than minimum wage punch a couple keys than to have some agent become a public focus. This dudes life is fucked and he'll probably never know why.
