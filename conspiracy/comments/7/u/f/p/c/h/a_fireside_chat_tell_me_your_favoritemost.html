       So I am generally a skeptic when it comes to conspiracy theories, but I do enjoy them and think that generally there is some good in questioning established beliefs and ideas. Now tell me any theories you genuinely believe or are just your favorites even if you don't believe them. Thank you if you decide to share anything.

       do you think it was not possible for the lander to communicate with mission control? and you think it was impossible to hook up an analog signal to a telephone to allow a 'phone call' with the president?

       Because in the current age of dogmatic "science"-worship (I use quotation marks because I think a lot of people have lost touch with what science is), questioning the official moon landing story is seen as anti-science and that you're simply not smart enough to understand it. Nobody wants to be seen as dumb.

       I believe dust got kicked up when they took off again, maybe that obscured some of the footprints. I don't find a moon landing hard to believe, sure maybe the first one, I can see the motivation to accomplish that one at all costs.

       Right. So why don’t you use “simple math” to describe how to calculate the relation between fuel, thrust, and gravity to reach escape velocity?  You know, without using the formula that
       <em>
        others
       </em>
       derived from differentials.  I doubt you can even “prove mathematically” that it is possible to launch a rocket.

        Why do you keep bringing up the moon landing being faked or impossible!?  That is not what the argument has been about at all, it is a red herring and a straw man.

       This entire time I have been telling you that

        the math

       for the moon landing is real and works.  It works mathematically.  You posted a half-naked link questioning aspect of physics and math and it is stupid and easily disproven not by me arguing but by googling the calculations and following along if you are capable (not even hard to
       <em>
        follow

       mostly just requires trigonometry and algebra unless you want to follow the derivations which use differential calculus).

       about people going to the moon because that is not what you were arguing.  This prove that it is mathematically possible no matter how much random info you link that you do not understand how to synthesize.  Why are you looking up snippets about gravity and pendulums instead of just looking up the
       <em>
        readily available calculations for the actual moon mission
       </em>
       and examining that to see if you find a flaw!?  (Because you don’t have the knowledge to follow them or understand them, that is the real truth).

       The rocket doesn't "escape gravity" on the way to the moon any more than you "escape gravity" when you jump; it just goes a lot higher. Probes that go to other planets do escape Earth's gravity (technically, it's the gravity of the Earth-Moon system, which is slightly higher), but it's because they're going faster than escape velocity. Escape velocity normally is based on the mass of the body you're trying to escape from and the distance from its center to the object trying to leave it. However, since the moon is so massive (a rocket is tiny compared to Earth or the Moon so you don't have to consider its mass), you have to take its mass into account, too. The mean (the orbit is slightly elliptical) orbital velocity of the Moon is 1.022 km/s. At 385,000 km from Earth, its mean orbital distance, the moon would have to be going about 1.4 km/s to escape.

       send me a post card from the moon.

       until then, you are delusional if you think you can walk on the moon

      <p>
       its not that hard to figure out that the moon landing is a hoax.

       It's only "techno babble" to you because you're too ignorant to understand what I wrote. Since you don't even understand the most basic things about orbits, you're in no position to argue that you "proved with math" that the moon landing is a hoax. All you proved is that you don't understand it and you're not willing to learn.

       mk ultra, I heard about victims getting settlements in the 90s, I read more about it years later and it is such a dispicable thing for any government to allow doctors, scientist, and gov agents to it's own citizens.  Really woke me up to how the sausage gets made.

       I believe there are many more victims who have not yet been identified.  MK Ultra was used to program and control individuals.  That is still going on -- maybe called something else.  That Aurora theater shooter, for example, was totally programmed.

       Kinda fucked up. Witnessed this happening over the years. Went from a super fringe topic to a semi-used plot in film/TV to now being what you said a fact. And now that it is a fact, they rolled it out so slowly and perfectly most people don't even know about it let alone care.

       And you're just left feeling like even larger crazy person than you did before. You tell people its true and they shrug you off and now you're crazy as well for ever thinking it wasn't fact. Borderline 1984 feeling where we are almost debating what truth or reality is nowadays.

       It was to terrorize those who were paying attention, and to control the "conspiracy narrative" of those who noticed what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the ones that did this believe that if they make it obvious, the blood is no longer on their hands. If it is obvious to everyone that this was a fake, then it's on us to do something about it. Their hands are therefore clean.

       I definitely feel that the education system in America is failing a lot of students. I've always assumed it was just badly designed and mismanaged.

       Operation Mockingbird is an ok place to start. Funny, the intro section calls it alleged, but you dig down and find an actual declassified report in the article. So it is not alleged, but someone edited wikipedia to make it appear that way.

       Hopefully the frustration motivates you and doesn't dishearten. If you dig into this stuff little bits of answers come out. They aren't ever easy to convey to others because you are working against an entire industry of indoctrination.

       Yes that is another thing, the more I dig, the more I learn, the more alienated from others I become. It becomes harder and harder to fit in or even act like I fit in. I have learned myself to a place very from others. The knowledge is as much a curse as it is a blessing. But I press on. Just felt like sharing, thanks.

       Honestly I think that's why a lot of actual real people have gravitated to conventions for flat earth and such because it's absolutely not just our geospatial realm but so much more to discuss . I firmly believe flat earth is a meme and you can stop a meme.

       That the United States President is really a prisoner.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a plausible reason why Obama is reported saying that there was one debriefing after inauguration that he would have jumped out of a window, if there was one that he could.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Secret Service is a owned by the Federal Reserve, and there only business is protecting their money, and the president. That protection works both ways. The last president to threaten the bank met a magic bullet. The next guy after him to stand up for him took one trying to get away. Historically speaking so far... the third guy has STFU, and read the damn cards.

      </p>
      <p>
       It's a conspiracy theory, so real source evidence, other than the history of the SS themselves, being their own branch of government. They don't answer to armed forces or agency, just the bank, and supposedly the president.

       Once you've been in once, they've got "your protection" for life. As long as you play ball according to their plan, you'll be fine anyway. Of course there's the theory that they're chosen anyway. Big stakes, for big rewards. The kind of people that seek power are a bit egotistical anyway, and probably down for high stakes games.

       Pharmaceutical companies are legal drug dealers. They don't give a damn about patient well-being and are solely interested in making a profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the state America is in right now. Responsibility for the opioid crisis falls squarely in the lap of pharmaceutical companies. They lobby with their ridiculous profits to keep it all going, which results in craziness like:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Tramadol being schedule IV, even though it's just as addictive as other opiates and causes seizures in high doses.

       Not only that, but when was the last time a straight cure for any ailment was invented by a Pharmaceutical company? My (admittedly shallow) research says every actual cure has come out of a college or grant-funded research group.Why? Far more profit in a drug to manage symptoms that has to be taken regularly and indefinitely, as opposed to a cure which is finite. No real conspiracy needed either, just prioritizing the funding of research for treatments and long term 'management' of diseases over cures.

       JFK was assassinated in a coup enacted by our intelligence community. Absolutely true. It sunk in on me one day that the rich business interests in our country have the power to assassinate the President of the United States and cover it up,
       <em>
        and they got away with it
       </em>
       . IDK how anyone today can believe that the president is the most powerful person in the country, or that our intelligence community has our best interest at heart.

       I have several favorites, but the theory that that Son of Sam (David Berkowitz) didn't act alone and was, in fact, part of a cult that committed the murders is probably my all-time favorite. The theory stretches from the heinous ritualistic (and unsolved) murder of Arlis Perry in a church on a crowded college campus in California, to a small town in North Dakota, to the Untermeyer Park in Yonkers, NY, near Berkowitz's apartment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like many conspiracy theories of this sort, there are strengths and weaknesses to the theory. The strengths are legion. Many, many people within the NYPD believed that SoS did not act alone. The references to referring to "the Wicked King Wicker" and "John Wheaties," etc., quite clearly refer to the Carr family, who lived on Wicker street near Berkowitz and some of which fled to North Dakota. The theory is very, very strong in my opinion--and I'm a huge skeptic of these things, meaning that I look very hard at source documents and where information comes from and what it
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       means before making decisions on validity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The weaknesses come, as they often do, from a good-hearted and well-intentioned reported who followed the story where no one else would and ended up believing in things that were no longer supported by the facts. The reporter is Maury Terry, and his book
       <em>
        The Ultimate Evil
       </em>
       is an absolutely fantastic piece of journalism but for the times when he leans to heavily on speculation and starts connecting dots to Charles Manson, etc., that are not supported in the way that his other research (the Carrs, North Dakota, the California church murder) are. I highly recommend the book, but I caution people to separate out the true facts that are supported with clear evidence, from the places where Terry veers into speculation. The verifiable story that is supported by facts is quite alarming and incredible on its own, and it needs no fanciful embellishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very sad that Terry passed away. Unlike so many conspiracy writers, he was a true investigative journalist and he tackled his subject in the manner of a real journalist--tracking down leads, interviewing witnesses, filing records requests, etc. When he died, any real investigation into the topic ended.

       It's so funny to read ultimate evil and then programmed to kill, the differences in those guy's writing styles are stark as can be. I love mcgowan because books should not be written solely by professional journalists, yes you should always have a great editor, but if someone has something to say, get it down!

       I agree, personally I really like his casual yet confident style, but don't find him convincing all the time. I've read all his books and I'm not in agreement with everything by any means but he makes great connections that make you think from different perspectives. I appreciate that, and I hope his work lives on because you can tell he put a lot of himself in there and he seems like he was a cool guy.

       The mortgage/credit industry is simply a social control tool.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person is far less likely to protest unfairness in the workplace, society, etc. knowing that they can't miss A SINGLE PAYMENT over a 30 YEAR period.
      </p>
      <p>
       A mortgage is a 30 year guarantee that the individual will not become vocal or militant enough to jeopardize thier primary income.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Credit scores are far more social compliance tool than lending tool. The modern credit score is now reviewed for things that don't even involve borrowing money. Insurance, cell phone service, electric service, even job qualifications.

       Then choose to boycott the companies that require your credit score for mobile plan, electric service (which btw is a human right, because it falls under the umbrella of safety/heat) and do not apply for jobs that require those criteria. 
I don't know much because i live in the EU but shit like that is not flying here, few ISPs and cell providers tried to pull that shit and got boycotted to bankruptcy. 
Stop accepting whatever is being forced onto you by companies. 
Sure you might get crappier cell service or crappier internet speeds, but soon enough they will go out of business and that will teach them a lesson. That is how we act here.

       "Soon enough they will go out of business"... that's optimistic but it simply won't happen. There are too many passive idiots in this country that abide by the system for it to ever change - even if you convince a million other people to join you in rejecting "hard pulls" of your credit report for cellphone service applications, AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile won't go out of business. Too many rubes out there. This is a huge country, and you don't have the influence and/or resources to sway it one way or another.

       Canada is legalizing marijuana in July 2018.  Within the past 2 years, fentanyl has become a national epidemic, with the province of British Columbia reporting  1,410 opioid-overdose deaths in 2017, and even overdoses linked to fentanyl-laced marijuana across the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       My unproven conspiracy is that someone is planting fentanyl-laced marijuana on the streets to create fear and ensure the general population purchases their cannabis from the government-controlled dispensaries.

       Yeah but this doesn't matter if they can get the wider public to believe there is. It's really no different than the propaganda for decades past about "reefer madness" and people leaping from windows. If they can repeat it enough and get the public to believe it then it is irrelevant.

       I would be willing to agree with, but even if it is 'fake news' the fact that it's circulating in national papers is still a flag for potential influences campaigning for the same motive: get the public to purchase the government-owned weed.

       The school wasn't even open- it was covered in mold and had water damage, had asbestos in it and there was no traffic to the school's webpage. Furthermore, no trauma helicopters were called and the parents were all ok with not going into the school to see their dead child one more time. This would never happen in real life!!

       Why, in your opinion, is Sandy Hook the dumbest and most paranoid conspiracy? There was a lot to gain. The families of the "dead children" literally became rich as a result and the president got another example of why we desperately need the government to disarm the citizenry, and because this was a "tragedy involving children dying" it becomes very taboo to question it, so much so that it will cause people to lose friends and whatnot if they speak about it publicly. The fact that you think there isn't anything fishy about Sandy Hook proves that this one is off limits to you, which is exactly what they want, or that you are part of a campaign to push the narrative that Sandy Hook was real.

       Family members of people who actually die (in events such as 9/11, for example) are relentless in searching for the truth. For this reason it is actually much less messy to manufacture a hoax.

       How well do you know them? A lot of people say they know someone, a friend of a friend usually, who had a direct connection to this tragedy. My guess is that they must have gotten paid a lot of money by the government to lie about what happened. I know it sounds disrespectful if you personally know someone who claims to have lost a child, but after all the research I have done, the phonier the whole situation seems and I still cannot believe that anyone died that day.
       <a href="https://twitter.com/raolc/status/958976271597240320">
        I believe that the children are alive and well, and that the children that we see photographs of were actually in middle school and high school at the time of the shooting.

       He is my dad's friend and I see him like once every other month or so but have very little interaction when i lived at home.

       There is no better conspiracy (imo) than the New World Order - a secret societal agenda that dates back to biblical times. Honestly there is so much truth to the theory it’s indubitable. People who are and were part of secret societies have been quoted countless times in interviews, speeches, and books basically coming right out and saying “Yeah we control the world.” In 1871, Albert Pike, Illuminati wizard, wrote a letter outlining three world wars
       <a href="http://humansarefree.com/2011/03/3-world-wars-planned-by-illuminati.html?m=0">
        src
       </a>
       . Also, whether you are religious or not, the Bible prophecized a lot of this stuff, and quoted things like how Satan will disguise himself as an “angel of light.” One can also tie tons of other conspiracy theories within the NWO theory: MK Ultra (not even a theory anymore), 9/11, Holocaust, Titanic, Federal Reserve, Pearl Harbor, Lusitania, USS Liberty, the list goes on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NWO is the story of the world’s enslavement. It is the reason as to why their is evil in the world. It is the reason why we see endless wars. It is the reason the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. It is the reason governments, banks, corporations, media, etc. are all corrupt. It is the reason why the American education system is a joke. It is the reason as to why “only the good die young,” specifically when good people try to do good things and actually bring about real change in this world. It is the reason the world is brainwashed into believing what they are force fed. It is the reason “conspiracy theorists” are called “crazy.” If only more people knew how to use one thing: logic.

       This comment will probably get downvoted and shilled like crazy, as there are obviously many people who disagree, but I urge those of you who made it to the end of this to question everything you see, hear, and read until you can determine for yourself whether it is true.

       Wrong. Capitalism isn't the problem. The problem is when a person with enough wealth can gain control over the entire governmental apparatus to stifle competition against their interests. Free market capitalism wouldn't have these problems.

       Nah, it's just insurance. You can establish the government and have the people vote. Political parties work as voting bloc cartels and stifle liberty, so you really need a ranked choice voting system to make sure that the "lesser of two evils" picked by the elite doesn't have to be the winner. Of course, this requires an aware, informed populace that's willing to stand up for itself, which isn't a given, but it's better than any other system or government or anarchy (which is inherently unstable and doesn't last because someone less idealistic steps up to fill the power vacuum). You don't want to have to shoot at the government just to get things done; it's a last resort when your government can't be controlled through voting.

       “HAARP - a weapons system which disrupts the climate
...HAARP can be used for many purposes. Enormous quantities of energy can be controlled by manipulating the electrical characteristics of the atmosphere. If used as a military weapon this can have a devastating impact on an enemy. HAARP can deliver millions of times more energy to a given area than any other conventional transmitter. The energy can also be aimed at a moving target which should constitute a potential anti-missile system...“
      </p>
      <p>
       And since Weather Weapons do exist there really is no Big Leap to Anti Gravitation Technology to me (Brotherhood of the Bell, Operation Paperclip, Operation Highjump, Haunebu, Vril).

       I believe the price of college is engineered to keep students in just enough debt so that they have enough negative motivation to work and never get to experience mental freedom after the educational system.  People saddled with debt have less mental resources to think about who they really are and to connect with their true selves, much less to get down to what their convictions are and effect real social change.  Not to mention the age at which students generally take on the debt is exactly the time that people are meant to be finding themselves, before they should be asked to think about making such a huge financial decision.

       I'm referencing the fact that there are people (redditors) who are militantly up-in-arms when they read about raw food diets or other similar health choices, but won't say a peep in opposition to the sugars, preservatives, and other crap that actually sends thousands of people to the hospital every year. That's the line of reasoning I'm gonna go with.

       diabetes is caused by shit diet and or environmental toxins. all/most dis-eases are.  thats is the point.
there is a whole documentary about raw food and diabetes. and even type 1 can be managed very well with a HCLF diet.

       scientism is the new religion and has been subverted....  irs good for people who like to be told what to believe.
the point is that most of what we are told is bullcrap.   for example the human body cannot heal itself.
i've seen lots of people recover from all manner of "incurable" dis-ease and people like you propogate these foul lies because:ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       there are healing centers in this world where every type of dis-ease has been cured.    i wonder why these are never talked about or even heard of,,,, hmmmm   why do you think that is mr science man?   lol

       Anyone who believes this is the scum of the earth. How shitty of a human being do you have to be to require having "special knowledge" over one of the worst mass shootings in the country's history to feel like you're succeeding at life.

       an honest chance, because it's absolutely devastating to the official narrative. There is no chance in hell that anyone died at Sandy Hook. In real shootings they don't leave the victims' bodies in the building overnight without bringing them to a hospital. Nothing about the shooting makes sense, you aren't going to get much sympathy here by trying to shame the people who point out that it was one of the most bogus fake news stories in the history of the world.

       Special knowledge? Is that what you call the official narrative? Seems like a straw man argument to me. No where did any one claim this requires special knowledge to understand. All you need is basic logic and some time to go through the reported "facts"

       Sandy hoax and 9/11 certainly happened. Just that no one died at sandy hook and surprisingly only 4 israel jews died out of about 4000 that should have been in the kill zone.  But that's just a coincidence.

       I saw a lot of shapes and patterns that were very similar to what I know now as sacred geometry.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seemed so strange at the time that my mind could create these shapes out of nowhere and project them onto surfaces, and would also stay in the same spatial surface if I moved.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a later trip out in nature, I could somehow "feel" mother nature, and I would see all the trees morph into animal shapes. Something like seeing a cloud that looks surprisingly like a familiar shape. I wouldn't really describe myself as an outdoors type or an animal person but yet I had this experience.

      <p>
       Then came the deep, never ending
       <a href="/r/C_S_T">
        /r/C_S_T

       type thoughts that lead to me questioning everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reading various trip reports later would reveal that others have seen very similar things to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And here I am.

       Note: Of course I knew that my brain chemistry was altered, but I kept an open mind to explore the idea. I also have a science background.

       Hey OP. I agree with your post in that reality is not "precisely" how our brains perceive it to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to say however, if you are going to make a statement about reality perhaps not being as we perceive it, when someone asks you to expand on your experience/knowledge, do so.

       While I can't speak for OP, I can speak from experience. i would say it's more along the lines of, once you do try some of these substances and experience the effect, it shows you how your perception of every day life can be noticeably altered.
      </p>

       I'm not calling it a conspiracy really because, people from street magicians to neuroscientists have repeatedly shown that a large portion of our every day experiences are really manufactured by our brain.

       Again, I am not saying this is a conspiracy. It is literally proven truth about how our brains go about processing the boat loads of information it takes in every day.

       Terrance mckenna explains it best.   Psychadelics 'peel back the layers like an onion' of a lifetime of social conditioning and social programming, biases you didnt even know you existed...  the experience can separarate ones mind from ones ego from ones body from ones soul from ones psyche or any combination thereof or therein or therewithin or whatever-
Suddenly you realize that things you thought were just stuff actually have a lifeforce-  you realize the interconnectedness of every living being every single thing in existence and  for many this is a jarring and cathartic and life-changing forever moment because they now know within their absolute core being that there is a God- an Infinite Source of Love which
       <em>
        does indeed
       </em>
       know you!
      </p>
      <p>
       Yea-  so like something like that - give or take.
      </p>
      <p>
       A psychadelic experience on psyilocybin mushrooms with proper preparation - research, some form of forethought and planning-  might be a 3-6 hour experience.  Maybe 12-14.  But you exit that experience changed subtly forever-  in a positive way.
       <br/>
       Things like politics and hollywood and mass consumerism become boring and repulsive and compassion becomes a bigger part of ones' self.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats my take anyway.  Never used any psychadelic besides natures unprocessed psilocybin mushroom.  (And herb flower cannabis)

       Isn't it mostly just hallucination, though? I don't understand how anything you experience while tripping could be considered a reliable experience that tells you how the universe actually is. I get what you mean about changing one's outlook on life regarding, say, consumerism, but feeling like you're connected to all life or God or something or that rocks are alive while hallucinating doesn't mean you actually are, any more than would mean that psychedelic colors and dragons are really all around you and you just can't see them.

       Well, for one thing, the non-hallucinatory ("real") world is consistent. Things in it are consistent with each other and the experiences of different people show pretty much the same thing in the same circumstances. You can make simple predictions in the real world based on math and science watch them exactly happen. Drug trips aren't like that. They're different for different people and their accounts conflict with each other. Although some themes are common, such as a sense of oneness, they aren't universal and the details conflict. You can't make testable claims and then experiment to find out if they work.

       That an advanced civilization existed many thousands of years before we believe, I came across this on a youtube channel by this dude called Brien Foerester who takes people on tours to ancient archeoligcal sites.

       After having visited quite a few megalithic sites I can't wrap my head around how and why people built these places, especially how considering there's tons worth of precisely cut rock and impossible terrain usually involved.

       Theory: he city council in lincoln NE is likely in cahoots with wealthy developers from out of state to approve development projects and literally burn down undesireable businesses to increase property and business values. Examples being the burning down of the cities popular gay bar just inside the downtown highway entrance. burning down a pornshop and forcing the close a punk music venue along the same rout that is now being developed. Burning down our local downtown hispanic culture hub and grocier near campus expansion for unl. At least 2 other grociery stores being burned down in vicinity of down town creating what is being called a food desert. The nearest places to buy food are now generally out of state owned hyvee. Redevelopment of an area of down town full of historic buildings and the best bars in town to encourage buisiness at our new local tax funded out of state owned pinical bank arena. For a good laugh this area called the rail yard is now approaching a world record for most failed new businesses in an area....
      </p>
      <p>
       Id say i believe only to the point of suspicion, but it does seem an odd set of changes our city has gone through in a very few number of years.

       JFK. In my global studies class, my senior year of HS, we were divided into thirds, each third assigned a poignant topic in history, and then each of those groups was divided in two, either defending the current narrative or proving it was something else. I was in the JFK was shot by a gunman acting on his own authority, and my group was proving it wasn't Oswald acting as a lone wolf. It was the easiest fucking project I've ever done in a history class, and that was with publicly available material in 2002. We aced it. And that's why I chose to follow the release of the JFK files recently, and wasn't shocked at all by what we found. The government killed a sitting President and yet people think they have our best interests at heart. Not only is that not the case, they're not even indifferent to your presence. They want to suck everything out of you to benefit themselves.

       I believe that while these types of threads offer some good and some fun content, they are often used as to collect data on what people believe for malicious purposes. Perhaps even to see how well some cover-ups went (and gain info on where to go next).

       I came across it in another one of these threads and it seemed a bit silly, but the thought has grown a bit more every time I see one of these type of threads in different places.

       Maybe... but more likely just data farming for buzzfeed and other shit.  Also lots of marketers do it to gauge what is “cool” hence Taco Bell ads and tv shows that focus on this sort of thing.

       Sugar is the new tobacco and sitting is the new smoking. Coke &amp; Pepsi are the new Philip Morris.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had NO idea sugar was in soda when I was very little. I used to just drink water with sugar sometimes. In addition, my parents let me have candy and ice cream at will. Even worse, I did not know sugar caused obesity until I became a biology major. Of course I was a young fat kid who got picked next to last at dodgeball. I count my sugar intake now, it’s roughly 20g total a week if not drinking beer.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can read up on the sugar subsidies given to farmers which also ties into how wrecked the Caribbean economies  are (outside of  tourism) since they can’t compete. Haiti pre 1800 was the most valuable colony in the entire Americas. It was so valuable, Napoleon tried to wage a war to regain it and failed. Frustrated with his loss, he cut all French continental  ties with  North America and gave the US all of Louisiana when all the US wanted was New Orleans as a trading port.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to sugar today , I do believe the negative effects are somewhat   obfuscated by “big soda”. Even the diet sodas are arguably worse for you than the regular drinks. And why do you need a super size? You wouldn’t even need that much straight water with a meal!
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe the organic movement is poisoned, so to speak, by MSM portraying buyers as old hippies or douchebag hipsters. You know who’s at Whole Foods when I go? Regular folks, no weirdos. Consumers paying more to (supposedly) get something better in return.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, I don’t think it’s strictly the lifestyle choices that are making Americans fat. The same food has been around since the 70s in some form. Millions had desk jobs and drove everywhere then. You could binge on Pepsi and Oreos back then if you wanted. Instead, I think certain additives have been added to wreck  your metabolism and disrupt your hormones-specifically the thyroid. First time I ever ate European beef it blew my mind. It’s nothing at all like North American meat. I thought to myself , holy shit, I’ve been ingesting foreign hormones for so long I don’t even know how real meat tastes like.  It is VERY telling hypothyroidism is not even advertised as a health risk nor has an easy way ever been developed to test the level at home. The only diagnosis is a visit to a PCP and blood work.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are the motives behind this? I can’t say with certainty. 1) TPTB want  corporate profits with infinite growth 2) obesity causes a huge amount of health risks that require time,resources and money to treat. Something that could be avoided entirely with a good diet and moderate exercise. But that doesn’t make anyone any money except $50 a month for a fitness club so where’s the profit in that?

       Yes. Centralization of anything is a problem. Once you centralize something, you have the ability to easily corrupt it.

       While I can't speak for OP, I can speak from experience. i would say it's more along the lines of, once you do try some of these substances and experience the effect, it shows you how your perception of every day life can be noticeably altered.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not calling it a conspiracy really because, people from street magicians to neuroscientists have repeatedly shown that a large portion of our every day experiences are really manufactured by our brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I am not saying this is a conspiracy. It is literally proven truth about how our brains go about processing the boat loads of information it takes in every day.

       Terrance mckenna explains it best.   Psychadelics 'peel back the layers like an onion' of a lifetime of social conditioning and social programming, biases you didnt even know you existed...  the experience can separarate ones mind from ones ego from ones body from ones soul from ones psyche or any combination thereof or therein or therewithin or whatever-
Suddenly you realize that things you thought were just stuff actually have a lifeforce-  you realize the interconnectedness of every living being every single thing in existence and  for many this is a jarring and cathartic and life-changing forever moment because they now know within their absolute core being that there is a God- an Infinite Source of Love which
       <em>
        does indeed
       </em>
       know you!
      </p>
      <p>
       Yea-  so like something like that - give or take.
      </p>
      <p>
       A psychadelic experience on psyilocybin mushrooms with proper preparation - research, some form of forethought and planning-  might be a 3-6 hour experience.  Maybe 12-14.  But you exit that experience changed subtly forever-  in a positive way.
       <br/>
       Things like politics and hollywood and mass consumerism become boring and repulsive and compassion becomes a bigger part of ones' self.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats my take anyway.  Never used any psychadelic besides natures unprocessed psilocybin mushroom.  (And herb flower cannabis)

       I believe dust got kicked up when they took off again, maybe that obscured some of the footprints. I don't find a moon landing hard to believe, sure maybe the first one, I can see the motivation to accomplish that one at all costs.

       its pretty sad when your moon landing myth can be debunked by simple math, and even then you still can't put 2 and 2 together and figure this stuff out

       It's only "techno babble" to you because you're too ignorant to understand what I wrote. Since you don't even understand the most basic things about orbits, you're in no position to argue that you "proved with math" that the moon landing is a hoax. All you proved is that you don't understand it and you're not willing to learn.
