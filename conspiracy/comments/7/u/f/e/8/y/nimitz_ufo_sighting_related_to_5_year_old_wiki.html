       Just posted this over in
       <a href="/r/ufo">
        /r/ufo
       </a>
       but cross posting here since I found the article on Antarctica sticky on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something that has stuck out to me about the Nimitz 2004 is that even though we only see footage of this one craft being tracked on the radar, you clearly hear the pilots talking about seeing an entire fleet of them. Another guy points out “they” are all going against the wind.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Last night I was reading through a stickied post over at
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       about weirdness in Antarctica and came across
       <a href="http://ufodigest.com/article/wiki-leaks-alleges-secret-war-ufos-antarctica">
        this article from 5 years ago“Wiki Leaks alleges secret war with UFOs in Antarctica”
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I have never been to the site linked before I read this one article and have 0 idea the actual credibility of the site or the article.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, I thought the following was very interesting and immediately reminded me of the  Nimitz Pilots seeing a fleet of these things.  The linked article said the large groups of UFO craft were headed from Antarctica towards Mexico, right up the Pacific in June 2004. The Nimitz incident was recorded in Aug 2004 off the coast of Santiago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of the article that most interested me:
      </p>
      <p>
       “The infamous and embattled Julian Assange had made prior comments to the announced release of many of his controversial intelligence leaks that there would be UFO related materials. Such was the case recently when Wiki Leaks revealed alleged compromised Department of Defense cable communications indicating that US armed forces may be in the midst of a secret war with UFOs.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the sources that were revealed, there was an all out alert issued by Air Force Space Command after the emergence of a large flotilla of airborne unidentified objects from the floor of the Southern Seas of the Antarctic. This armada of unknown objects headed toward Guadalajara, Mexico.
      </p>
      <p>
       With US warplanes deployed and all radars intensified on the inbound targets, the massive UFO fleet supposedly dimensionally relocated themselves back to submerge in the antarctic oceans once again. The incident occurred 10 June 2004.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently, another massive emergence of the unknown objects headed toward the southern tip of South America and flew over Chile. Experts say that the immediate threat posed by these huge displays of large numbers as they launch from beneath the waters is the dangerous wave they generate that is capable of sinking ocean traffic such as freighters and other vessels. In the most recent appearance of the UFO armada from the antarctic Southern Ocean, one cruise ship was nearly capsized with 160 aboard while another vessel was overturned with a crew of 60 with only 20 rescued survivors.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I have no idea if anything in that article is to be believed, but usually where there’s smoke there’s fire. Especially after The NY Times article that released the DOD Nimitz videos.

       Nothing about those videos makes sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would expect airforce pilots to become super serious in tone when faced with an unknown object, not the "oh my gosh/bro/dude" voices that sound like an overdub.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the guy in the interview claiming to be head of the UFO unit looked more like a mercenary type than someone in charge of an administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       No proof provided for the whole "fleet of them" and "churning the water" backstory either. And the radar controller claiming that the same object travelled ultrafast to another location seems to ignore there being a fleet.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no followup on it from serious journalists with independent sources either so the real story is why this "disclosure" was organized -- in the middle of a tense North Korea situation.
