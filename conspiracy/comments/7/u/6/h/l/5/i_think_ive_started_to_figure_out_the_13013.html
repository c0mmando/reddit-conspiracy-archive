      <p>
       So if you look at the 13,013 card, it says the number is important for reasons "SECRET" and "COMPLEX" to put on the card.
       <a href="http://www.nouvelordremondial.cc/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/carte_13013_s.jpg">
        http://www.nouvelordremondial.cc/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/carte_13013_s.jpg
       </a>
       Now, the following is not a complete analysis, and it might seem complex, but stick with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’d first like to start with the number. I believe it refers to the New World Order date, August 11, 2045, right after the fake alien invasion. If you go back 13,013 days it leads to December 25, 2009. Obviously this is Christmas, but I don’t believe that the 2009 Christmas is anything important. It is Christmas, though, and that matters. Also, the number 13,013 can be broken into 13 x 1,001. 1,001 has to do with the Arabian nights. So you have the following aspects that are important:
      </p>
      <p>
       Aliens
      </p>
      <p>
       Arabian Nights
      </p>
      <p>
       Christmas
      </p>
      <p>
       The number "13,013" looks like BOB. BOB is a celebrity flat earth advocate, and his birthday is November 15. One of the biggest video games featuring predictive programming is “Shadow the Hedgehog”, which came out on November 15. It is game about aliens, btw, but that’s not critically important atm. In the level “Prison Island”, there is mention of a “top secret disk”.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn6VwntaSnk">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn6VwntaSnk
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look up the flat earth, it is shaped like a disc. So “secret disk” is a flat earth reference. Not only that though, but the word is spelled “disk” in the game instead of “disc”. “Disk” adds up to 43, and “Disc “adds up to 35. So 43 and 35, why is this important? On December 10, 2017, the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Los Angeles Rams 43-35. In this game, QB Carson Wentz was injured on his 33rd TD pass (coincidental? nah). Not only that, but November 15, 2005 ---&gt; December 10, 2017 is 12 years, 25 days. 12/25 is Christmas. Also, the words “SECRET” and “COMPLEX” add up to 70 and 88, respectively. “Carson” adds up to 70, and “Wentz” adds up to 88. So I think we can agree there is a direct correlation here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s talk about the Arabian Nights. Another video game that came out was “Sonic and the Secret Rings” on February 20, 2007. This is 66 weeks after Shadow the Hedgehog, and the mid-point, 33 weeks before StH and SatSR is July 4, 2006. America’s birthday. Interesting, no? But let’s focus on Sonic and the Secret Rings, the game was centered around the “Arabian Nights”, and it was called the “Secret Rings”. Could “Secret Rings” possibly be another flat earth reference? I think so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another important game to throw into the mix is the Sonic game between “Shadow the Hedgehog” and  “Sonic and the Secret Rings”. This game was actually called “Sonic the Hedgehog”, like the original, and was released on November 14, 2006. So you have the following dates:
      </p>
      <p>
       November 15, 2005
      </p>
      <p>
       November 14, 2006
      </p>
      <p>
       February 20, 2007
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 52 weeks between 11/15/05 and November 11/14/06. And then there are 14 weeks between 11/14/06 and 2/20/07, So 52 and 14, why is this important. A couple reasons. The Level “Air Fleet” in shadow the hedgehog “5-2” or “14”, and it is about shooting down the president’s escape pod! There is another illuminati card predicting a trump assassination, and I could get to that soon, but understand that 14 and 52 are correlated. This upcoming Super Bowl is number 52, and on this day an asteroid that has been monitored for 14 years is supposed to pass by earth. Lastly, “Sonic and the Secret Rings” is approximately 14,052 days before August 11, 2045.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've actually looked towards Pokémon, (LOL, stick with me) and I've picked out two particular Pokémon, Jirachi and Deoxys, and I believe they are important to the equation, Jirachi is about "wishes" and Deoxys is a sort of "Alien virus" thing, so I believe that's important. The Pokémon are right next to each other, 385 and 386, and their names start with "J" and "D". Another noteworthy Pokémon is "Absol", Absol is 359, which is Christmas Day, and Absol has the ability to foretell natural disasters, so I believe it is part of this "predictive" equation.

       dude bob dobbs (who is fucking great, btw) is what that card is about.  and it's not 0 so much as it's a 0 (in perfect balance) with a phi noodle.  like a j.  also the smoking pipes thing.  you know..gives itself away if you can read the symbols.  i wouldn't read too much into the numbers.  13 is the number of a particular archetype who uses D and J as symbols.  i'll just leave it at that.  nothing fancy or secret in that whole thing.

       "Our eyes and experience tell us the Earth is flat and motionless and everything in the sky revolves around us. But when we cease to believe our own eyes and experience, we have to prostrate ourselves at the feet of these very pseudo-scientists who are blinding us. Treat them as experts, astronomical priests who have special knowledge only they can access, like the Hubble telescope. So by brainwashing us with something so gigantic and fundamental, it actually makes every other kind of lesser indoctrinatation a piece of cake. Earth being the flat, fixed center of the universe around which everything in the heavens revolves gives us a special importance and significance. Not only to Earth, but to us humans, the most intelligent among the intelligent designer's designs. By turning Earth into a spinning ball thrown around the sun and shot through infinite space from a Godless big bang, they've turned humanity into a random, meaningless, purposeless, accident of a blind, dumb universe. It's trauma-based mind control, beating the divinity out of us with their mental manipulations. People are always asking, 'why do they do this?' Other than the obvious profit-margin motive, NASA being the biggest black-budget black hole in existence, sucking in over $30 billion taxpayers money for the fake moon landings alone... nowadays, hundreds of billions of dollars, not just NASA but RASA and all the other fake space organizations around the world, giving CGI images for hundreds of billions of dollars. So this modern, atheist, big bang, heliocentric, globe Earth, chance evolution paradigm spiritually controls humanity by removing God or any sort of intelligent design, and replaces purposeful, divine creation with haphazard, random cosmic coincidence... and so by removing Earth from the motionless center of the universe, these masons have moved us physically and metaphysically from a place of supreme importance to one of complete nihilistic indifference. If the Earth is the center of the universe, then the ideas of God, creation, and a purpose for human existence are resplendent; but if the Earth is just one of billions of planets revolving around billions of stars and billions of galaxies, then the ideas of God, creation, and a specific purpose for human existence become highly implausible. By surreptitiouslyindoctrinating us into their scientific, materialist sun worship, not only do we lose faith in anything beyond the material, we gain absolute faith in materiality, superficiality, status, selfishness, hedonism and consumerism. If there's no God and everyone's just an accident, then all that really matters is, 'me, me, me!' They've turned Madonna, The Mother of God, into the material girl living in a material world. Their rich, powerful corporations with their slick, sun cult logos sell us idols to worship, slowly taking over the world while we tacitly believe their science, vote for their politicians, buy their products, listen to their music, watch their movies... all sacrificing our souls at the alter of materialism."

       What i meant is that this is the answer to the commonly recurring question and reason people give themselves not to investigate available physical proof.  " But, but why would they lie..?"

       This is a Logical Fallacy called Appeal to Motive.  People don't want truth, they like to keep their idea of reality intact. Ego preserves itself and its lifelong "hard-earned" belief systems.

       Basically it is the reason people have an automatic negative emotional response when facing ideas that go against their cherished beliefs. To the point of entirely dismissing new ideas and physical proof related to it whilst refusing to admit they have no observable/measurable/repeatable  data for their spoonfed belief.  This psychological phenomenon is called Cognitive dissonance. Objective Truth's arch enemy.
