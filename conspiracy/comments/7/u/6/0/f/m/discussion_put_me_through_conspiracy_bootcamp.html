        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi guys, sorry for the strange title. Basically, i&#39;m a new guy. I really didn&#39;t care much about conspiracy theories, apart from having heard about the government covering up aliens in some place called area 51, and that jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams, but the Las Vegas shooting put no doubt in my mind that we received a total <strong>bullshit</strong> story.</p>

<p>I put up a post the other day asking how to not lose my mind, and received some great answers. I have a few more questions, if possible. </p>

<p>Is there a 101 for conspiracies? How do I start? I can&#39;t just jump in. I see you guys writing about Hilary Clinton, and Zionists, and Vaccines, and the Rothschild family, and the CIA,  and black op assassinations, and I just don&#39;t know where to jump into. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the Communist Manifesto of conspiracy theories? What credible, entry level resources should I look at? How far back do you all recommend? Obviously starting at 1990 i&#39;m going to miss a lot (Kennedy assassination etc), but going back to Ancient Egypt seems like overkill (correct me if i&#39;m wrong). </p>

<p>Thank you so much for reading.</p>

<p>TLDR: complete new guy, give me some direction. Not asking to be spoon fed, just pointed. </p>

<p>Flat Earth is pure distraction material, its used to overload you with senseless information that will hinder your ability to make rational judgements for yourself.</p>

<p>We have gamma rays coming from space, aurora borealis caused by radiation, asteroids, meteor showers (which people track their projectory, like NASA). </p>

<p>We also know of other planets and have images of those other planets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy 101: If you find yourself believing 100% of any source, you&#39;ve been duped to a certain extent. Disinformation, misinformation, and just plain bias are rampant. You&#39;ll never get the whole truth, no one will. Accept that, then start figuring out who to trust more and who to trust less.</p>

<p>Conspiracy 102: It used to be that you could hide information. With the internet all information is out there. The goal is no longer to obscure by shredding the documents, but by burying the documents in more documents, and by making copies of the same documents over and over again with slight alterations so you never know what the real document was.</p>

<p>Conspiracy 103: Realize how deep you&#39;ve gone and you&#39;re still in the beginner courses. Decide if you want to continue on this path or just live your life happy in ignorance. Realize if you continue you may never get successfully to Conspiracy 475 (and again, remember even then you don&#39;t get the full truth), but instead you might end up on Disinformation-Version5 101 thinking you&#39;re in advanced Conspiracy territory.</p>

<p>Conspiracy 104: There&#39;s more than just the CIA, KGB, and Mossad misleading you. Ever country has multiple intelligence organizations. Large corporations have intelligence organizations. There are for-hire intelligence organizations. This is just considering we&#39;re talking about intelligence organizations, and leaves out secret societies, NWO, illuminati, and aliens (and those might be advanced Conspiracy levels, or they might be early disinformation levels.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aySN0FGJYpM">Everything is a Rich Man&#39;s Trick</a> is a decent primer on a lot of modern conspiracies.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtube.com/user/reallygraceful">reallygraceful</a> is a good source for bite-sized conspiracy videos that cut to the chase and gives you the overview of a lot of different topics.</p>

<p>Look into ancient history to learn about how long the big lie has been going on for. Go beyond the mainstream sources, because they are generally part of the lie. Take a look at the erosion of the Sphinx, which offers solid proof that it was built long before the history books say it was. I think this a really good gateway topic into the ancient civ stuff, due the fact that it offers material proof.</p>

<p>Know that you won&#39;t be able to find indisputable proof for most conspiracies, so it requires you to take a loot at a lot of sources and view points in order to even try to get a complete picture. And you&#39;ll never have a complete picture, because the deception goes incredibly deep.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe you ever know the complete truth. Don&#39;t believe anyone who says they know it all. Seek with an open mind. Be willing to entertain notions that sound absurd. Remember that just entertaining them is not the same as believing them, but the very act of being willing to consider it will help you develop a more critical mind. Take baby steps and remember to detach from this stuff once in awhile.</p>

<p>Try to have fun. There is some seriously dark shit going on, but just do your best to stay grounded and don&#39;t let it bring you down too much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look into your kitchen for the mother of all conspiracies.</p>

<p>First of all, I suggest strengthening your body and mind through natural diet and mental hygiene (don&#39;t eat crap and don&#39;t listen to crap). This is because truth requires a solid receptacle or it causes tremendous shock.</p>

<p>If you simply start researching which foods are good for you and why, you will have started to unravel the veil of lies while fortifying yourself. There is no need to look to ancient Egypt for an exciting conspiracy - you can find one in your kitchen cupboard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Om the right side of the forum is a link to &quot;List of Confirmed Conspiracies&quot;. Start there. Best to start with those that are &quot;confirmed&quot; by credible sources that open your eyes, before going down other rabbit holes.</p>

<p>What about the LV shooting was it that opened your eyes? How was it more eye-opening than 9/11? As a non-American, stories of mass shooting is so prevalent that I would&#39;ve thought one shooting story would seem same as other shootings. Planes going into buildings, now that doesnt happen every day.</p>
