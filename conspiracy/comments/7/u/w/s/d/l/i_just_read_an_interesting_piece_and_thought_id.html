       "Today the HPSCI majority released their "memo" detailing some stuff about the politicizing of the DOJ agencies against a political opponent and everybody is losing their minds. But I think you're missing the larger picture here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The memo, the one everybody can't shut up about, isn't anything new. We already knew 90% of this. Yeah the circular reporting from Steele to Yahoo to the dossier is new stuff, but come on... this isn't anything unexpected. Trump knew everything in here 11 months ago. He tweeted about it.
      </p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Let's roll back to January 20th in 2017, Trump is the new POTUS and he's got about zero allies. Democrats hate him, Republicans hate him. Trump is a honey badger, he doesn't give a shit. He gets to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even further back, he knew this wasn't going to be easy. He knows how to win, he's going to teach the party that he commendeered how to win.

       He starts implementing conservative policies, stock market likes this, he's rolling back regulations, he's reversing Obama's progressivness, he's telling immigrants they need to go back, he's bringing back law and order, he's cutting off the Global Elite... AMERICA FIRST!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice I said "conservative" policies, and not Republican policies. There's a difference. The Republicans hate this... but the conservatives like it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Republicans are a part of the same snek that Democrats are. At the very core of America lies a deep conservatism, it's where we came from. So the true conservatives in the Republican party start to take notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me ask you something real quick... Do you think a liberal New Yorker gives a shit about American conservive policies? The answer is, maybe. Maybe not. So how in the hell did he capture the heart of middle America?
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump is a family man, and he's got a deep love for his country. He's also a shrewed businessman and knows how to run shit. He knows he can't do this alone, he needs help. He implements these very correct conservative policies and Rand Paul takes notice. Grassley takes notice. Gaetz takes notice, along with Jim Jordan. Mark Meadows is on board. DeSantis looks around the corner. Gosar opens his eyes. Trump is getting their attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       The healthcare negotiaitons, he works directly with Rand Paul on this. He's delegating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the DACA negotiations, he tells Tom Cotton and Mark Meadows he won't sign anythign they won't sign. He's getting people to help him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay you know all of this, so let me circle back to where we are today... and why today is such a monumantal day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conservatives fought for Donald Trump today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read that sentence again. It's important
      </p>
      <p>
       He knew about all of the memo stuff a year ago, but he can't win this war on his own. Over the past year he's included the core constituency of America, the conservatives, in his plan. He showed them that he will fight for their America, he included them in the fight, and as of today... they are starting to fight for him. Nunes and the HPSCI did this all on their own. Trump wasn't involved. Trump wasn't involved at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've got a war on our hands, and we've got one hell of a Commander In Chief at the helm. He spent the past year showing them how to win, and today they finally took a fucking shot. Get ready for more. Conservatives see what just happened, and confidence is contagious. Others will want a piece of this. It's called Success!
      </p>
      <p>
       So this is what is truely amazing about today. Yeah, go ahead and have fun and bitch about the memo. It's all political theater, but whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just be proud, because I know I am. I've waited a long time to see the conservative backbone."

       It's statistically true.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you ask people very directly, with very clear words, what they think about issues without obfuscation, most use reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conservative policies rely on two things, tradition of success and reason. They are winning in reason, while their tradition of success is attacked endlessly by leftists with CRIS theory degrees, and 'progressive agendas'.
      </p>
      <p>
       in the middle, that center of American polices as it can tax, is the investing tax-payer. This is not the class the DNC focused on, assuming 1% men at the helm of the MSM could convince people who rationally spend and account for money, would simply overwhelm the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overwhelming the narrative does not work when evidence and actions speak louder than words, to people who make moral judgments about others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, everyone is a conservative when you expose them to certain DNC members histories; they care about law and order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certain people become progressive when they look at immigration history and stats and see what's being done; it's about accommodation and investment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certain people assume progressive stances when exposed to leftists and anarchists groups using mass-rhetoric and illegal activities to further their intentions; All people hate subversion and perceptions of 'treason', and this is show in Dante's Inferno.
      </p>
      <p>
       All people have an identity, but more so, we all have human needs. To assume identity comes before those needs established as a 'sense of security', is to assume those identity crusaders are working, not subsidized, and can pay you back for the investment.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a dead-end ideology right now. Coming from a former Blue-state Liberal turned libertarian.

       Spare me your Donald Trump indignation. Many of the people criticizing Trump have spent plenty of time playing in the mud. They could at least wipe themselves off before handing down hypocritical moral judgments on others.   It's all corrupt man.  Every fucking bit of it.

       Hey brother, I would love to debate you on a multitude of issues. I appreciate anyone who is well versed in their personal preferred ideology, and who thinks deeply about the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my analysis, you are way off the mark, and couldn’t be further from the truth about leftism, liberalism, conservatism, and republicans; even human nature in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       You make claims about “all people”.. I think you are smart enough to know that painting the human collective, or just Americans more specifically, in such a broad brush, will always end up being incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       ALL PEOPLE are not inherently opposed to subversion or subversive political acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Basically, everyone is a conservative when you expose them to certain DNC members histories; they care about law and order.”
      </p>
      <p>
       What kind of insane, partisan, wildly-sure-of-yourself statement is that!?   What the hell? Lmao. It is impossible for you to be a fully formed adult after that statement..
      </p>
      <p>
       People DO NOT change their political line or abandon their ideology just because you showed them the “history of certain dnc members”.  Like forreal bro?  Is that serious?  The actions of the scumbag DNC and their members has absolutely nothing.. zero.. to do with leftism or socialism.. which many of us believe is the better system.
      </p>
      <p>
       You spoke about reason.   I’d say conservatism is lacking common sense and logical reasoning in many cases.. conservatives do not mind war usually, they don’t mind obscene wealth accumulation and the sale of our democracy to these wealthy interests. They don’t fight for the rights of workers or higher wages, better healthcare for the most people... for AMERICANS IN AMERICA.. Ya know, the place conservatives SWEAR TO JEBBUS CHRIST that they love soooo much.  They are anti abortion and PRO-fucking-WAR.
      </p>
      <p>
       They hate America.. they hate Americans by the millions..
They send Americans to die in illegal wars..
They cheer on the genocidal Jewish state , and support insane amounts of foreign aid..
They support the equivalent of modern day kings who have monopolies over the means of production..
They are anti worker across the board.
They hate the poor and the weak.. even though they totally oppose any policy that would make these people not poor or weak.
And way more.
      </p>
      <p>
       In essence, conservatives are anti American in reality. They rabidly support ultra fast Irreversible actions they sell away the limited raw resources of OUR LITERAL LAND, to a handful of mind blowingly, impossible to imagine wealthy sociopaths.. and they spend every single second trying every possible way to justify it.. usually by ridicule or cheap shot attacking ANYONE  who wants the average American hammer swinger Or burger flipper or hair cutter or cab driver or factory worker to actually benefit from their labor. YOU guys divert attention and lie by saying that income tax is tyranny, when that point is moot because our jobs are meaningless shit in the first place, and oh yeah, you fight with every breath to keep some cigar chewing pedophile sadistic billionaire or millionaire reaping every cent of the wealth created by OUR labor, except the few dollars that will keep us alive and working..
      </p>
      <p>
       But healthcare? No it’s evil for everyone to have it, too expensive.
Higher education? Selfish to think everyone should be able to have it, no money for that.
FUCKING FOOD? Food stamps and welfare is draining this nation!
      </p>
      <p>
       War? Sophisticated hundred billion dollar secret spy apparatus and clandestine murder squads? Weapons that cost hundreds of millions that mutilated children who live in sand and doesn’t even make a dollar a day? Corporate handouts? Insane bonuses for CEOS?
      </p>
      <p>
       WE HAVE MONEY FOR ALL THAT! But we need more, so uh, those few and far between social programs that people fought and died sometimes for years and years ago need to be cut or ended totally. Unions need to be stopped also.
      </p>
      <p>
       A bunch of insanely rich people paid professional manipulators and PR GUYS to trick America into not only giving them the entire physical country, it’s peoples souls, and it’s cultural zeitgeist, but also the souls and futures of every generation forever..
      </p>
      <p>
       And you “conservatives” and “libertarians” literally started doing the job for free.  You guys systematically sell out the land, people, and future of this nation while destroying everything humanity on this landmass fought to the death for, while simultaneously locking down the future so we can never get it back, thru the buying and controlling of the govt and military.. and then you fucking insult us by tricking us and fucking with our minds by dividing us along invisible lines like “left” and “right” and liberal and conserv and this and that when the whole time it was always the same struggle..
      </p>
      <p>
       The same war.
The class war
The people vs the wealthy
      </p>
      <p>
       The people vs the wealthy and their uniformed lackeys that call themselves all types of right wing type labels and treat peoples fucking lives, wages, and futures like a motherfucking football game
      </p>
      <p>
       Well your on team billionaire pedophile soul destroying genocidal sociopath

       Follow through with what I said, rhetoric man:
      </p>
      <p>
       "All people have an identity", is what I said. That's in-arguably true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Show me one 'person' without an identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, that was the first and last statements you made about my post. I can only assume the inner ramblings of your shit sandwich are equally as poor. Yet, dont waste time on garbage.

       Just die dude. Go blow rich guy and then let him keep 90% of your wages for doing it.  And then after you swallow, you can complain about getting taxed on that last 10%, and then you can call food stamps socialism that Obama tyranny-attacked ya with and call for their abolition so we can save 3$ a paycheck and give it to the war machine so we can kill the brown children in the weapon testing arena we call the Middle East. Or we can cut Medicaid and give the money to the wealthiest americans so they create more blow-a-billionaire jobs.

       These people never suffer.  Ever
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s say there are 10,000 of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other 7,999,990,000 of us are suffering unspeakable horror and desperation. Poverty brings mind-shattering drugs, crime, murder, rape, incest, suicide. It pushes people into any “job” they can get, which is a literal prison sentence.. just instead of a cell, making license plates for pennies, you have a larger cell at a random location that you need to go to everyday, making French fries 🍟, for a few dollars for each 60 minutes interval of time served. Your entire improbably existence, randomly forming into a maybe illusionary creature built of invisible “atoms” floating on a giant wet rock, in outer”space”.. is spent in some weird place doing things u don’t want to do and never would if u aren’t coerced by need.  And so called conservatives think not only is this arrangement great, but that you deserve less, and the person who lives a fantasy life on perpetual vacation, who never has to go to a work cell, should get the most, and it’s “communism” if you complain.

       I think 'so-called' is the operative words, in regards to conservatives. The left/right paradigm takes advantage of some of our primal evolutionary biology; our brains work in binary: Snake, BAD. Fire, GOOD. The basic group psychology of 'our group good, that group bad' is still hard-wired in us, so we're especially susceptable to false paradigms like 'the left/liberals are like this' or 'the right/conservatives are like that'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people at the top responsible for pushing these policies (not the politicians) aren't 'conservative' or 'liberal' per se, they're just ruthless billionaires that are strictly concerned with their own self-interest. They'll pay off whoever is elected to enforce their agenda. At this point, so much of our 3 branches are corrupted — bought and paid for — that they can pretty much do what they want. It's rich vs poor; class warfare has been being waged top-down for several decades now, and the poor don't seem to understand it's a war, because we continue squabbling amongst ourselves instead of banding together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though their weapons are superior and far more insidious than we could ever imagine, we ALL have to shoulder a level of responsibility for allowing things to get this way through our complacency.

       Amazing response. Thank you
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m a socialist, and I’m in a trade union in NYC. I talk politics at work all the time, and I openly support socialism, which I catch a lot of flak for.  People don’t understand it so they fear it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ones who do understand real leftism and socialism, but still oppose it, are the ones I became friends with.  We debate added constantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of them rabidly supports free markers, and you know what, I realized, so so I.
      </p>
      <p>
       And he believes workers should own the means of production.
      </p>
      <p>
       We find middle ground and debate what is idealistic and what is really possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Answer is anything is possible.  Human beings can collectively decide that they want to organize and progress society to a end goal. That end goal should be for as many people as possible, or everyone, to have the highest quality standard of living
      </p>
      <p>
       As an American, we should want our neighbors to have as good of lives as our own children.  We should pursue a society as close as possible to utopia.. because why not?
      </p>
      <p>
       Right and left can find middle ground and make a better world
      </p>
      <p>
       If not, then the ones who obstruct this process are an enemy to humanity and evolution
      </p>
      <p>
       We literally can make our reality whatever we want it to be.  People just need to be on the same page with an end goal.  I think communists would accept capitalism instantly if it ended up with the same great world
      </p>
      <p>
       Socialists criticize capitalism because it doesn’t solve social problems, and in many cases, exacerbates them..
      </p>
      <p>
       And vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we drop the partisan color  proxy war and agree that we want a better America, a better world, a better human?

       Thank you very much!  I thought it was an interesting read.  I grew up in the 80's and 90's.  Things have changed SO VERY MUCH in these last 40 years.  The country is split into believing in two different narratives.  The time is SO ripe for a third party...and maybe a fourth and fifth.

       =] JIB!   I’m changing my name to JIB BUSH asap.    Am I rite or am I right tho about the “right”.  Like is anything that conservatives want, actually beneficial for Anyone except people who have billions of paper coupons called money that get them a alternate reality full of constant maximum pleasure?

       These people never suffer.  Ever
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s say there are 10,000 of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other 7,999,990,000 of us are suffering unspeakable horror and desperation. Poverty brings mind-shattering drugs, crime, murder, rape, incest, suicide. It pushes people into any “job” they can get, which is a literal prison sentence.. just instead of a cell, making license plates for pennies, you have a larger cell at a random location that you need to go to everyday, making French fries 🍟, for a few dollars for each 60 minutes interval of time served. Your entire improbably existence, randomly forming into a maybe illusionary creature built of invisible “atoms” floating on a giant wet rock, in outer”space”.. is spent in some weird place doing things u don’t want to do and never would if u aren’t coerced by need.  And so called conservatives think not only is this arrangement great, but that you deserve less, and the person who lives a fantasy life on perpetual vacation, who never has to go to a work cell, should get the most, and it’s “communism” if you complain.
