       "CONFIRMED: THE CONGRESSMEN ABOARD THE TRAIN WERE SUPPOSED TO BE IN SESSION. THEY WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HEADED TO A "RESORT" THAT DOUBLES AS A DOOMSDAY (COG) FACILITY. Adding to the credibility of the theory they were fleeing a threat is the fact that they had family members aboard the train, including children that should have been in school.
      </p>
      <p>
       OVERWHELMINGLY PROBABLE: THEY RECEIVED DEATH THREATS OVER THE MEMO, AND WERE HEADING TO A SAFE PLACE WHEN THEY WERE STOPPED BY A STAGED "ACCIDENT"
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the story, which is all now 100 percent confirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       A majority of Republican congressmen who voted to release the Fisa memo, which exposes an enormous amount of deep state corruption, were on an escorted train when they were supposed to be in session, with all roads closed ahead of the train (for security reasons) and the train receiving helicopter escort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite all the roads being closed, the train hit a garbage truck while going 70 mph. The front wheels of the front engine derailed, but the rear wheels stayed on the tracks. With all the roads closed for security reasons, the only way the garbage truck could have gotten in the way of the train would be if it was done intentionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even some Congressmen are now saying the accident had to have been staged, and that it was an attempt to kill a large number of congressmen who voted to release the memo. Large numbers of deaths would have occurred if the train did derail, (as planned) but with the will of God it mostly stayed on the tracks and none of the cars or engines tipped over. If that had happened at 70 MPH the results would have been devastating.
      </p>
      <p>
       HEADS UP: Rogue factions in the United States government are attempting a violent coup with "plausible deniability. Fortunately only minor injuries happened, but having this end up being minor defies all probability, it was supposed to be a disaster and it was definitely, without question, not an accident."

       If you had claimed that we have to look out for false flags, people would have responded better. Instead you speculate that Republicans are setting up potentially lethal train crashes risking death for half of their leadership in order to get sympathy?  If that is so, where are the republican leaders coming out saying that they were attacked by the Democratic cabal and calling for arrests.  When that happens, we can consider false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the meantime, I think most people watching MSM will consider it an accident and most people here on r/conspiracy will consider it an desperate attempt to intimidate republican lawmakers by the deep state.

       It wouldn't necessarily need to be the Republicans setting it up, either. What if it was, for example, a deep state false flag intended to make it look like someone else was trying to intimidate the Republicans? It's risky, but from the perspective of a hypothetical evil group pulling the strings, loosing a handful of pawns for some other goal might be considered an acceptable loss. Why do this? I have no idea. That's the problem with these kinds of conspiracy theories; if they're true, there would be a lot more going on behind the scenes that you don't know about, so it's hard to speculate on motivations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I don't think that's what happened. This is all speculation and there's zero evidence for any of it. All I was saying is that if you were to assume that it was some kind of false flag, that it wouldn't have to be the victims behind it. A false flag could conceivably be perpetrated by a third party. You would have the perpetrator group, the victim group, and the group intended to take the blame. And the official narrative in the media could be different altogether. You could have a false flag where the Republicans are supposed to assume that a different group was trying to intimidate them than the one that actually caused it, and the story in the media could still be "accident".

       Well, let's see what comes of any investigation into it.
       <br/>
       I mean the name of the garbage company was on the side of the truck. Were they on their normal route? Why did the damn thing stop? 
Are the post accident photo bogus, some are already claiming that they have see photos that have different trains in them.
       <br/>
       How many eyewitness accounts will we see?
      </p>
      <p>
       If a Democratic cabal did it and the Republicans know it, might they delay seeking justice in order to wrap it all up later with prosecutions  of people with names already on sealed indictments?

       Exactly, I live near the resort and they have been talking about this on the local news, planning it, for many, many months. Longer than this memo shit has been in the news. People would rather believe they live in a Robert Ludlum book though. TBH life is probably more exciting that way though.

       I mean, I am not trying to brush off that the accident itself may not have been entirely what it seems. But the retreat was definitely not an unplanned event - like you said, it was planned way before this memo talk.

       Can we get his higher? Nothing makes skeptics and truthseekers look worse than buying wholesale into a theory that is this easily disproved. Research and following the evidence are much better than going all in because it feels true.

       Ruins the theory that they were fleeing because of the vote.

       Sounds like they had a cover story so that they could take a train ride to a planned retreat.  Given the train derailments, that's not a dumb idea.
