       Did you know there is a difference between driving and traveling?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Driving is the act of using the roads for financial gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Traveling is going from here to there with your property.
      </p>
      <p>
       Driving is a privilege.
      </p>
      <p>
       Traveling is a right.
      </p>
      <p>
       And these are facts that the money hungry, power crazed corporation called the United States does not want you to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh yes, the United States government is a corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is defined in the
       <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/3002">
        US Code Title 28 Section 3002 Definition 15
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You have probably unwittingly entered in to a business contract with a corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I digress, this post is purely about the DMV and its extortion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another corporation, obviously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets see what the US Code has to say about motor vehicles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hmm... Whats this?
       <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/31">
        US Code Title 18 Section 31 Definition 6 says...
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "A motor vehicle is any contrivance propelled by mechanical power used
       <strong>
        for commercial purposes
       </strong>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats right. Only for commercial business or financial gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you are not paid to haul rocks or transport passengers, you are not using your automobile for commercial purposes, and do not require a license, or registration, or insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there is no need to wait for hours at the Department of
       <em>
        Motor Vehicles
       </em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Many court cases back up this truth.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "... For while
        <strong>
         a Citizen has the Right to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon
        </strong>
        , that Right does not extend to the use of the highways, either in whole or in part, as a place for private gain. For the latter purpose, no person has a vested right to use the highways of the state, but is a privilege or a license which the legislature may grant or withhold at its discretion."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/3564703/state-v-johnson/">
        State vs. Johnson, 243 P. 1073;
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        These cases,
though involving regulatory statutes or ordinances, all
recognize and are based upon the fundamental ground that
the sovereign state has plenary control of the streets and
highways, and, in the exercise of its police power, may
absolutely prohibit the use of the streets as a place for the prosecution of a private business for gain. They all
recognize the fundamental distinction between the
        <strong>
         ordinary right
of a citizen to use the streets in the usual way
        </strong>
        and the use
of the streets as a place of business or main instrumentality
of a business for private gain. The former is a common
right, the latter an extraordinary use. As to the former,
the legislative power is confined to regulation; as to the
latter, it is plenary and extends even to absolute prohibition.

        Hadfield vs. Lundin, 98 Wash 516
       </a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       We all have God given rights, and one of those is the right to travel freely and have liberty.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is Liberty?
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberty. noun -  The state of being free within society from
       <em>
        oppressive restrictions imposed by authority
       </em>
       on one's way of life, behavior, or political views.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use your rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be free from oppression.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cancel your insurance, your registration, and rescind your drivers license.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless of course you drive a taxi or something, then you need that stuff!
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       WARNING
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not for the faint of heart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police can still drag you out of your car and taze you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police act outside the law every day, and this is no different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many cops, I am sure, are aware of this truth, however I am sure there are still plenty who are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       You must be able to stand up for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       You must research this topic fully on your own, and be very careful not to incriminate yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply responding "yes" to an officer who asks if you were driving is enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       You just admitted that you were transporting goods for financial gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Always say traveling, or conveying, or moving, never ever say driving.
      </p>
      <p>
       And never say motor vehicle. Always say automobile or car.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also having an ID of some sort is a good idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       A common law ID can be made by a notary, but a state ID or passport work as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not some magic loophole to escape every law out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most rules of the road still apply to traveling citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you endanger lives, or trample the rights of others, a police officer will do his job and stop you.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, any citizen has the right to stop anyone who endangers lives or oppresses their rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any at-fault accident that occurs while traveling would be your responsibility.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I went to my local police station today with a document I typed on my 1964 Royalite typewriter and asked the officer at the desk to mull over it and explain any errors, if any, about my interpretation of the law. It included case law and US code definitions, and ended with a paragraph about how I have the right to travel freely and how I cannot be required to register insure  and license myself in order to engage in a constitutionally protected activity. He looked at it, and said, yes, this is all factual. I recorded the conversation, and will use it in court if necessary, however I doubt that will happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are beginning to realize that the government is not there to help you, or protect you, or do anything good for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is our duty to remove any corrupt system and regain our liberty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spread the word.

       What exact case law do you want me to cite? Also you just suck at statutory interpretation. You also realize definitions like you're quoting are only for those specific chapters/statutes right?
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, in terms of laying out judicial power, the term the United States means any corporation owned by the government, any of its agencies, etc. not that the government as a whole is a corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And sure, for that particular federal statute, that's what a motor vehicle is defined as, but that doesn't stop every single state you drive in governing their own roads and using their own definitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're also apparently really bad at citing cases yourself. You realize the Montana case is only binding on other Montana courts...right? Same with the Washington one for Washington.

      <p>
       Like all sovereign citizen types you've just thrown a bunch of jargon out there and hope it confuses people enough for you to get away with some bullshit.

       Blacks law dictionary isn't a legal document but an attempt at explaining legalese to the average joe.

      <p>
       That older definition is from 1856 (half a century

      </p>
      <p>
       You shouldn't also ignore the second sentence of their definition; A person actually doing driving, whether employed by owner to drive or driving his own vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
       The argument of "I'm not driving, I'm travelling" is flawed, since the 4th edition defines driving; To urge forward under guidance, compel to go in a particular direction, urge (toward?), and direct the course of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even using your older definitions, shows that travelling and driving aren't mutually exclusive.

       <p>
        coach, carriage, wagon, or
        <em>

       Are all vehicles that can be steered. . A car would fall under "other vehicle" btw.

       You're quoting US(Federal) Criminal Code. You're not being pulled over by US(Federal) Law Enforcement, you're being stopped by state Law Enforcement. Your arguments are invalid, as the states set their own definitions for motor vehicles. Failure to register a vehicle - which is an action you take at the state level, not the Federal level - is an actionable infraction that carries a penalty. Which, again, is set at the state level, but the Federal level.

       The right to travel applies exclusively to travel between the states. It says that a state can't close its interstate borders, basically.
      </p>
      <p>
       You absolutely do not have a right to whatever method of travel you wish. Just as if you had a private plane, it doesn't matter if you consider yourself to be "travelling" when you're flying it, you MUST abide by FAA regulations.
      </p>

       wtf is that case law? it literally just says $300 or 1 year is the most for resisting arrest. Where does travelling come into this?(you forgot an "l" dumb-ass) It doesn't. If you link me a section of the case law from above that references a "sticker" or driving/travelling/fucking whatever the hell you think you're getting on about, I'll give you 1 LTC ($125 ish).
      </p>
      <p>
       I love self governing. I absolutely believe that the police over extend. The bullshit people put forth for travelling/driving is absurd and detrimental to the movement. Fuck you. Fuck your stance on this issue. I hope you burn in some depressive state of self-reflection that you are absolutely wrong about what you believe in and your depressing lack of interpersonal support.

       ...They literally wont. They only need to have 'suspicious cause' to detain you and hold your car. Because they are police and have the backing of the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's if a CIVILIAN does it, it becomes false imprisonment and kidnapping and armed robbery. (Treason? They are attempting to overthrow the government?) It becomes those things because they do not have the government saying it's okay for you to handcuff and detain this person. The police can do shit that a security guard, nun or hobo cant because they are employees of the government who are given explicit permission to do those things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Absolutely shit will happen to the cop, because they did their job. The worst that will happen is the DA drops the case. Not the cops fault. They won't even be reprimanded.

       No. They enforce the law. They have to know enough law to decide 'This looks like it might be illegal' and detain you, then the DA goes through and decides 'Yes, this is indeed illegal' or 'no, it's not.' They do not need to know the law in detail any more than a mall cop does to detain a suspect. They only need to know ENOUGH to do their job. The police do not actually take you to court or prosecute, they just handcuff you and hand you to the guys who DO do that.

       Does each of the 50 states — the ones that require drivers licenses and insurance — also define “motor vehicle” this way? Because it’s not the U.S. government that requires these things, it’s the several states (and a few commonwealths thrown in for good measure).

       The one thing I hated the most with government was how the Bakersfield DMV had an enormous sign the says, "Driving is a privilege and not a right." So I said, how can this be true, was riding a two wheeled cart a privilege, a horse? Was the addition of a motor the tipping point? Wait! Is walking a privilege and not a right? If the answer is "privilege" then I have an enormous

       People were run down by horses and wagons. Even walking people fall off cliffs like the inventor of the Segway, well actually he drove his two wheeled Segway off a cliff. So, if something kills you, or another, it's a privilege but, according to you there has to be enough technology to cross a certain line or amount of death before it transitions from a right to a privilege.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now it's easy to figure out. Getting shot out of a cannon is a privilege because there is a certain level of technology and it can kill you. Hey, wait a minute, owning a
       <strong>
        gun
       </strong>
       is a right!? Now I'm confused again. Please clarify again why we must be granted the privilege from on-high authorities and employees of the DMV and/or the Highway Patrol.

       You can drive however you want on your own property as long as it doesn't disturb your neighbors. And there's a reason for regulating how you can drive on public roads, the US has 12.9 road fatalities per 100 000 motor vehicles while a less developed country like Togo has over 3653.4 fatalities per 100 000 vehicles. You needed a passport to even travel to another city or town before the 1800s.

       The "Passports" issued during the War for Independence made sense if you were tracking enemies, spies, royalists. It made sense for that during war. It makes zero sense in this context. Non Sequitur.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't focus on the question can you? ADD? The question is:
       <em>
        Is driving a right or a privilege?
       </em>
       The logic of calling it a "privilege" is faulty, wrong, and un-American. It's not what we fought for.

       The passports thing were in use in many other countries and not in times of war. And it shows that people had even less rights to travel then. Driving is a privilege. You are using roads, maintained with taxes from the inhabitants and sharing the road with other drivers. If you want to travel without a driver's license, take the bus, subway, train, tram, plane, taxi, Uber.

       Because no one cares about your rights except those codified in the law. Feel free to discuss philosophy with the cops that arrest you but they don't care either. There is no right to operate a motor vehicle without a licence so if you try and claim that right you will be fined and probably eventually go to jail. At this point you can discuss your philosophical rights with the guards and they won't care either.

       A right is unconditional and given to all. A privilege is given to a select group and can be conditional and revoked at will.

       Rights are given by default and can be taken away. Privileges are not offered by default and have to be given. There's a difference. You don't have a right to drive a motor vehicle on a public road, you must be given the privilege to do so by your state. The fact little Timmy has the privilege to go to his neighbors house doesn't make the term incorrect.

       Actually, I believe it became a privelidge when the government began constructing the roads with public funds. You can do whatever you want on private property, but the public has agreed to certain requirements for using public property.

       It became a privilege with they started mass making public roads. You are allowed to drive a vehicle. However, using a public road requires certain permissions, as they are maintained by the government and tax money. If you decide to buy up a few thousand miles of land and make your own roads, you can go mudding up and down the road with no licence all you want wearing chains on the wheels and no seat belt. But the second you pass onto a publicly maintained road, you are bound to the governments rules because the government owns the road and sets the rules of how someone can use it.

       All of that is true but but I still say it is a basic human right, to travel. Lord knows, sitting in a traffic jam is no "privilege". They wrote the rules, and I obey them, but none the less, no fucking authority granted me a privilege. I granted, at minimum permitted, without objection to regulate driving as one of "We the People."

       You are granted life, liberty, and the ability to pursue happiness. (Happiness is not guaranteed, only that they won't step on you for trying to achieve it.) There's no law that says they have to permit any method of travel you wish on land you do not own; and more than it does your neighbors property. You have a right to travel, that's the point of the law sovereign citizens like to quote, they let you travel freely between states rather than card and document you every time you cross like it was in the soviet union going between provinces. They do however have rules permitting how you may make use of their roads. That doesn't mean your not allowed to go anywhere you want. Motor vehicles are not guaranteed in the constitution any more than teleportation or space travel is. Your free to go there, but they can limit how you use their property if they choose.

       ...You literally don't have THAT right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rights: a moral or legal entitlement to have or obtain something or to act in a certain way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Privilege: a special right, advantage, or immunity granted or available only to a particular person or group of people. I.e. people with a driver's licence can drive on public roads.
      </p>
      <p>
       A privilege can be revoked or have conditions to have it. A right cannot be conditional.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is literally by definition a privilege. They do not HAVE to let you be capable of driving on the road. If you doubt that, try arguing your rights when you have a suspended licence, see where that gets you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you have a moral outrage at the use of the word does not make the definition incorrect.

       Wow. DMV is such a horrible place. God forbid you go there once every 3-4 years! It 'crushes the human spirit.' It frightens me people like you have the power to vote. Given your nature as perceived by your poor arguments; I am legitimately afraid of what laws and government you would create if given free reign to do so. You seem to have a terrible disconnect between the intention of laws and what inconveniences you personally.

       Once more aggressive attack against the arguer instead of at any point indicating why his argument does not have merit. Instead he accuses me of working at the DMV, calls me a creepy sadist, ugly, etc etc. And still has not actually refuted the point about rights vs privilege. Does foaming at the mouth and spewing garbage normally win arguments for you?

       I'm beginning to have similar sentiments if this is how you deal with confrontation. But, since you asked, I'd say so far I have pointed out I feel you react aggressively when provoked and make a great deal of insulting attacks. You've accused me of being (apparently?) a government employee, a sadist, ugly, an asshole, a maggot, and now apparently pure black evil. So I'd argue your the far more rabid one. Out of curiosity, do you have a counter point to this justification of my statement that doesn't involve vulgar language and attacks on my character? I'm legitimately curious now.

       Agreed. My mother had her kneecap shattered in a parking lot by an inattentive driver. Then later in life when she got by with a cane and bright red coat, it was alarming the number of people who still nearly clip her in the middle of a crosswalk.

       I do not understand why SocCits feel things like driving is a right. You don't HAVE to be permitted to operate a dangerous vehicle that can maim/kill someone with a moments inattention to get around. There are plenty of alternatives if you demonstrate it cannot be done safely. If you text and drive you SHOULD have your licence taken away. But apparently they should be able to do anything no matter how it affects others because it's them. The degree of narcissism and focus only on how it affects themselves is staggering sometimes. Even the above posters argument boils down to "It's my right because 'I' say so" without any kind of thought on any position that doesn't affect them. And becomes aggressive and abusive if they are challenged.
      </p>
      <p>
       I expect the DMV is an extension of that. They should just be able to drive. They feel any kind of challenge to that authority is abuse, and the fact it's a crowded government agency to boot is some sort of personal insult. It's the only explanation I can think of for the hate of the DMV. The LONGEST time I've ever spent there was maybe 90 minutes, where I read a book and ate a snack, and had it done in ten minutes once I was called up. Once every 3-4 years, less often than that in many states. But people act like it's the incarnation of hell.

"A motor vehicle is any contrivance propelled by mechanical power used for commercial purposes"
Thats right. Only for commercial business or financial gain.
So if you are not paid to haul rocks or transport passengers, you are not using your automobile for commercial purposes, and do not require a license, or registration, or insurance.

       No, it's not. You're obviously talking about definition #15:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (15) “United States” means—
(A) a Federal corporation;
(B) an agency, department, commission, board, or other entity of the United States; or
(C) an instrumentality of the United States.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Notice the "or" there. That means that, for the purposes of that chapter, the phrase "the United States" could refer to any of those things. Okay, why does that matter? Because that chapter is about debt collection. And guess what? There's several government-owned corporations (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) that are in the debt collection business. So when that chapter says (for example) "You have to repay your debt to the United States or else these are the consequences..." the law is saying (in part) that you have to repay the debt you owe on the loan you took out from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: It doesn't mean the United States is a corporation. It means that when it says, in the context of debt collection, that "the United States" can also refer to government-owned debt collection corporations.

       The clause in the Bill of Rights that free citizens have a fascination with is due to a profound misunderstanding of its very purpose, which was to establish a federal system that would not restrict travel for citizens betwixt the states, NOT to establish that citizens in transit were somehow not beholden to the authority of the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, even if using roads for, "traveling," as you have defined it, was governed by federal law, it is a tenant of federal (and state) civil procedure that simply by using public highways for any purpose, one has entered into a reciprocal agreement with that jurisdiction to be beholden to its authority. This means that just by using publicly funded infrastructure, like roads and highways, you agree to submit to the laws of that jurisdiction, regardless of your purpose. The laws of every state require licensing to operate a motor vehicle, and therefore if you use a public road, you have agreed to apply for and maintain your privilege to operate a motor vehicle, via licensing. Even if the federal government explicitly did not require licensing for "traveling", the Erie doctrine would require the government to apply the licensing law of the state in which the event occurred, which unanimously require licensing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that the operation of a motor vehicle for non-commercial purposes exists as a right is laughable after even a modicum of reflection - if such an activity existed as a right, at what point would minors be allowed to exercise that right? Immediately? At the age of majority? If an individual was blind, it would be illegal to restrict their right to drive, thereby endangering everyone, including pedestrians. Every attempt to regulate transit would become a civil rights claim, further congesting the courts, and costing taxpayers. Even if the legislature intended for driving to be a right and not a privilege, the legislature would have changed it in the interests of judicial economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The notion of differentiating between private sector use and public use is, firstly, impossible to regulate, and second, the result of not only improper statutory interpretation but also a complete misunderstanding of the laws of the United States. Even if the wording was originally intended to differentiate transit in the way you have misconstrued, its application today exclusively treats motor transit as a single type- the hallmark of US law is its ability to adapt to the times via precedent. Ergo, you're wrong, and even if you were correct in your statutory interpretation, you're still wrong. Also, an idiot who I cannot wait to watch get lawfully arrested on YouTube.
      </p>
      <p>
       You must understand that when you pretend to be someone who understands the law, the lazy, the naive, and the stupid will believe you, particularly when you slap two cases in your post to lend your "argument" credence. Both of those cases have been cherry picked for a quote that disregards the context in which they were made, which is dishonest and manipulative. I will not enter into a firing of caselaw back and forth with you because you are obviously not a lawyer and have proven yourself incapable of understanding statutory construction, interpretation, and precedent. When you attempt to mislead people as you have, you can cause them or bystanders to be fined, unable to obtain just remedy, injured, or killed. The ramifications of your erroneous interpretation of the law have real world effects, so please put down your device, burn your keyboard, and cease enjoying your right to free speech.

       I think you can travel in a car, just can't travel on a road. Your welcome to drive a tractor or go cart on your own property. But once you go onto public property you better have a licence to do so. Or get an elaborate chain of permissions to travel through a series of private properties between you and your destination so you can just cut across everyone's lawn to get there.

       Wow this is great stuff ... If you're being detained by someone who is not a state employee.  State law is different from federal law

       You've cited a tiny portion of two cases that don't say what you think they do. How come you can't cite a single case where this argument has actually gotten off someone for driving without a licence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's assume you're right. You're not. If you're right then all of the cops and all of the courts think you're wrong. God gives you no rights. The rights you have are limited to what a court agrees they are. The court says you're wrong and you'll rot in prison for contempt until you agree with it.

       OP, you are being stupid. A cop is not a lawyer. The recorded conversation doesn't mean shit. You are delusional and need help.

       First you try to evade my observation and now you resort to name calling. That means you agree I'm right. Rekt again.

       I guess you would know. Do you work at the DMV? I hate that space. In itself, it is a form of oppression, crushing the human spirit. I'm done with this discussion and stand by my freedoms and not your semantics.
