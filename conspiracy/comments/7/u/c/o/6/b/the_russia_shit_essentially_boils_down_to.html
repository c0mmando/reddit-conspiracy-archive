       So far all of the evidence is coming from the 5 eyes and 9 eyes groups. Not far fetched to say that they're all cooperating to take down Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the support is that all the evidence so far is "Intelligence agency says X". Why should we blindly trust an organization built for propaganda?

       Why would you blindly trust someone who lies as much as trump? He's lied time and time again about his ties to Russia. His sons said they've gotten large sums of money from Russian financiers but trump lies about it. He hires people who lie about working for pro-Russian foreign governments.

       This tribal thought of black and white, left and right is obfuscating your ability to think logically, the both of you. You are saying that you either -
A. Believe Trump
or
B. Believe the Intelligence Agencies
      </p>
      <p>
       Both are wrong. Do not believe either of them if you wish to conclude the truth, the Russian allegations are completely fabricated, to fabricate a foreign enemy is vital to the defense industries and the defense department, especially a nation such as America which much of it's income relies on destroying and stealing the assets of foreign nations such as Iraq for the oil and Afghanistan for the heroin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is, nobody gets into the office of President without having some usefulness to those who control the entire system of US Politics, the deep state, the elites. I personally believe they put Trump in office and have been defaming him ever since because he is one of the easiest targets to destroy if it needs be, the amount of dirt they will have on him will be ridicoulous. 
They have manufactured an arena, an arena in which the game you are invited to play, they set the rules. They have manufactured a situation in which you are either pro-trump, or pro-deepstate/massmedia, knowing full well that Trump is designed to fall like a house of cards. That is politics in the West with the illusion of democracy. With trust in the deep state withering since the revelations that they lied in full knowledge of WMD's in Iraq being false in order to have a pretext to invade, they need to redevelop the trust. One is by opposing a house of cards. You must see this.
Humans are tribal beings, easy to manipulate if you set the rules of engagement and divide society into factions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, with Russian allegations, surely it is the job of the people claiming there has been intereference to provide evidence. In a court of law, the accuser provides evidence against the defendant, not vice versa and that is for good reason. So far, over one year into a full pledged investigation spanning cross-country, there has still not been one piece, not an iota of evidence to suggest interference.
Also, you say that the evidence is in the 'intelligence' community claiming it, why would you blindly follow the words of people who you know full well, lied to the public to justify an invasion of a foreign nation. They fabricated 'evidence' for geopolitical advantage. Perhaps if you think for a minute, why would you blindly believe a known liar?

       Lot's of evidence that the Rothschilds have controlled most of the West for a long time now. That includes the creation of modern Israel as we know it, and complete control of our banking system, including the Fed.

       Of course they do a very good job of staying in the shadows and keeping their dealings a secret, otherwise they wouldn't be able to maintain this level of power. A good primer with tons of solid research is "Secrets of the Federal Reserve," by Eustace Mullins.

       Have you ever considered thinking for yourself, rather than relying on appeals to authority? If you simply "trust" what those in power over you tell you to believe, you are guaranteed to be manipulated.

       I don't simply stop believing in something just because experts tell me it's true. That seems absurd to me. Do you also believe the earth is flat? Just because people in charge say it's not?

       ...What, no? That's not what I'm saying at all. I'm saying that I've seen nothing that makes me believe in the Russia collusion narrative pushed by a few corrupt people at the top of the IC and our Project Mockingbird MSM. And I'm not going to believe it just because they say so.

       Yup, I think this has been obvious to most people for nearly a year now, no offense. Our IAs have a long history of doing this in other countries, like with Jacobo Árbenz in Guatamala, where they employed propaganda through the media (Project Mockingbird) to successfully turn much of the population against him. People don't want to admit it, but propaganda can be very effective and many people have been manipulated into believing what they do.

       The Russia shit essientially boils down to:

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Did the Trump Org employ a convicted Russian mafia associate that has served jail time for massive stock fraud and stabbing a man in the face?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Did the Trump Org participate in a racketeering scheme at Trump Soho to launder millions of dirty Kazakh money from embezzlement, bank fraud, and mining corruption?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Did the Trump Org employ additional Bayrock employees outside of the convicted Russian mobster?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Does the convicted Russian mobster have ties to the top corporate lawyer and executive VP at the Trump Org?

         Does the top corporate lawyer and executive VP at the Trump Org have deep family ties to Russian organised crime in Brighton Beach, including a father in law that plead guilty to conspiracy tax fraud?

       They imply massive crimes committed with the coordination Russian mafia, something that Trump has consistently lied about throughout his entire political career. Michael Cohen and Felix Sater both pop up during the campaign, especially Michael Cohen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allthough the obstruction of justice investigation looks very promising, it is the money laundering with the Kazakh and Russian mafia that is ultimately going to be the biggest exposure for the President.

       What the
       <del>
        propaganda
       </del>
       media says is that Trump was helped by the Russian government in the campaign and they might possibly have compromising material on him. What you're saying is that he had shady financial dealings in Russia which is illegal but is far from what he's being accused of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention he never made any pro-Russia policy until the sanctions shit and he also continued many Obama era anti-Russian policies. He's even starting a new campaign against a Russian ally with this Iran shit.

       I couldn't care less about his past or rumors about his campaign, for all we know all of that is made up by the ICs and fed to the gullible media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just care about his policy and for the most part he's continued Obama's policy of antagonizing Russia and its allies.
