    <div class="md"><p>This tribal thought of black and white, left and right is obfuscating your ability to think logically, the both of you. You are saying that you either -
A. Believe Trump
or
B. Believe the Intelligence Agencies</p>

<p>Both are wrong. Do not believe either of them if you wish to conclude the truth, the Russian allegations are completely fabricated, to fabricate a foreign enemy is vital to the defense industries and the defense department, especially a nation such as America which much of it&#39;s income relies on destroying and stealing the assets of foreign nations such as Iraq for the oil and Afghanistan for the heroin.</p>

<p>The truth is, nobody gets into the office of President without having some usefulness to those who control the entire system of US Politics, the deep state, the elites. I personally believe they put Trump in office and have been defaming him ever since because he is one of the easiest targets to destroy if it needs be, the amount of dirt they will have on him will be ridicoulous. 
They have manufactured an arena, an arena in which the game you are invited to play, they set the rules. They have manufactured a situation in which you are either pro-trump, or pro-deepstate/massmedia, knowing full well that Trump is designed to fall like a house of cards. That is politics in the West with the illusion of democracy. With trust in the deep state withering since the revelations that they lied in full knowledge of WMD&#39;s in Iraq being false in order to have a pretext to invade, they need to redevelop the trust. One is by opposing a house of cards. You must see this.
Humans are tribal beings, easy to manipulate if you set the rules of engagement and divide society into factions.</p>

<p>Also, with Russian allegations, surely it is the job of the people claiming there has been intereference to provide evidence. In a court of law, the accuser provides evidence against the defendant, not vice versa and that is for good reason. So far, over one year into a full pledged investigation spanning cross-country, there has still not been one piece, not an iota of evidence to suggest interference.
Also, you say that the evidence is in the &#39;intelligence&#39; community claiming it, why would you blindly follow the words of people who you know full well, lied to the public to justify an invasion of a foreign nation. They fabricated &#39;evidence&#39; for geopolitical advantage. Perhaps if you think for a minute, why would you blindly believe a known liar?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, I think this has been obvious to most people for nearly a year now, no offense. Our IAs have a long history of doing this in other countries, like with Jacobo Árbenz in Guatamala, where they employed propaganda through the media (Project Mockingbird) to successfully turn much of the population against him. People don&#39;t want to admit it, but propaganda can be very effective and many people have been manipulated into believing what they do.</p>

<p>They imply massive crimes committed with the coordination Russian mafia, something that Trump has consistently lied about throughout his entire political career. Michael Cohen and Felix Sater both pop up during the campaign, especially Michael Cohen.</p>

<p>Allthough the obstruction of justice investigation looks very promising, it is the money laundering with the Kazakh and Russian mafia that is ultimately going to be the biggest exposure for the President.</p>
