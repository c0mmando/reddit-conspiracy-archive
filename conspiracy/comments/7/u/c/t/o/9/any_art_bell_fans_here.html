    <div class="md"><p>Art made late nights great.  I remember hearing Malachy Martin&#39;s first interview, all stars like Norio Hayakawa, Bob Lazar.  Those were great shows.  The theme music, bumper songs, and the ominous voice &quot;from the Kingdom of Nye.&quot;  </p>

<p>George Noory trashed the Coast legacy, but Art Bell will always be the king of late night.  When Richard Hoagland would stray off topic Art would whip him back, while George would nod off during Hoagland&#39;s rants. Art even had better commercials, the one for the radio with a crank instead of electricity, compared to George and the supplements and whatever else he peddles.  </p>

<p>I think it is time for a new conspiracy style late night show.  I am fine with podcasts but there was something exhilarating about waking up at midnight to listen to the show live.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>there is an AM radio station near me I listen to, and late nights, like 10 or 11pm, they do &quot;Coast to Coast, with Art Bell&#39;s &#39;Somewhere in Time&#39;&quot;.</p>

<p>its pretty awesome. sometimes when it goes off into demons and astral projection im like &quot;meh&quot;. sometimes they have cool guests and topics that are less fictional and just curiosity related. sometimes the fictional stuff is worth a laugh if they are being tongue in cheek about it.</p>

<p>I love how they re-air episodes from the 90&#39;s. its cool to see snapshots of history, like how people talked about the Y2K bug. the real and palpable anxiety over &quot;the end of the world&quot; hysteria at the turning of the century. </p>

<p>...and the politics. I always have a chuckle when I tune in and dont realize its the show, and im hearing about a new Clinton scandal and realize its not something new but its like the whitewater scandal from the 90s or one of the many others, and its just an Art Bell re-air.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a video on YouTube and he was talking to some guy on the radio saying he doesn’t have long before they triangulate his position and he was telling them they need to start moving the population to safe areas and stuff then the guy gets cut off. That’s all I’ve heard from the guy I never bothered to look up anything else, is it interesting? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, though I actually liked Coast to Coast even more after George Noory took over.  </p>

<p>I also live in the same town as a guy who used to be a frequent guest on the show during both eras, who has his own local radio show, and I sometimes listen to that show too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Art Bell was a brilliant radio host. It was really sad to see the slow decline of Coast to Coast after he left. They had some good hosts in the follow-up, but the end George used intimidation and conniving to take it over. The way George treated Art, who founded C2C and made it great, is reprehensible. </p>
