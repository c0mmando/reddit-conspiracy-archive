It&#39;s POLITICS, not a conspiracy FFS.  Who cares if Joe Kennedy voted to prosecute pot users.  NOT a conspiracy, just politics.  Yet this sub eats it up like its <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> because <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is useless now that it was taken over by shills and bots.  </p>

<p>huh? Also, the abstract starts with:</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t this be more like fake planted disinformation for foreign agents or general psyops?</p>

Conclusion: &quot;From the analysis of the video tapes and high speed photographs of 25 successful experiments in breaking through spatial barriers by a young subject with paranormal abilities. We have proved the existence of one paranormal ability - the ability to pass through spatial barriers. That the pass through point can be the wall of the container, and further more that the passing through the walls occurs over a period of time&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. I&#39;d like to see it reproduced on video, tbh. One of the things that makes me skeptical of these claims is that James Randy had a million dollars on the table for decades for anyone that could produce psychic/esp/whatever under controlled, laboratory settings and he finally withdrew it because it went unclaimed. He probably needed the money for himself at that point since he was old and retired.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s basically how I feel too. Moreover, even the stuff that seems to have a weak effect is soooo weak that it&#39;s pretty much worthless, and there&#39;s been no research at all showing that people can actually harness the power in any meaningful way even if it does exist. </p>

<p>They work using binaural beats. Binaural beats create a specific frequency in your brain by broadcasting, say, an 8 hz signal in your right ear and a 1 hz signal in your left ear. The mind will sync to the difference, in this case 8 hz which is generally considered to be a content state. 1hz I believe is deep sleep, and, spookily, 6.66 hz is a very bad place to be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>TLDR: The CIA experiments with paranormal Chinamen, breaking through spatial barriers by moving objects through glass bottles and paper envelopes with their minds.</p>

<p>When and where was this experiment performed? Was the Chinese government also involved? What happened to the All-China Paranormal Physical Abilities Joint Testing Group? Was Lin Shuhuang ever tested by anybody else? How come they didn&#39;t get it on good quality video? Why are the pictures of such low quality? Is psychokinesis strong enough to move somebody&#39;s organs outside of their bodies or is it a weak parlor trick like in the experiment? Why would anybody trust the CIA? Does the CIA ever forge documents? Do they lie about their true purpose? Why has The Agency never admitted the true purpose of MKULTRA, i.e. trauma-based mind control?</p>

<p>When an American person talks of &quot;Asian&quot; people, they are referring to Chinese, Japanese, Korean etc.</p>

<p>To a British person, &quot;Asian&quot; is more like Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi. When it comes to what you call &quot;Asian&quot; we tend to just use the country name, for example someone might be Thai, or Chinese, or Cambodian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Chinese is the term here. It doesn&#39;t appear that these experiments were conducted by the CIA. It says &quot;Aerospace Medicine Engineering Institute&quot; then a handwritten note says &quot;probably military operated.&quot; No place with that name comes up on google. I think if this was an institution used for CIA testing there would be no doubt about who operated it or whether it was military.
Last page thanks a long list of Chinese people including Chairman Zhang Zhenhuan. Pretty sure this is a report that was given to the CIA and not one conducted by them.<br/>
I do believe these things are possible from my own experience and it is known that the CIA was interested in these things. It&#39;s an interesting paper but it&#39;s not proof. It&#39;s evidence and it&#39;s up to you to decide its value.<br/>
Also, can someone buy the CIA a new printer? </p>

<p>&quot;TLDR: The CIA experiments with paranormal Chinamen, breaking through spatial barriers by moving objects through glass bottles and paper envelopes with their minds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some questions:</p>

<p>When and where was this experiment performed? Was the Chinese government also involved? What happened to the All-China Paranormal Physical Abilities Joint Testing Group? Was Lin Shuhuang ever tested by anybody else? How come they didn&#39;t get it on good quality video? Why are the pictures of such low quality?...&quot;</p>

<p>Because you have to understand dude - the paramilitary and black government agencies don&#39;t study things for any greater posterity. They don&#39;t need to have good video or pictures because it&#39;s not done to prove anything to anyone but themselves. They also know that less documentation means less chance of leaks.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not meant for you to know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason why the CIA gave up this type of research is because they found that their ability to design objective tests to verify these abilities was always slightly bettered by the ability of cunning humans to beat or bypass the tests controls. It took them quite a few years to realize this. Then there was also the whole fooling / being fooled by the Soviets angle.</p>

<p>Universities and colleges like M.I.T also delved into this type of research, even opening entire labs for the purpose. Initially they had success in verifying the phenomena only to be thoroughly embarrassed once they realized they had been tricked. They soon closed them down. Randi talks about how this went down.</p>

<p>The longest running phenomena which defied explanation was the ability for people to learn to pronounce whether a number provided by a Random Number Machine was above or below the last number given. More study has shown the effect to likely not exist (depending on who you ask). </p>

<p>There&#39;s a group who still sells the RNM and the software used in the testing if you want to give it a try.</p>

<p>Randi&#39;s unclaimed $1m prize for proof of paranormal ability is pretty good evidence none of this stuff exists. </p>

The title refers to attempts to kill goats by staring at them and stopping their hearts. The book is companion to a three-part TV series broadcast in Britain on Channel 4—Crazy Rulers of the World (2004)—the first episode of which is also entitled &quot;The Men Who Stare at Goats&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. Ronson and Jones certainly didn&#39;t portray it that way in that episode of Crazy Rulers of the World. </p>

<p>You can watch them on youtube setting up the hidden camera in the bag, talking with people about the best way to sneak in, being all &quot;freaked out&quot; about what they saw, Jones and his buddy suspecting Ronson of being secretly against them and wanting to get out of town in a  hurry, etc. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t put it past Jones, but I respected Ronson more than that. </p>

<p>Spot on. I think their interest in remote viewing and psychic experiments is basically a cover for very real psychotronic technologies.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they publicised to the masses that human consciousness isn&#39;t an accidental byproduct of bipedal brain function, nor is it limited by the bounds of time and space, but rather that consciousness is an inherent property of the universe and everything in it, then the masses would have far less of an incentive to continue their meaningless, depressing, 9-5 grinds and give up so much of their earnings to some authority.<br/>
But since that is reality, then instead of publicly advertising that, they advertise religion in place of it. Institutionalised spirituality. And they make it political. That way they can satisfy (for a lot of people, at least) that nagging feeling that there&#39;s &quot;something more&quot; to all of this, but at the same time continue to control the flow of information under a perceived authority figure and hierarchical power structure. This worked for a long time, until this guy called Jesus came along and told everyone, &quot;Hey, guys, the priests are lying to you. You don&#39;t have to go through them to access &quot;God&quot; - all you gotta do is look within yourself and you can access all the information of the universe!&quot; so then the Romans killed him and rewrote the bible and his story and yada yada yada, you know the rest of that.<br/>
But then about 150-200 years ago this a new idea entered the mix and some of these guys who thought it decided to start denying the concept of God as the industrial revolution was occurring, which was quite convenient. They could promote the whole political power structure thing, but do entirely out with the whole &quot;God&quot; thing so people wouldn&#39;t have any reason to go against the grain under the knowledge that they have the safety net of eternal existence post-life, and all the while they could use science and machines and technology and all this stuff to keep the masses distracted and they&#39;d call this &quot;progress&quot; while simultaneously discrediting and shaming the idea of believing in higher consciousness as &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;not based in reality&quot;. But then as science progressed physicists started discovering that no, there really is something more than this physical reality, and they redefined God from the misrepresentation of it that had been propagated by religion for so long, back to the original definition. Physicists had rediscovered God.<br/>
And then WWI happened.<br/>
And then WWII happened.<br/>
And all the spiritual knowledge and artifacts and symbols that had been slowly coming to light over the years got hoarded up by the key power players who kept it to themselves. And the killing off of so many people had left those who remained in a bit of a state of shock - not only that humans are capable of such terrible potential, but that science and technology can really do a lot (think: guns, planes, radio, radar, TV, splitting atoms etc). Now they could push that old chestnut of scientific atheism again with far less resistance.<br/>
But if you&#39;re paying attention we can see that same pattern emerging again. You can only keep spirituality suppressed for so long until it gets rediscovered. Either by science or archeology. This is what&#39;s led a lot of people to theorise that WWIII is on its way.<br/>
Huh... How did i get here from you asking why this stuff isn&#39;t publicised? Well, I suppose it&#39;s that whoever is in power at the time likes to keep it to themselves. But then it gets out eventually one way or another anyway. And then they throw a wrench in the works. And then history repeats itself. </p>

You open gateways to demonic possession or attachments when you meditate, do yoga, do psychedelic drugs, chant certain sounds, play certain music among other things like group sex during a magick ritual and more. By lowering critical faculties you allow evil spirits to enter. That’s how many famous magicians get their powers allegedly. Through contracts with demons. Basically luciferians channel spirits and people who develop supernatural abilities typically are able to do so because they opened a demonic gateway either knowingly or through new age practices without knowing its demon conjuring.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your misinterpretation is a result of you viewing it through the lense of organised religion (or &quot;institutionalised spirituality&quot; as I call it, wherein &quot;spirituality&quot; simply refers to the study of consciousness and reality). It&#39;s a warping of the truth. A stemming of the flow of information from a perceived authority figure (in this case I <em>assume</em> the church) in order to control the masses.<br/>
Extrasensory abilities, via the extended mind, are skills and traits innate to all beings. It&#39;s just a case of becoming aware of them and utilising them. I won&#39;t deny that there may be some methods in which allow an individual to come into contact with another conscious individual (be that human, alien, or any other classification of inter/extradimensional entity), but I believe the majority of extrasensory ability in humans is a result of exercising inherent capabilities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was agnostic for decades. I figured this out by researching government corruption which led me to researching the occult which top public figures appear to be involved in. Eventually that led me to question if they actually were getting results from worshiping their dieties and if there was a spiritual world, It was clear they worshipped lucifer and hated Christianity. They infiltrated every major institution in the world including the Vatican. That’s how we ended up with priests getting enabled to be pedophiles and changes to the doctrine in general to contradict the Bible. </p>

<p>After over 15 years of research and experiences - including a background in studying world religions- I’m now a Christian. Jesus is real and he’s our only protection. If we walk with Christ He’ll restore what’s been stolen from us by these demons that the perfectly possessed devil worshipping secret cabal of witches are trying to sell us out to in exchange for power and wealth. Who knows what technology they’ve been given and how long they really get to live compared to us. Something must be convincing them that going to hell is worth it. Whistleblowers say that they are taught a fake version of the Bible that makes lucifer the god and savior and makes them think hell is not bad or that they will be spared somehow by lucifer which would be a deception that they were tricked into believing it brainwashed into believing from birth. </p>

<p>Many if not most of them are mind controlled victims. The lowest ranking members don’t even know that they are members of a devil worshipping cult. It’s kept secret by only giving as much info as is necessary fir each member to play their part. The highest ranking are from important luciferian bloodlines that put their children through mk ultra programming and sexual rituals as they themselves were so they are in line with the agendas they need to push to lead as many people to hell as possible. That’s the end goal. </p>

<p>I’ve witnessed the effect of Jesus’ name in demons. They flee. Alien visitations, sleep paralysis, entities encountered while tripping are usually demonic attacks. These “aliens” and UFOs are demons, not extra terrestrials. The gray aliens we hear described look just like the demon, Lam, that Aliester crowley (most famous occultist) channeled and made a drawing of back in the day. The reptilians people claim to see are demons. The Bible even says that evil spirits look like reptiles. </p>

<p>The entities encountered in sleep paralysis and “alien” visitations fit the descriptions of demons written for thousands of years. Different people can share the same sleep paralysis “nightmare”. The only thing that explains what’s happening in the world is the Bible. Science is just a method of study that can only create supported theories or prove things false. You can’t prove a theory true so it will always have a scientific explanation for anything that is supernatural since there’s no burden of proof. According to my bio professor 50% of scientific facts get proven false in ten years since they are just theories. </p>

<p>I had a sleep paralysis incident a few years ago that was terrifying. My body was being held down with crushing power and I couldn&#39;t resist, budge, breathe. Finally my mind reminded me to pray to Jesus, and it went away. The millisecond my mind started praying, it lost 50% of it&#39;s strength.

&quot;Analysis and assessment of the gateway process&quot;, for anyone wondering.

I like how it really gets into the holographic theory (see: <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a>) and directly addresses some descriptive models from Itzhak Bentov - whose work I also always recommend for those interested, and can be seen on YouTube or read in his books &quot;Stalking the wild Pendulum&quot; and &quot;A Brief tour of Higher Consciousness&quot;. Also on the same page I encourage people to look into the work of Rupert Sheldrake on morphogenetic fields aka &quot;the extended mind&quot;, which he has some good lectures on YouTube about. </p>

But we found it only worked if the two people were touching. Could not do it from two different rooms. We made color cards and two people were placed back to back. One person pulled a random card and looked at the color. The other person would have to tell what color they were looking at. It worked best if the person trying to figure out what the color was closed their eyes. Sometimes it was hard when it was between two colors that were similar. But often the color would pop right up with no problems. Fun and kind of creepy. </p>
