       All of this is very ironic when one looks yet deeper into Crowley's secret connections. Crowley was not only involved in the OTO but was also a member of an arcane secret society known as the A:.A:. (Argenteum Astrum) or the Order of the Silver Star. The "silver star" referred to is Sirius itself, the most prominent in the heavens and positioned as the chief star in the ancient constellation "Phoenix". The ancient Assyrians and Phoenicians both derive their name from this legacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crowley identified the Order of the Silver Star as the Illuminati itself. As he was considered to be the head of the Illuminati, the correspondences continue to run even deeper. The heart of his magical current was inspired from Sirius and there was much tradition to back this up. In occult tradition, Sirius is the Hidden God or "the sun behind the sun". As the moon reflects the sun, so does the sun reflect Sirius."
      </p>
      <p>
       Sun Kachina: "Sirius is the Hidden God or 'the sun behind the sun'..." Sirius: The star that "brings" the flood season on the River Nile. Also "chief star in the ancient constellation 'Phoenix'..." River. Phoenix.
      </p>
      <p>
       "According to the ancient Egyptians, there was a special occult link between Sirius and the Earth when they were at their closest distance. In other words, more universal light was being reflected from Sirius than at any other time of the year. This link was found to be most powerful during the Dog Days of August (Sirius is known as the Dog Star , also the name of keanu reeves band) which run from July 23 rd to August 23rd."
      </p>
      <p>
       Phoenix turned 23 on August 23rd of that year. An anagram of his name spells 'Viper Heroin X". On the most important holiday in every occultist's calendar, he died from a supposedly accidental overdose.

       The name of Keanu's band was (is?) "Dogstar". Everyone knew that around MOPI, Keanu was -- somehow -- seriously involved with David Geffen. I don't know if it was a relationship or sexual or what but it seemed like everyone knew they were together. River and Keanu were always just friends but Van Sant said Keanu had told him they'd had sex in the movie trailer. He could have just been trying get a rise out of Van Sant but I don't know. River and Keanu were very close.
      </p>
      <p>
       Geffen is one of those industry guys that gives me the creeps. Then, River dies from an overdose of eight times the lethal limit of cocaine (read that: Eight times the LETHAL limit), mixed with Persian brown heroin (the strongest kind), codeine and diazepam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Geffen was going to deal with the loss of one of his biggest stars, shortly after the death of Phoenix. He was having issues with Nirvana. From the Wikipedia of the "In Utero" album:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Soon afterward, in April 1993 Albini remarked to the Chicago Tribune that he doubted Geffen would release the completed album.[59] Albini commented years later that in a sense he felt he spoke about the situation "from a position of ignorance, because I wasn't there when the band was having their discussions with the record label. All I know is [. . .] we made a record, everybody was happy with it. A few weeks later I hear that it's unreleasable and it's all got to be redone".[60] While Albini's remarks in the article drew no immediate reply from the group or its label, Newsweek ran a similar article soon afterwards that did.[61] Nirvana denied there was any pressure from its label to change the album's sound, sending a letter to Newsweek that said that the article's author "ridiculed our relationship with our label based on totally erronous [sic] information"; the band also reprinted the letter in a full-page ad in Billboard. Rosenblatt insisted in a press release that Geffen would release anything the band submitted, and label founder David Geffen made the unusual move of personally calling Newsweek to complain about the article.[62]"

       River Phoenix (An anagram of his name spells 'Viper Heroin X") died at Johnny Depp's infamous drug den, The Viper Room. Depp had early connections with the drug mafia. For some strange inexplicable reason the joint was never raided. Depp sold the place after the disappearance of his former business partner Anthony Fox, who took Depp to court on fraud.

       Jennifer Syme was born in Pico Rivera, California, where she lived for the first eighteen years of her life. Shortly after moving to Los Angeles, she landed a job working for director David Lynch. Syme had a few minor film roles including a part in Lynch's Lost Highway. She later joined the staff of a music label. She was also a personal assistant to Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction and, later, the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
      </p>
      <p>
       On April 1, 2001, Syme attended a party at musician Marilyn Manson's home. After being driven home by another party guest shortly before dawn, she left her home, reportedly to return to the party. On the morning of April 2, 2001, Syme drove her 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee into a row of parked cars on Cahuenga Boulevard in Los Angeles. She was partially ejected from the vehicle and died instantly. Syme was 28 years old.[1] Syme is buried next to her daughter, Ava Archer Reeves (stillborn in December 1999), whose father is the actor Keanu Reeves, in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.
      </p>
      <p>
       In April 2002, Syme’s mother, Maria St. John, sued Marilyn Manson for wrongful death for giving Syme “various quantities of an illegal controlled substance”[3] and for "instructing [Syme] to operate a motor vehicle in her incapacitated condition". Manson issued a statement denying responsibility for Syme's death, stating that the lawsuit was "completely without merit".[4] An investigation into the accident concluded that Syme, who was not wearing a seatbelt, was inebriated at the time of the accident. Reports also stated that police found two rolled up dollar bills that contained a white, powdery substance and two bottles of prescription drugs, a muscle relaxant and an anticonvulsant.[5] Syme's mother told police her daughter was seeking treatment for back pain and depression just a few days prior to her death. Marilyn Manson's former record label interscope is owned by David Geffen , Manson's music is prominently featured on the soundtrack of John Wick a film about a secret society of assassins  Starring Keanu Reeves.

       Yes, if one is going to discuss Crowley, you really need to factor in that he was in British intelligence (many occultists are also in intelligence, as you may have noticed).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there's more to it than just this, but it's pretty clear the Brits sent him over to America to be a rabble rouser at one point, and then later his "retreat" where he bummed people seemed like some kind of psyop re: elites themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Colin Wilson's book "The Occult" (recommended on a Reddit book list so fairly obviously a gatekeeper book, but interesting nonetheless) dances around the issue and basically spells out that he was in intelligence. There were numerous esoteric / mystical societies at the time, I think his task was to consolidate power within those circles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly, the Colin Wilson book above also engages in gymnastics to not acknowledge that significant number of elites are Satan worshippers. I swear there's a part where discussing French occultism, the author glosses over a mystic guy jizzing into the disemboweled mess of a dead boy. End sentence. Moving on. Nothing to see here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Published by Random House which likely would have been under editorial control of Jason Epstein at the time. This latter guy is married to Judy Miller who hoaxed/psy'op'ed America into Iraq war. They're both part of the academic honors fraternity (phi beta kappa) that Ben Shapiro and other cultural pivot points are in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Epstein is thanked (along with Satan) in Saul Alinsky's rules for radicals. His wikipedia page is natural a bit sparse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bit of an aside there, but yes Crowley was certainly part of something larger.

       Great post. I just wonder how many other connections can be made with other hollywood stars. I am sure all of them have some sorts of connection to illuminati or other shady stuff.
       <br/>
       One thing I learned
 is you will never be a super star just because you are talented. Hollywood is not about talents and skills, most of them are really bad actors. It's all about connections.
       <br/>

       Great post. I just wonder how many other connections can be made with other hollywood stars. I am sure all of them have some sorts of connection to illuminati or other shady stuff.
       <br/>
       One thing I learned
 is you will never be a super star just because you are talented. Hollywood is not about talents and skills, most of them are really bad actors. It's all about connections.

       Ah, I see. Still, not sure if "prominently featured" is an accurate description. I'm not saying the other stuff isn't true, but it's important not to hyperbolize statements just to make something seem true.

       Oh I agree. I find it weird itunes doesn't list it as on the soundtrack and maybe it isn't on the soundtrack but it was played in the movie a couple times.

       How the fuck is it a conspiracy though?? It's just ranting. I can make wild word association and change some letters around in some words to make them spooky, it doesn't constitute a conspiracy. At best there are some light coincidence involved in OPs post.

       Yes. These cultists who rule the world from the shadows as an all-powerful entity choose simple anagrams to name their celebrity pawns. They leave simple fucking clues for people to figure out...it sounds rediculous.

       Please stop acting like you have some secret information nobody else has. You don't. You just choose to believe in a LARPy reality in which demons and ghosts exist. The occult is a holdover from when people were too retarded to understand their own existence.

       By all means continue to live in a complete fucking fantasy world while the real and true problems rage on. If you believe the occult plays any role in modern society aside from campy halloween stories you are painfully mistaken and you're a part of the problem. You are the reason people scoff and group all conspiracy theories together as mad babbling.

       Magic doesn't have to be real for the belief in it to be a framework for people's behavior. Jesus or Moses don't have to be real for Christianity or Judism to exist. Why is it any different with the occult?

       Why even bother coming to this subreddit. People are actually discouraging occult or anything fringe related on this subreddit... thats insane to me. Do you actually like conspiracies or do you just invade threads that you disagree with? Vast majority of the people on this sub at least entertain the idea.

       How about take this from an occult believer?  This post is kindergarten level bullshit.  Sounds like someone read Cosmic Trigger and think they are enlightened.
