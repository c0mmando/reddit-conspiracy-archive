       TL; DR
      </p>
      <p>
       *Reddit founder dies premature. very libertarian Ron Paul fan type about internet and the future of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       *new lady who replaced our lord is ousted to be replaced by our current steward (like, lotr style steward).
      </p>
      <p>
       *censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       *paid promoted links
      </p>
      <p>
       *making it a financial project to sell as a reference source to video theater acted visual media outlets with an agenda, and not a free discussion in text and logic that might conflict with the sites financial sponsors. (nothing inherantly wrong with that, eddison beat tesla by learning finances [kinda like libertarian vs socialist] the same way elon musk is trying to be both an edison and tesla.)
      </p>
      <p>
       *limiting debate. partisan shilling. disenfranchisement. trolling. bots. paid narrative control.
      </p>
      <p>
       *the gateway into this last bastion of a sub is basically being strangled the same way voat is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this what they meant when they said the rich man learned it was time to sell hi stock when the shoe shiner boy had stock opinions?
      </p>
      <p>
       interesting times. the common focus has shifted and sorted out so many things over the years. if the eye stays where it's at, for a lot of people, it's going to be historic.
      </p>
      <p>
       my theory is that this very bastion of refuge for us minds is no more as innocent as it started. but it can be. being in the fringe and left alone as rejects was more comfortable. the sudden social and narrative attention validating everything we've been rejected for over the years... it changes the online congress of ideas. in some ways it validates it, but in others, it consumes it and shuts it down.

       the nebulous chaos of financial gain and immunity that has driven all greed.  not any one web, but a network of spiders and snakes who like to prey on the information gathered and control it's flow much as building a damn on a river can be both destructive yet profitable. control the head of the river of information and the power one can wield is... worthy of serious reflection if you are reading this.

       I would have never imagined, that in our tiny little corner, where we were usually left alone to the mainstream, we would see such a daunting influx of people
       <em>
        paid
       </em>
       to disrupt and divert our conversations. I just didn't think these little conversations were that important. Looks like I was wrong.

       It was only a matter of time given the quality of the content that was put out here before the toxic shit storm that led up to the election. Its lingered because it realizes we're effective means of disseminating information, whether true or false. Now more than ever, we should refine our tastes to be a bit more discerning; and critically question that which we may have previously easily accepted.

       Yeah, this sub really started to be manipulated around that last election, and it has yet to let up. People are getting to close to the truth. I wouldnt be surprised at all if pizzagate or elsavideos was part of it.  Who knows really, were all just grasping straws in the dark. It seems more people are seeing how fucked up things are though, and some of them are starting to question why.

       I honestly think the Ron Paul movement in 2008 was an eye opener for TPTB, and they learned how to mitigate information on this site during Obama.  For instance, occupy wallstreet was heavily censored for about a month after it started by here and in MSM.  Eventually it broke through, but that first month it was by in large ignored.  Then we had Snowden, which was a censored topic as well and when it did get through it was primarily people trying to marginalize the topic by claiming 'everyone already knows this, you're just not paying attention' without discussing the new revelation.  Basically creating a controlled opposition to what ever topic pops up that TPTB don't want discussed.  Then came the bot and AI in my opinion.  I think reddit's business model at this point allowing various groups to run/test their AI chat bots, and aren't using actual humans as shills at this point.  Elin Musk did it a year and a half ago, and since then I have seen a couple more articles of people plugging in their AI to learn here.

       I hate to break it to you, OP - but you're a huge retard.  The world's largest magazine conglomerate bought reddit over ten years ago; their game has always been to create a magazine online where they don't have to pay content creators but still get to sell ads.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.

       There's no conspiracy here, spez just knew that he needed to market this site to the normies if he didn't want to be shut down. The way to do that is clear out the unsavory elements a bit. And the last couple years have seen way more normies on this site than there was when I joined 3 years ago. H

       I agree that from a marketing standpoint, clearing out unsavories would be desirable. ... I think when spez was caught directly altering the content of peoples posts (regardless of the content) without notifying the op, that was a breach of trust. Showing a bias towards finances over organic open discussions is disenheartening. As 'unsavory' elements are surpressed more and more, i think that our sub is being swept up in that effort to 'clean out' the cobwebs in the corner and vacume under the couch, so to speak.

       That was a breach of trust to us, the people that comment on reddit and give a shit about that. They don't want people like us, they want people to mindlessly browse propaganda and poorly disguised ads on

       We need to start making contingency plans in case they decide to ban our sub for any reason. But I think we should be safe as long as we don't have illegal activity and we don't get too much bad press.

       The new rule on 2 month club before posting on this sub is what those goats at voat have done... But idk if i'd consider it a great model. A contingency network of forum and exchange that can still maintain a traffic flow would be of interest. More of an expanded list of places to talk info and not a jumping ship migration.
