       Hello all. I decided to watch the 9/11 documentary “Loose Change” on YouTube tonight, as I have never seen it before. I noticed at about 1:02:34 after the narrator discusses how most, if not all, of the suspected terorrists are reported to still be alive, he talks about how Mueller went on CNN a bit after the incident and said that “there is no legal proof to prove the identities of the hijackers.”
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest, I didn’t even realize that Mueller was the FBI director at the time of 9/11, as I was very young. So, I did a little bit more research on him. He was nominated for the position by Bush on 7/5/2001, and was voted in on 8/2/2001, by a unanimous Senate vote 98-0. He was up against two other candidates but was apparently always considered the front-runner. On 9/4/2001, a week before 9/11, he officially assumed his role as FBI director.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find the timing of all this very interesting. I’m sure he obviously had something to do with the concealment of FBI info releasings after 9/11. Do you guys think he was just a prop? It is strange he’s still around and is now investigating BS propaganda for the Trump-Russia conspiracy. Any more info on his involvement in 9/11 would be appreciated.

       In terms of Mueller, a good entry point into his involvement in 9/11 is  the Anthrax case.  A series of letters was sent into the mail, from which 5 people died, was initially blamed on Al Qaeda and Saddam.  This was used as a connection between Iraq and Al Qaeda.   Start with this 'short' video that provides the overview of how it was handled...because the Antrax strain was traced to a US facility.  The FBI initially accused someone who ended up suing the FBI and WINNING!
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the documentary, just watch it for the background.

      <p>
       Well the head FBI investigator in this case, filed a lawsuit, which accuses Mueller, who was the FBI director at the time, of undermining and obstructing the investigations, and influencing in so that a wrong person gets accused.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the court document, where the accusations against Mueller were made.

      <p>
       Mueller was also intrumental into creating and maintaining the narrative that Saddam was in some way connected to 9/11.

       The guy is a deep state stooge, and political fixer, it is why it is so crazy to see all the people here holding up this guy as some kind of hero  here.

       If you consider shills and bots "people" giving honest opinions, then sure. For those who are real and who are defending Mueller, they are nothing but useful idiots who have drank the Deep State kool-aid.

       Could not agree more.  Mueller should be on the other side of the law for being accessory to war crimes, and pushing the BS 9/11 narrative that we are still fighting against.

       Because they are a counterweight to the GOP and Conservative ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's hilarious how you demonize the Democratic Party when the GOP has had a nearly unchallenged stranglehold on government for the better part of the last 18 years and have been FAR more consequential in shaping America's political landscape, having been the party that gave us 2 wars and the Patriot Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       What has the Democratic Party done that has been nearly as disastrous for the country?

       You could not be more wrong about this.   Let me offer you a historical argument of why this is the case.  The Democratic Leadership Council, has ties to the Koch brothers, and has been pushing the party to the right for decades, attempting to undue social programs enacted since FDR, here is a good overview.

       You need to learn to see passed political party and realize that both sides of the political spectrum are fucking us all in the ass. It’s not just one side. It’s the haves vs. the have nots. Always has been, always will be. Come on man, this is basic level shit.

      <p>
       This shows a misunderstanding of what the deep state means, because it actually consists of an inversion of the power relationship you state.  The deep state is a nexus of the intelligence agencies, the military, private contractors, and organized crime that wield power, and make policy that the other branches of government, cover for, and enact.

       Just because someone thinks isn't convinced about your theory doesn't mean there on a government payroll. It could, and is far more likely that they are simply a person that does not agree with the way you see things.

       As u/williamsates says, the "Amerithrax" case is particularly important when you know that Mueller was head of the FBI at the time. After failing to pin the anthrax attacks on Iraq, the scientist Stephen Hatfill was falsely accused of sending the letters; he won his case against the FBI after this false accusation. Mueller and the FBI went on to accuse another US-based scientist, Bruce Ivens; Ivens committed suicide before the case came to trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the best authorities on this whole debacle (and indeed, 9/11 in general) is Dr Graeme McQueen. He has written an excellent book based on his extensive research into the anthrax case; here he is talking about it:

       A little off topic but it was neat to me.  I went to a presentation by the case agent on the Amerithrax case who discussed it with us.  After his presentation the supervisor of the man the FBI ended up accusing is asked to speak.  They asked if he thought Bruce Ivans I think his name was did it. The supervisor said no.  He said despite Bruce working with Amerithrax he did not have the skills to make what ended up being sent out.  He also said Bruce killed himself because the FBI basically harassed him until he killed himself.

       Hatfill was also relentlessly harassed by the FBI. His apartment was searched by the FBI on live TV, and he was hounded out of jobs. He was publicly named by then Attorney General John Ashcroft as a "person of interest" with respect to the anthrax attacks.

       The people defending him cite Bush appointing him as a show of "bipartisanship" and claim it means Mueller is an impartial Republican who if nothing else would at least give Trump the benefit of the doubt...these same people also believe the official 9/11 Narrative.

       Most of the people on this site were barely aware when 9/11 happened.  Mueller had such a behind the scenes role that even the older ones don't remember him at all.

       So let me get this straight, these two brothers armed with weapons decided to evade police and get in shootouts with them...instead of turning themselves in and saying hey I wasn't there. You are beyond delirious dude. Like seriously, you need to get a grip on reality, I can't imagine how much of an embarrassment you must be to your family or anyone that associates with you

       Bottom pic: How did the suspect get inside the boat? The boat has a shrink wrap cover on it, with a square hatch in it. Theres a step ladder below the hatch. Upper pics: Infrared of heat from chimney, window, and boat. They heated the boat for him

       I am not saying it is not allowed. I am saying your comments are not relevant to the topic being discussed. So I ask why you insist on bringing it into this discussion.

       Why don't you make a separate submission trashing Trump and the GOP, and people can debate that with you there.
