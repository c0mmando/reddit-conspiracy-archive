        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In ancient Gnostic literature, it depicts of the true nature to this reality and essentially the terms &quot;God&quot; and &quot;Devil&quot; are speaking of the same entity known as the Demiurge. Responsible for ensnaring our souls in this illusory, material matrix realm of pain and suffering to begin with. An entity devoid of compassion and empathy, psychotic in nature. When you take a step back and analyze what you can easily conclude is that the realm that we reside in is fundamentally that of evil. </p>

<p>The beast system where animals mercifully attack and kill other beings as a means of survival. People dying in agonizing ways by diseases, natural disasters, famine and murder among many others. From my own experience all that I&#39;ve ever known was immense suffering dealing with several different diseases and watching innocent children die a brutal, agonizing and slow death to cancer. People find it exciting when pondering the notion of reincarnation into perhaps a fearless lion or bear. But what if you draw the short end of the stick and reincarnated as an innocent baby impala or gazelle over in the eastern parts of the world? What you find over in r/natureismetal and online videos is the beast system in its raw form where these souls are eaten alive In such immense agony by other beings in this realm. </p>

<p>An evil, wrathful, vengeful entity that constantly demands worship is what I interpret the Demiurge and the Buddhist teachings which closely ties with Gnosticism greatly resonates with me. To liberate our souls out of this archontic karma reincarnation system and break the cycle of suffering. Freedom from the Samsara Wheel. </p>

<p><a href="http://college.holycross.edu/projects/himalayan_cultures/2011_plans/dsexton/Wheel_of_Samsara.html">http://college.holycross.edu/projects/himalayan_cultures/2011_plans/dsexton/Wheel_of_Samsara.html</a> (an ancient Buddhist painting depicting the Demiurge grasping the wheel of the various different hellish/heavenly astral realms we find our souls in. The bottom pictures show beastly entities, demonic in nature who are tormenting many human souls in depths of fire (hell). The being to the right floating above the cloud is a Buddhist monk who was able to attain complete Liberation from this evil Samsara Wheel)</p>

<p>The inverted pentagram is the primary sigil associated with Satanism, the dark occult, dark arts, left-hand path. </p>

<p>The explanation for this is because it represents a perversion, or an inversion of the sacred seal of the upright pentagram. </p>

<p>The upright standing pentagram has five points. The bottom four points of the star symbolize the elements that comprise matter: Earth, Fire, Air, Water. The apex of the pentagram symbolizes Spirit, and it&#39;s governance over the forces and elements of Matter. </p>

<p>The Hermetic definition of Spirit is a higher or mystic force or power. Spirit is also the Numinous Presence or Power contained within the divinity of Man. This is the force that counters and repels the demonic forces of iniquity peddled by the Archons. Without cultivating the Heart and pursuing Spirit, we are but wounded prey no more intelligent than the animals here in Kenoma (realm of matter) to these Astral Predators. </p>

<p>When the Pentagram becomes inverted, it subjugates the Spirit and permits the forces of corruptible matter to reign over the Numinous. This is the ultimate maneuver of subjugating the souls incarcerated in this realm. It is a formidable force that dominates this world. Observe your world, and know that the majority of Souls are motivated by the pursuit of worldly things -- gratification, wealth, power, sensual pleasure, etc. There is a profound lack of True education on matters of the Soul and matters of Spirit.</p>

<p>If anyone has an interest in a variety of material considered &#39;gnostic&#39; by virtue of the systems utilized to unveil that which is hidden, I recommend The Secret Teachings of All Ages by Manly P. Hall as primer into the genre of classical esoterics. </p>

<p>For more literature based on classical authentic Gnosis I recommend delving into the texts contained in the Nag Hammadi series. It is in my opinion the premier library of texts that present the unadulterated Gnostic revelation -- an apocalyptic vision of the story of our genesis. It portrays a uniquely different interpretation of the contemporary Christian mythos, that is: the story of Creation and the Garden of Eden, was the Fall of Man as clear cut as we are taught?</p>

<p>Read the Apocraphyn of John, the Gospel of Thomas, Hypostasis of the Archons. These are but a few contained within the incredible library found in Nag Hammadi, but I recommend The Dead Sea Scrolls and research the Cathars, the Valentinians, Sethians, Manichaeism, etc. </p>

<p>The Cathars were a legitimate Gnostic sect of Christianity that shared many tenets of Buddhism and Dharma. They were an exceptionally peaceful group of ascetics that abstained from meat consumption and taught the revelation of the transmigration (reincarnation) of souls as orchestrated by the Archons/Lords of Karma. They were annihilated by the Archon/Demon infiltrated Catholic church in one of the most egregiously heinous murder campaigns ever waged, sanctioned by Pope Innocent III.</p>

<p>Gnosis is about redemption and liberation from the clutches of the Beast system. Truth is the conduit to this freedom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Earnest Gnosis compels the conscious agent to examine all religions, doctrines, creeds, spiritual and philosophical traditions. We evaluate what holds True against the unwavering compass that is the Numinous Heart. </p>

<p>Observe your world. Countless beings consume and tear each other because of the blueprint of their design. Matter is corruptible, and so too our bodies are subject to the forces that distort, corrupt, pervert, and ultimately wither these forms unto oblivion. Imperfect design by an imperfect creator deity. Could a truly perfect fashioner of this world permit such suffering? What if the &#39;devil&#39;, Satan, Yama, etc. all of these evil deities are actually many heads to the same hydra? Food for thought...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I say reality I dont mean any template. I mean unchanging unborn reality. Also called Buddha mind, Self or God.</p>

<p>If you have relealised that as your own self, you see only divinity everywhere and matter is seen as not solid, made of spirit and only appearing as solid matter external to yourself if you have not realised your true nature.</p>

<p>What you call the conscious agent is in the state of not knowing your true nature taken to be yourself when what we really are is unbound spirit which is reality.</p>

<p>So what if the forms in this existence are only temporary when the forms are not what we are but what we use to experience this realm?</p>

<p>27 Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with &quot;social&quot; religion. Discredit the Bible and emphasize the need for intellectual maturity, which does not need a &quot;religious crutch.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This entire doctrine is based on Luciferian worship.</p>

<p>&quot;Ye shall be as gods&quot;</p>

<p>It all sounds real nice, until you realize the people who are propagating these beliefs are the power holders in this world today. </p>

<p>This nonsense has been incepted into us using the movie and music industries for 100 years or so now. </p>

<p>Salvation by faith alone was the teaching of Jesus. The corrupted version Gnostics use not only came well after the apostles materials,  but negates the sacrifice Jesus made on the cross. </p>

<p>Before Jesus, a Jew was saved by sacrificing a Lamb, and the blood therein. Jesus, read Yahweh incarnate, sacrificed himself <em>as that lamb</em> for all mankind permanently. Whoever believes in Him is saved.</p>

<p>Man cannot become a god, though many try they all fail. </p>

<p>A few pieces of twisted teachings I know will be brought up out of context to attempt to support your claim:</p>

<p>&quot;Does it not say in your scriptures ye shall be as gods&quot;</p>

<p>Jesus is speaking of the Divine council, the many sons of God which are part of Yahweh&#39;s &quot;court.&quot; Lucifer was one of these.</p>

<p>&quot;Condemnation of the Pharisees&quot;</p>

<p>Jesus condemned the Pharisees for their racial supremacy doctrine, keeping the word of God out of the hands/heads of Gentiles. The parable of the prodigal son directly related to the Jews attitude towards the rest of humanity. Interesting that they themselves recently faced the other end of that doctrine by way of Nazis. It seems they learned all the wrong things from that experience.</p>

<p>There were no &quot;secret teachings&quot; Jesus taught on mountains, not in caves. Until the apostles it was given to know the true meaning of His teachings, <em>because they believed in Him</em>. Not because there was some secret teaching only given them.</p>

<p>Again, the Gnostic &quot;Jesus&quot; is a <a href="https://youtu.be/pDyl1qrpj_Q">forgery</a> and scholars of every religious background agree.</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>

<p>The beliefs propagated by TPTB are what you&#39;re expousing, mainstream Christianity.  The &quot;leaders&quot; of western countries have pushed it as an official and semi-official religion for centuries because it keeps the pleds passive.  It keeps them believing stuff like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Man cannot become a god, though many try they all fail. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t want you to try, because if your mind is truly free, you won&#39;t fail.  They want your mind shackled to a church pew, and only reading their officially sanctioned Bible.</p>

Why would he worry about them keeping others from the &quot;kingdom of heaven&quot; through Judaism if he condemns the hypocrisy of the religion and the preachers? I look again to Luke 17:21 to see that the kingdom of God is found nowhere near the churches, but within us.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes the Torah is the sacred book of the Jews, what of it? I imagine the printing press may have had a hand in spreading all religious texts, and the rise in literacy. People back in those days couldn&#39;t have read the Torah even if Jesus went to the temple and snatched it from a scribe&#39;s hand and gave to the crowd. I mean Matt 23 lays everything out so clearly I don&#39;t understand where you got racism or this just pertaining to Judaism. Considering alot of current Christian practices come from them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read &quot;The Gnostic Bible&quot; and &quot;Gnosis: The Nature and History of Gnosticism&quot; as academic primers. </p>

<p>Personally I think there&#39;s some validity to portions of the general outline of what gnostics believed. However not all gnostics or gnosticism is created equal. There&#39;s a LOT of reading out there, but a couple things:</p>

<p>-there was no unified &quot;gnostic&quot; religion. There was a general theme, principles and ideas, but LOTs of variety in details and practice. There were greek gnostics, zoroastarian, christian gnostics, pagan gnostics, etc. gnosticism was very much like today&#39;s New Age believes with no central authority--except that everyone&#39;s an expert with a secret unnamed &quot;inside source&quot; and lots of people claiming to experience things all while trying to sell you a book/program/product.</p>

<p>-LOTS of gnostic groups were straight up cults with leaders who would either advocate orgies or celibacy, partying or daily fasts, sex with family members, sex with kids or no sex at all. Like...ther was a LOT weird shit mixed together and called &quot;gnosticism&quot;</p>

<p>-OPs depiction sounds great until you look closer into the nitty gritty. If OP is correct, then all of us are fucked because none of us know the secret passwords we need to say, and none of us have the magical secret totems/amulets/scrolls we need attached to our wrists/arms/necks to remind us! </p>

<p>-Lots of misinformed people today will say that Gnosticism is correct and they&#39;ll say &quot;Read the gospel of thomas and gospel of judas to see what I mean!&quot; without realizing that the groups that read these texts may have read them separately and may have even been competing or rivaling sects at the time of their existence. This is the equivalent of a ignorant Jew trying to convert you to Judaism by telling you to read the Quran and the Book of Mormon. I mean, you&#39;ll definitely get the idea but they clearly don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>-Most Roman-ra gnostics believed that there are categories of people. Some people have the full &quot;spark&quot; of God (Pleroma/monad) that allows to return to be absorbed (yes, gnosticism preaches that heaven means to lose your identity and to join the amorphous blob of God.&quot;You&quot; cease to exist) upon death. But in order to be absorbed you have to get past the Archons who are gatekeepers for the layers of reality separating our realm from God.</p>

<p>took classes from professor who&#39;s done original scholarship on the issue actually. Personally, I think Jesus is the way back to the monad, and knowing&amp;being known by Him is the way past the archons.

    <div class="md"><p>You make valid points, yet you also return to some rather questionable emphasis on the importance of these relics. It is indeed accurate that there is no single, unified group of Gnostics that endured throughout the ages. This is tantamount to the varying denominations of Christianity, Buddhism, every other spiritual and philosophical traditions.</p>

<p>It is advisable that we should review the wisdom teachings of our predecessors; yet, the True Spirit of Gnosis is that which is revealed from within the conscious agent, the observer who resolves to seek Truth as per earnest inquiry coupled with inner discovery. Gnosis is indeed the &quot;inner knowing&quot;, not so much dogma or organized religion.</p>

<p>While the amulets and other devices may have been regarded as sacred talismans that assist their practice, it is far from these tools that offer the much sought after liberation from the suffering this realm allows. The vehicle for liberating was akin to something like the Noble Eightfold Path of Buddhism, advising practical directions to attainment of enlightenment and thereby &#39;Nibbana&#39;. For the earnest Gnostic, it was the path itself that permits salvation and it is earned through redemption from our previously unconscious, somnambulistic state.</p>

But the &quot;archons,&quot; they said, were very much our responsibility as humans too, since they&#39;ve gotten into our minds. Really, really good book that looks at the non-Christian Gnostics- comparable to shamans of today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you aware that Hinduism and Buddhism relative to Christianity are historically significantly older? </p>

<p>If the many millions (today billions) of people that walked this Earth prior to the historical Christ&#39;s birth did not have his religious teachings, were they all destined to never have salvation? Should they be morally exonerated for never possibly receiving Christian scriptures?</p>

<p>I think we need to expand our concept of Christ. People for millenia before the historical birth of Jesus Christ did not have the moral precepts that Christianity promotes. Does this mean they were all fraudent and incorrect in their observations of the world they inhabit? I would suggest that it is unfair to relegate our relatively earlier ancestors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were several groups of Gnostic Christians. What makes those who practiced this variant insincere? The Catholic Church also were not fond of Gnostic Christians. Pope Innocent III sanctioned the massacre of all men, women, and children who were Cathar Christians because of their...nuances. </p>

<p>The Cathars encouraged Gnosis. They relinquished the pursuit of worldly riches, sensual pleasures, gratification, etc. and abstained from the consumption of meat and most animal products to offer mercy to the suffering of these creature. They also sought to initiate women as equals, disciples of Cathar Christianity beside their male counterparts. They were perhaps the most morally exemplary Christians that have ever walked the Earth. The Catholic church whose clergymen, bishops, and pontiff enjoyed gold clad riches, political prowess, and meat eating, as well as misogyny, did not approve of this Christian variant. The Cathars and countless innocents were slaughtered as a result of their corruption and morally-tainted institution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Catholic Church is the center of the Sun worshiping Mystery Babylon religion.  The Pope is their high priest.  They hijacked the name of Christianity so that it could be used to straw man Jesus Christ and true biblical Christianity.</p>

<p>The core of Christianity actually isn&#39;t about being a good person.  That&#39;s part of the deception.  Christianity is all about realizing that no matter what we do our goodness/righteousness is filthy rags to God.  We like to compare ourselves to each other instead of a perfect holy God that cannot sin.  So a single sin is enough to condemn us to an eternal lake of fire.  The only way out of this is to  trade our righteousness of Jesus Christ&#39;s perfect record by believing his gospel which is:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>If one understands what they truly are and repents of their sinful and rebellious state and believes the above gospel and cries out to the Lord tell him so they will be saved:</p>

<p>Rom 10:13  For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. </p>

<p>Once a person is saved the Holy Spirit comes inside of them.  All good works come from the Holy Spirit convicting the individual.  None of it come from our flesh nature.</p>

<p>So basically anyone teaching that you need to do good things to be saved is deceiving.  Salvation comes to the guilty sinner just as they are.  After salvation the saved individual will bear good fruit because of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit working in their life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps such practices were encouraged. Many religions today use similar talismans and relics as symbols for their beliefs. Why would this be problematic?</p>

<p>While the &quot;amulets and artifacts&quot; as you say may have served to repel malevolence, the wisdom teachings were far more profound. The path to liberation was critical -- the tokens and amulets were tools complementary to their creed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Christ to which you are referring exists as a latent force indwelling your Spirit. Christ inspires redemption, while Buddha, a term for the being who becomes &#39;bodhi&#39; or develops an awakened mind, compels the individual towards liberation. There are pearls of Truth scattered across both the Western Abrahamic Dharmic as well as the Eastern Dharmic traditions.</p>

<p>I have been interfacing with entities for several years. These beings have brought me to humility, but not by their wisdom or benevolence. The beings to which I am referring are overwhelming hostile, predatory creatures that are consumed by madness. I have learned compassion by the suffering these beings have inflicted upon my kin and upon myself.</p>

<p>I will be blunt with you -- this world is a loosh farm. &#39;Loosh&#39; being the term coined by Robert Monroe I believe to describe the energy produced by the human being. Others have reported similar NDEs as you have described. After diligent researching, there are reports that entities appear projecting benevolence and wisdom to usher back to material incarnation. There are different labels for these entities--Lords of Karma, Archons, Jinn, etc.--but they maintain a deceptive quality while confronting the wayward soul.</p>

<p>The purpose for this enterprise is the harvest of Human vital energy. This is comprised of the spectrum of psychical-emotional and vital energy that we generate. This world is farmed for its &quot;bioelectric, thermal, and kinetic&quot; energies whose primary generators are the hominids as ourselves.</p>

<p>I encourage you to test every entity that you encounter. If develop astral prowess, you can learn to reveal the base form of entities that you encounter. It is most likely that your interface will be a demonic/jinn/archontic parasite...these are but a few of the epithets for the protean astral parasites. Nearly every culture has a name coined for a demon/evil spirit.</p>

<p>I appreciate your resolve. Still, I would encourage you to make it your earnest intention everyday to reveal Truth. It will astonish and hurt you to do this...painfully so. I was confronted with the revelation that this realm is primarily a system of coercive reincarnation. </p>

<p>I have more to say if you seek further counsel. Be well and be True.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The typical person exists in a somnambulistic state, that is to say we operate and function in what is for all intents and purposes a sleepwalking-like state. If we can recognize this then we have a hope for a spark of lucidity, albeit an ephemeral clarity as it may be. The powers and forces that oppress the Human-Anthropos, Numinous Spirit being here are treacherous, insidious beings. They are ceaseless in their endeavor to ensnare and reap the powerful generative energy of our Kundalini (e.g. sexual energy) and Emotions. The fault of humanity is purely ignorance. Society is crafted to create a false buffer of security and protection from the rest of the Beast System. It is easy to forget that our flesh bleeds and our bones break in the jaws of a fierce predator. The primary human predator however, is extra-dimensional/acorporeal and its invisible nature permits the absurdity of this predatory survivalist realm to persist. </p>

<p>I&#39;d advise you to study the 7 Hermetic principles, look into Gnosticism. Some schools have usurped Gnosticism as a label for their occult affairs. I recommend to focus on the Christian Gnosticism as well as texts/codices influenced by Buddhism. The Cathars were a Gnostic group that expertly synthesized the Truths contained in both the Western and Eastern traditions. They were slaughtered brutally, mercilessly, by the Demon/Archon infested Roman Church.</p>

<p>Earnestly investigate the 4 Noble Truths as well as the Noble Eightfold Path. Research the Kleshas and how these adverse qualities afflict us. Focus on learning and divest yourself of investing in any belief beyond the indwelling Truth accessible via your Heart conduit, Hridaya (True Heart in Sanskrit). It is by the Numinous Heart that you access the Spirit-Atman, or your Divine Spark/droplet that emanates from the luminous waters of the vast ocean that is the Monadic All, or the One.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be wary of the channeling, as many practitioners who work with astral entities interface with the parasites. The astral is teeming with these beings and they are subject to similar laws that govern our worldly experience. Principally, they are subject to hunger and the need or compulsion to feed. When a person is channeling, it is likely that an astral parasitic entity is tuning in and siphoning the hosts energy. This is a tremendous problem for unsuspecting individuals searching for answers. </p>

<p>Learn as much as you can and hone your ability to Observe, as well your capacity for Inquiry. These two skills will serve you tremendously.</p>

<p>The beliefs propagated by TPTB are what you&#39;re expousing, mainstream Christianity.  The &quot;leaders&quot; of western countries have pushed it as an official and semi-official religion for centuries because it keeps the pleds passive.  It keeps them believing stuff like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Man cannot become a god, though many try they all fail. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t want you to try, because if your mind is truly free, you won&#39;t fail.  They want your mind shackled to a church pew, and only reading their officially sanctioned Bible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read &quot;The Gnostic Bible&quot; and &quot;Gnosis: The Nature and History of Gnosticism&quot; as academic primers. </p>

<p>Personally I think there&#39;s some validity to portions of the general outline of what gnostics believed. However not all gnostics or gnosticism is created equal. There&#39;s a LOT of reading out there, but a couple things:</p>

<p>-there was no unified &quot;gnostic&quot; religion. There was a general theme, principles and ideas, but LOTs of variety in details and practice. There were greek gnostics, zoroastarian, christian gnostics, pagan gnostics, etc. gnosticism was very much like today&#39;s New Age believes with no central authority--except that everyone&#39;s an expert with a secret unnamed &quot;inside source&quot; and lots of people claiming to experience things all while trying to sell you a book/program/product.</p>

<p>-LOTS of gnostic groups were straight up cults with leaders who would either advocate orgies or celibacy, partying or daily fasts, sex with family members, sex with kids or no sex at all. Like...ther was a LOT weird shit mixed together and called &quot;gnosticism&quot;</p>

<p>-OPs depiction sounds great until you look closer into the nitty gritty. If OP is correct, then all of us are fucked because none of us know the secret passwords we need to say, and none of us have the magical secret totems/amulets/scrolls we need attached to our wrists/arms/necks to remind us! </p>

<p>-Lots of misinformed people today will say that Gnosticism is correct and they&#39;ll say &quot;Read the gospel of thomas and gospel of judas to see what I mean!&quot; without realizing that the groups that read these texts may have read them separately and may have even been competing or rivaling sects at the time of their existence. This is the equivalent of a ignorant Jew trying to convert you to Judaism by telling you to read the Quran and the Book of Mormon. I mean, you&#39;ll definitely get the idea but they clearly don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>-Most Roman-ra gnostics believed that there are categories of people. Some people have the full &quot;spark&quot; of God (Pleroma/monad) that allows to return to be absorbed (yes, gnosticism preaches that heaven means to lose your identity and to join the amorphous blob of God.&quot;You&quot; cease to exist) upon death. But in order to be absorbed you have to get past the Archons who are gatekeepers for the layers of reality separating our realm from God.</p>

But the &quot;archons,&quot; they said, were very much our responsibility as humans too, since they&#39;ve gotten into our minds.
