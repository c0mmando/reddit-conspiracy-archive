        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The FBI&#39;s field agents are &quot;the good guys&quot;. It&#39;s the ass kissing, spineless
careerists at the top who have corrupted the agency. In the critical weeks
and months leading up to that fateful day, numerous clues were picked up by
loyal FBI field agents. Some of these agents were so alarmed at what they
thought was an unfolding terror plot, that they tried to convince their
superiors to investigate deeper. These agents were either ignored,
threatened, or fired.</p>

<p>Each of these FBI agents thought that they were on the trail of an Arab
terror plot and unless they&#39;ve read this paper, they probably still believe
so. We can forgive them their ignorance if they haven&#39;t realized yet that
the trail they were on was not that of Arab terrorists, but rather Mossad
agents impersonating Arab terrorists. (much more on that later!) The
essential point is that these agents were on to something big that someone
didn&#39;t want them to digging into.</p>

<p>There is FBI Special Agent Robert Wright. The public interest law firm
Judicial Watch is representing agent Wright. Wright claims that he was met
with retaliation and threats from his bosses and from the Justice Department
who told him they wanted his probes to go no further. 124 Wright maintains
that if his investigation had been allowed to continue, the attacks could
have been prevented.</p>

<p>There is FBI agent Coleen Rowley. The gutsy Rowley wrote a 13 page letter to
FBI Director Robert Mueller (Currently Special Prosecutor for Trump-Russia case) in which she actually accuses the director of
her own agency of &quot;a subtle skewing of the facts&quot;. 125 Rowley&#39;s letter also
charged that the agency refused to react to evidence of a pending terror
plot. According to Rowley the FBI&#39;s obstruction was so blatant that her and
some of her fellow agents jokingly speculated that key FBI personnel must
have been moles working for Osama Bin laden! 126 Rowley&#39;s main point of
contention was the agency&#39;s failure to go after Zacharias Moussoui, the
&quot;20th hijacker&quot;, even after his flight school instructor reported his
suspicious behavior to the FBI. Moussoui you will recall was the French
Algerian who couldn&#39;t speak French to his flight school instructor.</p>

<p>There is FBI agent Sibel Edmonds. Edmunds was an FBI wiretap translator. She
claims that another FBI translator was working for the Mossad and that the
Mossad also tried to recruit Edmonds to make phony translations for the
purpose of misdirecting investigations. When agent Edmonds refused, the
Mossad threatened her safety! 127 When she brought these allegations to the
attention of her superiors, she was fired for being &quot;disruptive&quot;. The
Washington Post briefly reported this story without mentioning the name of
nation that tried to recruit Edmonds. But The Post did reveal that Edmonds
and the other translator &quot;trace their ethnicity&quot; to this certain &quot;Middle
Eastern&quot; country. 128 Agent Sibel Edmunds is not an Arab. Edmonds is jewish.
Therefore we know that the &quot;Middle Eastern&quot; nation which the Post chose not
to name is Israel. (No big surprise there!) Sibel Edmonds deserves a lot of
credit for defying the Mossad and blowing the whistle to her superiors.
Instead, she was fired for her patriotic efforts, proving once again that
Zionists are willing to hurt innocent jews.</p>

<p>There is FBI agent John M. Cole, program manager for FBI intelligence
investigations covering India, Pakistan, and Afgahinstan. In the same
Washington Post story about Edmunds, it was reported that Cole also wrote a
letter to FBI chief Mueller warning him about lax security procedures in the
hiring of translators. 129</p>

<p>Dedicated agents such as Wright, Rowley, Cole, Edmonds and others who have
spoken anonymously, had to be stopped from going after &quot;Muslim terrorists&quot;.
If not so obstructed, they would in time come to discover that they weren&#39;t
really Al Qaeda terrorists!! Not only were investigations blocked before
9-11, but they continue to be blocked after 9-11. The cover up is so blatant
that members of both the House and Senate Intelligence committees complains
directly to CIA Director George Tenet and Attorney General John Ashcroft.
The Los Angeles Times reported:</p>

<p>&quot;Lawmakers leading the investigation of intelligence failures surrounding
the 9-11 attacks are increasingly concerned that the CIA and Justice
department are actively impeding their efforts....The flare up centers on
obstacles congressional investigators say the agencies have strewn in their
path.&quot; 130</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what FBI agents Wright, Rowley, Edmunds, and Cole said
happened to them when they tried to investigate before the attacks! By the
way, did I mention that the FBI is under the jurisdiction of yet another
Zionist named Michael Chertoff? Chertoff is the Director of the Criminal
Division of the US Justice Department. FBI chief Robert Mueller has to
answer to Chertoff. Perhaps that explains Mueller&#39;s highly pathetic, and
highly revealing, speech before the Anti Defamation League&#39;s 24th Annual
National Leadership Conference held in May of 2002:</p>

<p>&quot;I have long admired and respected the work of ADL, and I appreciate your
longstanding support of the FBI. I know that under my predecessor, Louis
Freeh, this partnership reached new heights. . . . I am absolutely committed
to building on that relationship. We in the FBI tremendously value your
perspectives and your partnership. Your insights and research into extremism
are particularly helpful to us, shedding light on the changing nature of the
terrorist threats facing America. Your support of hate crime and terrorist
investigations, which are now front and center in the work of the FBI, is
essential to us. And the training and education you provide for the FBI and
for law enforcement have never been more relevant. That includes the
conference on extremist and terrorist threats you are sponsoring later this
month at the FBI Academy.&quot; 131</p>

<p>Just shoot me now! The FBI is in &quot;partnership&quot; with the Zionist ADL and
relies upon this criminal smear group for &quot;insights and research&quot;, and
&quot;education and training!&quot; Didn&#39;t anyone ever tell FBI chief Mueller that
when the FBI raided the California offices of the ADL in 1993, they found
that the ADL had computerized files on nearly 10,000 people across the
country, and that more than 75 percent of the information had been illegally
obtained from police, FBI files and state drivers license data banks? 132
Isn&#39;t Mueller aware that the San Francisco Superior Court awarded $150,000
in court judgments against the Anti-Defamation League in connection with
this FBI bust? 133</p>

<p>What other group in America could get away with not only stealing FBI files
(a Federal offense!!!), but then becoming &quot;partners&quot; with the FBI? So why
would FBI Director Mueller disregard the fact that the ADL is a criminal
group that was caught spying on US citizens by his own FBI? Why does Mueller
ignore the &quot;insights&quot; of his own agents while thanking the criminal ADL for
it&#39;s &quot;advice&quot;? It&#39;s because Mueller and his kind are empty, career minded
&quot;yes men&quot; who understand that it doesn&#39;t pay to defy the Zionist Mafia.
Ass-kissers like Mueller get promoted. Honest agents like Wright, Rowley,
Edmonds and Cole go nowhere fast!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fun fact:  I was working in Daimaru Tower in Melbourne (one of the larger skyscrapers on the periphery of the Melbourne CBD)  during the &quot;summer&quot; of 2001.  The ADF had a facility on one of the upper floors embedded with the company I was working at.  We had an unannounced, full building evacuation where the elevators were shut down and everyone was forced to used the stairwells about a month or two before 9/11 happened (it was an enormous cluster and I can only imagine what the WTC would have been like if such a thing were attempted).  The word on the street was a terror plot was brewing that involved running airliners into buildings, but nobody was sure which building or even which countries or how many airplanes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sometimes wonder if there was a survey sent around the state department, the FBI, intelligence etc asking whether or not people would turn in their fellow countrymen on treason, whether they would whistle blower, etc regarding 9/11.  Then anyone who didn&#39;t answer in the liking to the traitors in charge were either executed or sent on training on one of the fateful planes.  9/11 was more than just a pretext for what is now WW3, it was a huge hit on very important people, as well as a massive gold/money heist, the insurance fraud is just a drop in the bucket.  Dual Israeli citizens at every key position of power.  Treason in the highest form.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having trouble figuring if you&#39;re being sarcastic, but I assume you are. This is a conspiracy, for sure. Russia pulled a USA and influenced our election in an admittedly beneficial way. North Korea is a fucking joke dude. I don&#39;t mean to fight, but that&#39;s genuinely funny. America is waiting for a reason to fund the war machine, aka a false flag. They&#39;d retaliate in seconds. It&#39;d be the worst joke of all time, and i pray it never happens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is this a pro. FBI post in conspiracy? Lol. I mean, what do you think President Kennedy thinks of the FBI? Did Ruby Ridge, Waco and LV Massacre reenforce your trust in the agency? Virtue and Morality are not usually qualities that come to my mind when I think of the FBI, but invasion of privacy and political manipulation are. I have Libertarian leanings. I would like to believe the law and order guys are good guy Patriots serving their county, but corruption of government agencies seem prevalent thruout, and I pray for my country because I love America.</p>
