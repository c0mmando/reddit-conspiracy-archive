       If you smoke cigarettes, you should stop. What are ya, a dummy? I have been for a long time, but I'm trying to stop now, and when you make the decision it becomes clear that there is an INDUSTRY built on taking your money for killing yourself. It sucks but if your going to make an impact at all or vote with your dollars, start here God dammit.

       That's what I'm on the end of my 1st day on, and I see your point because of how well it's working for me so far. I've tried one of those huge robodick looking vapes before and gave up. I bought a smaller lighter-sized one yesterday and been pretty well content all day with it. Honestly, I'd rather be addicted to this than sticking something in my mouth and setting it on fire 20 times a day though.

       Yes, keep it up. I vape like it's going out of style but at least it's not carcinogenic. The robodicks take some getting used to, but someday you will want the huge clouds that they put out. They seem wet/heavy for a while but you get used to it.

       Yeh I agree it’s much better for you, but I feel that nicotine itself is a very harmful compound to the himan body. Stick with the vape for now though, I’m actually at the point where I tried a cogarette about three months ago, and felt sick! You can really taste the chemicals that they stick in cigarettes after not having one for a long time. I could never go back, which is good.

       Vapes can bean excellent tool to quit smoking but also keep in mind that even vaping can potentially cause popcorn lungs and honestly beyond that it hasn't really been super popular long enough for us to know what the long terms effects of it are either. Just putting that out there for the sake of harm reduction

       To be fair nobody has ever gotten popcorn lung from vaping. They used extremely small amounts of the same chemicals that flooded the air of factories in certain juice lines but after the media hysteria I don't believe any company uses it. I forget the name, diactyl maybe

       Major producers say they have quit using it but some still use flavors with a very similar compound. One of those "msg free (but contains an ingredient with naturally occurring msg so we don't have to list it.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm weary of most flavors and even pg and vg for that matter. I've attempted to mitigate this by mixing my own juice and using a fraction of a percentage healthy normal flavor addition. It doesn't taste as good but I feel a little bit less worried about vaping it.

       It's hard to do, but it's possible. I use to smoke 2 packs a day, and switch to vaping and quit smoking cigs instantly. After a couple years vaping, I finally tried to quit so I just keep lowering my nicotine until I was smoking 0mg. I smoked that for about a month, needing it less and less daily to break the habit. And then one day I just decided I didn't need it with me anymore and hasn't picked it up since.

       Yeh that’s the plan. Started on 18mg, used 12mg, now on 6mg with a view to 3mg then 0 for a bit. Even with the 6 though I find I need it a lot more than the higher strengths

       I think it's reasonable to call it nearly harmless. All drugs have side effects, but the majority of problems associated with smoking are due to the smoking, not the nicotine.

       Why not just taper yourself off and slowly start using less and less nicotine percentage in your vape juice? Eventually work your way down to 0%

       I quit smoking and started vaping 4-5 years ago (it's been so long I can't recall exactly how long ago). The first year or two I vaped quite often, all the time if i was at home. After a while, I just started to vape less and less. About 4 weeks ago I came down  with pneumonia, and couldn't vape because it made me cough.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found I didn't really miss it a great deal. Some people said i vaped less because vaping delivers an inconsistent amount of nicotine and over time my addiction lessened. I can't explain it.

       You're 100% Right, but I feel like realizing the dummy I've been had been the key to my motivation all along, and I've found a suitable crutch for now. I'm not trying to preach from the finish line, I'm just hoping I can share with others what has clicked with me and how it could possibly reach those in this community. Conspiracy on the tip of your nose and such.

       Try replacing it with a less bad oral fixation meanwhile if it's hard for you to quit. Until you really do quit. Lollipops, light chips, etc. I used to bite the skin of my knuckles when I quit biting my nails, it helped

       The scary thing is how many movies from hollywood and US in general are now coming out with actors smoking! Pretty much the majority of modern 1st world nations are taking stance against cigarettes, and here is USA/Hollywood film and TV where cigarettes are a popular thing!
      </p>
      <p>
       IS that the solution for the overpopulation Capitalist swine (the evil capitalists) have, give everyone cancer so they die sooner? And its clearly most potent form of propaganda/advertising in developing nations, those that dotn have modern social structures and services. I saw a documentary that in asian nations, poorest asian nations children's, very young children smoke cigarettes, they are being sold right outside schools. Its disgusting, how for profits we allow such practices. Its not just one thing thouhg is it, war on fat, to suppress the ruth that it is sugar that is doing it all. Its carsonagens, its polluted water, its corporations telling us WATER is not a human right....like who the fuck they think they are to take away human rights because they found a way to make a profit. We need the socialist movement, otherwise the greed will kill us all.

       Do you have access to a sauna? A week in a sauna will cleanse your body pretty well, and rid you of all the chemicals in your body, again making you crave it much much less. Worked wonders for me when I quit... eeh... I don’t know if you have a English word for it, I think it’s gotten popular elsewhere than Scandinavia now as well, but have no idea what it’s called.. tobacco you put under your lip, or as we say in Norway.. snus

       i hear this repeated an awful lot: "once the chemicals are out of your body, all is well!" but is incorrect. if you are going to have withdrawal symptoms, they will occur as the substance depletes in your body; they will be at their worst when there is no more left in the body. this is because the body has gotten so used to functioning with said substance for so long that without it it is off-kilter and must find balance.

       Sure in an understand that, but I’ve been present when people have receive bad news, and in that moment saw all this bravado change and turn to something like this. “Oh god please let me get through this and I’ll change my ways”. It’s easy having this attitude now, but when you’re dealing with the reality of what cancer or other terrible diseases that come with smoking, the tune ALWAYS changes.

       Strongly disagree. Living in the present can lead to hedonism, but I think the biggest problem humanity faces today is greed. The only downside of hedonism is a potentially early grave.

       It's not just about you. if you have kids do you want them to be healthy? They wont if they see you smoking, because they will likely start. You also perpetuate the mere existence of smoking. Also, everyone hates being near smokers. They can't help it, it stinks. i smoked for 12 years and I get sick from the smell. I understand why you smoke. But there's more to this universe than your lack of a desire to life a long life. I certainly don't want to live a long life either. i suffer from chronic pain, scoliosis, fibromyalgia, minor brain damage, multiple mental health issues. I'm really fucked up...But i realized how big the picture is. I am a small but significant part. I influence people every day. THose people go on to influence others. And so on. Every thing you do has quantum waves in reality. A "wake" like a boat. The smallest thing can have an enormous effect on the universe.
And the smallest thing, ignorance, is ALLOWING the universe (our earth humanity)to rot and die.

       You should quit smoking.  No doubt about it.  But you should also realize that no one has the right to demand that you quit smoking.   I really get worried when the government tries to force you to make personal decisions.  That sugary drinks tax in Seattle really bothers me.  We are living in a hodgepodge combination of Huxleyan and Orwellian society and and we don't even realize it.

       The whole hysteria concerning lung cancer and second hand smoke is mostly propaganda to draw you away from the real culprits of cancer in the US; a whole slew of chemicals, packaging, preservatives, pesticides, and 100s of other factors.  If you don't believe me, just consider that the US has a much much lower percent of population of smokers than the Far East.  Yet the US's lung cancer (and other cancers in general) dwarf the rates in the Far East.  If you've ever been to Korea, China, or Japan, you know what I'm talking about.  Everyone is puffing away over there.  Yet they boast one of the lowest lung cancer rates in the world.

       1 can coke has about 40gram of sugar. Go to a fast food restaurant or a Costco/Walmart and you'll see what the unhealthy looking people are drinking. We have some of the highest obesity rates in the world. It's not just a problem anymore its an epidemic that has triggered movements such as the fat acceptance movement. I don't mean to imply that it is just soda that is the problem but curbing access to unhealthy foods may be advantageous to the overall average population. After the implementation of the tax, consumption of sugary drinks declined and that may not be a bad thing. 
Here is an article i googled for some added reading.

       And where does it end?  Deep fried foods also contribute to obesity.  Should we tax fried chicken next?  Then what?   Should we start taxing people who go outdoors without sunscreen on their skin since we know it causes cancer?  After that, perhaps we can start taxing people who drive to work instead of riding a bicycle if they live within one mile of their work place.  Because burning fossile fuel is bad for the environment.

       The whole point is this.  When the government starts penalizing the whole populace because
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       of the populace has a problem with it, the govt is stomping out liberty.  This is exactly the case for drugs.  Do a whole lot of people try drugs?  Yes.  Do all of them become addicted to it?  No.  Do some?  Yes.  So we place a penalty on the entire population by making it illegal.

       It's my crutch for now, and 2 days in it's working so far. I got the smallest one I could find and have zero interest in all that cloud-blowing bullshit or tricks or stupid ass flavors. I got menthol juice and plan on tapering the nicotine level off weekly until I don't need to vape at all. The "culture" around vaping is a bit cringey for me, and I want no part of it lol.

       You're right, just figuring out compromises that work toward my end goal for now. I've tried to quit maybe 10 times now (started at 16, I'm now almost 34), and while it's definitely not necessarily healthy, it's effective enough for me to not smoke under circumstances where I normally would have. My 4 month old daughter had surgery to correct a problem causing her to have sleep apnea and constricted airways yesterday morning, and 2 days ago I worked my final 14 hour shift at a job I fucking hated, and through all that, I haven't smoked at all, only hit my vape when the urge hit me.

       I quit a few years ago and it was the best decision I've ever made. Even after a few months I started feeling better, more alive and less depressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used the patch, which if you use the cheap ones cost less than smoking. A lot of smokers I know try to go cold turkey, but end up failing. I think they want to prove they have the will power. Don't be afraid to hack you body. If 
I smoked with a patch on Id feel sick so it really builds that negative reinforcement. I had to sleep with it on or I would want one in the morning. The crazy dreams were kinda fun tho.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best of luck

       The animal-agriculture industry puts the cigarette industry to shame in this regard, once you realize that there is absolutely no nutritional requirement to eat any animal products. And indeed, pretty much all the medical science seems to indicate that the less animal products you eat, the healthier you will be. Vegans know this, and it's one of the many reasons we choose to live as vegans. It is an industry of death- it kills you, it kills the animals, and it kills the environment.

       For the first time ever, I have some interest in cutting back. Like, way back. I am allowing myself 5 per day right now (I've had one day with 2 and I also went over one or 2 days).
      </p>
      <p>
       If I start to think about that "last cigarette ever" I get anxious and it makes me want to smoke, so I'm attacking it with the best defense I got. Procrastination. If I just keep distracting myself, I can go many hours without smoking. For now, I'm using the patch, so I am still getting nicotine, I know that isn't ideal, but it is at least an improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck quitting! Just figure out what motivates you. It took me a long time to do that part.

       That’s basically how I quit. There was about 9 months-a year where I would smoke between 1-5 a day but I wouldn’t worry too much that it was talking so long to get down to 0 for the rest of my life because those 1-5/day prevented me from jumping right back into 20/day which I probably would have if I had allowed the anxiety to compound by completely avoiding cigarettes before I was truly ready to do so

       Good luck, it look me something like 15 attempts over 5 years to finally quit. It can be hard, some times it will feel impossible, but if you can quit then I guarantee you will feel the relief on your lungs in just a few weeks. Don’t underestimate the task at hand, it will require consistent mental effort to rewrite your brain’s prototypical response of “Damn id love a cigarette right now” but a day will come when your brain says something more like “A cigarette? Fuck no I don’t wanna wheeze and cough my way to an early grave.”

       Prayers to OP. I smoked for 15 years, quit 2.5 years ago.  This is a very tough habit to break, I tried for years to quit and was finally able to with help from a Dr who prescribed Chantix and Welbutrin and also needed personal resolve and prayers.  I was off both these meds after only a few months. Praise God

       You're not wrong. I've also been drinking iced water from the same Old Fashioned glass that I'd typically been drinking vodka/soda from to help curb my cravings. Being less drunk has made the cravings easier to resist.Not trying to quit drinking altogether though. One vice at a time for me, and I consider drinking in moderation vastly less harmful than smoking cigs for me.
