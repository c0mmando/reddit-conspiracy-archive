        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The main two reasons we are told the earth is round are:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Horizon, you can&#39;t see forever.</li>
<li>If the earth was flat, you would fall off.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, the first can be debunked by simply using a zoom on a camera or a telescope to extend perspective, and the second one can be answered by the Antarctic ice wall.</p>

<p>If I wanted to sell you coconut oil, and I told you it was good because it cured baldness, I would be lying. It might be good for you, but curing baldness is not the reason.</p>

<p>Similarly, the earth may be round, but the reasons listed above are not the reason, so why are we taught them?</p>

<p>Remember, this is not about debating the Earth&#39;s shape, it is simply about why do they give children false reasons for the earth being round instead of just giving them real reasons?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably for the same reason kids are told lots of incorrect or misleading things all the tune: the people teaching them don&#39;t know the actual science well enough to explain it to a child, so they go with something intuitive and easy to explain. It takes a <em>very</em> deep understanding of a topic to accurately satisfy the curiosity of an inquisitive child once you introduce the actual science.</p>

<p>For example, as a kid, I was told by lots of adults that the ocean is blue because it reflects the sky (and, on other occasions, that the sky is blue because it reflects the ocean). I could tell this was BS because the ocean was still bluish on overcast days. Turns out that like the gases that make up the sky, large amounts of water are blue when clear because light waves on the red side of the visible spectrum are absorbed, as well the violet and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum, leaving mostly blue to be reflected to the observer. But despite the fact that I have two degrees in earth science, at a molecular level, the details of <em>why</em> different wavelengths of visible light are differentially absorbed by water (and air) take an understanding of optical physics I <em>still</em> don&#39;t really grasp, even though I know the work has been done to explain it. I wouldn&#39;t be able to answer a child&#39;s follow-up answer of &quot;why?&quot;</p>

<p>Basically, I think the answer to your question is &quot;because grown-ups are stupid and ignorant but don&#39;t like kids to know it&quot;. </p>

<p>The horizon part you mention is sort of true though, it just tends to be hard to find good examples. Boats will disappear from the bottom up as they sail away, if you have a clear enough view though a telescope over calm waters, but that&#39;s a lot to ask. The Earth is so big that the unobstructed distance this actually takes is farther than most people realize, and any elevation above sea level for the observer will greatly increase the distance necessary to see this effect first-hand.</p>

<p>If you want proof that the Earth is round, though, I&#39;d go with something like a <a href="http://www.n2yo.com/space-station/">livestream camera feed from the ISS</a>, or data streams from any number of satellites orbiting the Earth based on detailed calculations that assume a roughly spherical Earth, or maps of <a href="http://www.divergingmarkets.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013.04.16.Global-Shipping-Routes.png">shipping</a>/<a href="https://i1.wp.com/spatialanalysis.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/flights_sml.jpg">travel</a> routes designed to maximize efficiency. Profit-driven companies would not arbitrarily, unnecessarily add time and expense to follow arcs that reflect the curvature of the Earth just to keep up a ruse that the Earth is round. </p>

<p>I&#39;d look into ISS live streams more, you mind find some peculiar things on them, like some of them are on loop, some don&#39;t match weather, etc. </p>

<p>Here is a visualization with the Pontchartrain power lines</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/epi4GCG">https://imgur.com/epi4GCG</a></p>

<p>You can see what you are talking about with the image in the top left. This is exactly what you describe. </p>

<p>Because of the vanishing point the object gets smaller as it goes away. </p>

<p>In reality however we see the towers curve as it gets further away from us, you can actually see the concrete foundations disappear as the waters curvature obscures them. </p>

<p>This is completely false. </p>

<p>Why do those videos never follow an object for any amount of time? What effect does compression have on these youtube videos? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1,) No. Even if you had possibly infinite zoom, at some point you wouldn&#39;t see a ship sailing away anymore because it&#39;s beyond the curve. Also, every picture shown by glat earthers to prove that the earth is flat, has one flaw. Lower parts of the buildings, mountains etc aren&#39;t visible, almost as if there was a curve. And no, waves can&#39;t explain that away because you see this effect with calm seas and on land as well.</p>

<p>The earth is round-ish because objects with mass attract each other, objects with hire mass attract objects with smaller mass. With the center of gravity being in the middle of the earth, at its core it will naturally take a round-ish form over millions of years.</p>

<p>Further, on a disk earth the center of gravity would be in the center of the disk. The further away you get the more you have to lean sideways to remain level with the pull of gravity. Yet there are no reports of buildings being built almost lying on the ground or people having to crawl because the gravity pulled them towards the center of the disk earth. Everything is always pulled &quot;down&quot; towards the center of the earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can you make a statement which assumes the earth is flat and then ask people to discuss without discussing the shape of the earth which most people would argue is the opposite of your assumptions. So this conversation can only be had by those who believe the earth is flat?</p>

<p>Quick question.. if the earth is flat. Would the sun also be flat? If that is the case then how does the sun rise and set if not for the rotation of the earth?</p>

<p>For the amount of people who believe in this theory its bizzare how few convincing arguments are presented. Im skeptic, convince me. Not to be lazy but all my research points to a round earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the Earth is rotating at 1000 MPH in one direction, why are the airplane travel times to and from different places the same? Shouldn&#39;t the trip be faster if we are traveling in the opposite direction of the rotation? Moreover, how can planes land north-to-south with all their east-to-west momentum due to the earth&#39;s rotation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To answer your question about the sun, it&#39;s a sphere and it travels in a straight plane across the sky, but since we are below it in elevation, when it approaches you, it appears to rise. When I moved away from you, it appears to set. Just like when a helicopter flies overhead and heads off in the distance. It will appear to set as it moves further because it is merging with the horizon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You must not be serious. Lol once the magic sphere gets to the other end of the flat earth how does it get back to its point of origin? What force is acting upon the sun to allow it to move across the sky? Lol how can half the earth experience night and the other half day if the sun is travelling across a flat plane? It would be day for 100% earth then night for 100% of the earth. Which is not the case.</p>
