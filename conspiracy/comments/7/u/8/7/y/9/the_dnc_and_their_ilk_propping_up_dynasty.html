       Yes, the Kennedy family has a tragic history. So sad. I did not listen to Joseph Kennedy last night, so I can't say anything bad or good about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do know that another Kennedy relative (who is a Democrat) made a film with Robert De Niro about unsafe vaccines. I want safe vaccines too, so I'm a fan of this guy.

       The conspiracy is that anytime a new possible 2020 contender appears, there's a concerted effort to get the propaganda out about them early and often.

       A couple people?  The entire left went gaga for Oprah.  And it wasn't this sub that fixed that.  Your media had to come out and tell you what an awful choice for president that was.  Washpo and NYT ran articles the next day to correct your thinking, and you immediately switched to what they told you to think.

       Some people were riled up for an oprah run, but plenty immediately kicked back against wanting to elect another businessperson/tv star to office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Organic people on this sub will notice that there is a concerted effort on both sides to do anything they can to discredit the other side. In this case, because Kennedy made a speech, there were immediately posts about drool/chapstick on a conspiracy sub. Makes perfect sense. Oh wait

       They are both similar in what they are trying to achieve but the RNC did NOT want Trump as the nominee. They preferred, of course, a bush. They’d have been happy with anyone else. They fell into like, of course but the RNC did not annoying Trump. If democrats fall for a Lennedy, I’ll be convinced it’s because of the echo chamber bullshit environments like r/politics.
