<p>A solid two weeks of Oprah bashing in multiple posts every day on this sub.</p>

<p>This Kennedy kid gives the Dem response to the SOTU?</p>

<p>Some people were riled up for an oprah run, but plenty immediately kicked back against wanting to elect another businessperson/tv star to office. </p>

<p>Organic people on this sub will notice that there is a concerted effort on both sides to do anything they can to discredit the other side. In this case, because Kennedy made a speech, there were immediately posts about drool/chapstick on a conspiracy sub. Makes perfect sense. Oh wait </p>

<p>It would be a better world if Joe Kennedy were to enunciate truth re the murder of his kinsman President <a href="http://dockersunion.net/vb/forum/the-kennedy-assassinations/67-the-assassination-of-john-f-kennedy">John Kennedy</a>, blasted to death in broad daylight in Dallas Tx, Nov. 22, 1963. </p>

<p><strong>Sure he would need to bring the <a href="http://i.imgs.fyi/img/6jl.jpg">Martin Luther Kings</a> man &amp; wife, black Secret Serviceman Abraham Bolden and Andy Warhol into it, since all three were in the firing party on the Grassy Knoll.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>He could insist on the innocence of alleged killer <a href="http://i.imgs.fyi/img/6ji.jpg">Lee Harvey Oswald</a> who was standing in the doorway of the TSBD when the shots were fired, who was still there when the three tramps were marched by hours later similarly exculpating him for the murder of Dallas Cop JD Tippit. <a href="http://interested-party.blogspot.com.au/2015/10/cops-lives-suck-jd-tippit-murdered-by.html">G Gordon Liddy Murdered JD Tippit</a>.</p>

<p>Then he could talk of the killing of another of his kinsmen US Senator Robert Kennedy shot dead June 6, 1968 in Los Angeles, insofar as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Evidence+of+Revision%2C+Part+4">video evidence</a> proves alleged assassin Sirhan Sirhan innocent and implicates Security Guard <a href="http://i.imgs.fyi/img/2ild.jpg">Thane Eugene Cesar</a> as the murderer!</p>

<p>As well he could be onside with truth re <a href="http://i.imgs.fyi/img/2ile.jpg">John F Kennedy Jr</a>&#39;s fatal air accident July 16, 1999 that also took the lives of his wife and her sister, which was allegedly arranged to ensure Hillary Clinton&#39;s election as US Senator for New York. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ot5sv/cnbc_offer_a_friendly_reminder_about_what/dcn1e5g/">Link</a>.</p>
