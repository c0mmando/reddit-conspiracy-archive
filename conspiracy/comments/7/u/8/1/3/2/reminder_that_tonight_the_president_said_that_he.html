       I feel like we should all be against this insane abuse of power the federal government has. Why do we spend all this money on the military and torture, when we could spend it on the American people. The conspiracy is that the government and the military industrial complex is too big!

       Something done by every President (increasing military spending)...in the open...with the support of voters and congress and which is not technically even a crime is not exactly what r/conspiracy was created for, imo.

       Even the torture/indefinite detention stuff aside, the mere existence of a US military prison on the island of Cuba, against the explicit wishes of the Cuban government, is brazenly neo-imperialistic. Weirdly dissonant in the 21st century.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, so's the torture and the indefinite detention without due process.

       He did for a while, then he transferred the detainees to Bagram (now Parwan), then more people were put in Guantanamo. So basically he made it look like he was putting an end to torturing political prisoners, by sending them all to a second Guantanamo under the guise of closing the first, and no one questioned this, and in fact many people still think he closed Guantanamo to this day, but he didn't. That was the plan, they said they were doing it, then they didn't do it, and now there's two of them. We transferred ownership to the Afghanistan government (because they're such a great band of folks) under the condition that we still maintain heavy oversight over who they are allowed to release. This facility tortures and interrogates the same political prisoners that were at Guantanamo, except now people like Ashraf Ghani were making decisions about how to run the facility. Ashraf is the current president of afghanistan. He graduated is an anthropologist that received his doctorate from Columbia university, and taught at Berkeley and John Hopkins. In the 90's he worked as an anthropologist lead for The World Bank in the 90's working on reform programs in east Asian, including in India, China, and Russia. During this time he also received Harvard and Stanford education. This ticks a lot of boxes to anyone well acquainted with the Bretton Woods conspiracy, in particular the IMF, which was founded at the same time as The World Bank, and has been accused of enslaving the third world under inescapable debt.

       Not to discredit what the other comment said, but Obama did more than just trying to move around prisoners to other sites like Guantanamo.  He did actually make an effort to shut it down, however to do that we needed to move the prisoners to the US and there were zero congressmen/women who wanted that to happen.  No one wanted the detainees in their state.  So basically some in congress wanted to shut it down publicly, but in reality they voted no because they didn't want them here, or more specifically in their own state potentially.  That was just the democrats too if I remember right, the republicans were voting no just because it was Obama, but I bet they had similar feelings as the democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       So he did try, but got shut down pretty quick.  I don't know if he could have used an EO for it or not, but doing so would have put him at odds with not only the republican congress, but also with the democrat congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guantanamo is a huge black eye for the US and it is super depressing that Obama was unwilling and unable to make an impact on it, and unfortunately we now have a president that not only wants it open but wants to send more people there.  This is something I feel like the entire US population should be on the same side about, but we are so politicized now that I fear Trump supporters are going to support Guantanamo remaining open which means their representatives will also begin supporting it.

       It's depressing.  Laws are laws, they can be changed on a whim.  But what Americans wrote into the Constitution should be reflective of our ideals and what we want to project to the world as a statement of who we are.  People are so scared by the idea of criminals and foreign terrorists in their backyard that they allow these ideals to be broken every day.

       I completely agree with that statement, but just so you, it doesn't matter where you were born at this point, POTUS just has to say you're a terrorist and you can be put away indefinitely without trial.  One might wonder why the people who like Rachel Maddow, who is #resistance doesn't mention Trump now has this authority is troubling.

       So we can see that Trump is about the law of the land, with the appointment of judges and not arresting political figures outright. If he did that then he would have looked like a tyrant. So law of the land, that is his mission.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what does that have to do with gitmo?
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe that GITMO was kept open for terrorists, foreign of course but also domestic. It sounds obvious but there are over 13,000 indictments in the docket, these are American, and includes Hillary, Bill, Comey, McCabe and their cronies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keeping gitmo open means military court and imprisonment, NOT civilian. Because can you imagine Obama placed liberal judges overlooking Hillary case for example?

       Leftists called America a shithole.  America is great, but it's going to be greater.  The America you want, a socialist multiculti "utopia", is done.  You will have to work and this nation will get back to it's roots.  If you don't like it leave.

       Guantanamo is a very nuanced problem. There are legit terrorists there from war-torn nations that simply don't have a government to report to. The only literal alternative is to release them into the wild, or release them and let Canada pay the terrorist $8 million dollars.

       Or just put them in one of the many maximum-security prisons that we have here in the US. You know, the ones that already house terrorists, serial killers, and people who are far more dangerous than anyone in Guantanamo. The only additional cost would be to fly them over from Cuba.

       It has a specific purpose and use an we're better off with the scum tucked away inside there than to have them out and about plotting their schemes and making violence on our people such as they have done. they are pulled from a shadow army and the US DOJ has no jurisdiction, hence Gitmo where the military has jurisdiction over foreign combatants.

       Better they are there for them too. Look what happens when you hand these people back to the legal banner holders of their own countries. Useless exercise when you consider they will be simply killed or re-employed as mercs or taliban goons or what have you.

       Yeah, the Q thing strung me along for a bit but after seeing them loving on Gitmo, it's clear none of these people in DC are anywhere close to being 'good guys'. They all need to go. We need a new system of government. This isn't anything even remotely resembling a democracy. Trump made it crystal clear to me that this is a show and it has been for a long time. So thanks for that. Now kindly get the fuck off stage. All of you.

       did it dawn on you that maybe that's why he's there right now?  He was approached by the military to run, probably as a distraction, while this country is being cleaned top to bottom.  It isn't a partisan issue anymore, it's  quality of life and liberty issue.  Forget about Trump, concentrate on what the fuck is going on RIGHT NOW in terms of other executive orders revolving around human trafficking and fun things like that.

       there was a long term plan set in place for this country (and the globe) to be one united world.  Short term, this was a 16 year plan.  8 for Obama and 8 for Hillary.  There's not cliff note version of this stuff, you have to read the calm before the storm threads.  Trump is a distraction put in place while the gov't gets sanitized.  How many career politicians have decided not to rerun this year?  How many CEOs have resigned?  How many social media execs are now gone?  All of this is coincidence?

       Well the world was nowhere near close to being united at the end of Obama's Presidency. Another 8 years wasn't going to accomplish anything. Most the world is only halfway friendly with the US because they are a super power.

       the people weren't close to being united, but we're not talking about people.  just look at Obama's actions in his second term...namely gutting high ranking military (generals) and replacing them.  That was Valerie Jarret's role in this mess.  Spotting people not willing to play the game and getting them ousted.

       But how was this going to lead to a one world government?
      </p>
      <p>
       For that you need everyone to be more or less on the same page politically (not happening any time soon)
      </p>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <p>
       You need a forceful takeover. The world isn't going to just let this happen, nor does the US alone have the man power to do this. The US doesn't have any allies that they are close enough with to support them either.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you take the US government as being the model on which a one world government would be based it is an even harder sell.

       I think we're heading in the right direction, but we're basically being asked to trust one group of thugs to protect us from another group of thugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, I think we're being told a lot of stuff in the conspiracy world, but at this point it's a lot of promises and the evidence is patchy at best.  Did they send the cabal to Guantanamo or is it for anyone they don't like?  When are they disclosing suppressed technologies?  I'm not ready to buy the whole package hook line and sinker yet.  Maybe when heads start to roll I'll trust them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of whether a person dislikes trump or the people that came before him, we should all be agreeing that the system that got us to where we are now hasn't been successful in serving the people, and that we need to fix this system in such a way that our government is utilized to serve our will, and this is not something that we can let them fix for us, because letting them set it up has led to it serving them rather than us.

       Well of course they weren't going to close it. You think the CIA and military want to get rid of their torture sights? Actually, they'd probably be fine closing Gitmo and just shipping the prisoners to the blacker sites they have. But that won't happen. It's a convenient talking point for Democrats (we're gonna close Gitmo! But then never actually do) and it's a great "America fuck yeah! Fuck the bad guys!" For the Republicans. Neither side cares about the people there, both innocent and guilty. They're just boogeymen and talking points they can use to score some points.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you thought the "law and order, we need to defeat ISIS, terrorism is everywhere and coming for YOU" candidate was going to close Gitmo, then I have a condo on the moon I'd like to rent out to you.

       The big thing is they want to close Gitmo but don't want to release anyone. No one in the States will take the prisoners, nor will any other country as half of them would probably release the anyone they were sent due to lack of evidence.

       There is over 15,000 troops in Afghanistan alone yet.  If they are all but defeated why do we need to increase the military budget? The thing with invading countries is you can all but defeat them for decades.

       Alright, lets circle back then once ISIS is, "defeated." not sure how you can defeat any enemy when you are exponetially creating new enemies, but you apparently think were almost there.  Glad to hear most the troops should be home soon then since there all but defeated.

       You guys and your sheltered opinions are cute. You're going to cringe at the things you used to think when you get older. However I would avoid saying things like the person above me said in front of people who come from actual oppressive countries. It'll save you a lot of embarrassment later in life.

       The funny thing is that we're in the middle of one of the biggest "conspiracy" events i can remember and i'm old.  And R fucking CONSPIRACY wants no part of it.  Makes zero sense to me.  Either operation mockingbird made a splash here in the last few months or the shills have taken over (judging by the looks of the mod list, i'll opt for the later)
