       Perhaps emboldened by the admin's apparent apathy to behavior that
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be considered as going against the core ethos of this website, the stalker/hate sub known as TMOR has significantly increased their attacks against me.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7u1py5/how_come_washingtons_in_a_rush_to_rig_russias/dtgtyld/">
        this submission statement of mine
       </a>
       from 15 hours ago has managed to achieve an impressive -85 in comment karma.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Curiously, the thread never got very popular (it hit 0 fairly quickly) and less than a dozen other users actually commented at all.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       For those familiar with reddit, that would
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       account for almost -100 comment karma, with well over +100 comment karma for the top comment (which was a TMOR-esque ad hominem attack against me).
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7u309p/top_mod_goes_full_comrade_and_posts_literal/">
        Here's the explanation
       </a>
       . Notice how this TMOR thread has
       <em>
        significantly
       </em>
       more activity than my thread: it's at 257 points with 46 comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO this is
       <em>
        irrefutable
       </em>
       evidence of a TMOR induced/inspired brigade that created a -100/+100 discrepancy in the voting of my post.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a similar example from today,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7u1n3e/reaction_to_recent_iranian_protests_reveals/dtgudou/?sh=bf98fd55&amp;amp;st=JD290RBE">
        another comment of mine
       </a>
       was downvoted dozens of times
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7u5737/top_mod_at_it_again_complains_about_his_blatant/">
        and it just so happens it was linked
       </a>
       by TMOR as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       And hey look,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7u410z/top_mod_posts_political_thread_weeks_after_saying/">
        they linked to
        <em>
         another
        </em>
        one of my posts today.
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       As of late, TMOR has decided to honor me with multiple links to my posts and comments on their front page on a regular basis (there are at least 4 on their front page right now!).
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7t536z/stand_up_to_the_mod_abuse_axolotl_peyotl_sets_a/">
        Their current sticky
       </a>
       is even some sort of perverse call to arms against me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scanning through these threads is a fascinating experience...they don't even know me, and yet it's palpable how they delight in their obsessive disdain, and all over some person on the internet!
      </p>
      <p>
       This thread should serve as a good reference point for those who accuse us of spouting baseless accusations against what very clearly is despicable behavior being regularly carried out by hate-oriented subs like TMOR.

       Take comfort in their outrage. They obviously target you because they’re afraid of what you have to say, so keep on triggering them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a shame admins can’t see this/ refuse to act, but quite a few of the hate subs have been told to stop user-tagging recently. Maybe admins are realizing how badly this bullying behaviour reflects on Reddit, and they can’t have that when they go public.

       TMOR exists solely to mock and harass people who don’t follow the approved MSM/ Governement narrative. They’re unable to produce original content, so they piggyback on the thoughts of others to make themselves feel clever.

       That’s really lame.  From what I’ve seen here nobody here is claiming “genius” status but just exchanging ideas and theories they may or may not believe in.  It’s a fucking conspiracy sub I don’t get it.  The only problem I have with this sub is it’s a little to heavy with the politics.

       Eh, it's a common enough sort of subreddit. Others dedicated to racism, etc... or to highlighting stupid shit from all sorts of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for conspiracy theorists, there is a broad range and some of them are legitimately mentally ill. Others thing they're supergeniuses that can see the truth that all those other sheeple miss. Some Pepe Silva shit. Pizzagaters for example, invented a shadowy cabal of pedophiles from a couple of emails that mention pizza... wild leaps of logic. Aka "top minds".

       Individual members may vary in their responses, but for some, yes. You can find those if you dig into the history of the place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose they might argue it's not mockery but "highlighting" some of the crazy. Anyway, they and other similar subs pop up on
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       from time to time, if you use that as your front page like I do you'll see them whenever something extremely highly upvoted is posted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do recommend that; if you're new to reddit you might not know about
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       but it's what
       <a href="/r/popular">
        /r/popular
       </a>
       replaced. It gets all sorts of cool stuff from all over reddit (except quarantined subs). A great way to find new subs or just awesome content you would otherwise miss.

       You should just make a megathread on TMOR and sticky it to the top. All the users that have been affected by TMOR can drop comments in it. Then we'll send it to all the news websites and see if we can get an article about it. The only way Reddit inc. might care is if the PR is bad enough. Even then...

       I don't think losing magic internet points would be seen as a significant story. The article you linked is about a person whose online profiles were connected with her real identity, which makes the harassment more serious.

       They get away with it because this sub doesn't enforce sitewide rules, which means the admins don't step in.  If this sub cleaned it's own house, the admins would actually finally step in an do something about the obvious brigading.  Until then, they'll let this place wallow in the mess it's created.

       Don't feel like getting banned to be honest.  Admins have clearly stated on multiple forums that if the mods on a forum don't enforce sitewide rules that they aren't going to step in and deal with other issues.
      </p>

       If you don't keep your own house clean, don't expect the admins to come and clean it up for you.

       But the admins do, and that's the entire point.  When you bring up these obvious accounts to the mods here, they don't do shit, when you report it to the admins they say "
       <a href="https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-ban-evasion">
        we only review ban evasion reports when they are reported by the subreddit moderators
       </a>
       " which the mods here won't do because they are protecting certain accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therein lies the problem, if the mods here actually kept the sub clean, the admins would probably be more willing to step in regarding the obvious brigades.

       Exactly. Several got banned in that thread as well. My comment was removed and they wouldn't respond every time I asked why.

       I downvote a lot of posts like his that are clearly partisan politics or trying to discredit anything Russia related. Not because I'm a shill, but because they're garbage posts.

       Why don’t you post with another account until they calm down with their targetted campaign against the axotl account? You could use this one merely to moderate, another one to post all the good stuff you usually post.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not advice I’m giving, as you most obviously thought about this already. I’m genuinely curious why you don’t do it. It couldn’t possibly be because of karma capital, so what is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I fear the more you complain about this, the more it emboldens them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is quite clear what is going on. Everyone can see it. Personally I don’t need further proof. Remember they were profoundly humiliated recently, so that explains IMO their renewed violence.

       The guys over there are mostly lefties and communists. I once thought, at the very beginning when I found TMoR, that they wanted to have a discussion, oh, boy I was wrong.

       I managed to get -160 points in just a few hours, with only one posting, so I realized what they are.

       I ignore them. This submission only gives them ammo. It's encouragement. The best method of training mentally impaired dogs is by refusing to acknowledge their behaviors until they fall in line. TMoR are just a collection of yeast infections without purpose or value. Don't do anything to justify their unemployed, uneducated existences.

       I'm pretty sure that submission statement was so heavily downvoted because you linked to literal Russian propaganda. Not like RT level propaganda, just straight up, obvious and unmasked propaganda. Organic users on this site aren't stupid and they downvoted you for making such a post. That would be my guess as to what happened. Or, I suppose it could be because everyone is out to get you and wants to keep the "truth" from being known.

       If it's propaganda then it should be easy to actually address the point made then right? If you attack me or do any of the arguments I made your proving my point.

       You know, I actually agree with you that people should address things they disagree. That's been my stance with the whole "shill" thing here: it shouldn't matter if people are shills. If their points are bad, argue for why they're bad. So I agree that people should address the point of an OP most of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I was simply giving an alternative explanation for why OP's post might have been heavily downvoted. It doesn't require TMOR brigading or whatever.

       All the time. People downvote and dismiss pretty much all posts from the Washington Post and things considered MSM without addressing the content. Those threads are always filled with comments about how "WaPo is trash" or the like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ditto for RT and zerohedge. People downvote and dismiss.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that people should address the claims in most cases. There are probably a few exceptions for really obvious bullshit, but even in those cases it makes sense to address the claim and show why it's wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is different than downvoting. I don't expect people who hate the Washington Post to upvote posts from the Washington Post. Likewise, I don't expect people who think RT is propaganda to upvote posts from RT.

       Contact me if more evidence is required, I have screenshots and links of their terrible behavior.

       Please provide! I think a sticky post on TMOR would be timely and appropriate.

       You know, there's an anti r/conspiracy post on their side with users backing the original poster the same way that users are doing here with OP. It's so fascinating to sit back and compare the two subs and their similarities. What's up Reddit?

       Every time a brigade happens, you react by throwing your own posts into stickies or contest mode. Each time it gives your political posts more visibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since this is r/conspiracy I can't help but wonder if there's a conspiracy that you're getting things brigaded by tmor for more visibility and to play the victim.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just entertaining the idea because it seems like you're benefiting from these attacks.

       Well first of all TMOR brigading is a fact like it or not and you know this they linked to the thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since when does this sub downvoted things without even reading or addressing this point because "I disagree it must be propaganda"?
