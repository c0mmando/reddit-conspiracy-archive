       Then why was it being touted as being detrimental to national security before its release, especially after we are now able to read its full contents and seeing that there is truly nothing in it that threatens national security?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is the knee-jerk reaction of the media to discredit everything in the memo without at least first looking into the claims made?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is there only one story regarding the memo on the front page of Google's cards after searching "news?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is the word "partisan" just now starting to be used as a buzz word... To shift people's perception on the memo?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why have we not seen any evidence refuting the claims made in the memo, instead, we only hear individuals from the left trying to immediately discredit its legitimacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are all questions that I have which I hope will be answered in the coming weeks.

       I google memo and got a lot of "partisan" headlines. When the Democrats memo hits the cycle I wonder if it will be headlined "partisan" as well? This is a big deal. If people could be a little more objective they'd see just how scary this truly is. And I think we're only beginning to get the actual scope of what's been going on in the DOJ/FBI for the past few years.

       Bingo.

      <p>
       The US government used unverified rumors and innuendo as "probable cause" to unleash the US intelligence apparatus against a US citizen.

      <p>
       Seriously. The Dems should really consider if they want to legitimise this sort of behaviour from the FBI/CIA/NSA.

       I'm sure Bill Clinton would have been in a hell of a lot more trouble than simply getting a blowjob, if this power had been used against him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do Americans, of either side, really want the US government to be able to obtain invasive search warrants so easily?

       This is why its such a political show.  Both sides have known for some time they have used increasingly less and less to obtain warrants, as far as they are concerned its no big deal, until it hits close to home.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it becomes something we are supposed to be outraged by.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well screw you, we have been outraged for years and nothing has been done, so pardon our lack of outrage just because it happened to someone on their team.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both sides are to blame as they increasingly legislate more and more power, afraid of the boogeyman Muslim terrorists, all the while stomping the average person.

       One side is getting the information out. The other side is trying to shut it down. You may blame both sides and ultimately you may very well be right. But right now it's a bad look for the left. The entire point of having oversight committees is to keep agencies accountable. Those committees work for us. They should report to us. And again, I'm not exactly sure what Democrat leaders are thinking these days, maybe they're just taking it for granted that the mid-terms will swing their way. But it's not a good look siding with the intelligence communities and choosing censorship over transparency.

       Oh, I agree, there were oversteps for sure.  The problem I have is we have been bitching about this for years because it happens to the average person.  The only time it becomes a BIG DEAL to most people discussing this, is purely because of some partisan bullshit.  The truth is this wasn't the first, it sure the hell won't be the last(by either sides), so color me if I am not surprised, and just see it as the game they play with each other.

        But a Democratic memo written to rebut the Republican document says that the F.B.I. was more forthcoming with the surveillance court than the Republicans say. The F.B.I. told the court that the information it received from Mr. Steele was politically motivated, although the agency did not specifically identify the information as financed by Democrats.

       Trump is delaying the approval of the "Minority report" of the memo so that the Nunes/GOP can have a few days of time, without rebuttal, so that this memo can be the first to set the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the Minority Report comes out the initial blast into the news will have faded somewhat, and the ideas behind the first narrative will have been cemented in the minds of many.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was clearly a strategic decision to not release the Minority Report (i.e. rebuttal) at the same time as the Nunes memo.

       Trump isn't delaying anything. Where did you get that from? The House is using a process to declassify the minority memo. If the minority memo had existed before this week you could have had it sooner. But it didn't and now it's subject to the same process that Nunes memo underwent.

       First to set the narrative?  We have known about the memo for a week..  Most every MSM outlet has had tons stories about Dems saying how 'fake' it is.. and how 'it shouldn't be release due to national Security (despite being fake..)'.  The Dems have had every chance to 'set the narrative'.. it's not like 'the memo' just appeared unexpectedly this morning.

       Schiff is currently criticising Nunes for having not read the underlying documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI only allowed one member to read those documents, and Nunes sent Gowdy because he is a former prosecutor more likely to be able to see the legal ramifications.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now, apparently the Dems claim to have read the source documents themselves?
      </p>
      <p>
       How?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the FBI feeding the Dems information that they are withholding from the Republicans?

       Because it's early enough that people like the FBI director may still be formalizing statements, and the facts that are missing are classified and can't be released without either Trump or the committee that released the memo approving (that's a pretty neat piece of work, huh?)

       Comey has made similar statements on Twitter (which added to our miscommunication).
      </p>
      <p>
       Right so Christopher Wray... who from 2003 to 2005 was the Asst Attorney General who worked DIRECTLY FOR James Comey who was the Deputy Attorney General..  weird how friends promote/recommend friends... they also protect them.

       I'm curious as to how critical the bulk of media will be regarding the minority memo. I guess we can then gauge if the media is only being critical as they should, or partisan as many suspect.

       Google's a very left leaning company that actively shut's down dissenting opinions. Just ask James Damore. To blindly trust that their sorting methods are solely based on financial incentive is naive.

      <p>
       There are more things besides the minority memo coming out real soon. There's been a very real investigation by the IG regarding the very same FBI/DOJ's handling of the Clinton email "matter" coming out in March. Do you believe that the IG's report will be as partisan as you believe the Nunes memo to be?
