<p>Bingo.</p>

<p>The US government used unverified rumors and innuendo as &quot;probable cause&quot; to unleash the US intelligence apparatus against a US citizen.</p>

<p>Seriously. The Dems should really consider if they want to legitimise this sort of behaviour from the FBI/CIA/NSA.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure Bill Clinton would have been in a hell of a lot more trouble than simply getting a blowjob, if this power had been used against him.</p>

<p>Do Americans, of either side, really want the US government to be able to obtain invasive search warrants so easily?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why its such a political show.  Both sides have known for some time they have used increasingly less and less to obtain warrants, as far as they are concerned its no big deal, until it hits close to home.</p>

<p>Then it becomes something we are supposed to be outraged by.</p>

<p>Well screw you, we have been outraged for years and nothing has been done, so pardon our lack of outrage just because it happened to someone on their team.</p>

<p>Both sides are to blame as they increasingly legislate more and more power, afraid of the boogeyman Muslim terrorists, all the while stomping the average person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One side is getting the information out. The other side is trying to shut it down. You may blame both sides and ultimately you may very well be right. But right now it&#39;s a bad look for the left. The entire point of having oversight committees is to keep agencies accountable. Those committees work for us. They should report to us. And again, I&#39;m not exactly sure what Democrat leaders are thinking these days, maybe they&#39;re just taking it for granted that the mid-terms will swing their way. But it&#39;s not a good look siding with the intelligence communities and choosing censorship over transparency.  </p>

The only time it becomes a BIG DEAL to most people discussing this, is purely because of some partisan bullshit.  The truth is this wasn&#39;t the first, it sure the hell won&#39;t be the last(by either sides), so color me if I am not surprised, and just see it as the game they play with each other.</p>

<p><em>But a Democratic memo written to rebut the Republican document says that the F.B.I. was more forthcoming with the surveillance court than the Republicans say. The F.B.I. told the court that the information it received from Mr. Steele was politically motivated, although the agency did not specifically identify the information as financed by Democrats.</em></p>

<p>When the Minority Report comes out the initial blast into the news will have faded somewhat, and the ideas behind the first narrative will have been cemented in the minds of many. </p>

<p>It was clearly a strategic decision to not release the Minority Report (i.e. rebuttal) at the same time as the Nunes memo.</p>

<p>First to set the narrative?  We have known about the memo for a week..  Most every MSM outlet has had tons stories about Dems saying how &#39;fake&#39; it is.. and how &#39;it shouldn&#39;t be release due to national Security (despite being fake..)&#39;.  The Dems have had every chance to &#39;set the narrative&#39;.. it&#39;s not like &#39;the memo&#39; just appeared unexpectedly this morning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny...</p>

<p>Schiff is currently criticising Nunes for having not read the underlying documents.</p>

<p>The FBI only allowed one member to read those documents, and Nunes sent Gowdy because he is a former prosecutor more likely to be able to see the legal ramifications.</p>

<p>But now, apparently the Dems claim to have read the source documents themselves?</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>If the FBI feeding the Dems information that they are withholding from the Republicans?</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s early enough that people like the FBI director may still be formalizing statements, and the facts that are missing are classified and can&#39;t be released without either Trump or the committee that released the memo approving (that&#39;s a pretty neat piece of work, huh?)</p>

<p>Google&#39;s a very left leaning company that actively shut&#39;s down dissenting opinions. Just ask James Damore. To blindly trust that their sorting methods are solely based on financial incentive is naive. </p>

<p>There are more things besides the minority memo coming out real soon. There&#39;s been a very real investigation by the IG regarding the very same FBI/DOJ&#39;s handling of the Clinton email &quot;matter&quot; coming out in March.
