The FBI and Democrats kept repeating the memo should not be released because of national security. 
There is no national security threat in the memo, that was obviously a cover to attempt to keep the memo from getting out. </p>

<p>We have to see what the FBI/Democrat response will be in the next couple days, but it doesn’t look good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily. </p>

<p>The memo that was released was changed and edited from the original version of the memo, the one she would be making that comment about. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/958897790469464064">Schiff tweeted about the editing.</a> Hopefully the president of the US was smart enough to ask that the memo be changed to <em>not</em> endanger sources or national security before it was released to the world. Hence why the memo was released without redactions from the White House - it had already been edited.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;ll believe that when I see the changes that were made. The minority leader made a hot mess of herself claiming that releasing the memo would leave us, as a nation, in harm&#39;s way.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be honest - I don&#39;t. But I am open to the idea that they did. I&#39;m not a fan of Clinton nor particularly of Obama so I&#39;m not, like, morally against the idea... I just don&#39;t think anyone has shown any convincing evidence that its happened. And the meme, if anything, has made me more skeptical - if this is the best they could do at making some sort of &quot;smoking gun&quot; for something &quot;worse than Watergate&quot;.... it&#39;s not very convincing.</p>

<p>That said, that doesn&#39;t really matter in regard to my last post. This memo CLAIMS some things without showing evidence to back them up. The upcoming Democratic memo will similarly make CLAIMS that may, or may not, have evidence backing them up. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle, and hopefully these memos will lead to more leaked/released primarily sources which will help make that middle more clear.</p>

<p>Your approaching this with a partisan take which makes you jump to the conclusions you want to (that, predictably, they want you to too). Still doesn&#39;t make your take reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t said that the meme is a &quot;nothingburger&quot; (hate that term), but I do think that it doesn&#39;t  conclusively show what you&#39;re claiming. Hopefully when the equally-spin Democratic memo comes out, there will be a push for releasing more primary source documents, which will either back up the claims in this memo (which the memo itself does not) or explain them more fully.</p>

<p>Either way, your claim that the people who said the memo was a national security risk were merely saying that to prevent the memo&#39;s release is not necessarily true. Schiff posted several days ago saying that the memo had been changed from what was initially given to the Committee to an edited version that was going to be released. Presumably those edits took out the parts that threatened security and sources? </p>

<p>Why didn’t Nunes review the FISA warrants? He said as much, and then tried to foist off sloppy workmanship on Trey Gowdy, who wasn’t having it. Gowdy still has confidence in Mueller, and said the memo does nothing to undermine the investigation. Looks suspicious to me. </p>

<ol>
<li>If Trump and company had an issue with the FISA warrants, why didn’t he request review by an independent judge six months ago? If he truly believed malfeasance, he could have requested the review right away and stopped the investigation immediately. His base would have loved it. They’d never stop talking about it. Why do it in a half-assed way with Nunes? It looks more like a smear campaign. </li>

<p><strong><em>Assuming</em></strong> this is true will Trump supporters concede the memo thing is done and Nunes apparently together with the White house lied?</p>

<p>If the incoming left explanation is correct we got the following</p>

<p>RNC and later DNC funded Steel who obviously thought Trump is a crook. Steel unearthed information which at this point are neither fully corraborated nor dismissed. This information was used to <strong><em>extend</em></strong> a FISA warrant on a guy who was hanging out with Russian spies et cetera. </p>

<p>Why would the FISA court care if the dems paid for this escpecially given that the RNC paid as well. Most FISA warrants go through anyways apparently. How is this the big relevation Trump supports make it look like? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a horrible abuse of powers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How. They went to the FISA court and tried to renew a surveillance warrant for a guy who hung out with Russian spies and then came up again in the dossier. Where is the abuse of power? Steel was a reputed investigator. Why would a impartial judge not grant a new Warrant if a firm comes and delivers information? Isn&#39;t that what FISA warrants are for? That the US spies to much on its citizens is crystal clear but what about this warrant stood out to you? Where is the abuse of Power. They considered him a valid surveillance target long before the Trump thing. You also consider this abuse of Power? People act like they got a warrant for Trump himself. </p>

<p>If Steels information are correct will be seen later I guess. I feel people thing somebody got convicted of a crime because of Steel. They just allowed further surveillance....</p>

<p>Trump seems to think the spying on US citizens is fine because he renewed the FISA laws. So if Trump doesn&#39;t think the FISA system is broken where is the issue?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see how taking note and uncovering past abuse of FISA warrants getting rid of FISA.</p>

<p>Please explain that logic to me. There have been abuses of tax law, for instance, yet we don&#39;t throw the whole law out. </p>

<p>The problem is the corrupt people that abused the law. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean. Trump is outspoken about this. He thinks he got wronged. Right? But his approval of the FISA laws shows this to be merely talk. If Trump consideres the FISA laws oke doke <strong><em>despite</em></strong> knowing about this Carter Page thing we know that this is merely a move to lie to his followship. Because until this point nobody has even dared to show how this warrant is &quot;illegal&quot;. How is this abuse of power? Can somebody show the explict law or guideline or what not? Not one single person has done so. And you know full well if there were such law/guideline you would know about it. This lets me make the following conclusions: Trump knew about this, he knew what happened, he knew what happended was <strong><em>according</em></strong> to the approriate FISA guidlines/laws and yet he signed the new FISA laws.</p>

<p>What does this tell you? They appear to have constructed a disinformation project hoping it would fool enough people.</p>

<p>If the FISA warrant was awarded &quot;illegally&quot; they would tell you the law or whatever, and they would tell you it thousands of times by now. Right? The_donald would have 70 posts with the letter of the law. So apparently nobody broke any laws and the FISA warrant was awarded legally.</p>

<p>But are the FISA laws wrong or bad or whatever? Apparently not because Trump reapproved them. See the conundrum?</p>

<p>The FISA court got supplied information dug up by steel and multiple judges considered those information enough to extend the warrant for the guy who hung out with Russian spies before. So my question I asked like 5 times already. Where is the issue here?</p>

<p>&quot;That stupid fucking 4chan post didn&#39;t get a single thing correct. Literally none of it is true. The dossier was not compiled by a reporter and it was not based on information mailed to the FBI.&quot;</p>

<p>So you&#39;re pissed that 4chan fucking larps the shit outta people and you take it out on some poor sucker who fell for it? Or did the person you were expending so much effort on just troll you into trigger mode with a few little words about 4chan?</p>

<p>&quot;This is like if someone on 4chan said Trump ran as a democrat in the election.&quot;</p>

<p>Also kinda like if someone on 4chan started a rumor that Trump pays Russian Hookers to piss on a bed Obama slept in.</p>

<p>&quot;Literally all you have to do is fucking listen to the facts.&quot;</p>

<p>Hahahahahhahhhahaha, that&#39;s a good one, you do know where you are right? Evidently millions people on both sides of the aisle during the last few years  have gotten caught up in &quot;fake news&quot; posts on social media, even politicians and the news channels themselves have gotten played. Even if the majority of news stations report a story to your personal satisfaction, in the world of spies and political intrigue, dont you think it&#39;s possible the intelligence community and/or the media could still be getting played? </p>

<p>Do speak fluent 4chan? Are you sure you saw all of the relevant 4cham posts? Are you sure someone from 4chan wasn&#39;t feeling info on the down low? Do you trust the people at the top telling you it didn&#39;t happen to admit if they had been played out by 4chan?  There are a ton of examples throughout history where the facts have gotten completely buried in situations like this. </p>

<p>My point is not that there was or wasn&#39;t a tenable 4chan connection, just that it&#39;s possible regardless of the media reports. Also you really did kind, sorta, just get troll triggered by 4chan yourself, even if it was via an unknowing proxy.</p>

<p>In any event, you&#39;re being an unnecessary asshole. How do you know if the person you responded to is mentally challenged or under-educated or just a punk adolescent who doesn&#39;t know better? You could have just given them a friendly update, but your to fucking tough for that shit right?  Keep it angsty and edgy always bruh...or maybe calm the fuck down because if that&#39;s all it takes to incite hatred in your soul you got bigger problems than 4chaners trolling redditors and this shit ain&#39;t good for your blood pressure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) The memo shows that the Trump campaign hired a agent of Russia - Carter Page.</p>

<p>2) The memo shows that the Steele dossier was not the only or the original source of FISA warrant related investigations but rather this was initiated from Papadopoulos&#39; drunken brags.</p>

<p>3) The memo reveals a surveillance and warrant timeline which is a major security concern.</p>

<p>4) The memo show zero malfeasance by the FBI or Justice Departments</p>

<p>5) The memo shows that Nunes did not follow proper channels with reporting FISA concerns and that these &quot;concerns&quot; were largely a political fabrication.</p>

<p>6) Carter Page foreshadowed the memo months ago to NBC&#39;s Chris Hayes, so it also show this was a long term strategy.</p>

<p>A few other points could be made such as Nunes admitting he did not read much less study the underlying material and that this memo seems likely to have been written in part or whole with the White House.</p>

<p>So if anything, &quot;the memo&quot; is further indictment of Trump.</p>

<p>And further proof that Devin Nunes is incompetent at his job.</p>

<p>That is merely a political assumption on your part. The political affiliation of a man&#39;s wife is meaningless in both practical application and according to the ethics rules of the agency.</p>

<p>The Nunes/Trump Memo outlines zero malfeasance from the agency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it isn’t a “political assumption”  this is textbook ethics. You shouldn’t lie to people and say it isn’t an ethical dilemma because you’re dead wrong.</p>

<p>The U.S. Judiciary Code of Conduct (Chapter 3) not only requires that all employees abstain from conflicts of interests but also abstain from ANY APPEARANCE thereof. Translation: if it might seem like a conflict, don’t fucking do it. </p>

<p>Luckily the law is above any one, including Gowdy.</p>

<p>Congress didn’t act nor did the FBI and the DOJ when the IRS was sued for discriminatory behavior towards Tea Party non-profit applicants. The Judges in these cases cited gross discrimination by the federal government. Yet the agencies tasked to prevent corruption, failed to do so. </p>

<p>The government has been PROVEN ineffective to reign in corruption of any kind. Including political. The DoJ and he FBI aren’t immune from corruption either. To assume as such is naive and irresponsible. </p>

<p>It’s also deeply disturbing that liberals seem to think it’s okay for our government to spy on Americans based on paid political research from unreliable sources. </p>

<p>But not Trump? </p>

<p>This is the bullshit politics of this entire charade. Pointing to the wife of an FBI agent is just smoke and mirrors to cover-up the corruption of the Trump family and his Goldman-Sachs cronies in the Cabinet.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has already admitted obstruction of justice and conspiracy with known agents of Putin Pedik. Trump, Jr. willingly provided the further evidence of a conspiracy with Russian agents to undermine the 2016 election.</p>

<p>All this hilarious apologia for Trump, specious memos, incompetent spokespeople, mafia attorneys, etc. has been overridden my Trump himself on numerous occasions.</p>

<p>Donald J. Trump is an illegitimate President.</p>

<p>And his family is going to prison. I wonder if Ivanka likes orange?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily. </p>

<p>The memo that was released was changed and edited from the original version of the memo, the one she would be making that comment about. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/958897790469464064">Schiff tweeted about the editing.</a> Hopefully the president of the US was smart enough to ask that the memo be changed to <em>not</em> endanger sources or national security before it was released to the world. Hence why the memo was released without redactions from the White House - it had already been edited.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The funding of the dossier was a lie. It was one of the few bipartisan efforts in the 2016 campaign season.</p>

<p>It is a national security risk, because it makes the entire world aware of the time frame in which we have been eavesdropping on a suspected foreign agent.</p>

<p>It is a &#39;nothingburger&#39; as it tells us absolutely nothing that we haven&#39;t either known or guessed, and the dossier in question was not the primary piece of evidence for the FISA warrant, nor has there been any information on the primary sources that were used, and how those sources were vetted, which brings us back to security risks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it isn’t a “political assumption”  this is textbook ethics. You shouldn’t lie to people and say it isn’t an ethical dilemma because you’re dead wrong.</p>

<p>The U.S. Judiciary Code of Conduct (Chapter 3) not only requires that all employees abstain from conflicts of interests but also abstain from ANY APPEARANCE thereof. Translation: if it might seem like a conflict, don’t fucking do it. </p>

<p>Luckily the law is above any one, including Gowdy.</p>

<p>Congress didn’t act nor did the FBI and the DOJ when the IRS was sued for discriminatory behavior towards Tea Party non-profit applicants. The Judges in these cases cited gross discrimination by the federal government. Yet the agencies tasked to prevent corruption, failed to do so. </p>

<p>The government has been PROVEN ineffective to reign in corruption of any kind. Including political. The DoJ and he FBI aren’t immune from corruption either. To assume as such is naive and irresponsible. </p>

<p>It’s also deeply disturbing that liberals seem to think it’s okay for our government to spy on Americans based on paid political research from unreliable sources. </p>

<p>There’s more evidence that OJ killed his wife than Trump collusion. </p>
