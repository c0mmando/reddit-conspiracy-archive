    <div class="md"><p>The memo invalidates the dossier itself. The claim that the dossier had been &quot;corroborated&quot; and therefore was actionable intelligence that allowed the renewal of a FISA application was a lie.</p>

<p>The document was corroborated in FISA court by a Yahoo news article that Steele himself leaked to create. Not only is it illegal for a paid FBI asset to reveal his relationship with the FBI, but FISA court renewed the Page spying warrant based on the thought that the Yahoo article was an additional source of intel that corroborated Steele&#39;s dossier. When in fact it was just Steele corroborating himself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t discredit the dossier in the slightest. Aside from the fact that the memo&#39;a credibility is nonexistent because of it&#39;s source, the non-corroboration aspect of the dossier is probably related to the Fusion GPS testimony. The company trusted Steele&#39;s work enough because he has high credibility as a competent agent. The FBI also trusted Steele enough, because they worked with him on the FIFA bust. The fact is that the dossier was based on the research of a credible source and if anything in the FBI&#39;s investigation is based on Steele&#39;s work then they had a legitimate reason to continue investigating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t understand what credibility actually means and how it is being used in this investigation. You keep trying to muddy the waters by saying &quot;where are the credible sources&quot; when credibility is about whether someone&#39;s word or opinion has any weight. Steele&#39;s research has credibility because his word and his research are actually trustworthy in the investigative community. When he makes claims about research, people listen because his investigations have been correct in the past. Which is why the dossier is a part of the investigation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being fired for leaking to the media does not affect credibility or trustworthiness either. Plus, the fired claim is disputed, as Steele said he ended their partnership due to the FBI taking too long.</p>

<p>Salacious doesn&#39;t mean what you think it does; treating sexual matters in an indecent way and typically conveying undue interest in or enjoyment of the subject.</p>

<p>Also, you&#39;re twisting his testimony. Comey was describing what he said to the president when Trump asked him whether he was under investigation. Comey was not making a statement of fact on the truthfulness of the dossier to the panel. Merely what he said to Trump about the allegations. The actual transcript :</p>

<p>&quot;... I want first to ask you about your conversations with the president, three conversations in which you told him that he was not under investigation. The first was during your January 6th meeting, according to your testimony, in which it appears that you actually volunteered that assurance. Is that correct?</p>

<p>COMEY: That&#39;s correct.</p>

<p>COLLINS: Did you limit that statement to counterintelligence invest — investigations, or were you talking about any FBI investigation?</p>

<p>COMEY: I didn&#39;t use the term counterintelligence. I was briefing him about salacious and unverified material. It was in a context of that that he had a strong and defensive reaction about that not being true.</p>

<p>From the memo:</p>

<p>&quot;A source validation report conducted by an independent unit within FBI assessed that Steele&#39;s reporting as minimally corroborated.&quot;</p>

<p>Did you skip right over that part in the LONG 4 page memo? 😂😂</p>

<p>No, I can make the assumption that Carter Page was acting as an agent of Russian intelligence simply from the fact that the memo states that a FISA warrant was approved on Carter Page 4 times.</p>

<p>Again, feel free to make some points on why Carter Page did not act as a foreign agent of Russian intelligence during the campaign.</p>
