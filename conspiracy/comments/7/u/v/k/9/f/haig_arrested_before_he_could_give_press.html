    <div class="md"><p>SS: Ive been waiting for his statement/conference all day. However it seems he was arrested prior to it taking place. This is the 2nd person of interest in the Las Vegas Mandalay Bay incident. I guess he wasnt supposed to be manufacturing AP rounds. He was linked to Paddon by his name being on a box and also his fingerprints on the AP rounds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean it&#39;s clear why democrats would do that without any conspiracy angle - it&#39;s a simple and direct response to a shooting, no different than someone saying &#39;we&#39;re going to get rid of all the drugs in the city&#39; when drug deaths are rampant, or the movement that brought the drinking age up to 21 in the US. All that I can say is if any or all of these shootings are being orchestrated as part of some conspiracy to take away guns, it&#39;s been completely ineffective and has probably served more to the opposite angle of making people numb to mass shootings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this! So, he WASNT arrested BEFORE the conference. I had only been looking for details and the article I linked was the first one to come up.</p>

<p>I havent watched the full video yet. But with the first 4 minutes I have a question (ill edit as I watch more). ×They may be answered later. </p>

<p>Ok. Lawyer says there was only one. TRANSACTION with SP. However its stated that he originally met SP at a gun show and didnt have the amount needed so after a few INTERACTIONS he fonally sold SP the tracer rounds. So, in lawyer speak, only the one TRANSACTION could mean the only traceable sale to SP was the tracer rounds. Im going to watch rest of video now becaise I didn&#39;t know it existed. Thanks you! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did Haig mention that he trusted Paddock? I read it as more that he didn&#39;t see the signs that Paddock might do something crazy.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t necessarily need to trust someone in an ammo purchase. In fact, it&#39;s better for a dealer to not trust the buyer, it takes longer for a buyer to load a rifle than it does for the seller to pull out a loaded pistol.</p>

<p>Paddock bought 720 rounds of tracers from Haig. I know, that sounds like a lot to someone who isn&#39;t familiar with firearms, but a standard .30 cal military ammo box can hold around 650 loose .223/5.56 rounds, a .50 cal ammo box is upwards of 1200 rounds.</p>

<p>Sounds like a lot, but for an avid shooter it&#39;s nothing special. Better to buy in bulk than to pay overpriced rations or suffer buying reloads at the range.</p>

<p>Answer me this. Didnt Haig say the Tracer rounds were 7.62? IIRC there was not a single 7.62 rifle or magazone found in the hotel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What doesnt make sense is, why the hell did the shooter fly to PHX from LV to meet this guy and guy 720 AP Rounds? </p>

<p>A simple DuckDuckGo search I could buy 1000 AP Rounds for $350
1000 Tracer Rounds for $600</p>

<p>They said he met him at a gun show but didn&#39;t have the AP rounds on him so made a contract to buy from his house? Excuse me? You are at a GUN show, you could buy dozens of cases of 5.56 AP rounds, </p>

<p>Dont want it traced to you? use cash, you will find someone at the gun show to sell you ammo for cash, easy.</p>

<p>This story really doesn&#39;t add up to me, no one is flying from LV to PHX to buy 720 rounds of 5.56 ammo....</p>

<p>Only normies would think 720 AP Rounds is super rare and hard to come by...</p>

<p>There’s a nexus cartels and jihadist terrorists like ISIS. The fast and furious guns ending up used at Bataclan are a clear example of this. And Phoenix is full of cartel, MS13, etc. </p>

<p>Who else did Paddock meet with in Phoenix? What ties does Campos have in Phoenix?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty sure Bruce has an upcoming court date so we shall see if he still exists. </p>

<p>Haig was arrested for manufacturing armor piercing rounds. I personally dont know the laws behind that but he had a freakin website and sold them frequently &quot;as a hobby&quot; per the lawyer.</p>

<p>I hope someone chimes in with the legalities behind AP rounds because I have no clue. To me, it seems like smoke and mirrors to get him in Protective Custody since he has recoeved death threats and people beating on his door (allegedly)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ownership is legal for those rounds, manufacture with the intent to distribute or sell is not legal without federal licensing. </p>

<p>Manufacture: 10 FFL 18 USC sec. 922(a)(7))
Import/sell : 11 FFL (18 USC sec. 922(a)(7))
Having either one of these you can only sell to military/law enforcement. 
01-03 FFL holders,  may sell or deliver AP ammunition, must be entered into the Acquisition and Disposition Record.</p>

<p>AP rounds definitions by the shitty ATF standards is a cluster fuck. They define it as pistol ammunition, it&#39;s a fuckery of wording that really could be won in court with a good lawyer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. They put a foot long trail behind the bullet. Unless he (or accomplice who backed out/didnt show) planned on using those as a backup in case the Incindiary rounds (or van with tannerite parked by tanks) didnt ignite the jet fuel. </p>

<p>I feel this shooting was supposed to be a lot longer than what happend. (If we believe the shooting was an actual act of violence and not a political statement). For real, this setup would have caused thousanda of deaths but it was either thwarted or wasnt ever supposed to happen. Lots of questions...  Not a lot of answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man. Campos being shot by swat? First time I lve heard that! I could run with that to 100 different scenarios. </p>

<p>I dont make comments off of what I know for a fact (because we don&#39;t know) but I like to look at every angle. What if SP killed himself before Campos went in the room and then SWAT shows up and catchs him in the room and shot him. I seriously doubt it but thos case is fucked and we need closure. </p>

<p>When you break it down, there are 2 main theories. Paddock shot the guns or Paddock did not shoot the guns. Thats the simplest ways to put it. Either he was a lunatic mass murder whos been planning this for years with or without help OR he wasnt involved in the actual shooting and was set up by CIA/FBI/CARTEL/SAUDI ARABIA/ILLUMINATI/ELITE OR WHOMEVER. </p>

<p>Thats it. </p>

<p>Is this a government op gone wrong or is this a serious mental health issue? Those are my only 2 conclusions and after looking at all scenarios I have no clue but its leaning towards coverup. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His name wasn’t leaked. It was on an Amazon packing box that he put the ammo in when he sold it to Paddock. The box was in the hotel room.</p>

<p>The name was then made public when news outlets sued to have warrants and other documents released. The judge ordered them released and voila, his name became known.</p>

<p>I’d wager anything that he was being kept under surveillance by FBI/law enforcement before his name was made public, and that’s what LVPD and the prosecutors office didn’t want the documents released.</p>
