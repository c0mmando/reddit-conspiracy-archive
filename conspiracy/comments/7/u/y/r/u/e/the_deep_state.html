       In this current climate I think it is important to clarify a couple things, especially about the Deep State and government.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think the Deep State is only Obama/Hillary loyalists, please slap yourself. Twice. You are doing a tremendous disservice to your fellow conspiracy theorists and distorting the truth to fit your partisan view.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Deep State is unelected officials who seek to influence and undermine the public. The Deep State ranges from Robert Mueller all the way to Sean Hannity. You think he gives a fuck about you? Pfft, amateur. None of the talking heads on TV do. None of them care about limiting government power and exposing government abuse, they only care when it suits your team.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Deep State isn't partisan. It reaches across party lines and unites Ds and Rs. The surveillance state, perpetual war, corporate welfare. These are the things most people in DC agree on, and most people in the USA do not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wake up and stop playing team politics.

       Agreed, there is shit in both parties, but democrats are the worst, pedophiles, rapists, killers, treasonous people who protect the same kind of people and want to flood you with illegal immigration and terrorist refugees, so in comparison, the R's are 6 (but not the whole party itself, just many of the people there) on a scale o evil from 1-10, but the D's are 10-10 so fuck their whole party, THEY ARE THE DEEP STATE. And you can only "share" the guilt, just because they lost the elections, hence all the power they had with the nigger as president, if not, they would have had all the power and by now, we would all be drafted into a massive war, if KILLary had won.

       If there are pro-trump people in the deep state, more power to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is fighting for the people, the left is fighting for control over the people. Major difference...vegas, pizzagate, 9/11 happened because the ridiculous control the intelligence communities gained from left leaning morons.  You think the past presidents gathering and campaigning last year was just for fun?  No, they are representing the corrupt deep state seeking to combat trumps ‘power to the people’ presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don’t think there is a philosophical war at the top (left vs right), you’re a bit blind to reality.

       I still can't believe this is even a discussion or needs to be said. The government, every govt, is two sides of the same coin.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not until revolution happens, preferably political and without blood being spilt, that we the people will see the world managed how we deserve it to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       And don't get me wrong, the average person deserves Jack shit, but they do deserve to be fairly heard and  represented by their government and they do deserve to live a life without constant fear of whether their country/govt is about to turn on them next - through extreme taxes, land theft, wage theft or general lack of security through food/shelter/employment scarcity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it really so hard to simply allow citizens to life a full life? Most of us just want a home, a family, a bit of spare time to persue our hobbies and a network of friends and other citizens to enjoy said life with.

       To me, that isn't a very good question to ask. Everything, before it was done, had no examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       We didn't solve conflict with words once upon a time, we did it with sticks and stones. Why would it be hard to believe that it's out of the realms of possibility that we as a humanity could move forward from this situation without killing people or getting into a class war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides all that, I said preferably. I mean, I personally would prefer we solve this situation with diplomacy. Will it happen that way? Maybe not. Maybe it will.. Hopefully, preferably, it will. I see human life as too precious to be wasted on violence. How many budding Einsteins would be killed as cannon fodder in this revolution? It hurts me to think about.

       Hey, I wasn't the one suggesting revolution, you were. But to expect a revolution to be bloodless is naive at best. How do you expect that to work? "Hey, I'd like you to give up your power and money please"? Let's be real - Conflicts like that are not resolved with words

       I thing that I think is left out of these discussions is factionalism within the deep state and at the level of agency, ngo, and cabal. I won't say that I disbelieve that the Kochs could be included in the "deep state" but it would sure seem like there are other people/ groups the are largely in opposition to them but also "deep state".

       No you are completely correct, there are hundreds of thousands of corporations and individuals with their own interests. It just so happens that a lot of them agree on key things, such as the New World Order. That's why there are organizations like the Council on Foreign Relations, Bilderberg, and the Trilateral Commission.

       After reading this post, it's clear to me that OP is a very stupid guy who needs to punch himself in the face. Not once, or twice, but at least 5 times. This stupid guy is trying to discredit what the republicans have done for america by lumping them in with the corrupt deep state democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       The republican party led by trump has done more for america in 1 year than all past deep state presidents combined. Many of these Rs are now on board with trump because he was the only one who said FUCK YOU to the deep state. Without a great leader you can't get great followers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wake up and start supporting the republican party. Not because they are a "team", but because they are the moral, orderly, functional ones who want great things for americans. And their actions so far has shown this.

       Remind me, which party was it that officially supported a pedo who got banned from the mall for a senate seat?

       That turned out to be false. There is no evidence that Roy Moore did anything illegal and his behavior was considered acceptable at that place and time when the old way of marrying off teenage daughters was still common. I'm not saying I agree with that practice, by the way. All I'm saying is that the allegation that Roy Moore was viewed as some kind of predator in his late 20s or early 30s is a false allegation. I believe the constant references to Roy Moore as a pedo is intended to distract from the more serious pedo problem in our government related to child sex trafficking.

       A 29 year old taking a 16 year old to the movies on the suggestion of her mother is gross, but it's hardly akin to senior members of our government and law enforcement protecting and participating in organized human trafficking, which is the real story of our time.

       What discredits serious pedo investigations are people who want to bring out the pitchforks against people like Podesta, who have zero accusers, while defending people like Moore and Trump, who have dozens of accusers.  It's outlets like Fox News, that get all indignant when liberals like Weinstein are accused of sexual harassment, but take a very different tone when it's one of their own (Wynn).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious that done some people, pedo investigations are something that should only apply to liberals.

       Both Democrats and Republicans are NWO globalists, and that is the problem.  How do you explain McCain?  He is a NWO globalist pretending to be a Republican.  Trump is a Nationalist pretending to be a Republican.  Hillary is a NWO globalist pretending to be a Democrat.

       Largely agree but your definition makes it hard to distinguish any “legitimate” state actors. So somehow I think it must be extended beyond just unelected officials and has to include activity of officials and appointees outside of constitutional bounds or that undermines democratic principles. For example Hillary’s takeover of the DNC and subsequent surveillance and rigging of elections appears to be a combination of outsiders and insiders (that certainly crosses party lines).

       Yeah if we do that we'll definitely realise how fucked it is because we'll literally be giving TPTB a blank cheque to do whatever the fuck they want (and they already do that). They'll see a non-voting populace as an outright rejection of Democracy and public accountability when they're already thriving off of widespread voter apathy.

       True. But, you're going to have to gain the trust and respect of the people. And I think the best way to do that is to run successful local election campaigns, and grow a grass roots movement from there. I think there is too much focus on the presidential election and not on local elections from third parties.

       I agree. I don't think the focus on the election is out of place, here, though.

       After all, this sub is mainly filled with people who are either die hard Trump supporters or Clinton supporters, and both are completely convinced they aren't part of the problem.

      <p>
       In terms of constructive application of this idea, though, you're 100% correct.

       What I think is quite rich is the subset of people who view the deep state as some all encompassing, virtually unstoppable entity, yet think some long shot "man of the people" legitimately won a presidential election. There's only a few logical conclusions from this election- the winner never mattered in the first place because they control both, OR they wanted trump to win because they control
Him, OR they're inept and have never been the threat people seem to think they are. The first option seems to be by far the most likely
To me

       Some people will argue one day that that a certain conspiracy can't occur because the government is too incompetent and we would find out about it, and then the next day they argue that the conspiracy wouldn't be exposed or defeated because a conspiring government would supposedly be all powerful. We either wouldn't even know about the conspiracy because the government is extremely competent or the conspiracy wouldn't be kept secret because the government is too incompetent.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't think it's a little of both? Certain factions of the government are pretty good at what they do, but they sometimes fuck up. Other parts of the government can make really stupid mistakes, and this causes some people to assume the entire government must be just as incompetent. "The government" is actually a bunch of mostly independent parts, and if we are talking about an intelligence community/corporation partnership, they'd generally be pretty good at what they do, but they are not infallible.

       For them to be that powerful they would literally have to have alien tier AI tech/magic.
      </p>
      <p>
       So your wrong on it being more likely they
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       that powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'l give a quick rundown on what is the actual most likely state of the deep state is.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Their strongest point and how they survived until this point.... They turn people into psychopaths (Probably through something like MKUltra) and then blackmail them by forcing them to do something extremely evil making a 100% certain way of no one confessing. (This is the obvious conclusion considering the behavior I've seen from shills and any other option giving them astronomically low chances of surviving). And I repeat this is their only real strength.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They lost the election because their analyst are shit, But they assumed their was no way they could lose anyways, Especially because of their rigging. (Which was probably around 10-20% of the votes).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Their biggest weakness is that it is virtually impossible to do anything useful in reaction to Trump because of how loose their organizational and leadership probably is (Probably just a bunch of rich old bastards that are too dumb and scared to actually
         <em>
          lead
         </em>
         ). And so they aren't going to fabricate evidence like they definitely should do because again their all retarded and scared and since their isn't one single dude leading them no one will take charge and do that scary option. Also they will be rigging less votes because of the probably Voter ID and other things coming,
         <em>
          AND
         </em>
         Trump will be gaining huge amounts of popularity anyways.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       And btw Trump would literally be a godlike liar if he was part of the deepstate. Ever hear about the Red Dinner?

       The deep state isn't just political party members on both sides and media. It's rogue elements of the military and intelligence communities. It's corrupt businessmen and "lobbyists" from banking, to the energy sector, to tech industries etc. It's high level insiders of religious influence. It's secret societies. It's not easy to define... But it certainly doesn't stop at politics.

       Then is the "deep state" really just another term for TPTB or the Illuminati? I don't disagree that these things exist, but we don't want to conflate everything into "deep state" or else the term will become meaningless. Also if "deep state" begins to encompass so much, it's harder to know what people are referring to when they use the phrase.

       I see the deep state as the CIA, NSA, and DIA (Pentagon's intelligence). These agencies have also infiltrated DEA and I think FBI somewhat at this point, and they're obviously very connected to big industry players. The CIA is often called "The Company."

       Well yeah, they're definitely key players, but the reason I think it's not easy to define is because within these agencies and groups you have individuals who genuinely are working for the people alongside the rogue elements. It's hard to be super specific unless you can name names, because otherwise you might lump in the good guys with the bad.

       I don't disagree with you on this, btw. But I do think we're looking at a very top-down system in which the upper echelons are extremely corrupted and knowingly evil. Have you read some of the CIA whistleblowers' works? I'm thinking of people such as Victor Marchetti and John Stockwell, Philip Agee.

       Oh OK, yeah sure then, I completely agree. It was just that in your first reply to me it came off as an absolute as if the entirety of these organisations are corrupt. But given that the CIA has had its fair share of secret society directors then I don't doubt it's corrupt from the top-down. I haven't actually read anything from those guys so thanks for the link! I'll have a read into them. Any idea where to start?

       "The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence" by Marchetti. There was a big court case around the book, and the CIA won; they were allowed to block out some sections of the book, because Marchetti was sworn to secrecy as a CIA agent. But you still get a lot of valuable info out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for Drug War whistleblowers, I strongly recommend Michael Levine and his bestseller "The Big White Lie," about how the CIA-infiltrated DEA blocked him from going after big cocaine dealers in Bolivia and then when he persisted- they went after him instead. There's a lot of good material on CIA involvement in the drug trade, the virtual Bible being "The Politics of Heroin" by Yale Professor Alfred McCoy.

       Sorry I didn't come off as clearly as I'd like in my original post; I need to work on that.

       Thank you for those recommendations! They've been added to my ever-expanding reading list, haha.
       <br/>
       And no worries, dude, we all got something to work on. I can be a bit of a stiff for clear communication. But I think that's because I grew tired at some point of people often reading into what I was saying instead of simply listening to the words as I say them. I tend to go by a quote I once read by Robert Louis Stevenston: "Do not write merely to be understood. Write so that you cannot possibly be misunderstood."
       <br/>
       But I also try to help others along that path too. I try to be helpful and not to be a dick about it, but we all falter on our paths here and there. That's how we learn though. It's all just a learning experience.

       No. The media is definitely trying to paint it that way. It's Red and Blue, which I loathingly refer to as Purple. Literally the same fucking same. They disagree on social issues, but when it comes to maintaining the status quo? They're almost always on the same side.

Traditionally speaking that term refers not only to high level officials and military officers, but also the obscenely wealthy and powerful private individuals who determine what actions government officials can take.

       There's also the absolutely massive amount of free advertising cable news gave to Trump. I'm sure Clinton would have loved to have her rallies streamed live on air for free like Trump did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because the producers were thinking "people will watch this to see what crazy thing he says next" doesn't change the fact that it was millions upon millions of dollars worth of free advertising. Campaign rallies are basically one long campaign ad for the candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much like how the OP says the deep state isn't primarily concerned with partisanship, neither is the media. They mostly care about money and ratings, so they filled the airwaves with Trump.

       The counter argument to this is that the money made from TV news is chump change. I believe it’s more about controlling the message. This would explain all of the consolidation in the news business. If there were a decent profit margin, we’d see more upstart competition in the TV news space.

       Deep state pizza party is definitely across both aisles. Read the wikileaks. It's also about all the various agencies (intelligence or otherwise) that spring up, get a vague mandate to do &lt;x&gt; and essentially become cesspools of corruption for decades.

       We have actual evidence against the Deep State. We have evidence that the Clinton foundation paid for falsified evidence in order to spy on trump. We know that was falsified. Where is the evidence of collusion? You are holding on to CNN's pathetic excuse for the Clinton campaign losing 2 billion dollars.

       They think they are doing good by stabilizing the world. Maybe they are doing good. In Star Trek it seemed like progress.

      <p>
       What discredits serious pedo investigations are people who want to bring out the pitchforks against people like Podesta, who have zero accusers, while defending people like Moore and Trump, who have dozens of accusers.  It's outlets like Fox News, that get all indignant when liberals like Weinstein are accused of sexual harassment, but take a very different tone when it's one of their own (Wynn).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious that done some people, pedo investigations are something that should only apply to liberals.
