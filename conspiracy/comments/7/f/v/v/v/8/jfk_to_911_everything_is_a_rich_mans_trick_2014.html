    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re associating fascism with anyone who leans right. That&#39;s not the way it is, despite being told so repeatedly. Nobody wants a Hitler. Nobody wants a dictator. Nobody wants to cleanse the gene pool of all non whites, that&#39;s ridiculous hype spread by the MSM a.k.a. political organizations. </p>

<p>The left&#39;s ideology is fascism under the guise of socialism. The left seems to trust the government so much they are willing to give control of everything to politicians. All power consolidated into one entity. Sounds pretty fascist to me but instead of one person ruling without the people&#39;s say, it&#39;s corporations backed by law who would rule us. Fuck that. Fuck the left&#39;s utopia when they don&#39;t even expect 100% transparency. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re arguing that I&#39;m misunderstanding what white nationalism is when I&#39;m telling you what it isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>If you are lockstep with the meta story of the left, Trump is a racist, fascist, white supremacist despite no evidence confirming the allegation and plenty of evidence to the contrary. If you ascribe to the corporate narrative, you also believe half of Trump&#39;s voters are so incredibly deplorable they have reached irredeemable status. They total millions and are white, Christian males who coordinate Trump&#39;s golfing outfit (the same one liberals photoshopped shit on his pants) with the tan khakis and white Polo shirts. And they all grab theatrical tiki torches to march in front of professional photographers for a Hollywood-esque production. All organized by a former Occupy Wall St. activist and outspoken Obama supporter. This is what the corporate media is telling people white supremacy is. They create the narrative. That was just one example, there are hundreds more. Fake news. It&#39;s all theater. It&#39;s an identity psy-op intended to pull on the heart strings of the uniformed to trick them into agreeing to full servitude to the state. To the point they will jail you for saying the wrong thing. See Britain. Get that shit away from me and stop imposing your ideology on this free wandering spirit, says every person aware of the dangers of authoritarian communism. </p>

<p>The moral of the story is the media has convinced half of America that a fascist dictator has become POTUS and is firing up internment camps. It&#39;s all bullshit. Fish food.</p>

<p>authoritarian communism</p>

<p>Authoritarian communism vs authoritarian capitalism both are fascist/dictatorships.</p>

<p>We just had a democratic presidential primary where they got rid of 
hundreds of thousands of registered democrat voters to try and usher in Clinton to the general. The jurisdictions even admit that it happened.</p>

<p>No prosecution or outrage in the &#39;news&#39; at all.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t do a damn thing anymore in the United States without a fkn license. Try to build a house without a contractors license in any decent sized city. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t even get a job washing peoples hair in a beauty salon WITHOUT A LICENSE.</p>

<p>The POTUS has been a target to divert attention from the military welfare complex since at least Eisenhower was in office.</p>

<p>You can do anything you want in the United States except supersede TPTB....unless you let them in early to profit from what you have built.</p>

<p>What makes you say that? Try going to sub-saharan Africa where many countries basically have a very weak goverment. Corporations do whatever they want, destroy the environment, treat workers like shit, etc etc. 
So with less regulation/government, you get worse corporations. It&#39;s pretty logical to me. Corporations only think about the bottom line.</p>

<p>Without government there would still be corporations, you might just call them something else but they would still be there, still making iphones that need titanium etc. and still be mining companies destroying the environment in Africa to get it (etc etc.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s possible they did hear gunshots from the grassy knoll, this documentary says there were shooters there as well as on other buildings, they just all missed cuz they were idiots, but the guy in the sewer got the shot after the limo came to a stop at the x on the road right in front of it, the fail safe, and the zapruder film shows this stop. I think that checked out I just want to see proof jd tippet looked like JFK</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen the documentary, my politics are anti-authoritarian, feminist, and alt-leftist. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve questioned WW2 for the past couple of years.</p>

<p>I believe that TPTB manipulated Soviet politics to make Stalin, rather than Trotsky, succeed Lenin (My theory is that Stalin and his allies supported fiat money whereas Lenin, Trotsky and their allies wanted to retain the Gold Standard after the USSR had returned to it in 1924. I&#39;m not saying this is necessarily true or that it&#39;s the only reason that the bad guys desperately wanted Stalin and his goons in the Kremlin, but there ya go.) and then built up Hitler to give well-connected bankers, arms-makers, and military contractors someone to destroy while they lined their pockets in the process. </p>

<p>Hitler and the Nazis did need to be destroyed (how effective TPTB actually were in this respect is most questionable when one examines some of the shit that came out of Washington and Moscow after the war, especially with respect to the CIA and the American Deep State), both to avenge their millions of victims and to prevent Nazi Germany from being the world&#39;s preeminent superpower, that much is obviously a given, but we commit a great folly when we are so distracted by the unadulterated evil of Hitler&#39;s regime and the sound and the fury of the War that we ignore the conductors and the machinations that allowed Hitler and Stalin to seize power to begin with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a long documentary; but suffice it to say it is (IMO) the best historical narrative of the true formulation of the 20th century geopolitical world. It also is so very important that we view this material and not set it aside as pure history; people and their families involved with the foundation of this shift are still actively pursuing these same interests today, with plenty of obfuscation of truth just as it was then. It is difficult  to determine exactly what is being done at any one time, but the awareness brought about by this type of thing should only sharpen our insights. Instead of focusing on individuals, or military operatives, or groups/countries etc., the important thing to focus on is the overall misdirection and how it could clearly continue to entangle us in the future. We all play a role in deciding our future; we need to ensure we maintain as much of that equity as possible, before it truly is too late. There will never be a time where a person cannot think freely; but it may come to pass where those that choose to do so are forced to do so in complete isolation or secrecy. That is the time that I fear the most; when society has tangibly released its desires for truth and values more the safety of not choosing to think. We seem to approach it more and more every day since the machine has no slack and continues to burn; but it still requires fuel. We must limit the fuel. Watch this documentary, stop being fuel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, anyone can look it up. There&#39;s tons of links out there. Just curious as to who or what sold you on this idea. Now that I know that it was written in <strong>1986</strong> by a <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Paul_Berg"><strong>German-American</strong> <em>mechanical</em> engineer and Holocaust revisionist</a> and published in a magazine sponsored by neo_Nazis and the KKK (you know, those folks who wear confirmation bias color goggles and religious blinders), then it&#39;s easy to dismiss before wasting any time reading it. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, I <em>did</em> take the time to look into why the author was largely dismissed by most serious scholars and the claims therein were rejected by courts as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think hitler didn&#39;t really know what was going on and didn&#39;t realize Zionists funded his Nazi party. I think Himmler was his handler. Look what Himmler did:</p>

<p>Louis Nathaniel de Rothschild (German: Ludwig Nathaniel Freiherr von Rothschild[1]) was an Austrian baron from the famous Rothschild family. He was born in Vienna on 5 March 1882 and died of heart failure while swimming in Montego Bay, Jamaica on 15 January 1955.[2]</p>

<p>He was the son of Albert Salomon Anselm von Rothschild. He owned a spectacular palace in Vienna, the Palais Rothschild, that housed an exquisite art collection and antiques.</p>

<p>After the Anschluß of Austria to Nazi Germany in March 1938, he was arrested at the airport at Aspern[3] and taken into custody by the Nazis because he was a distinguished member of the Jewish oligarchy. He was released only after lengthy negotiations between the family and the Nazis and upon payment of $21,000,000, believed to have been the largest ransom payment in history for any individual.</p>

<p>While imprisoned he was visited by Heinrich Himmler. Rothschild apparently impressed the SS leader, who subsequently ordered that Rothschild&#39;s prison conditions be improved with better furniture and sanitation facilities.[4] Despite appeals from Queen Mary of the United Kingdom and possibly the Duke of Windsor, Rothschild was held in Vienna&#39;s Hotel Metropole while the German government attempted to expropriate his business concerns.[5] He was imprisoned at least through July 1938, and his property placed under control of a German &quot;commissioner&quot;.[6] Felix Somary, in his memoirs,[7] recalls that, soon before the Anschluss, he phoned to the baron repeatedly, in a desperate attempt to convince him to leave Austria. The day before the Anschluss, Louis&#39;s brother Alphons and his wife were visiting him in Switzerland, wanting to go back into Austria; he persuaded them to remain there, and to get his children Francesca de Rothschild and Heidi de Rothschild away from Austria to Netherlands.</p>

<p>However an EXTENSIVE investigation published and extensive article, which you can still get in PDF, shows the entire shooting scenario is impossible.</p>

<p>Said investigator was given full access to the Dallas sewer system in the area, something I dont think the city has done since, but this was the early 90s and the height of Stone&#39;s JFK popularity, and the supposed path of the supposed sewer shooter&#39;s escape has a series of bottle necks only a few inches wide.</p>

The points he was making, like explaining the behind the scenes of the JFK assassination, fits well and makes sense, but he never shows where he got his information, like on the story of John Liggett for example. It just rubs me the wrong way when he advocates for the truth but expects us to rely on <em>his</em> research alone for that truth he&#39;s pushing.</p>

<p>Now downvote the Truth away</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to get screenshots of the <em>dozens</em> of books and <em>hundreds</em> of names e.g. Smedley Darlington Butler and the fascist coup financed by ... just watch the fucking film <em>and take note</em>!</p>

<p>IF you <em>really need</em> more &quot;proof&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m certainly not going to bother spoon feeding you snippets of info becoz of your 30 second attention span. Sucks to be you with a 200min+ movie</p>

<p>&quot;what an amazing film, every second, or 11,000 or so of them was fascinating and informative.

<p>Groden was arrested in Dealey Plaza on June 13, 2010 and initially charged with selling magazines under a city ordinance that permits it. When that was pointed out, he was charged with violating an ordinance against selling merchandise in a city park without a permit; Dealey Plaza is under the control of Dallas&#39; Parks and Recreation Department.[3][14] In December 2010, the case was dismissed by a judge who agreed with Groden&#39;s defense that Dealey Plaza was not a city park and that the city neither offers nor requires permits to sell merchandise in parks; the city appealed.[3]</p>

<p>Groden, whose lawyers said that he was arrested without probable cause and that his right to free speech was violated in the process, sued the City of Dallas for $900,000 in &quot;mental anguish,&quot; $100,000 for damages to his reputation, and $1,000 for merchandise that was confiscated.[15] In addition he sued certain police officers for violation of his constitutional rights.[16] The City of Dallas filed a motion to dismiss which the court subsequently granted on the basis that Groden failed to adequately plead his case against the city.[16] The suit against one of the police officers proceeded to trial.[16]</p>

<p>On June 12, 2014, jurors deliberated for an hour and returned with a verdict stating that the arresting officer&#39;s actions did not violate Groden&#39;s constitutional rights.[15] Groden&#39;s attorney claimed that the jury indicated they did not want to punish the officer for a crime committed by the city and asked why the city was not a defendant.[17]</p>

<p>In October 2014, Groden filed a motion in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas requesting for the dismissal order be vacated and he be granted a new trial against both the City of Dallas and the police officer.[16] The Court denied the motion by stating that Groden failed to remedy the early deficiencies in his claims against the City.[16]</p>

<p>Groden successfully appealed the dismissal of his lawsuit against the City of Dallas. In June 2016, the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court&#39;s dismissal and remanded the case to continue against the city.[18] Groden&#39;s Monell claim was allowed to be pursued. The Appeals Court permitted the police officer&#39;s ruling to stand.</p>

<p>Authoritarian communism vs authoritarian capitalism both are fascist/dictatorships.</p>

<p>We just had a democratic presidential primary where they got rid of 
hundreds of thousands of registered democrat voters to try and usher in Clinton to the general. The jurisdictions even admit that it happened.</p>

<p>No prosecution or outrage in the &#39;news&#39; at all.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t do a damn thing anymore in the United States without a fkn license. Try to build a house without a contractors license in any decent sized city. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t even get a job washing peoples hair in a beauty salon WITHOUT A LICENSE.</p>

<p>The POTUS has been a target to divert attention from the military welfare complex since at least Eisenhower was in office.</p>

<p>You can do anything you want in the United States except supersede TPTB....unless you let them in early to profit from what you have built.</p>
