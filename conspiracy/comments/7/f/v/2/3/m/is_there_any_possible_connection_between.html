        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I saw an article today that says Leah Remini believes the LAPD is in some way being influenced by Scientologists. </p>

<p><a href="https://newsnow360.com/leah-remini-believes-lapd-covering-scientologists-like-danny-masterson/">https://newsnow360.com/leah-remini-believes-lapd-covering-scientologists-like-danny-masterson/</a></p>

<p>Now I&#39;m wondering, after all the hugely negative press about Scientology over the past few years really started ramping up, is this their way of getting vengeance: revealing all of this horrible information and possibly even encouraging or paying people to come forward? </p>

<p>Scientologists are well known to collect information on their members and likely collect information FROM their members about others as well. The Hollywood connection would likely produce a vast amount of dirt on many celebrities. With so many people being outed left and right, you could almost accuse anyone and make it stick if you have enough accusers. They could be using the huge amount of REAL scandal to fabricate scandal. </p>

<p>The only thing is I can&#39;t seem to find any connection between the celebrities that have so far been outed and any anti-Scientology actions. (Basically all I have is a stupid nonsense theory) But I&#39;d like to hopefully see if anyone else knows of any connections? </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babalon_Working">Basically</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;The Babalon Working was a series of magic ceremonies or rituals performed from January to March, 1946 by author, pioneer rocket-fuel scientist, and occultist Jack Parsons and Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard.[1] This ritual was essentially designed to manifest an individual incarnation of the archetypal divine feminine called Babalon. The project was based on the ideas of Aleister Crowley, and his description of a similar project in his 1917 novel Moonchild.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s not the end of the connections, though. Crowley was controlled by Golden Dawn, an extension of high level British Freemasonry through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatuor_Coronati_Lodge">Quatuor Coronati</a> lodge. He was also a <a href="http://rense.com/general82/crowl.htm">British intelligence asset</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;Referencing documents in British, American, French and Italian archives, Spence discovered that Crowley was connected to the sinking of the Lusitania, a British luxury liner that was torpedoed off of Ireland, killing 1,198 of the people aboard; the sinking turned public opinion in many countries against Germany in World War I. Crowley also helped thwart Irish and Indian nationalist conspiracies, connived with the Communist International and played a murky role in the 1941 flight of Rudolf Hess...</p>

<p>He actively encouraged German aggressiveness, such as the attack on the Lusitania, with the ultimate aim of bringing America into the war. In doing so, &quot;Crowley followed precisely the wishes of Admiral Hall, chief of British Naval Intelligence,&quot; said Spence.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Operation Snow White was a criminal conspiracy by the Church of Scientology during the 1970s to purge unfavorable records about Scientology and its founder, L. Ron Hubbard. This project included a series of infiltrations into and thefts from 136 government agencies, foreign embassies and consulates, as well as private organizations critical of Scientology, carried out by Church members in more than 30 countries.[1] It was one of the largest infiltrations of the United States government in history,[2] with up to 5,000 covert agents&quot;</p>
