        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Lately I&#39;ve been looking into an interesting set of structures in GA.</p>

<p>There are two main sites, Track Rock Gap, and Sandy Creek Park.</p>

<p>In both cases, there are ancient stone terraces and burial cairns that span about two miles in the case of Sandy Creek, and roughly four in the case of Track Rock. So these are pretty large sites, with stone walled structures poking out of the ground that nobody seems to want to excavate.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Track Rock Gap was closed to the public after somebody posted pictures and video of them. The county restricts access, not even TV crews or archaeologists are allowed to visit the site. The local tribes (last I heard) do not take credit for the structures.</p></li>
<li><p>Sandy Creek Park is the polar opposite, anybody can go view and visit the park and, if you veer off of the paths a bit, can view the stone structures very clearly. However, nobody at the park knows anything about them. They aren&#39;t mentioned in the park guides/panphlets. And though they&#39;re consistent with native American farming terraces and stone cairn structures, none of the local tribes take credit for these either.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you&#39;re interested, I got some video of some of the terraces at the park when I went on a trip there:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/HGjW6JibUi4">https://youtu.be/HGjW6JibUi4</a></p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<ul>
<li>Skip to 29:13 for a good shot</li>
<li>Go to 31:40 for a better one.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://onlineathens.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow__640x360/public/11821148.jpg?itok=mOf5dl-V">Here</a> is a picture that I didn&#39;t take</p>

<p>So these sites, and a few others, were clearly made by the same people, but nobody knows who and nobody seems to want anybody to figure out. Not a world-breaking conspiracy, but it&#39;s pretty fishy to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right? I live about 3 hours from the sites but I&#39;m definitely planning on going back.</p>

<p>Some people are saying that the layout of the sites is consistent to Mayan structures. Paired with some other, eerily mayan-esque artifacts found at Mississippian sites it is definitely a fun theory to look into.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what it&#39;s worth, the idea that there was no large scale pre-contact agricultural or monumental architecture north of Mexico isn&#39;t entirely true. These sites are in an area that was inhabited by the Mississippi Culture at around the same time as the Mayans.</p>

<p>Granted, they didn&#39;t build with stone as far as we know, but the structures in the video don&#39;t seem to have been quarried or shaped, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s outside the realm of possibility that they could be associated with the Mississippi Culture.</p>

<p>I also wouldn&#39;t discount the possibility that these are actually the result of post-colonial farming. It can be surprising how quickly structures can be reclaimed by the wilderness, and the shots in the video do remind me of field boundaries that show up around Europe.
You might be able to find old maps or documents showing land grants in the area, just to be sure.</p>

<p>Really interesting though. I&#39;ll definitely be reading more on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent point. The idea that they&#39;re Mississippian is definitely a possibility, but yeah as you said it isn&#39;t typical of them to make structures like this.</p>

<p>And they <em>could</em> be post-colonial. There would have to be another explanation for the stone cairns in that case.</p>

<p>I personally believe they were made by an as yet unrecognized native American culture, but anything is possible. Glad I could pique your interest!</p>

<p>His idea is basically that these pre-contact Mound Builders were Canaanite refugees, linked to the Phoenician empire. Fleeing from Hebrews and Kassites and Elamites and Greeks alike.</p>

<p>There is hard evidence of ancient copper mining in Michigan and similar areas, some of the copper found in Canaan HAS North American metallurgy!!! Lots to look into.</p>

<p>They also say &quot;See whom you cannot criticize to see who rules you&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Among the more popular misconceptions were those holding that the first residents of the continent had been members of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel or refugees from the lost island of Atlantis, that their descendents had developed the so-called Mound Builder culture, and that Native Americans had later overrun and destroyed the Mound Builder civilization. <strong>These erroneous and overtly racist beliefs were often used to rationalize the destruction or displacement of indigenous Americans.</strong> Such beliefs were not dispelled until the 1890s, when Cyrus Thomas, a pioneering archaeologist employed by the Smithsonian Institution, demonstrated conclusively that the great effigy mounds, burial mounds, and temple mounds of the Northeast and Southeast culture areas had been built by Native Americans.</p>

<p>BTW, now would be the beginning of a good period for one of these: <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;amp;_sacat=0&amp;amp;_nkw=drone+with+camera&amp;amp;_sop=15">https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;amp;_sacat=0&amp;amp;_nkw=drone+with+camera&amp;amp;_sop=15</a></p>

<p>You may also want to google for the county&#39;s, or countys&#39;, GIS website[s]. Sometimes they have better and/or different satellite imagery than the various map sites. USGS might be a good place to look, too.</p>

<p>Keep us posted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  The Creek/Muscogee [Mississippian] and Cherokee [Iroquoian] legends speak of white-haired and red-haired giants, respectively. 
I tend to believe the Solutrean hypothesis and do also entertain the possibilities of many migrations from Europe, The Mediterranean, and Near East. I think the possibility of widespread prehistoric contact and trade are reasonable  - and the prospect of a worldwide or near-worldwide culture further back in antiquity is well-considered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is the conspiracy? Nature takes back terraces pretty quickly, there&#39;s some really good documentaries of it.</p>

<p>I watched the video and I don&#39;t see anything sinister or why the government would &quot;cover&quot; it up. I don&#39;t understand how it&#39;s even a &quot;cover-up&quot; since anybody can go there.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just confused on what the conspiracy theory even is?</p>

<p>The U.S. government killed a ton of native americans and covered up their farming terrace? We already know about that against tons of tribes.</p>

<p>Can someone explain anything I missed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I may not have given a great amount of context within the video, so that might have been my fault.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know <em>why</em>, but there&#39;s lots of odd things surrounding Sandy Creek and especially at Track Rock. Mostly the track rock site, but obviously I can&#39;t film a video where I walk through that one because it&#39;s off limits.</p>

<p>So it begins with a man named Richard Thornton. In I think like 2012 he had been studying these sites and had developed a theory/timeline that suggests that the Mayans may have had a presence in North America.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a new theory, but he was the first to try to prove it to the acedemics</p>

<p>So he publishes it and is immediately assblasted by acedemics for it.</p>

<p>With his publication he uses photo and video evidence that he had taken at Track Rock to show the layout, stone cairns, and terraces.</p>

<p>Well after it&#39;s published, the county blocks access to the site. They don&#39;t say why, and it isn&#39;t connected to any native American Spirituak grounds or anything.</p>

<p>Now, here is my personal theory..</p>

<p>The Sandy Creek site was already a park open to the public during all of this, so they can&#39;t block it off.</p>

<p>So they did the opposite, they ignored it.</p>

<p>However, there are sections of the park that are blocked by heavy barbed wire. Those sections just happen to  contain the best preserved examples of terraces, and the Acropolis of the entire complex.</p>

<p>But if you look up &quot;track rock&quot; it&#39;ll take you to a rock on the side of the road, the track rock site is in the forest southeast of the rock if I remember correctly. I&#39;ve never been there though.</p>

<p>No but they&#39;re about an hour&#39;s drive from the Guidestones. I&#39;ve visited both and it was something like 46 minutes. Sandy Creek Park is right above Athens.</p>
