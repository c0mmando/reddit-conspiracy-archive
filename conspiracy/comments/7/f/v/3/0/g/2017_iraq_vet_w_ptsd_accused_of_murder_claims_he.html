<p>The suspect asked for help with PTSD in 2012. Instead, military police officers arrested him and he was put in a mental hospital, said his former sergeant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, is launching a $70 million program to help military personnel with psychiatric disorders using electronic devices implanted in the brain. The goal ... is to develop new ways of treating problems including depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, all of which are common among service members who fought in Iraq or Afghanistan.</p>

<p>This is the soft police state.  They are gearing up to take care of any enemy the establishment wants to paint as bad guys.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How so? <em>Nosedive</em> is basically going on right now. In many ways, <em>Men Against Fire</em> is also occurring now (soldiers only think they know their enemy). <em>San Junipero</em> is just a sweet concept. <em>Shut Up and Dance</em> is also going on now (blackmailing by getting hacked). <em>Playtest</em> is scary as hell. Basically felt like a new age Tales from the Crypt. Looking back at them now Season 2 wasn&#39;t bad. I guess it was mainly Season 1 I didn&#39;t like at all. Felt drab and too British I guess. </p>

<p>There&#39;s more to this story than is being portrayed. </p>

<p>In the military even a command directed metal health screen takes at least a week. Non command directed takes about 6 weeks. Getting him admitted is the fastest way to get a mentAL health screening and that can only be done on a doctor&#39;s orders. </p>

<p>I was military police. The army had a lot of failings for a long time with mental health but using your ptsd as an excuse for murder is laughable. I have 70% disability for ptsd people use it as a cop out.</p>

I’m not saying he used his ptsd as an excuse, I see it more like  symptom. Then again there isn’t a whole lot of information out there other than what the MSM is giving us. And maybe they’re trying to work the dangerous veteran with PTSD angle. 
The vets I know (husband included) have said they could never really get the help they need for fear of being locked away in a mental institution. </p>

I&#39;m not here to create, or even myself, go on a gun control debate rant here.

    <div class="md"><p>The 19974hz you see is clearly not a natural signal. It is a signal used in the biological frequency region for brain entrainment. Once a target is entrained to a computer or human to computer to human, the interface is established. This interface can read biorelevant feedback at attempts at behavioral modification, neurolinguistic programming, learned helplessness sadistic torture, and a resurgence of MKUltra/test pilot of Neurolink.</p>

<p>The stupid motherfuckers trot around playing demi-human selecting human subjects without consent barbarically ultrasound ablationing and microwave lesioning people’s brains.</p>

<p>Some of it is for pleasure derived from being a sadist. Some of it is at “feigned” rehabilitation. Some of it is a transhumanism movement. Some of it is just the boot stopping the populace.</p>

<p>It is real measurable and there are whistleblowers. The technology exists. There are patents.</p>

<p>Sleep is a privilege.
<a href="http://www.biggerthansnowden.com">http://www.biggerthansnowden.com</a></p>

<p>I have had good experiences with operators, but mostly bad ones. I am surprised I’m still alive. I am just starting to sleep good again. The dick bags play good cop/bad cop and use inconsistent operant conditioning depending on their mood is, too pretty much mind rape individuals. If this is a just world, they would spend a couple years in solitary confinement for the psychosis they attempt to induce.</p>

<p>Some people claim it is alien technology. Others say it is an artificial generalized intelligence. It could be but I am not sold. It is advanced enough for synthetic telepathy and other sensory somatic phenomenalism (Scents, sounds, images). If I had to wager a guess it is a hybridized system, part toaster, occasional man in the loop. Essentially old mind control techniques on steroids. Hypnotic cues as well as cognitive disruption with ones own natural bio signatures laced with suggestion.</p>

<p>The fact that they have to buy into one’s internal semantics informs me they have already lost, even I don’t do that all the time. Psychology is riddled with paralogical musings.</p>

<p>What is a man, but a pile of lies?</p>

<p>Essentially a multimillion or billion dollar waste of money, time and effort, if the goal was objective.</p>
