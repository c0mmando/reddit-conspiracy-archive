       I don't invest in most conspiracies until I have researched and obtained enough information to choose whether I believe it to be to true or not. I recently started to watch some television (basic channels as well as Netflix). I have lived without watching programmed television for years relying solely on my movie collection. I have watched a handful of shows and aside from an almost instant headache from the commercials I have noticed intensely dark messages if not subliminal incentives.
      </p>
      <p>
       In several shows I have watched weird content geared towards children, a clearly "dumbed down" version of dialoge, cut scenes every six seconds or less ( at a constant rate) to the extent where by the time a commercial comes on my pulse feels irregular and my mind cluttered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Years ago I enjoyed watching SNL with my parents but the last few episodes I've watched have been creepy. The last episode I watched was with the infamous molesting robot the Rock built, and I just stumbled upon this in my suggested videos. It's basically a mock of 70s porn but the exaggerated pizza references and the odd unnecessary involvement of a kid being present is crazy. I didn't know what to make of the pizza discussions and which rabbit holes have truth burried in them but this is too much of a coincidence.

       There's been at least a few Weinstein jokes on SNL, in the cold open, sketches and Weekend Update. There was a whole sketch about Hollywood sexual harassment that directly addressed Weinstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, don't forget Trump hosted the show. Hillary only did a walk-on.

       So they cut jokes that fell flat during dress rehearsal (this happens every week) on one episode, but have covered Weinstein several times since.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watch the show, and I've seen the jokes. They are in no way "refusing" to joke about Weinstein.

       I watch the show, and they did give him a "pass" intentionally cause "he is from new york" (lorne's words not mine)  they only had to start taking about all that cause the backash did not stop, and even then they are always like: but but but the president too, weinstein and the president, 4 abusers one is the president etc

       Me neither, and I pretty much watch every week. I think SNL is stepping very, very lightly on these eggshells right now, because the risk of blowback. I'm also sure that there are plenty of skeletons hanging around the closets of Studio 8H. I think it's next to impossible to have a show for over four decades (especially a late night one fueled by drugs early on) without some bad things behind the scenes.

       They did go after Franken which I found notable since he was on the SNL staff from the very beginning.

       Yeah, they did joke on Franken on the show and a bunch of alums released that

       I hear you regarding Lorne. I feel like he was fairly even-handed during last year's election (despite most of the writers and cast being obviously anti-Trump and pro-Hillary). After all, Trump hosted, Hillary and Bernie were guests and he even gave Ted Cruz
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3hB3iOQKjY">
        that weird commercial parody
       </a>
       after he bitched about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things are so crazy right now that I feel like no new revelations would surprise me anymore, but yeah, I hope Lorne is clean.

       My husband and I just watched 'Inglorious Basterds' ( been ages since I've seen newer films) and it eerily lined up with my researched beliefs that aside from our own government giving immunity to actual Nazi scientists for information, that also we were fed lies regarding most aspects of history.

       We had guys like Jack Parsens who openly mentored under Aliester Crowley and, behind closed doors, made the Nazis look like teddy bears. I'll take Von Braun over

       You should watch The Punisher series on Netflix, it talks about the reason why many soldiers come with PTSD built right into them when coming back because of what they had to do and what they are still doing in Afghanistan, and the conspiracy covering the opioid that the US is supposedly protecting there. It's a pretty sick in your face story.

       I'd like to echo this comment and say aside from Bojack Horseman(seriously some of the most wicked anti-Hollywood jokes in cartoon form) the Punisher is one of the more legit Netflix originals I've watched. The CIA-opiod connection is fairly on the nose and the general pattern of higher up government officials using lower pawns to climb their ladder or remain in power is represented here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really enjoyed
       <em>
        slight spoiler
       </em>
       the later episode where a sleazy pro gun control  New York senator uses a bombing to try and push his agenda, meanwhile he hires armed mercenaries to protect his life against said bomber. It isn't just happenstance but multiple characters point out the irony, including a sympathetic journalist who also conceal carries which the show also makes a point about. I can't comment much on source Punisher as I don't watch or read much comic book anything, but it's worthy imo

       lol I had a feeling that maybe "pedophile" in this instance was being used in place of the more accurate "homosexual." I've noticed that a LOT of latent homophobia seems to come out among Pedogate acolytes. I mean pedophilia is obviously incredibly fucked up and should be stopped wherever it is happening, but when you read between the lines of some of these people's thinking, it's obvious that a lot are sort of lumping homosexuality in with pedophilia as unnatural, despicable, evil, etc.

       Practicing Jews, a miniscule minority, fear God and the Day of Judgment. Non-practicing Jews think only about the material world, and believe the False Messiah/Antichrist/Dajjal will give them their Paradise on Earth. Non-practicing Jews deal in usury and consider all non-Jews to be inferior beings put on Earth to serve them. There is indeed a difference between practicing and non-practicing Jews, just as there is a difference between practicing and non-practicing Christians, and practicing and non-practicing Muslims.

       Not sure if you are insinuating I am a troll or not. I'm genuinely concerned about the intense shift in television content that I am used to.

      <p>
       As far as the pizza thing,  I am weary whether or not to believe that it is a legitimate code for the true crisis or blatant paedophilia or just that the horrendous crime is finally being noticed. I am fully aware that this crime has been ignored for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think adding 'gate' to every crime helps shed light on these acts but it doesn't mean I am not seeing it.

       I've read the first three books over the years and it's set in a dystopian type world so the movie would make sense to be depressing. Books were decent but not my favorite Stephen King of even close, haven't seen a trailer of the movie but will watch if it comes to hulu.

       I mean SNL has always attempted to keep up with the times. I'll bet some skits from the 1970s would be deemed as extremely sexist or racist based on our what we see today.

       Eh.... SNL is considered EXTREMELY hit or miss, but it's basically an institution at this point, over 40 years. The above sketch is pretty much a miss.

       Okay, I'll tell you that: Half the featured videos aren't black guys with white girls or weird step family incest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Out of the 46 featured videos on Pornhub's front page right now,
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/aaBOv">
        4 videos match your description
       </a>
       (image is strongly
       <strong>
        NSFW
       </strong>
       ), or 8.7%.
      </p>
      <p>
       So i'm telling you that half the featured videos aren't black guys with white girls or weird step family incest.

       No that's just the conclusion youre jumping to because you want to justify your own racist inclinations. There is a serious effort to fuck over white people. 1. Tell whites they shouldn't breed. 2. Tell whites even their babies are racist. 3. Tell whites they should race mix or their racist. 4. White genocide is real 5. I'm not racist but i believe 1-4 whole heartedly. 6. I have an asian girlfriend and probably won't date another white lady in my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go cry your victim complex social injustice faggotry somewhere else. You don't get to come to the conspiracy sub and call racism on someone discussing white genocide. You fucking troll.

       But you

       bigot, though. Your comments and comment history are not ambiguous in that respect. Why not just be a man and own it? If it's what you believe, it's what you believe. Sack up. Stop talking out of both sides of your mouth. Stop trying to dance around what you are. Say "fuck yeah, I'm a bigot and I'm not going to apologize for it." Any else just shows what a weak person you are.

       He is just all sorts of fucked up. Uncomfortable when a black man dates a white girl. Probably because he is insecure. And is so insecure he cant handle dating white woman anymore, so he stereo typically goes for what he probably believes is the more docile and submissive Asian woman.

       Like added shapes into his backgrounds. Like the scene in
       <em>
        The Shining
       </em>
       when JN is interviewing for the job. There's a lot of white space behind his shoulders, meant to be foreshadowing/building tension. When watching the remastered version on broadcast, like in the fall of 2015, you can see digital manipulation of the background

       That's intentional. The rapid cuts are more prone to make you watch, for 'fun' count how fast they are and then watch a show from 30 years ago.
      </p>

       From what I understand the cut scenes are timed to grab our maximum attention and make sure our eyes don't wander away...

       A few weeks back, I decided to watch Mr. Robot on TV instead of downloading it commercial free, like I always do. I wanted to get a feel for the climate that most people are exposed to, and was just as creeped out. During the show, an Ecoin commercial aired as a legit commercial, and when there was strangely no substance within it, I realized that it's fake. So now they're airing fake commercials based off fantasy elements in what's playing? That really gave me the chills.

       I also noticed a few ads for the Mars One mission, even an HP commercial advocating it. So that verified for me, that there's an agenda behind it, programming us to believe in the mission. My friend keeps talking about wanting to live on Mars, and since I'm so disconnected from the mainstream, I've wondered where he's getting that idea from. Now it all makes sense.

       I know exactly what you mean about the massive increase in cut scenes. I've always been a fan of atmospheric movies / shows, a slow reveal, smooth camera movements, etc, but everything seems quicker these days. We have all these quirky / funny shows now, parody on top of parody, with what seems like ADD camera movements. I agree with you, it's very disorienting / unnerving, and am glad someone else brought that up. It could just be a reflection of our current culture, maybe it's deliberate, or maybe it's both.

       Interracial dating isn't propaganda, it's reality. Society progresses and we're not going to go back to the 50's mindset.

       You need to wake up from your backwards thinking. Skin color is a few millimeters on the outside of our bodies. Inside we're all the same.

       People actively try and push racial divides in our country.

       That's controlling.  And you're losing to it.

       For me, I can't watch the talk shows, morning shows, or anything like that without noticing constant instances of propaganda. Its funny how you never notice it until you realize what messages they are trying to push. Then you see them subtly shoehorn those messages in, often regardless of context.

       Don't forget the gay agenda. Also there is a constant state of degeneration on most sitcoms. They're trying to make people have zero morals.

       I've read the first three books over the years and it's set in a dystopian type world so the movie would make sense to be depressing. Books were decent but not my favorite Stephen King of even close, haven't seen a trailer of the movie but will watch if it comes to hulu.

       Practicing Jews, a miniscule minority, fear God and the Day of Judgment. Non-practicing Jews think only about the material world, and believe the False Messiah/Antichrist/Dajjal will give them their Paradise on Earth. Non-practicing Jews deal in usury and consider all non-Jews to be inferior beings put on Earth to serve them. There is indeed a difference between practicing and non-practicing Jews, just as there is a difference between practicing and non-practicing Christians, and practicing and non-practicing Muslims.
