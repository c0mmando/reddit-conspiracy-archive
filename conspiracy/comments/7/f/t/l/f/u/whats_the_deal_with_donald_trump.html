I personally believe he is simply because during his election and to this day it looks like the power structure is against him. I want to know what you think of him. Is he just another shill or controlled figure?</p>

<p>Some would say that if your fighting something that big behind the scenes its going to take awhile. He also seems to have surrounded himself with many military members. Idk hit me with your theories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Culture shift. Constantly portraying Trump as a harassing misogynist (whether justified or not) has stirred up many intense feelings in people, particularly women. Since the removal of Trump is a difficult option, all that anger has spread out to other men, many of whom truly deserve to have their actions revealed and publicized (Weinstein, etc). </p>

<p>Another way to think about it: if Hillary Clinton was in the White House would we be going after and talking about these predators or would we (and especially the media) all be circle jerking and glad handing ourselves over how progressive the nation is and how women have truly &quot;made it?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yup</p>

<p>now let&#39;s remember jews started the Christian religion in the first place, so why is Catholicism centered in rome, not Judea where jesus was from, it was all a scam so jews could take over the roman empire. back in the day the jews had many wars with the romans, well guess who finally won. This is THE conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>Jews also run the mafia and Masonry which have ties to this bank.</p>

<p>why are the official bodyguards for the pope from Switzerland. why not from Italy. Similar to how the Fed Reserve&#39;s secret service protect the president. Really they are watching over them and keeping them line line and assassinating them if they do get out of line. Switzerland is a Rothschild HQ. </p>

<p>Are you going to pretend that all</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, no I&#39;m not, nor did I and hence why I clearly used words like &quot;majority&quot; and &quot;most&quot; and not the word &quot;all&quot;. </p>

<p>I&#39;m well aware of Trumps supporters. I&#39;m also well aware that the majority of media coverage, social media comments, and particularly the international opinion of your average European citizen is a very negative one in regards to the man. You don&#39;t seem to want to admit that.</p>

<p>And using &quot;look at how much the powerful human rights crushing elites of China love Trump&quot; as evidence the man is beloved internationally or something is disingenuous at best. Political leaders across the globe have come out to publicly deride the man on a scale I&#39;ve never seen in my life (including China who have blasted Trump publicly multiple times). </p>

<p>The man has absolutely negatively impacted the global perception of our country since coming into office. He insults world leaders over Twitter for God&#39;s sake, displaying the maturity of a sixteen year old boy on 4chan. That does not help our image as a nation whatsoever in the eyes of the world. It makes us look like impetulant children. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I will agree with you that Trump&#39;s fluctuations make it hard to see what his true intentions (and therefore the long-term implications) are, I think pulling out of the TPP was the absolute best thing he&#39;s done so far for the future of the U.S. economy. I would also say that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to characterize his administration&#39;s approach as completely isolationist and protectionist, as he favors bilateral trade deals over multi-national mega &quot;free trade&quot; agreements like TPP or NAFTA (and frankly so do I). </p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing about this man that should lead any sane person to conclude he is a genuinely good person.
