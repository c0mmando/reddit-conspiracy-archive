       Is he legit or not? I personally believe he is simply because during his election and to this day it looks like the power structure is against him. I want to know what you think of him. Is he just another shill or controlled figure?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some would say that if your fighting something that big behind the scenes its going to take awhile. He also seems to have surrounded himself with many military members. Idk hit me with your theories.

       I would say he has some selfish beliefs but is definitely not a shill. The entire establishment, left and right, wanted him gone from day 1. He has likely changed politics as we know it.

      <p>
       One thing I know for sure, had he not won, Harvey Weinstein would still be raping everyone in Hollywood. And we are only in year 1.

       Culture shift. Constantly portraying Trump as a harassing misogynist (whether justified or not) has stirred up many intense feelings in people, particularly women. Since the removal of Trump is a difficult option, all that anger has spread out to other men, many of whom truly deserve to have their actions revealed and publicized (Weinstein, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       Another way to think about it: if Hillary Clinton was in the White House would we be going after and talking about these predators or would we (and especially the media) all be circle jerking and glad handing ourselves over how progressive the nation is and how women have truly "made it?"

       I didn't say he deserves praise for that, and I wouldn't say that it wasn't something that he set out to do. I am saying that the election of President Trump has been an intense wake up call for many sleeping Americans on a multitude of issues. Maybe the "pussy grabbing" video would have been enough, maybe not. I think it's safe to say that we wouldn't have had an enormous women's march right after Hillary was sworn in, though.

       Yup this is something you can't ignore. Believe it or not Alex Jones (here come the down votes) began saying not too long after he was elected to watch for this to happen because Trump would back and give the greenlight to law enforcement. Not sure if he was the first to say it though.

       He is working for the Zionists with Rupert Murdoch, Goldman Sachs etc. Just a different flavour of TPTB. Ultimately controlled by the Rothschild's just like Hillary. He gave his daughter to Israel through Kushner and he has provided the blackmail material to Epstein and Maxwell(probably Robert as he is old school).

       Carl Rothschild, head of the bank in Naples, was invited in for a private audience with the Pope. There Gregory XVI awarded him the ribbon and star of the newly established Order of St. George...the Jewish banker was permitted to kiss the Pope's hand, rather than his foot, as was customary..

       yup
      </p>
      <p>
       now let's remember jews started the Christian religion in the first place, so why is Catholicism centered in rome, not Judea where jesus was from, it was all a scam so jews could take over the roman empire. back in the day the jews had many wars with the romans, well guess who finally won. This is THE conspiracy theory.

       Jews also run the mafia and Masonry which have ties to this bank.

       why are the official bodyguards for the pope from Switzerland. why not from Italy. Similar to how the Fed Reserve's secret service protect the president. Really they are watching over them and keeping them line line and assassinating them if they do get out of line. Switzerland is a Rothschild HQ.

       No, it doesn't. Are you really going to pretend that globally the majority opinion of Trump is a positive one?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean I guess it wouldn't surprise me, you have to live in a sheltered fantasy world to not notice that Trump is the butt of every joke in a way Obama and no other president, even Clinton during the Lewinsky scandal, has ever been.
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans in general took a pretty big credibility hit in the eyes of the global community with the election of Trump. People genuinely are bewildered that we would elect someone so blatantly stupid and egomaniacal.

       No, no I'm not, nor did I and hence why I clearly used words like "majority" and "most" and not the word "all".
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm well aware of Trumps supporters. I'm also well aware that the majority of media coverage, social media comments, and particularly the international opinion of your average European citizen is a very negative one in regards to the man. You don't seem to want to admit that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And using "look at how much the powerful human rights crushing elites of China love Trump" as evidence the man is beloved internationally or something is disingenuous at best. Political leaders across the globe have come out to publicly deride the man on a scale I've never seen in my life (including China who have blasted Trump publicly multiple times).
      </p>
      <p>
       The man has absolutely negatively impacted the global perception of our country since coming into office. He insults world leaders over Twitter for God's sake, displaying the maturity of a sixteen year old boy on 4chan. That does not help our image as a nation whatsoever in the eyes of the world. It makes us look like impetulant children.

       I do know that the Clinton /Bush cartel have been far more destructive to the world over the years. I am willing to see what plays  out here. I hated Drumpfhh whenever Seth McFarlane Roasted him and thought he was a joke of UUUgee proportions but after seeing real evernts and listening to him I think very differently. He maybe killed or change the world .. I would like the latter.

       While I will agree with you that Trump's fluctuations make it hard to see what his true intentions (and therefore the long-term implications) are, I think pulling out of the TPP was the absolute best thing he's done so far for the future of the U.S. economy. I would also say that I don't think it's fair to characterize his administration's approach as completely isolationist and protectionist, as he favors bilateral trade deals over multi-national mega "free trade" agreements like TPP or NAFTA (and frankly so do I).

       I would disagree with that on face, simply because the TPP was never enacted. There are many ways to exert influence, I personally don't think large multinational trade agreements are the best way.

       "Genuinely good person".
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on what? Because the evidence of his actions and words fall firmly into "scumbag" 99 out of 100 times. He doesn't give a fuck about anything but himself and his ego, and how anyone could think otherwise is beyond me. Do you not listen to the words that come out of his mouth?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's nothing about this man that should lead any sane person to conclude he is a genuinely good person. His actions through out his entire life vividly paint the picture of a greedy, stupid narcissist who exploits and fucks over anyone he can for his own selfish reasons. His track record of immorality is so long you'd have to live under a rock to ignore it.

       Find me a speech of his where he explains how he wants the best for his country. Saying “Make America Great Again” does not count. Show me things he’s done to improve the overall wellbeing of his country. Is making Betsy Devos the Secretary of Education the action of someone who wants the best for their country?

       He doesn't run shit he does what the military tells him to do. You could call them white hats if you wanna buy into that line but he is mostly controlled by the us Military, I think they plan on throwing him under the bus when the time is right.

       Trump is a puppet of the internationalist oligarchy and Zionist Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       That should be painfully clear at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who believed the Trump bullshit about America first or national interests or "draining the swamp" was played for fools. But given the demographic makeup of this group, it isn't the first time they were played for fools.

       If it wasn't serious, it would be funny. A Russian rent-boy and an American reality television clown played the Republican Party and all they Republicans can do is double down on supporting an admitted pedophile in Alabama.

       While I will agree with you that Trump's fluctuations make it hard to see what his true intentions (and therefore the long-term implications) are, I think pulling out of the TPP was the absolute best thing he's done so far for the future of the U.S. economy. I would also say that I don't think it's fair to characterize his administration's approach as completely isolationist and protectionist, as he favors bilateral trade deals over multi-national mega "free trade" agreements like TPP or NAFTA (and frankly so do I).
