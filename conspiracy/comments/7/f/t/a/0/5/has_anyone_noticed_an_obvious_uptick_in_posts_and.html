    <div class="md"><p>I think it’s good the topic is being discussed because it’s recent and relevant partly do to the fact of forcing registration of overseas news as foreign agents. </p>

<p>Since I’ve being hearing a Little here and there about this online and on the radio, can anybody explain why they think it’s better to have Russia as an enemy rather than ally (besides the communism before)?
I understand all the “election interference/collusion” allegations would cause some people to be against them over that (whether or not they’re true has yet to be determined/proved IMO), the Cold War era, and the effect the USSR &amp; communism had on Eastern Europe before it was resolved. </p>

<p>Honest question, id like to hear both sides of the fence on this one if anyone would like to enlighten me, but besides whether you believe the collusion/interference allegations, and older folks prejudice having lived through the Cold War being told they are the enemy their whole life, what is the benefit of making them “the bad guy/enemy of the year” instead of a better ally &amp; strengthening relations?
Considering their power in that side of the world among other things, to me at least thinking objectively, you’d think our country would be better off with more allies &amp; good relations instead of more enemies and the tit for tat thats been going on. </p>

<p>During the 80’s in the Middle East, we were arming the Afghanis to fight the Russians in a proxy war to prevent spread of communism and reduce their influence/drive them out of the Middle East which seemed like a clear objective. Fast forward 10-20yrs &amp; the people we armed and financed to fight a proxy war are killing our soldiers with some of our own weapons &amp; ordinance, bought and paid for by the U.S., so they’re the enemy now. </p>

<p>With everything going on especially at this day In age, to me it seems hard to differentiate between friend or foe since it seems everybody is screwing everybody in one way or another even if they’re allies with good relations. I also think there’s something to be thought about as far as how in the U.S. it always appears we are the good and everyone else is the bad and the ugly, also that the politicians are always telling us who we should be against/who the enemy is according to their agenda. I would think their working with the Assad regime in Syria is a reason some would say is why they don’t like them. Then again the U.S. always decides its our duty to police the world and that we are always on the good side and in no way capable of doing the horrible things other countries do that we use as a reason to send troops in. I see how people could think there’s something going on with Trump being Friendly with Putin and erring on the side of better relations on policies that apply to Russia. I don’t believe we should take shit off of any other country but it keeps looking more and more like tptb are pushing us towards WW3 and perpetual war, they can’t get enough of endless cash flow from the military industrial complex. </p>

<p>Didn’t mean to get that long winded I apologize.</p>

<p>Tldr: What are the advantages to having Russia as a frenemy/foe as opposed to a strong ally? What are the disadvantages of having a good relationship with Russia thats mutually beneficial for both countries? 
There will always be conflict and we must defend ourselves when necessary. I’m not about to sit around a campfire and sing Kumbya, but wouldn’t humanity be much better off and more advanced if we tried to make more allies than enemies?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Historically, conflicts between the U.S. and Russia have been utter bullshit. Hypothetically, of course you&#39;d want to get along and work together where you can, and I hope we will once both countries stop breathing down the other&#39;s neck.</p>

<p>Putin&#39;s regime is a different story. The guy really is ex-KGB/director of the FSB, rose to power through what really may have been false flag attacks and a manufactured war, integrated the mob into the national infrastructure (according to investigators and diplomatic leaked cables, via WikiLeaks in &#39;10), consulated control of the media, schemed his way into seizing Crimea, likely murdered political opponents and dissident journalists, rigged elections, etc. </p>

<p>Not that Putin (18 years in power so far) or the current Russian government are very unique among global players-- they&#39;ve done the same type of shit the US deep state has done. Which is why I trust neither, hence a whole lot of nuance and confusion are inevitable.</p>

<p>Well? Russia defended a political takeover by Soros lackeys in Ukraine. Defends Syria&#39;s right to rule itself. and banned the corrupt Rothschild&#39;s from operating in Russia.</p>

<p>So exactly why is Russia bad? It seems to me like Russia under Putin&#39;s leadership is fighting against the corruption in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IDK, I think it&#39;s beneficial for Russia that the US has a strong and free nation.</p>

<p>I also can&#39;t help but think that a lot of the current red scare is driven by the fact that Russia is primarily a white Christian nation.  For instance, I&#39;ve found that most people in the US are surprised to find that the Kremlin is surrounded by seven very beautiful churches.  That has to have something to do with the anti-Russia sentiment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a question. Is America good? Are US news outlets truthful? </p>

<p>RT gives opposing side to US propaganda. The truth is usually somewhere in the middle. Without the opposing side everything leans towards US propaganda.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here it is, I read the enemies propaganda, the liberals.. See, in this country, there isn&#39;t one view, but more than one.. I don&#39;t look too Russia to tell me what is good. It makes me sad that conservative talking points are being pushed by Russia.</p>

<p>Why? Because I haven&#39;t subscribed to &quot;Russia good&quot;. I read everything am I&#39;m not left wanting for what Russia thinks. Hmm.. weird that. I give zero fucks what Russians think about Americans. Fuck you, prove you&#39;re an American or GTFO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a very honest response. But in my country (America) there&#39;s already two sides that chime in on what they want and don&#39;t want.. it&#39;s biased, sure.

    <div class="md"><p>RT does a better job of covering Americas war crimes than Fox/CNN/MSNBC.  The MSM has different views on certain topics but none ever takes an honest look at the horror and destruction caused around the world.  Not that you need to rely on RT for that, there are some good freelance journos out there on a variety of different platforms, it&#39;s just that their stories never really get pushed hard by the American MSM (which is propaganda through omission).  RT is a fucking joke though if you want to learn about what&#39;s happening in Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just the opposite. </p>

<p>For the most part I don&#39;t know anyone who really dislikes Russia. For the most part people are fond of the nation and would rather be allies then enemies. </p>

<p>What I <em>HAVE</em> seen in the last year is a lot of political propaganda trying to make Russia out to be evil, and a lot of people bashing anyone who questions it. </p>

<p>Look, they are a giant nation with a lot of power. They do things that are fucked up. But so does the USA. And so does almost every nation. </p>

<p>Russia hasn&#39;t done anything out of the norm for a nation, and they have been decent allies to us. </p>

<p>To me the &quot;Conspiracy&quot; is the hate. Not the people defending them. </p>

<p>I have an open mind and I will question shit they do. But the insane amount of hate seems a bit unwarranted. </p>

<p>&quot;It is easy to hate and it is difficult to love. This is how the whole scheme of things works. All good things are difficult to achieve; and bad things are very easy to get.&quot;</p>
