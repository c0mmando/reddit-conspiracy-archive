<p>Maybe he has connections with people who do monitoring of some type..or is in the business himself.</p>

The argentine navy wants to keep families hopes alive they&#39;ll find the sub in time because random &quot;explosion&quot; is not definitively from the sub.

<p>The Vienna-based agency, which has monitoring stations equipped with devices including underwater microphones that scan the oceans for sound waves, said in a statement that two of its stations had detected an unusual signal near where the submarine went missing. <strong>The agency was more guarded about whether that was caused by an explosion.</strong></p>

<p>An <em>implosion</em> could be the cause of the &quot;unusual sound&quot;.... an implosion like that generated by a submarine sinking below its crush depth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On day 1 the explosion was mentioned. Really wish I could remember the source I read it on but it was absolutely being reported initially. However it was originally dismissed as something else (and no I&#39;m not confusing this with the Marine noises of whales or whatever that they also noted)</p>

<p>My best guess is they wrote it off in hopes of still finding the sub and it&#39;s remains (maybe because of information on the sub, possibly Falklands related?) But now that there&#39;s no hope in their air supply lasting long enough their confirming it was an explosion so that they can get the families out of the base and moving on</p>
