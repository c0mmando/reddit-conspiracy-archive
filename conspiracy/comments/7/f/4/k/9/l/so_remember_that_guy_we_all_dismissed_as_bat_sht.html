       At least a few of the wars in the middle east and Africa are between factions paid and trained by Russians verses ones paid and trained by Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       We haven't been at war with each other, that would destabilize us too much. But paying the locals to fight for the right to be exploited is much safer.

       The us and Russia have been in an intelligence war since 1944. It never stopped the people just forgot about it after the soview union collapsed.

       That's why Trump Jr meeting with what he thought was a Russian government official to obtain dirt on Hillary is a bad thing. Trump supporters forget that Russia is not the friend of the us

       Maybe he has connections with people who do monitoring of some type..or is in the business himself.

       There are any different underway sensors..I'm sure once an individual has spent enough time with a certain type of sensor they learn to read things it picks up even tho it may not have been designed for that specific application.

       Well the dozens of ships wiped out isn't part of the Argentinian sub story yet, and I don't know why the tunnel would be closed and the BBC in emergency mode. If he had said
       <strong>
        Argentina
       </strong>
       I'd be more inclined to believe the tweet, but it seems more like a coincidence. I mean, why does the USA need to wake up if it's an Argentinian sub?

       You act like various militaries just release information easily. The argentine navy wants to keep families hopes alive they'll find the sub in time because random "explosion" is not definitively from the sub. It doesn't get reported if it's not released. Not everything is because msm doesn't want to report it  jfc use critical thinking skills

        The Vienna-based agency, which has monitoring stations equipped with devices including underwater microphones that scan the oceans for sound waves, said in a statement that two of its stations had detected an unusual signal near where the submarine went missing.
        <strong>
         The agency was more guarded about whether that was caused by an explosion.

       An
       <em>
        implosion
       </em>
       could be the cause of the "unusual sound".... an implosion like that generated by a submarine sinking below its crush depth.

       A month ago I was wondering why pop songs had subliminal submarine pings but I didn’t want to say anything about it. There’s
       <a href="https://youtu.be/8e4f9f-j-5Y">
        this song
       </a>
       and there’s another song I can’t remember the title of but came out at the same time.

       On day 1 the explosion was mentioned. Really wish I could remember the source I read it on but it was absolutely being reported initially. However it was originally dismissed as something else (and no I'm not confusing this with the Marine noises of whales or whatever that they also noted)
      </p>
      <p>
       My best guess is they wrote it off in hopes of still finding the sub and it's remains (maybe because of information on the sub, possibly Falklands related?) But now that there's no hope in their air supply lasting long enough their confirming it was an explosion so that they can get the families out of the base and moving on
