        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">39</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-11-24 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/DarthCasanova.html">DarthCasanova</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First off it’s a theory, it could be total bullshit and hey if it is, it is.</p>

<p>A few months ago I was watching Cosmic Disclosure with David Wilcock and Corey Goode, and they were talking about underground/underwater fissures that ran under the South American continent all the way down to Antarctica. Goode even mentioned that subs could navigate these fissures. </p>

<p>Sub goes missing for a week. A week or two ago Q talks about “the hunt for Red October, a reference to a Russian sub in a film with Sean Connery from 1990.</p>

<p>The elite have a history of owning property in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, etc. We all know Hitler, the original neocon, moved there after the fall of Germany in WW2. Bush owned a ton of land in Paraguay. 300,000 acres.</p>

<p>Argentina govt withholds information about sub crew for one week from families until today, then take a hit that “Hey it blew up last week.”</p>

<p>You see where I’m going with this, right? What if Goode is correct and these underground fissures exist, and all this sub did was skip these dudes out of town and down to Antarctica. These fuckers ain’t going to care about the crew or their families, we all know that. They’ll use them up then spit them out when convenient.</p>

<p>Like I said I could totally be wrong, maybe I’m reaching, but we all know the elite have been sniffing around Antarctica a long time, and if there are fissures underground/underwater leading right to Antarctica, then they could basically escape undetected. </p>

<p>Thoughts???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only time a sub would traverse a fissure is if it is in shallow water and it uses the depth of the fissure to create a greater depth seperation between itself and any surface contacts do they can’t get sucked up and get struck. Subs won’t go in a fissure to get under land, it’s too risky of a maneuver. If they are in the middle of transit and they have a fire or flooding casualty they won’t be able to surface to assist in fighting the casualty.</p>

<p>Do you think it’s possible for a sort of underwater cave system where there might be big enough pockets for a submarine to make that journey? If they have done it enough times already?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose it could be possible, in my experience I’ve neither seen nor heard of any submarine actually doing this. If they have a correct gps track they follow along with the required depth band, have a tight grasp of their course heading along with the maximum error for each it could be possible fore sure. They could have some active sonar pinging away as an additional guidance to make it easier. </p>

<p>The only other big problem, outside of needing to perform an emergency surface, is if there are fresh water pockets in the area they going because the sub will be trimmed on the basis of salt water weight, about 8.26 lbs per gallon, the weight ration would shift drastically and they would start sinking out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Submariner here here’s what I think. Everyone pushes the 2-3 days because the most efficient way of changing atmospheres would be to snorkel(run he diesel) because they could also charge the battery. I’m not sure of their atmosphere control equipment, but we can make more oxygen, collect and discharge and maintain a safe level that would be somewhat close to a normal atmosphere. I’ve gone over 3 weeks without coming up and exchanging atmospheres.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how long their battery holds a charge, but it would be far less than the 2-3 days, so no juice means no atmosphere control equipment.</p>

<p>They also carry oxygen candles, sodium clorate, to make oxygen without needing to run any machinery and LIOH curtains which absorb carbon dioxide which could help maintain longer than the 2-3 day timeline as far as atmospheres go. </p>

<p>I believe the TR-1700 also have a forward and aft oxygen bank, if that’s the case that would be a 7-10 day supply of oxygen, but it really falls back to making sure CO2 is controlled or else it wouldn’t matter even if they had oxygen. </p>

<p>Another danger that I’ve been seeing over the last few hours was the talk of an explosion. If this is true it could likely been in waters that were Obove the 1500-1800 ft crush band depth, but there could have been a buildup of hydrogen from the battery. If there were high enough levels and they tried to use an oxygen candle it could have caused an explosion because when they are lit off they burn at about 600 degrees. </p>

<p>Those are just my thoughts on it, and I could only imagine how fucking terrible it would be to be on that boat. </p>
