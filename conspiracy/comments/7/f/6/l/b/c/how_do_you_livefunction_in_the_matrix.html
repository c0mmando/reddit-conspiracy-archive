<p>I can&#39;t watch tv or commercials or see new movie trailers without seeing the agenda everywhere.  The political bs.  The matrix.</p>

<p>So the question remains.......how do you walk through the matrix without wanting to check out of it?</p>

<p>It seems that no matter where we turn these days you can&#39;t get away from it.  Entertainment, movies, sports, music........the matrix is inescapable.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, it&#39;s good to know that I&#39;m not alone in feeling this way, sometimes I wish I could just switch off and enjoy just being alive but it&#39;s just a constant barrage of bullshit pushing away any hope of seeing anything change for the better, I&#39;ve left myself not wanting to socialise and even become quite reclusive. I don&#39;t want to become a slave to the state but instead have found myself a victim of the truth at least until there are enough people on the same wave length as us to make some meaningful changes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel exactly the same as you. I&#39;m tired of the arguments with people I care about who just come across as apathetic. I described it to someone the other day as being willing to sacrifice some of my own mental health to try to make the knowledge I&#39;ve accrued available to other. You can separate from it though. At the end of the day you can&#39;t change anyone&#39;s mind all you can do is work on yourself. Turn off all electronics and spend a week camping and hiking. Even just a weekend every month has helped me with my &quot;conspiracy driven depression&quot; take off and explore this beautiful earth we have access to. The closer you can get to Mother Earth/ Nature and separate from our techno focal society the better more grounded you will feel. Keep it up mate. The whole thing will come crumbling down eventually. </p>

We’re at the crossroads right now, and what happens next is up to all of us. People need to be made aware of the system, now more than ever. Keep spreading a message of love and unity, maby people will realise we, the ones advocating world peace, and real equality arent the crazy ones.. the ones that turn a blind eye to the endless wars around, the poverty, desease, famine.. those are the real crazy ones</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right especially the feeling of not belonging, as a child I always felt as though something just isn&#39;t quite right with the world and since beginning my journey through the truth it initially brought some comfort in discovering that my suspicions were right but after time it manifested into a feeling of helplessness, I&#39;m happy to know what I know now, but at the same time feel overwhelmed with how insignificant me knowing about all this is going to change anything. When things all fall into place so easily it leads me to think that the unknowing are actually just the uncaring and no amount of truth can change that. Sensitive people are more open to the truth but less able to cope with it. </p>

In a sense I think we chose to separate from the inner earth that&#39;s why we are alive and walking around... Lost. I know this sounds doom and gloom but there are wonderful things to experience while alive. Take advantage of it, love everything as it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont own a TV. I don&#39;t have Netflix. 
I have a FB I dont use.
No other social media.</p>

<p>I must say, not having all that BS is actually refreshing. My time is spent bettering myself, my household, my family, my finances, my health.</p>

<p>Of course I have the phone, so YouTube is my main source of watching things I want to see. But my desire to watch the latest shows, movies, etc is totally gone.</p>

<p>And at work, you just dumb down your conversations completely to get along with everyone there, which has worked out fairly well. And once and a while you could come across someone else that does the exact same thing you do when it comes to avoiding the MSM hype and you connect at a more meaningful level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  My wife isn&#39;t super blue pill but I&#39;ve learned not to overwhelm her too much.  That&#39;s a good thing though.</p>

<p>The other day she showed me the new movie coming out with Maryl Streep and Tom Hanks.  She asked if it was something I&#39;d want to go watch.  I smile.  She said &quot;You see a lot of agenda huh?&quot;</p>

<p>But I softened it by saying maybe we&#39;ll watch it when it comes out on bluray.</p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely a balance.  I&#39;m thankful she&#39;s not all the way awake though.  Ignorance is bliss.</p>

<p>Side note we&#39;re expecting in June.....this will help me focus and be grounded instead of the many rabbit holes I like to travel down.</p>

<p>Remove vices from your life. (I&#39;ve finally quit smoking and barely drink anymore)</p>

<p>Don&#39;t lie about anything (this one&#39;s harder than you think). </p>

<p>Read and expand your horizons (I&#39;ve found the Bible to be both incredibly helpful, and true. Almost all prophecy has happened. It was scary at first when I realized much of Revelation had happened already. Especially when you look at what&#39;s next.) </p>

<p>I still watch movies but now I can, by identifying symbolism used, see the plot behind the plot and recognize the propaganda slipped in. I make trying to figure out the real message behind the movie a game.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll be surprised that many people are starting to wake up to the bullshit. They&#39;re still babies at this point but will grow! Not overloading them is hard. </p>

<p>The Matrix is used to control your mind sure, but you still exist here when you see through it. </p>

<p>Interesting that we always use the movies about the Matrix as a guide to what we actually live in when those movies are pure Gnostic propaganda. And that false doctrine has subconsciously permeated your worldview, which will make it harder to actually release yourself from their control and take your life back from the feelings of dispair and loneliness they want anyone who sees through the propaganda to feel.</p>

<p>Great perspective overall.  For me I first began to see this when I was 18.  Went to the movie Jack.....with Robin Williams.  They were floating pedo bullshit way back then.  I had to walk out of the movie because it was so overwhelming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read about Gnosticism. Once you understand the Luciferian doctrines the movies all begin to really make sense. </p>

<p>Everything you see in these movies is flipped. The bad is the good and vise versa. A recent one that really stands out is X-Men apocalypse. They even use biblical lines such as &quot;come and see.&quot; The &quot;good&quot; superheroes in all these movies are allusions to the fallen angels or their part human offspring, and their war with God. It&#39;s in every movie too. Literally. Whether it be a comedy or a cartoon, once you know their perspective of the garden story you see it in all of Hollywood.</p>

<p>All the conspiracies in the world, all the centralization of power being worked on globally, it all comes back to the Bible. The battle for our souls between God, and he who would make himself god. </p>

<p>Everyone thinks the way things are today is &quot;progression&quot; out of the dark ages of religion. The gay and lesbian acceptance, the pedophilia, the drugs, &quot;free thought,&quot; sex drugs rock and roll, etc. It isn&#39;t. It&#39;s regression to the way things were just before the flood. </p>

<p>I was a staunch athiest at one time. But I <em>knew</em> there was more to the world. I fell into gnosticism for quite a while. I saw traditional Biblical teachings as the way of the past, outdated, just another form of control over the masses etc. But when I dug deeper and deeper into the teachings somehow I saw the error. I thank a great friend for that realization. The &quot;new&quot; age teaches that we are our own gods. It isn&#39;t new thought at all though, it is just newly popularized again. It&#39;s the same argument the serpent had in the garden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very great points. Also the push for transgender right now. The progressives have screwed themselves though because they used SCIENCE for the creationism/climate change debate but now that they want to push the trans agenda but their precision SCIENCE contradicts it.</p>

<p>Remember it was global warming and now it&#39;s climate change. They&#39;ll twist the trans stuff just the same way.</p>

<p>All this to say. My only answer for remaining sane is Jesus and reading the Word. It&#39;s the only thing I&#39;ve found that brings peace. People can scoff laugh or debate but it&#39;s the only thing that gives me peace joy and love.</p>

<p>Thanks for your input I&#39;m going to look into it more. I did gnosticism classes in college but I need to brush up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesuits himself fulfilled over 100 of them, but he also predicted the fall of Jerusalem after his death, the scattering of the Jews, the destruction of the temple, the ruling of Jerusalem by the gentiles. The Bible also predicted the rebirth of Israel in one day, the coming and crucifixion of the Messiah many hundreds of years before crucifixion was even a thing. The fall of Egypt from prominence, and that Egypt would still be around at the end times but as a lowly nation like it is today. </p>

<p>In the old Testament there are hundreds more, this site goes through a few</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are progressing rapidly towards a few key things that happen near the end of time, and are being called for by our world political and religious leaders.  Some things I&#39;ll say here may piss you off. Sorry if that&#39;s the case. </p>

<p>The &quot;Antichrist&quot; of which prophecy says there will be, and there has been many, has been operating in plain sight for hundreds of years. You know him as the Pope. The man who stands in the place of Christ on Earth (in the Greek this is written <em>Antichrist</em> and the new testament was written in Greek), and exercises his power to forgive sin, and pass judgement to an imaginary &quot;purgatory&quot; or &quot;hell&quot; by excommunication which he claims heaven must abide by. He also changed times and seasons as prophesied (the calendar/day of worship from Sat to Sun/time of Jesus birth from September to the day of pagan sun worship on Dec 25th).</p>

<p>We are watching the &quot;Whore of Babylon&quot; one world religion spring up as we speak. The Pope has set his dogs on bringing the Protestants back to Catholicism with papers signed this very year, as well as embraced other religions when kissing the Qur&#39;an, and preaching ecunumical unity among all religions. So much so in fact that it&#39;s become a <a href="http://www..com//www.google.com/amp/s/www.theonion.com/pope-francis-hosts-feathered-serpent-god-as-part-of-dei-1819579199/amp">joke.</a> </p>

<p>Gnosticism and other new age philosophy is also springing up worldwide, which is the Babylonian doctrine of the human eternal soul as being his own &quot;god,&quot; mixed with a few select sayings of Jesus. This is devouring much of Christianity right now as it is more exciting, and easier. </p>

<p>He also commands an army headed by a general. The Jesuits. Our current Pope is a Jesuit himself even. A little research into the history of the Jesuits will show their abhorrent and Hegelian methods and very bloody history. Here&#39;s a small excerpt from their oath <a href="http://www.thenazareneway.com/society_of_jesus_jesuits.htm">From the Library of Congress</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I furthermore promise and declare that I will, when opportunity presents, make and wage relentless war, secretly or openly, against all heretics, Protestants and Liberals, as I am directed to do, to extirpate and exterminate them from the face of the whole earth; and that I will spare neither age, nor sex or condition; and that I will hang, burn, waste, spoil, flay, strangle, and bury alive these infamous heretics, rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women and crush their infants&#39; heads against the walls, in order to annihilate forever their execrable race. </p>

<p>That when the same cannot be done openly, I will secretly use the poisoned cup, the strangulating cord, the steel of the poinard or the leaden bullet, regardless of the honor, rank, dignity, or authority of the person or persons, whatever may be their condition in life, either public or private, as I at any time may be directed to do so by any agent of the Pope or Superior of the Brotherhood of the Holy Faith, of the Society of Jesus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I didn&#39;t link the actual library, it&#39;s easier to get it from Google but it is indeed there if you&#39;d like to dig.)</p>

<p>Follow the symbolism appearing in their temple in Vatican city and you&#39;ll see that they are at the head of Freemasonry, they created the Illuminati with Weishaupt. This is the group wholly responsible for so much revolution and bloodshed as well as inquisitions, which were horrible affairs. They&#39;ll be back! </p>

<p>Why is the Pope on TV calling for a New World Order?</p>

<p>To fulfill prophecy the one world authority will need a global currency. A global government. And absolute power. It will be divided into 10 <a href="https://sciencing.com/10-geographic-regions-world-8774247.html">regions</a> or &quot;horns&quot; with a head or &quot;king.&quot; All this current war and revolution in the Middle East is to bring about one Arabian state. Some groups will never allow this, which is why they don&#39;t care if they genocide these groups and bomb them regardless of women or children being present. The Hegelian doctrine is playimg both sides of an issue to cause so much pain in separation that they will agree to things they otherwise wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>One world currency is in the works. The power to buy or sell must be able to be eliminated easily. And we keep pushing towards a cashless society.</p>

<p>The &quot;new world order&quot; or centralized global governance is just about fully established. One more big war will throw it over the top. </p>

<p>This war will be in the middle East the Bible says, in the valley of Megiddo. There are many troops around there from many countries right this second. Next is this big war. WW3, the Bible predicts a 200 million man army from East of the Euphrates. We will see. </p>

<p>Is there another period in time where every eye can see something as it happens?  Like with live TV? Broadcast even to your smartphone or tablet in the middle of the jungle? </p>

<p>When you look through history we are living in the most exciting time ever. Things are moving so fast now compared to 100 years ago, let alone 2000. The 2 links from Walter Veith on YouTube in my previous comment go through all of this and much more with better evidence and he&#39;s a professor, so much smarter than myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Felt enough of something the first trip that despite the mother of all bad trips back in February when I ingested something like 14 grams because I had plans to hang out with buddies, they never came, I was alone so I was like fuck it I&#39;m eating 14 grams by myself if no one wants to go get lit with me. I remember reality pretty much melting as a took a shower and felt like I was getting placed in dimension after dimension after dimension, like I was going through a rapid-ass slideshow of different lives I live across the multiverse. Demons started slashing me when the water drops around the shower all started oscillating like waves, and then everything around me pretty much melted into a blur of flashing colours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sort of feel bad for people waking up now compared to people waking up 20-30 years ago. There is far more conflicting info now compared to then, and I imagine being redpilled now must suck. </p>

<p>Waking up 20-30 years ago you have time to really research and digest and apply wisdom and have the luxury of time to see everything unfold and time to grow thick skin. </p>

<p>Some things were more difficult. I got shitloads of death threats in 2001 trying to tell everyone 9-11 was an inside job. Pseudo patriotism was at an all time high and to speak out against govt was to speak out against the USA. And telling people there was a police state coming was totally mocked, but hey, it sure is one now.</p>

<p>But to answer your question on how to navigate it: you just have to detach yourself from reality to a degree. You know the MSM is lying to you, but it’s important to still listen to their crap to see what the enemy is feeding the sheep. You watch these people on MSM articles fighting and debating a level of geopolitics that’s almost laughable, like watching lab mice fight. </p>

<p>It can be crazy and it’s like living in two separate realities at once, but you get used to it. To me, the one thing that’s drove me nuts are just internet assholes and know it alls. But even that I detach from.</p>

<p>But be lucky you’re being redpilled now, as compared to being forced the redpill. A day will come when it’s all revealed officially, and those who denied it for decades or had zero clue will be forced to take it all in inn a short time and they’re not inquisitive types anyway, and most will probably short circuit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the trilogy of movies you’re referring to, they actually find out that Zion, the place those freed from the matrix go, is actually another level of control. So even though they freed themselves from the matrix, it did not truly free them, posing the question, what is freedom and are we ever really free? And if we can free ourselves from this realty, I.e. the matrix, what even is this reality if when we free ourselves we are just sort of moving to another place to be controlled? </p>

<p>Choice ultimately was the problem with the world that was created for those enslaved in the matrix. In other words, everyone had a choice on whether to accept the matrix or not. This was built in to the system and so eventually those who saw the truth allowed for the “one”, neo, to return by helping him get free  and reset the matrix,  creating peace again between the machines and the people. If One believes in these movies as a metaphor for the problems we face today...then it’s only a matter of time before there is peace in our world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep but that&#39;s why we gotta keep going.  Every day people are being woken.  They need help and guidance.  </p>

<p>I had a buddy recently become woke to WTC7. I told him welcome to the club, where have you been? A few weeks later I apologized to him for being dismissive because he was just waking up.</p>

<p>He said not at all, he just realized all the underhanded shit our gov&#39;t had been doing since Trump got into office. That&#39;s what allowed him to explore things like 9\11 and such.</p>

<p>I realized I had to be delicate with those just waking up. I think I over compensated because I&#39;ve been labeled crazy for so many years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just have to unplug and stay away from TV and reading news online for awhile. For example, after the Las Vegas shooting I was following as much media as I could and the whole thing really started to wear on me after a couple of weeks. I became annoyed when others had no idea of the cover up going on and were still completely oblivious to what is going on in the world. I had to back off and stop following for a few days and focus on my own personal reality. I try to spend more time with friends and family and doing activities outdoors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is good.  I&#39;m still amazed that it&#39;s THE WORST shooting in US history and the blatant coverup going on.</p>

<p>People just go about their business.  They don&#39;t care.  </p>

<p>I feel ya though.  Ebs and flows man.  But we know the game at least!</p>

<p>Good on ya!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing matters, it&#39;s all meaningless. Find what you find fun or exciting and do it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m starting a business and I&#39;ve tried before but this time I&#39;m not backing down, I told my wife I&#39;m doing it with or without her even if it means divorce, and this time it&#39;s like I&#39;ve warped the matrix by how many people are offering to help.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even know if reality is real, this might be a simulation. So I&#39;m just going to please myself and hopefully please those around me too.</p>
