    <div class="md"><p>Sorry but i really have to laugh about this. If you really think that Russian television is more &#39;honest&#39; or unbiased or whatever then your american television, sorry then you are not thinking anymore. They are both as equally biased, untrue or whatever. If you want some decent new stop looking at russian or american news, try some dutch/swedish/norwegian news. Maybe then you can say it is less biased then US or Russian news. But saying that Russian television is closer to the truth is just utterly stupid...sorry</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re partly right.</p>

<p>But think about it this way. There are two opponents, in this case the West (US) vs Russia. Neither government tells it&#39;s own citizens what they&#39;re actually up to.</p>

<p>So, to a certain degree, each government will try and spoil the other side&#39;s game by giving out info (in their own news) about what the other side is really doing.</p>

<p>Another way of looking at this? Sometimes people have their own head so far up their ass they can&#39;t see how they appear to others. In situations like that, you need someone <em>who is not your friend</em> to give the most honest opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my humble opinion, nothing that comes from Russia, a nation now ruled by a shady elite, who got their fortunes on the failing SOvjet system, with criminals and power addicted fucktards running the country, can never produce any any good news show, especially if it&#39;s payed by the same criminals. (I know same goes for US, thats why i&#39;m glad im not a citizen of either country) so the OP made a too simple statement by saying RT is more closer to the trut. In fact i think RT is way more untrue then CNN. SInce RT is a gov run/payed for news outlet created to give the world a more possitive outlook on Russia. Nah RT can never be trusted. RT is shit, same like Fox. Is CNN or others better? Yes, but only a little bit. Btw also think about how critical journalist get killed in Russia. You don&#39;t see that shit happen in the US or Europe. to be honest, i think that most of the news from Russia, or most things Russia/Putin/his administration does is not to be trusted.</p>

Perhaps, &quot;I disagree&quot; or &quot;I think your wrong&quot; and then get to your point.
I still think it&#39;s Closer.
All media is skewed and it&#39;s our job to sift through all the crap if we care enough to form our own opinions and not just cling on to someone else&#39;s.
Max Keizer for instance is allowed to give what is clearly his own opinion on a non &quot;American&quot; media outlet.
Have you ever heard similar opinions in the American media?
I don&#39;t agree with all of what he has to say but he clearly loves this country enough to point out honestly some of the major problems with it.

    <div class="md"><p>My bad
I should have added more context
I love Max Keiser
I think they let him say what he wants which I guess is mostly critical of the US and I see the same problems.
I don&#39;t see American mainstream media giving anyone that same platform
Again just my opinion</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just my opinion that&#39;s all
I guess I was hoping for positive discussion and other opinions. Certainly wasn&#39;t trying to influence anyone else&#39;s. I admit it was a broad statement without any context.
Based on some of the comments, I&#39;ll keep my opinions to myself and continue to lurk in the background. Was it you that pointed out that I&#39;m only here 18 days? I see you take this very seriously.
True I&#39;ve been here only a short time.
I can assure you I&#39;m not a troll or shill for anyone.
I hate what has become of this country, the bullshit we are fed, whatever the truth is, we are not hearing it. People actually risk their lives for this government without questioning what it really stands for.
Educate me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look in to the history of Russian propaganda if you really think it&#39;s more trustworthy than western media. Maybe it is for US problems, but that makes sense. Russia wants to paint US in bad light. You really think they&#39;d tell you the truth about their own corruption and war crimes? Of course not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree
I mad a broad statement that was my opinion.
I&#39;m not interested in Russia&#39;s problems.
I&#39;m fed up with this country spilling the blood of our people. I&#39;m tired of feeling so betrayed by this corrupt government.
Iraq, Afghanistan , Syria, the whole frigging world.
How do we spread freedom and democracy when all we really export is debt and death.
The Russians are masters of propaganda
And they do a great job of pointing out what&#39;s wrong with this country..
I wish more Americans were more open to hearing what their opinion is instead of just buying into American propaganda, waving their flag and thinking we are the best.</p>

Most people don&#39;t even know what the truth is in their own home let alone the world.
Best we can do is shoot the shit and take care of our own. A little self sufficiency won&#39;t hurt.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the US has a lot of problems and our foreign policy often contradicts our supposed &quot;values&quot;. But one thing I&#39;d recommend thinking about is historical instances where the US has actually helped build democracies or otherwise flourishing economic powerhouses. West Germany and Japan after WWII for example. South Korea after the Korean War. We didn&#39;t occupy those areas and keep them for ourselves. They&#39;re currently prosperous in part due to US help and cooperation during reconstruction.</p>

<p>With that said there are many examples of the US leaving countries to rot after we were done with them. And that&#39;s worth talking about. But can you name a single success story from the other side? Has Russia left countries better than they found them? I think you&#39;d be hard pressed to find an example. Maybe China, but Russia never invaded China and China really took off after adopting pseudo-Western economic policies </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t defending Russia 
I like what you say about this country and I&#39;d like to believe we are &quot;the shining city on the hill&quot; or whatever Reagan said.
Yes we rebuilt Europe and Japan after WW2
Really can&#39;t comment on South Korea.
The Marshall plan was a great thing but there was an agenda behind it. It wasn&#39;t purely altruistic.
Europe and Japan remain vassal states of this country.
They do as they&#39;re told by the powers that control this country.( my opinion). The American empire is the largest in history. It dwarfs the British empire.
Same people, different name. Again, my opinion</p>
