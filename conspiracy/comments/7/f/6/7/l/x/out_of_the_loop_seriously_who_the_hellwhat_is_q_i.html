<p>And the Fleur-de-lis is more than the Saints Row Symbol...</p>

<p>but the average 4chin would automatically use media over its clear use. 4chan believes in absolutely nothing but memes and mass media that everyone knows but no one wants to admit is common knowledge.</p>

<p>They take their entire worldview from pop culture. They only know things from the crap they watch.</p>

<p>There is a reason the 4chin LARPs all use mass media knowledge and common sentiments instead of actual new ideas that a true insider would know.</p>

<p>Every single one of his posts is left open ended JUST enough to give leeway so that if ANYTHING happens ever, it can be used to prove him right. Same mental tactics used by scam artist psychics where you start where THEY want YOU to start.</p>

<p>Such as: Rothchilds, Jews, NWO etc used to segway into someone&#39;s trust using their own biases.</p>

<p>He then goes onto flowy and grandiose written word to make him seem more educated, but no one would go through this much length to create such a narrative under duress (if they wanted us to know something RIGHT NOW).</p>

<p>No one in a position of true knowledge would bother with this much showmanship. This isn&#39;t how real life whistle blowers act, this is how a movie character acts.</p>

<p>Secondly, Saudi Arabia having immense power in America has been in actual written scholarly articles since at least the 1980s. This relationship has ALWAYS been a master-slave relationship since the 1973 oil embargo forced America into capitulation. Its not been a secret. Even Mexican diplomats wrote about it openly.</p>

<p>There was nothing new from this man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an anonymous person on 4chan&#39;s /pol/. They like asking longs strings of questions without explaining context, apparently to lead the reader to a relevant conclusion. They offer almost no declarative statements at all ever, but they have made a few vague predictions of varying accuracy. They seem to want people to investigate the questions and find answers for themselves. Rather than stating directly what conclusion they want the reader to draw, they encourage independent research. </p>

<p>Trolls love dismissing this person as a &quot;larp&quot; even though this makes no sense. The word &quot;larp&quot; means &quot;live action role play&quot;. In the context of /pol/, it would mean a hoax, someone who claims to be someone they&#39;re not. As far as I know, this Q person hasn&#39;t claimed to be anything or anyone. They&#39;re not role playing anything, they&#39;re basically just asking a bunch of questions having to do with current events and connections to historical conspiracy theories. How could asking long strings of questions and making predictions be a hoax or a role play? If I post a bunch of questions here and now, would I be role playing or hoaxing? </p>

<p>There are a few collections around of this person&#39;s posts. I&#39;d recommend trying to find them if you&#39;re curious, but I wouldn&#39;t know how to help with that. Ultimately, there&#39;s almost no direct information though, so don&#39;t expect your mind to be blown by their long strings of questions. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>The reason they&#39;re referred to as &quot;Q&quot; is because they specifically claimed to be a high level person inside the Trump administration with &quot;Q level clearance&quot;, which is not something I had heard of previously, but is apparently the highest level clearance in the DoE. This is also around the time they made many specific predictions, with specific dates, none of which have occurred. Hence, a LARP. </p>

<p>In his initial posts he calls himself &quot;Q Clearance Patriot&quot;. In addition, there was the posts with the picture from the airplane that lead people to infer he was on AF1.</p>

<p>The entire reason that people are paying attention to the Q posts is because they were originally presented as coming from someone with executive level access to the president.</p>

<p>You should be able to ask here and get a link to an overview, but for some absurd reason you&#39;re more likely to get derision.

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is the Q anon situation has been going on for several weeks and someone makes one of these out of the loop posts quite frequently, and gets answered. People get tired of explaining the same thing to people over and over who can’t bother themselves to search through the sub themselves before asking everyone to bring them up to speed. I’ve given one of these people a brief synopsis on one of these posts but the same question keeps getting asked. It’s like coming into this sub and saying “hey guys, do you think there’s something fishy about 9/11?” Or “I stepped away from this sub for 30 minutes, can someone explain pizzagate to me?” I’m fine with someone being out of the loop and asking for information, but at least check the sub to see how many times that same question has been asked and read the responses there instead of cluttering up the place with questions that have been answered plenty of times. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is going on with this fucking sub? Just look at the comments on this thread. I&#39;ve always remembered <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> being about the discussion of conspiracy theories. What&#39;s with the high amount of aggressive and nasty comments? Throughout the years I&#39;ve been on this sub, I&#39;ve read some very outlandish theories that are deemed very &#39;out there&#39; which has been met with the usual skepticism but there was always an acknowledgement or an awareness that this is precisely what the sub is for. Now anything to do with Q anon or pizzagate is immediately met with mass vote brigading and highly upvoted comments just insulting people and shutting down any meaningful discussion. I don&#39;t know what, but there is definitely something strange going on.</p>
