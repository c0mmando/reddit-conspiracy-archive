    <div class="md"><p>Haha. Maybe that’s subconsciously why I brought it up.</p>

<p>I remember the article might have been the cover story but that might be wrong. I also remember drawings of the buildings with animated arrows pointing at different parts of the building’s structure and explaining what reaaaally happened. I remember the building image being on the right side and the architect’s account being on the left scaling it. I can’t imagine it was many pages since it was TIME FOR KIDS(TM).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I distinctly remember these stories I used to read when the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were still in their early stages, or about to happen.</p>

<p>In 2002, they made it seem as if American troops were in Afghanistan to build schools for children, and to ensure that women would be allowed to go to school, etc.</p>

<p>And, while they did offer some VERY LIMITED opposing viewpoints about Iraq, they also made it seem as if something militarily should be done about Saddam Hussein, who was reportedly building &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot;..............</p>
