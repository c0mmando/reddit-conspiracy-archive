        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">20</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-11-25 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/MightbeMarvin.html">MightbeMarvin</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>HANNITY: Let me bring former deputy assistant to President Trump, Sebastian Gorka. I did mean to introduce you, and I just got ahead of myself, as I often do. I apologize. Dr. Gorka, I want to look big picture here. And I thought Sarah Sanders said this very well, and I take it a step further. Everything that they tried to say about Donald Trump and his campaign, they’re guilty of. But I’ll add on steroids and human growth hormones. That they sold out America’s security in this case. Give me the big picture take away from this because now the media has gone silent on Russia, virtually silent.</p>

<p>GORKA: Here’s the big picture take away, Sean. For more than a year, the fake news industrial complex, and the Democrats, and Hillary, and Podesta, and Ben Rhodes, have been slinging filth against the president and against his team. None of it has stuck. But in the last week, we’ve had an explosion of scandals that all are true and that all go back to the DNC and to Hillary. And the trouble is, Sean, you have to do a massive service because you’re the only people. It’s you, it’s Sarah, it’s Solomon, it’s Peter, but that’s it. And there’s so many scandals. We have to separate them.</p>

<p>Number one, there’s the Uranium One deal. That’s treasonous, OK? We have to deal with that. Second, there’s the doggie dossier which is about Russian disinformation being used to slander Donald Trump. And then, thirdly, there’s James Comey using that disinformation to create a special prosecutor trigger that is used to investigate the president. And then, lastly, the fourth story is Fusion GPS. How many stories are out there that are fake that came from Moscow, and which were peddled by Fusion GPS into the left wing media. That’s four scandals in one week, Sean.</p>

<p>HANNITY: The Russians lied to impact the election. The Russian infiltrated our national security to corner the uranium market and they succeeded, and they knew all the crimes that were committed.</p>

<p>GORKA: If this had happened in the 1950s, there would be people up on treason charges right now. The Rosenberg’s, OK? This is equivalent to what the Rosenberg’s did, and those people got the chair. Think about it. Giving away nuclear capabilities to our enemies, that’s what we’re talking about.</p>

<p>HANNITY: All right. Last word, our friend, Peter.</p>

<p>SCHWEIZER: Well, look, I think it’s going to be amazingly important for that information to be preserved by the FBI. I think this eyewitness needs to be protected. And I think we’re going to see a lot more coming out on Clinton pay to play. I think Gregg Jarrett is right. There’s major legal problems for the Clintons when it comes to violating federal law.</p>

<p>Or they could have been led without knowledge of the details.. “Just trust Hillary and Obama”</p>

<p>While the FBI puts a gag order on a witness who was gathering intelligence and audio recordings of Russian players doing corrupt shit with American politicians.</p>

<p>All to get the Iran nuclear deal in order would be my guess.. There aren’t too many logical scenarios for US to want to sell off that amount of uranium to a country we recently almost went to nuclear war with. And the one now currently trying to corner the uranium market.. </p>

Posting Fox news clips, championing talking points from administration shills, schizophrenicly split between &quot;Russia is our friend!&quot; and &quot;Killary sold nukes to Putin&quot; while not having the mental capacity to realize your essentially chasing your own tails. Stop being so fucking stupid, I really am tired of it. At least believe conspiracies that stand up to more than several minutes worth of research and scrutiny, or that aren&#39;t tailor made propaganda from the fucking white house. </p>
