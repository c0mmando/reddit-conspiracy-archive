        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The story takes place in Lithuania, member of NATO and the European Union. It revolves around a little girl who was living with her father after the divorce of her parents (the mother accepted the terms, getting visitation rights on the weekends). In 2008 the girl’s father (Drasius Kedys) filed a police report that his daughter is being molested by the mother’s friend Andrius Usas, a businessman, an advisor to the speaker of the house. In 2009 the father submitted a formal complaint to the police that there were two other men involved - Jonas Furmonavicius (a judge) and another man Aidas (unidentified), while another girl was abused as well and both mother knew about it, and had financial gain from it.  No charges were filled. The father filed hundreds of reports and requests to the prosecutors, judges, congressmen and the president. He recorded his daughters testimony and sent it to hundreds of media outlets and the European politicians. The story was gaining some small traction online and in the independent media.  Later that year judge Furmonavicius and the second girl’s mother Naruseviciene were shot. Drasius Kedys became the main suspect. The story caught attention of the media and the public. Protests started throughout the country, blaming prosecutors for inactivity. The case was finally officially started. Kedy’s sister, judge Venckiene gained the custody of the girl. While the second girl disappeared. In 2010 the police announced that Kedys is hiding in Spain. The next day, his body was found in Kaunas, Lithuania. The official report of his death was that Kedys choked on his vomit while heavily drinking. His family and most of the nation did not believe this report. There were clear signs of violence on his body. His funeral was attended by around 10000 Lithuanians. Later the same year the court decided that the girl should live with her mother (while testifying against her). At the same time the main suspect Andrius Usas, fell of his bike and drowned in a creek. When girl refused to go to her mother, the court allowed police to take the girl by force. Hundreds of Lithuanians surrounded the house of the girl’s aunt, judge Venckiene and stayed there for more than two years, preventing the police from taking the girl. On March 23rd, 2012, during one of the visits from the girl’s mother, the police showed up and tried to take the girl by force, the mother was pulling the girl away from the grandmother, the girl was screaming “go away”. This attempt failed and caused a huge outrage threw out the country and the world. There were protests by the Government buildings in Lithuania and abroad. On May 17th, 240 police officers with riot gear, blocked the radius of the house for 2 miles, closed down the local school and shut down the roads. The police got threw the protesters, broke the glass door and carried the girl away screaming. The judge Venckiene’s legal immunity was violated, because the officers detained her by holding her arms. 39 other people were arrested, including the girl’s grandmother. Thousands of Lithuanians protested by the Presidential palace. At the time the President of Lithuania was in Chicago, at a NATO summit, the protesters surrounded her car, and did not let her pass. Soon after, 6 charges were brought against judge Venckiene (there are speculations that the president viewed her as a potential political threat). In 2013 Venckiene resigned and was elected to congress with a new political party that gained 8% of the votes, while having almost 0 funding. The same charges were brought against her, plus one additional crime. The parliament voted to remove her legal immunity and to allow to arrest her. She fled the country and asked for political asylum in United States. She was soon impeached from her congress seat, many members of her party and supporters are facing charges from refusing to obey a court order to a threat to the national security. Venckiene has been in U.S. for 5 years now. Lithuanian government asked for her extradition, the number of crimes grew to 39. The girl is missing. The grandparents are on trial for “psychological molestation” for asking the girl about what happened at the mom’s house. Kedy’s friend is sentenced to 8 years in jail for assisting in the killing. There are around 10 people that died who were related to this case, all of Venckiene’s family and supporters are being trialled and the story is being killed in the media.</p>
