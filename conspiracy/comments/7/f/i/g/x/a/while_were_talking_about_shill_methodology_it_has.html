       ...that is, posts that are intended to draw in the element or ideologues they are assigned to ridicule and discredit, where they coordinate and swarm with condescending and dismissive talking points to create the appearance of a strong and undeniable public opinion.  In their coordination they also upvote the post to guarantee it front page visibility.  It's literally designed to create illusory public opinions for sheep to follow and to shame all dissent into silence.  We need to recognize these posts which are frequenting the front page more and more and call them out.  They're easy to spot.  Their headlines almost always state a controversial blanket generalization as indisputable fact.  I wouldn't argue in their own set-up forum, just a downvote will do, but we should take note of the issues they are gunning for, and raise our voices even louder, more fearlessly.  They only operate in a world of appearances, but those attuned to truth cannot and will not be misled in this way.

       They definitely are there to try and bait you I to a ban by saying the word "shill"...

       That's why I migrated over to r/conspiracyundone . Rule ten on this sub is just a clever way you can be arbitrarily banned on this sub. At least they ban shills over on that other sub...

       What is the gain to subtly implying that you "know they are shilling"? Seems about as productive as accusing them outright.

       To expose them for what they are without getting banned.  I try not to throw the accusation around lightly, but sometimes you just know, and you want them to know you see through their deceit.

       I recently mentioned this to someone today. I've recently noticed a lot of users that seem to have a larger than normal knowledge base of the subject they seem to be defending, yet there are obvious and easily debunkable "seeds" in their well-written comments- blatant misquotes, poor "iirc" citations- things a novice should be able to catch. Then, in comes the debunker squad to tear up the substance of the thread over the "seeded" disinfo and the thread slides to trash. It's an interesting tactic.

       I also think just correcting the errors in a respectful manner would be a good idea, like, "great comment but I noticed you said 'hot tub' when it's actually 'pool'."
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I would like to dissuade folks from upvoting those posts until the user corrects the errors. I cringe when I see disinfo massively upvoted just because the commenter
       <em>
        seems
       </em>
       to be on a particular "side".

       I find that having well sourced links usually stops them as well. There are a couple good Steemit sources for Pizzagate material. If they start to realize you are sharing more material than arguing or defending yourself they tend to drop the thread.

       need a good named reddit for this, like "shill or not". Once shills and their tactics get profiled, they'll be easier to take down. Rule 10. needs to be modified.

       I've done a pretty accurate job at detailing my recent observations. I've been really busy with family and volunteer stuff so I wasn't able to participate in the posts I've observed- so I don't have quick linkd. If you are truly interested, look up recent PG posts and look for new users with highly upvoted comments that contain blatant errors that were quickly pounced upon. Be a detective!

       Indeed.  I got caught up myself this morning.  It's a real shame.  As much as I don't wanna give those fools any more of my energy, it's  hard to resist the urge to buck against their blatant deceptions and tactics.  There really is a messaging war going on, and it irks me to see these shills devices getting traction in popular thought.

       My hunch is there are X lurkers who don't post, so I'm just using the deniers to talk to the lurkers without directly addressing the lurkers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know in sales and service, one negative complaint equals almost 30 actual negative experiences (the other 29ish folk don't bother contacting the company).  I dunno what the ratio is poster:lurker, but its gotta be at least 1:30.

       That's a good point about communicating to the lurkers.  Whether conscious or not, I believe I do that too.  We're all invested in this messaging war it seems, no matter how detached and aloof we try to be, because we know how stubborn and forceful of a tide public opinion can be, and how collective consciousness shapes the world.  The battle to save the world is a battle to enlighten minds and open hearts, over those who seek to enslave and control the mind and take away our humanity.

       WCH, my friend. Thanks for backing me up on the other thread. They're pulling my whole case for PG out of context, insult me heavily with every post and even did some research in there about my nationality.

      <p>
       But the funny thing is, the more they repeat themselves with no input at all, the more I'm sure to be on the right track. Just let's not feed them on their threads, because they have instant control over those. Most of my posts got -15 and less, all that typing just to convince some people who are most likely getting paid to keep me arguing about total nonsense.

       Which encourages us to 1. trust our own critical thinking abilities and intuition regardless of how many people say something is true and 2. actually do your own research/put in the due diligence into a topic. For example, read the article rather than go to the top comments to see what people are saying.

       Agreed, with one caveat on point 2.  We need to be careful about who keeps raising the topics, controlling the conversation, and diverting our attention.  I can get drawn into things that were clearly designed just to frustrate and limit the focus.  I think they like to keep our investigations corralled within controlled arenas for fear we might stumble upon real issues.

        Astroturfing Information Megathread.

       That's what we know to be true. If you're interested in whistle blowers, check out

        Shill Confessions and Additional Information
       </a>
       . Since we know that many of these governments and corporations hire shills, some of them will eventually break their non-disclosure agreements and blow the whistle. Just be careful because it's difficult to prove that a whistleblower is legit. They would not want to prove their identity because that could get them fired or sued by their employer. This means some of the confessions could just be trolls. If you want to stick just with information we know is true, see the megathread.

       Well, no it’s not a lack of self awareness. It’s a lack of the necessary skills to grasp the subject. The same lack of skills stops you from judging yourself as incapable of grasping the subject. You may be aware and introspective, but still coming to the wrong conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Chicken playing chess” would probably just be a variation on the argument from ignorance, but I think it is different. Because the point is asserted as true because of the owners ignorance. Instead, the owner believes the point is true because the owners ignorance.

       Watching users of this sub spinning their wheels endlessly over "shills" is amusing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also calling someone a shill is an easy way to dismiss what they're saying without actually examining it. Just like when people get irritated because they think "conspiracy theorist" has negative implications.

       Well, you have a point, and what you say isn't untrue, but nevertheless, there are coordinated shills that really are damaging the free and open discourse of this sub, making it appear as it is not, and really taking a notch out of the potential of this sub.  I value this sub so much because it's one of the few places people can challenge the official narratives and discuss their perspectives openly without social backlash.  We live in touchy times, and even the most innocent questioning can turn the angry hordes against you.  Yes, calling someone a shill is an easy way to dismiss them, and in that sense, I can understand the rule, but that doesn't mean that there are not paid and coordinated shills literally trying to misinform and alter perceptions and thinking through deceitful means.  And that is a wicked thing at a such a dire and critical time in human history, and devalues the beauty and potential of a free exchange of information.  You hang around here long enough and you see the patterns and the tone change drastically during business hours.  You recognize the pattern of redundant tactics, you catch the buzzwords, note the provocations, and see the odd voting patterns.  Sure, there can be shill hysteria, but shills are real, and they're bad, m'kay?

       The shill accusation is nothing new, but we have huge numbers of people attempting to claim that it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have been dismissing others' opinions for decades by calling them names. Examples include sheeple, conspiracy nuts, tin foil whackjobs, libtards, Drumpf supporters, idiots, retards, truthers, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       People today will attack you for your comment history if you posted in certain subreddits, regardless if you were in that sub to agree or disagree. Some people will find stuff in your history from last year to discredit what you're saying recently, so this has been going and and will continue to go on for as long as the internet exists. People like to single out the shill accusation as something that's entirely new, but it's not. It's just a different version of the same old discrediting tactics. I've even had people tell me that I shouldn't be spreading information about shills because it will ruin conversations due to the influx of shill accusations. Those accusations would be significantly reduced if these governments and corporations required their workers to disclose ties to their employer instead of trying to blend in and manipulate people. They should be the ones who are to blame for the influx of shill accusations, not the people trying to educate others about the practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shills have existed for a very long time. Even the word "shill" is at least 100 years old, used to describe people paid by gamblers/auctioneers to impersonate regular people in order to manipulate a crowd.

       Again good info, and refreshing that someone sees it.  You talked a bit about ad hominem, a term I admit I only learned recently after ranting about the very thing on Facebook.  Once you're wise to it, you see it in exhausting repetition.  It's the go-to tactic of a feeble mind, nothing but a diversion from addressing a topic head on.  It is fascinating how deep they'll dig through your comment history looking for something to discredit you.  The second they start to bring that up, is the second you know for sure who and what you're dealing with.  Fucking cowards grasping at straws for deflection, nothing but dirty tricks and dishonest intentions.  I think the real ones to blame are the shills themselves.  It's like how the Nazi regime would have been powerless without the cooperation of the people.  In my opinion, anyone who profits off the seeding of misinformation and the suppression of the truth in such a dire and critical time in human history is guilty of a grave sin against humanity that won't go unchecked without its repercussions.  What a mark of wickedness to taint the purity and potential of a revolutionary, worldwide, open, and free communications network to push a self-serving and divisive agenda!  I can sleep at night after hundreds of downvotes, ridicule and scorn.  I hope the inner, gnawing guilt of shills haunts them and drives them to madness like Judas or Poe's "Tell-Tale Heart".  But it won't,  You can't break through to such hardened hearts. They'll be like fools arguing on a sinking ship, unaware of the real danger, until the moment frigid water fills their lungs, snuffs their dreams, and pulls their corrupted souls into the black abyss.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I digress...  Thanks again for the perspectives.  It's time to flip over the rock, expose them, and watch these shadow creatures scurry as they get scorched in the impartial light of truth.

       I really hate to polarize any issue.  The "us and them" mentality isn't serving us, but hurting us.  I was called a "radical centrist" today, fuck it. I'm very disenchanted with the left and the right and US politics in general, so I'd like to believe I'm not taking sides.  I'm on the side against deception, and a little content to just sit back and watch it all cave in on itself.  That said, I see PLENTY of pro-DNC shilling in this sub, and it's often the most arrogant and deceptive.  Everybody is freaked out, so everyone has to choose a side and commit to it, and now we're divided right down the middle and snarling at each other like distracted dogs, but we're on the same sinking ship, and the elite are having a good laugh from their beach chairs.  I think one of the chief challenges of humanity in this time is to wake up and outsmart this divide and conquer tactic, the crux of which is the us-and-them mentality that has been bred into us since birth in this long-corrupt system.  Trump is the ultimate polarizer.  To defeat him is to defeat the polarized mentality.

       Thank you!  I thought I was crazy.  I tell you who comes up with these terms: people who are so mired in their dualistic mindset that they can't even conceive outside their own limiting paradigm.  Everything that they can't understand, that doensn't fit into their world view, they either have to invent a label for that falls within the spectrum of their ignorance, or just dismiss the parts that don't fit as absurdity.  The ego's need to be right contracts the mind, distorts perception, and perpetuates division like a running crack in an iced-over lake.

       Your the second person to see it as Fed speak.  I give too much benefit of the doubt, but truthfully, it did have that stench. Exactly: to round up the freethinking outliers.  We can't have people setting an example that we can step beyond the narrative and expose the insidious mechanisms of division and control.

       Yes, I agree, but it's far more than this sub.  The whole world is spellbound by this us and them mentality and it is very effectively fracturing us and taking away our capacity to unite and solve real problems.  I wrote a poem about it:
      </p>
      <p>
       Like those who tussle in sinking sand,
only hasten their gritty fate,
Here we wrestle on a sinking vessel,
unaware the hour is late.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're just anrgy dogs on two sides of a sinking boat, each feeling righteous and blaming the other, at each others throats as we choke on rising sea water.  I really believe if shills are shilling anything, its simply this mentality.  It keeps us distracted and easily manipulated.

       You think your views warrant shills? Like the government actually cares so much about your "truth" that they send agents to try sway opinions in this place? This sub right here right now? Try not being so self important, your opinions are not worthy of a squad of government agents. Like no one cares.

       Come on... I've only been coming here (recently) for a couple weeks and I notice the Montsanto shills. It actually may have been ConspiracyII, but one of them always posts in Montsanto threads and that's about it. And always toeing the Montsanto line.

       Well thanks for the pep talk, but you're mistaken.  It's not about me.  In that regard you are correct.  It's about shaping popular opinion, because most are not like me, and are prone to follow what "smarter people" espouse as truth.  As more and more people have become distrustful of the mainstream media and feel unable to discuss ideas openly on Facebook for fear of social shaming, they've been coming here, where ideas are discussed in greater depth than tweets and memes, and where one can remain anonymous and speak relatively freely without fear of blowback.  So yes, TPTB, are aware that conspiratorial ideas are infiltrating mainstream thought and its fucking with their ability to decieve and control.  And yes, they send out shills in these forums to influence popular opinion.  I'm not so egotistical to assume they care about my personal ideologies, but you are apparently are egotistical enough to feel the need to snidely dismiss and condescend.  Bravo, champ.  Go get 'em!

       My newest thinking is that this would be a great idea for a new law stating:

      <p>
       If you are being paid to post, you would need to have some kind of flair to identify the source of your funding.

       Normal conversation is being subverted in ways that existing law doesn't seem to comprehend.

       This is what I've noticed - Shill OP links to shit blogpost (created by Shill). Other Shills swarm in support of shit blogpost. Shit blogpost gets bumped to front page.. stays there for a little bit till enough critical thinkers downvote. Post still stays around top 50 - 100 for a few days.

       I really hate to polarize any issue.  The "us and them" mentality isn't serving us, but hurting us.  I was called a "radical centrist" today, fuck it. I'm very disenchanted with the left and the right and US politics in general, so I'd like to believe I'm not taking sides.  I'm on the side against deception, and a little content to just sit back and watch it all cave in on itself.  That said, I see PLENTY of pro-DNC shilling in this sub, and it's often the most arrogant and deceptive.  Everybody is freaked out, so everyone has to choose a side and commit to it, and now we're divided right down the middle and snarling at each other like distracted dogs, but we're on the same sinking ship, and the elite are having a good laugh from their beach chairs.  I think one of the chief challenges of humanity in this time is to wake up and outsmart this divide and conquer tactic, the crux of which is the us-and-them mentality that has been bred into us since birth in this long-corrupt system.  Trump is the ultimate polarizer.  To defeat him is to defeat the polarized mentality.
