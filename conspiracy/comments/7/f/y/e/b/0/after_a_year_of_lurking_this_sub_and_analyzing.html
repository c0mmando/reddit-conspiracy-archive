<p>He&#39;s saying they know we don&#39;t trust the government, so they created a fake anti establishment populist president that our demographic trusts, so they can quell dissent and Revolution. If we think he&#39;s on our side, we&#39;ll sit down and not question him and they can get away with whatever they want.</p>

<p>Plus, he&#39;s like a villain to the liberals, and there&#39;s all this tension between the left and the right.

<p>At this point, I don&#39;t know what to believe, so instead I remain skeptical.

<p>There are legit wedge issues aplenty:</p>

<ul>
<li>no abortion vs. pro abortion</li>
<li>less vs. more gun control</li>
<li>church vs. state</li>
<li>expensive vs, free college</li>
<li>private national bank vs. public national bank</li>
<li>illegal vs. legal weed</li>
<li>private vs. public education</li>
<li>low vs. high vs. no income taxes</li>
<li>compulsory vs. non-compulsory military service<br/></li>
<li>corporate vs. social welfare</li>
<li>heterosexual vs. homosexual marriage</li>
<li>country bumpkins vs. city slickers</li>
</ul>

<p>Difficult to focus on what We the People have in common when we are so afar apart on so many big issues that people feel strongly about. And tptb never pass up a chance to exploit those differences, all the while deftly pick-pocketing the vast majority on both sides. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, all one would need to do to win the White House hands down in 2020 would be to run on a platform of 1) free college 2) a return to the 18 year-old drinking age and 3) legal weed. IOnce someone decides to get 18-25 demographic excited and organized then shit. will. hit. fan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see how you can claim to care about any living thing or human rights and somehow not support Trump. The country is in a state of war (information/disinformation) and has most likely been compromised at the highest levels before this admin. </p>

<p>You can logically ask yourself questions about everything you&#39;re told everywhere. I was very liberal up until about a year ago, given the current state options are limited on who can be trusted. If you cant trust the MSM and you can&#39;t verify all alt media sources you have no easy access to information. Massive research in to topics only yields more questions. Most of those questions lead back to sources who provide questionable answers. If everyone is lying, who are the biggest liars? Who are the biggest liars attacking? What are liars afraid of?</p>

<p>The answer comes down to Trump. If those that peddle lies at the loudest and strongest volume and level attack the same person regardless of any concrete proof or even a logical accusation... it should tell most people that A) he either is telling only the truth/partially the truth or some truth or B) he is their enemy. </p>

<p>I am ok accepting that A,B are both true. I am ok with just one being true. If B is true, and they&#39;re liars why do they fear him? Does he have something on them? This is how I ended supporting Trump. A complete distrust of all liberal new sources created on their own a complete lack of being able to verify all alt news sites, you&#39;re left with one logical option: </p>

<p>Support the leader that is hated by the liars. Hope for the best. Hope.</p>

<p>All you guys wish to accomplish to is to destroy this country. I love this country. I will support the man who fights for it. </p>

<p>Nobody&#39;s trying to destroy anything here dude. And it&#39;s not a political issue. We&#39;re just trying to show you how deep the social programming can go. Trust for trump is based almost entirely on 4 chan anons, little &quot;coded&quot; messages that people seem to interpret and everybody runs with it, and his lip service.</p>

<p>He bombed Syria, did an enormous multi billion dollar arms deal with the Saudis, he supports police militarization, he&#39;s an authoritarian all the way. </p>

<p>The &quot;script&quot; for this last election was definitely well thought out and complex. Who knows, maybe Hillary was supposed to win, but after support for her dwindled, they switched to trump.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is, both candidates are preselected, and signed on to whatever the agenda is. The social engineers decide who wins and who is going to be more &quot;effective&quot; of a front man. </p>

<p>This cant be a true statement. Everything that happened with Hilary slightly before, during and after the election should tell you all you need to know about the push to out Trump. Maybe Hilary was suppose to win? Newsweek a formally respected magazine published an article with her on the cover saying she won. There was never any question that she wasn&#39;t going to win in the MSM. Then Trump comes out of nowhere in the northern states, then the stories of Russian hacks on voting machines came (we know the CIA can hack and make it look like whoever they want) we know they backed Hilary. This is enough to point you in Trumps direction. </p>

<p>I know there can be a lot of things going on that I don&#39;t understand, I know there are a lot of things I will never know. I do not believe Trump is a part of this plan at all. You can see the chaos it caused in the media, you can see the rabid nature and continuity of the attacks on his person and family as well as anyone close, you can see the disregard of the media to his global presence (hes greeted well in most countries by its leaders). There has not been one liberal outlet that hasn&#39;t tried to gut him. Even South Park shilled for the left for half of this season. Its ridiculous. It isn&#39;t a humorous attack they&#39;re flat out calling for impeachment and at times execution.</p>

<p>He is the legally elected President of the United States of America </p>

<p>It is a fact that we are in an information war</p>

<p>If you cannot see why you should support him based on these points then simply don&#39;t. Hope for a better future for everyone does not need the admonishment of those that don&#39;t believe. It will grow, it will win and it will be for everyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post seems to hit a couple truths. but i dont think &quot;they&quot; made a &quot;anti establishment&quot; guy. Wasn&#39;t he already for some time ? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those who still have faith in him, consider the possibility that you only support him because everybody else seems to distrust and dislike him, and that fuels your trust in him. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>i think you forget alot of people became critical thinking humans again during the obama years due to shitty politics. and you excluded the past presidents terms in your calculation, like people weren&#39;t tired of that shit.</p>

<p>however, i do agree, it would be the strategy to take during last election. clever play. but i doubt the clintons couldnt imagine this happening. they actually played into this, and drove people into trumps arms, so are you also saying clintons network made trump president ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its funny because its true. They clearly didn&#39;t want him to win, and clearly still hate the fact that he won. I love a good conspiracy theory, but the idea that all of this is just a huge act is too much of a stretch for me.</p>

<p>The more simple answer is that they promoted him as a pied piper candidate because they knew they had dirt on him (the pussy grabbing audio) and they thought Hillary would win. It turns out that they made a big mistake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all conspiracy theorists don&#39;t vote.  Second of all I don&#39;t appreciate you referring to trump voters a stupid, it&#39;s very elitist.  </p>

<p>Also, follow the money and the propaganda.  It was lined up for Hillary.  Also look up the articles from 2015 where Bill Clinton asked Trump to run.  Then the Wikileaks emails had their strategy as making him the pied piper candidate.  She was supposed to win.   If TPTB wanted him in the first place the money would have been behind him.   Also there are tons of protests of him/ so he&#39;s not getting away with anything.   </p>

<p>But I get what you are saying: I didn&#39;t vote for him but the BS they&#39;ve thrown at him makes me want the truth to come out/ and most of the lies are on Podesta/Hillary side.  So it makes me route for their downfall.  </p>
