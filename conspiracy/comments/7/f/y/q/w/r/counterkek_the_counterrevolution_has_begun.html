<p><a href="https://pepethefrogfaith.wordpress.com">https://pepethefrogfaith.wordpress.com</a></p>

<p>Memetic magic is legit and they are literally going to shitpost our way to Trump achieving world domination. The world&#39;s future is copyright Trump if someone doesn&#39;t act. Memetic Warfare is in full swing. The great meme war of 2015-2016 was only the beginning. </p>

<p>The original NWO plan had been hijacked by whichever dark forces are behind Donald Trump. 
Do you want to live in a corporate dystopian nightmare New World Order with God-Emperor Trump at the helm? He&#39;s against the globalists because he wants to rule the world under his boot. </p>

<p>Do you want to live in a totalitarian world where everyone&#39;s microchipped, anyone who questions his authority gets lobotomised. Whilst everyone is living with their life&#39;s ,thoughts and feelings controlled, as Earth&#39;s resources are depleted, mass extinction of life, woman constantly getting raped, the population being grown fat to be taken to slaughterhouses to be turned into food to be fed back to us, being forcibly upgraded to robots with human brains like cybermen. </p>

<p>Negative entities will feed off our negative energy and our flesh. </p>

<p>So why don&#39;t we counteract? We need the real life Korben &amp; Leeloo from the Fifth Element to save the world!</p>

<p>The alleged Second Coming, they both represent Christ and Mary Magdalene, or any deity pair. The battle for the future is on folks, read this book and shitpost your way to a better tomorrow! </p>

<p>This was a huge find for me...... Prior to this i had synchronicity regarding 5555 and then had the idea to get on google earth and see what the distance between that event and the white house was. I almost flipped my chair when i saw the 5555.. miles. the only reason i was interested about Tunguska was because it took place on my birthday.</p>

But, that&#39;s not the one that I was thinking about.</p>

<p>The other one has something that looks a lot more like the meme.  I&#39;ll replay back with that one if I find it, but last time I looked for it I couldn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, they have the inside scoop on a few different things.  <em>At War with the Mystics</em>, a really good album, seems to feature a lot of allusions to energy weapons.  In fact, I think it was made as a promotional album for defense contractors or some event.  Listen to <em>At War with the Mystics</em> from 2008; listen to the whole original album (you don&#39;t need the deluxe version), and it will blow your mind.</p>

<p>Globalist NWO vs Trump NWO. I doubt they are even the only sides in this game of thrones for world domination.
