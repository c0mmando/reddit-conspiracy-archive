<p>I don&#39;t think iOS is sending raw voice data to a Apple data center in NC and that Apple is selling that data to a Canadian government so they can buy ads to target you.</p>

<p>Now, if it&#39;s an active phone call, then that may be different.  I&#39;d believe that iOS or someone is transcribing your voice calls and saving them.  But, I doubt they are selling ads based on that.</p>

<p>Holy shit that escalated quickly... lol</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to have a headphone jack to use a different mic.... the new iPhones come with wired headsets with mics that connect to the lightning port, also ever heard of bluetooth?...</p>

<p>The headphone jack is gone from newer phones for the same reason your laptop doesn&#39;t come with a floppy disc drive...it&#39;s outdated technology and the manufactures decided now was the time to get rid of it. People just get pissy because it&#39;s what they&#39;re used to.</p>

<p>Short answer: wifi sickness is in your head, it was made up by the media for attention and to pander to the &#39;crystal healing&#39; nuwave hippy crowd.</p>

<p>There is no physical way for any frequency commonly used in phones or wireless devices to harm you, the waves are simply too large to push through your meat jacket or spooky layer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If a wave cannot affect you at the power and frequency noted, as proven by every law of physics we know about, it doesn&#39;t matter the duration. It&#39;s like saying an LED a few inches away from the back of your head being left on will have any effect on the back of your head or the rest of you. The study previously linked shows an extremely strong case for the entire &#39;wifi sickness&#39; idea to be exclusively psychosomatic. In truth the only reported cases have been fringe individuals who felt better after moving from a city or suburb environment to the country... which makes practically anyone without severe allergies feel better. Every &#39;expert&#39; in the last 15 years that has pushed the theory in any form of media exposure has been selling something, with the earliest cases being a person that wanted to sell more RF detectors, which he did, to schools.</p>

<p>While there are some on-going studies practically every one completed so far (at least on cell phones) has shown no casual links between RF and cancer (or other ill health effects) when used at a suitably low level (i.e. you&#39;re not currently being burned by the literal amperage in the air.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not the issue.  The issue is the fact that the device responsible for converting the signal from digital to analogue in bluetooth headphones are usually pretty average.  This, coupled with the fact that (I believe) most bluetooth devices only allow for &quot;Lossy&quot; codecs to be used, further adds to the fact that they sound &quot;worse&quot; when compared to wired headphones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Say your listening to CD quality audio. The minute you go bluetooth, that CD quality is compressed into a different digital format. The sound isn&#39;t always awful, but it&#39;s probably noticeably worse than if the music didn&#39;t get converted. When I switch between mp3, XM, bluetooth Spotify,  and audio CDs in my car, they all sound different. CD has a fuller sound than the rest. If you listen to the same song from different sources, you&#39;ll probably notice the difference. If not, you might not have a discerning enough ear</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok, gotcha. I hear you!</p>

<p>So, the thing is, as I like to listen to my music in a certain way (clear strong bass , low level highs (&gt;5Khz) and will adjust my equalizers/effects to produce that </p>

<p>IF</p>

<p>I&#39;m listening to music on my computer. </p>

<p>BUT should I play a CD, I <em>might</em> need to re-adjust the settings to get the &#39;same type of sound&#39; from a CD being played by my computer, Or if it&#39;s played via another device</p>

<p>So, it&#39;s a hassle but you can learn how to adjust the Eq settings so that most things sound very similar for one&#39;s own ears</p>

<p>That&#39;s a false equivalency. There is zero benefit to removing the headphone jack and numerous drawbacks. There are far better ways of storing data than floppy. Listening through wireless earphones actually produces a worse quality sound than wired earphones.</p>

<p>From a business perspective, the cost of sticking in a headphone jack is so small compared to the overall cost of production that its removal cannot be justified as a cost saving measure.</p>

<p>Removing the jack is a blatant anti-consumer move. I can buy a cheap good pair of wired earphones for under $10. How much is the cost of buying one of those iPhone headsets individually from the several hundred dollar phone? More than $40?</p>

<p>I disagree. The analogy is bad because wired earphones and headphones are not outdated technology. Affordable Bluetooth earphones have really shitty battery life. No, thanks, I don&#39;t mind using a wire if that means buying some good quality earphones 20x cheaper.</p>

<p>Before Bluetooth earphones make wired ones outdated, you have to offer something significantly better than the previous technology and at an affordable, reasonable price. Forcing people to having to buy wireless ones and not being able to use wired ones is nasty. Fuck that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Open &quot;app of suspicion&quot;
Remove SIM -&gt; connect to wifi -&gt; run wireshark
Assuming it&#39;s active when on &#39;wifi only&#39; mode; you&#39;ll see a trace.
If not; it gets a tad more complex but roughly the same.  Use an LTE repeater; force the phone trough the repeater then capture with wireshark.   </p>

<p>Audio data is wicked large; even compressed.  </p>

<p>However; </p>

<p>If I were a nefarious OEM I would embed a Voice to Text parser on-board so that the raw audio could be parsed into bursts of &#39;choice&#39; words or phrases while discarding the rest.  This would look like a normal connection load; but the time my would be suspect.</p>

<p>If it is LTE only; and you can prove your carrier charges you for the data transfer; and it&#39;s not in the ToS; you would maybe have yourself a lawsuit (not a lawyer).   </p>

<p>Thankfully; the tools are available to test this hypothesis.  If they are listening; it will leave a trace.  </p>

<p>Happy hunting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost have it right. Spotify is connected to Facebook and Twitter, as well as your phone&#39;s contact list. Your phone knows your GPS location, and it relays that to those services, probably with your permission some how or another.
Odds are that Spotify&#39;s algorithm and their marketing affiliate picked up that you, your friend, or someone you both know mutually has googled something like &quot;Driving while high&quot;, or literally anything related to weed, or smoking, or DUIs and it plucked this relevant ad that someone paid for.
It&#39;s not that they CANT listen to your phone, it&#39;s that they don&#39;t even need to.

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re no doubt getting ready to either pull the licences of registered medical marijuana uses or issue them with restricted ones with hefty penaties if they&#39;re caught <em>under the influence</em> despite all kinds of studies that have shown that regular users have no trouble adapting to doing all the same tasks and holding down jobs just as well as they could when they weren&#39;t.  </p>

<p>They talk a good line about legalisation but they are going to make it as expensive and as difficult as possible by the time they get done with it. It will exist for those who can afford and are willing to put up with that while the illegal and unsanctioned sales will both be cheaper and continue to be prosecuted to keep the cops and courts just as busy with that nonsense as they&#39;ve always been. </p>
