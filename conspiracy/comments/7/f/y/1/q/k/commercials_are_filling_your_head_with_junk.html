       I stopped watching television and listening to radio and got Spotify premium and adblock for websites and YouTube. I can’t watch commercials anymore. I didn’t seem to care before, it just makes me realize that now I don’t consume them, my mind is so much more clear of the bullshit filling nonsense that is commercials. All that useless information gone from your mind, it feels great. We are the product of anything that sells.

       Ugh, same here. It honestly can make hanging out with friends excruciating because they refuse to see it from my point of view. Most seem to consider me excessively sensitive and unreasonable.

       Did you watch stranger things? I almost turned it off halfway through the first episode of season 2 because the ads became so egregious.

       Definitely not the only one. After you haven’t seen or heard them for awhile, it become obvious what an assault they are when you do see them. Literally intolerable. I have to leave or turn them off, and if for some reason that is impossible I close my eyes and ears.
      </p>

       It’s one of the reasons I can’t stand being in cities. Huge adverts EVERYWHERE!

       Its shit but thats the cost of watching tv. actors, production, writers and all the other costs in producing tv shows and films isnt free so they get it back through paid advertising. I dont like it but its not a conspiracy its just business. I just flick through channels or go on my phone or something during commercials. They can pay for advertising all they want I just wont watch them or buy the products.

       I didn’t watch TV at all for a period of about 18 months several years ago. It was very painful and disturbing when I turned it back on, and very difficult to withstand. You kind of realize all television programming, commercials or not, is poisonous to the mind and spirit.

       Ive been cable free for about 4 years. I get the cringe now during commercials on tv when I'm at other people's houses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Particularly ads for luxury items like new cars or watches don't make me feel the same as they used to.  When I was younger I would have felt envious of that slick looking car, or felt like having one might make my life better.  Now I feel like they're just not advertising toward me anymore, like they've just missed the mark on my demographic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it has to do with being away from it for a while and my brain has forgotten how to react to constant advertising.   I just see how silly and blatant the manipulation is, which makes it less effective.

       Stopped watching tv when I moved out of home 9 years ago. About twice a year I might turn it on to see how the msm news is spinning something important. The other month I turned it on. I was quite shocked at what an affront to the senses it was. It has definitely become much worse in the last few years. It made me physically ill after a short time. It completely bombards you with these seizure inducing, intense flashing fluro colours and spinning shapes, overly loud god awful pop music that only tastless morons and tweens would choose to listen to. All the while pushing a constant barrage of 'care free' images of the few socially acceptable stereotypes grinning from ear to ear for no reason like the creepy, brainwashed, homogenous Ikea Simpletons they are.

       Anytime i see a sugary cereal or sugar based product marketed directly towards children (usually by tv commercial) it makes me fucking sick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thinking of how it will impact the child and their parent in the long term is pure evil. It will make that kid crave candy which in turn will put them at a much higher likelihood to be on a path to potential obesity, heart disease, diabetes in the future. "Everything in moderation" some people say. Fuck that, it is having way too much faith in people's ability to control themselves and a child doesn't have the mental capacity to make a proper logical decision against being bombarded daily with sugar ads. What does it all lead to: a much higher risk to the public health system...
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus the way they market sugar to kids (and adults) is so god damn greasy. Fucking colorful animals dancing around making kids days. What a fucking creep that comes up with them. AND THEN they always have the gall to say "ITS ALL A PART OF A COMPLETE BREAKFAST!". I'm just sitting here like motherfucker, do you realize that kids just eat cereal for breakfast? I don't see them eating healthy fats, veggies, complex carbs and shit.
