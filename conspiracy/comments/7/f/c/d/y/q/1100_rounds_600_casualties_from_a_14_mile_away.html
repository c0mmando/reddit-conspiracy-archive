       So he fires 2 or 3 single shots at fuel tank, people start to scatter, fires another 100 round burst, people scatter more - then still somehow from a 1/4 of a mile away still has an accuracy rate of 1 person hit for every 2 bullets fired??
      </p>
      <p>
       If you did that by yourself Stephen then well done...Well done indeed.
       <br/>
       Your brother did say you were an 'army of one'
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit : 200 of the rounds were at 1 man in a hallway who he managed to hit in the leg. So he spent 200 rounds shooting 1 man in a hallway outside his door and could only graze his leg, but then he turned on the crowd and used 900 rounds to hit 600 people a 1/4 mile away with 32 stories of elevation/angle?
      </p>
      <p>
       OK, if you say so.....

       I also hear some arab men used 2 planes to bring down 3 buildings due to intense fires .. back in 2001 i think

       I've thought about that too. Reguarding different world events and them being just a test to figure the ratio of people who pay attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people seem programmed to believe anything "official" they are told and the thought of questioning it does not even occur to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people seem scared as fuck and won't question the officials report and don't like to talk about or gain knowledge about the world we live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there's those that question the narrative and while I don't know anything for a fact I enjoy the speculation and looking at and discussing the glaring issues and inconsistencies in what TPTB want the public to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if anyone or anything is paying attention to how the public reacts than we are on the winning side. Its a lot of generalizations and of course an individuals character decides who they are but to ignore and be willfully ignorant of the goings on in the world in 2017 is not the way to be.

       Not sure if u are /s?. Because, there were no rounds. No casualties. A completely staged hoax. The law suits, of course, are a claaaaass aaaaction. Riiight. So some law firm collects a billion dollars, and the "vicims" remain.. ah snap,

       sign on to a class action law suit. Fuck that noise. You'd go after 5-6 entities with your own viper law team. Impressive shit man.

       Oh yeah sorry, he spent 200 rounds shooting 1 man in a hallway but only got him in the leg, but he used 900 rounds to hit 600 people from 1/4mile away..  Nice effort Stephen

       Now, with that said, he also did this with a bump stock according to the official story.  Which, from what I have read doesn't work in the prone position with a bipod.  So this guy, was a 60 y/o out of shape gambler, with little to no firearms training, and he still had a 30%+ accuracy from a standing position from 475 yards.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've asked a bunch of my friends who were/are in the military and all of them don't think they could pull that off even in great shape.  They said just putting 1,000 rounds down range would be a physical feet all in it's self.

       As for your question, it’s interesting that you’re willing to accept the absence of evidence of a table to explain what happened, but you’re willing to accept a far more complex series of events without evidence. The difference being: one of them fits a narrative you want to be true, and one doesn’t.

       I'm the one who brought the table... to the table.  So I'm more than willing to entertain the idea he used a table.  From the leaked photos of the main room, it doesn't look like he used a perch.  Now, as for the 2nd room that was locked between the 2 room, maybe that's where it is.  IDK because I haven't seen any evidence or photos from the 2nd room.

       It looks like he could have used a chair and couch to rest the bipod on based on a couple photos. In the photo of the inside of

       you can see the chair and couch in front of the windows. In this [picture with from the outside with the windows busted out you can see what appears to be a chair in front of the right busted window. The busted window on the left side looks like a couch is going along that stretch of windows, but it might stop short of the window, I can’t really tell from the angle.

       Possibly, although in the 'in room photo' the chair is next the table, and the broken put window is where the curtain is being blow in.  Mabe he did, and I'm open to those possibilities.  But at least, like you did, give me some factual evidence to base a counter arguement off of.  Thank you for that.

       Just spit balling some ideas as you had brought up some points about the firing position I hadn’t considered. It does look like you can fire one of those

        bump fire/slide fire stocks from prone position

       . Though it seems like the angles would be all off from that position, seems like it would be hard to be shooting down 32 floors from prone.

       That, and if you listen to the audio of the shots fired, they aren't in bursts, but in continuous rates of fire.  Which makes me think it wasn't a bump stock to begin with but was a belt fed gun.  Hence why I'm picking apart the official narrative, it doesn't add up, especially when I hear it was an out of shape 60 year old with no prior training, who managed 30% accuracy from 450 yards going full boar on a bump stock.  Just doesn't make sense in general.

       I've started to suspect there was a 2nd shooter with a belt fed gun in the second room (with the 2nd broken window) and we haven't seen those pictures for a reason.  I don't buy the bump stock/bi pod/475 yards with that rate of fire.  Once you really look at the facts, it doesn't make sense at all, but a tripod belt fed gun, that makes a lot more sense, at least woth in the official narrative thus far.

       This is is the first time that I've seen the killshot/non-fatal shot ratio and I was actively searching for it in the weeks after shooting. I would wager that shooting approximately 400 moving targets at over 400 yds in such a short time span using a gimmick like a bump stock would be very difficult for a trained sniper, let alone a 64yo old amateur.

       Wouldn't it be an interesting show, to get a 64 year old out of shape alcoholic to try to fire off all those shots and be able to handle it. Oh, and maybe we can put up some targets.

       While they are at it, episode 2 could be computer simulations of TRYING to take down the towers with 2 planes.

       Episode 3 could be talking about the new Kennedy papers and watching the video. And then having the audience vote on who did it.

       The fact people still believe a 50yo millionaire with no motive decided to pack an arsenal of weapons, rent a room and shoot up a country concert all by his lonesome are asleep to what's really going on in this world......
And then you have Sheriff Barney Fife making zero sense.

       Sure, of course I believe people can lose their shit and commit horrible acts like this.  But the evidence provided by the officials doesn't add up.  Do you buy the official narrative so far? And if you do, which one, because there has been several stories that have changed over time.

       If Paddock
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       lone gunman, maybe he went crazy staring at slot machines all day, or maybe thought he's seen all life has to offer and modeled after his criminal father and felt compelled to replicate the sins of his father, even if they weren't similar crimes, but held a deep bond with him developed seeing him the few times as a young child, and always looked up to him. Maybe he decided to work for the precursor to Lockheed Martin because it would teach him about armed weapons, and maybe his lifelong use of weapons was intended to result to end in a grand "bang", the cherry on top of a pre-destined life he planned from the start. He was a strategic, calculating man, after all.

       Obviously there are forces (like Mandalay Bay, the FBI) interested in concealing information whether it be for public image, a fuck up they're hiding, or something of the sort, that we don't know that they're trying to hide it because they don't have an obligation to disclose evidence to the pubic freely. The way evidence would have to be disclosed is if their is a court case, which I believe some victims are suing, so that could result in more evidence released.

       Sure it is. But the probability that they have no friends or even associates who could tell us anything about them is low.  The probability that they have no discernible past and that no MSM media outlet is interested in looking into it is even lower.  And the probability that, on top of all that, he had not so much as a single person that he ever indicated a thought to about his motive....is damn near zero.

       Ok everything amount that theory adds up except this one little part: how the hell does a botched hit result in machine gunning an irrelevant crowd 1/4 mile away. It just doesn't make sense to me. They didn't need a cover or a distraction from a botched attempt, and if they did I'm confident the powers that be could come up with something way more discrete than mowing down civilians.

       What distracts more in the united States that a mass shooting? They always(until now) dominate the news cycle for a long time to distract from what is happening in politics. Sometimes in a panic, people make really questionable decisions.

       I mean sure they're very distracting, but why did they need a distraction? Maybe if the plan had succeeded and they wanted to say Paddock went up a few floors and killed the prince and then came down and started blasting. It makes no sense in terms of a failed operation though, why couldn't they have quietly packed everything up and left instead of firing into a crowd and blowing this this whole thing into the public eye.

       It seems that the security guard could be complicit (which is speculation). Even if he wasn't he went to mexico like 3 days after the shooting. Why didn't they just make him disappear? Nobody had heard of him at that point or knew his level of involvement. You can't tell me that people would think twice about a kidnapping/murder in mexico.

       Of course, we will never really know because, to my knowledge, they refuse to release the number of non-fatal gunshot injuries. This information has been freely available in other mass shootings.

       From reading a few news articles it looks like 50-60% of those with injuries had gun shot wounds. Amend the numbers to 250 shot and 57 dead. Still 300 different people hit with 900 shots would be quite the accomplishment at that range.  This is all giving the “narrative” the benefit of the doubt.

       30 years ago, they could have sold the story, but with all of the cameras, and the internet and people working together to try and piece together the information as it comes out, no way they can sell the lie.

       Paddock didn't kill those people.  Perhaps some?  Sure, but the numbers that you posted prove that there is no way he did this.  At least not alone.

       I thought that this very thing, which is why I unsuccessfully attempted to find the number of non-fatal gunshot victims. Despite the teevee trying to create fact by insinuating as much, not all of the 600 injuries were from gunfire. Many were trampled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly enough, when I commented on social media that this key piece of info was being withheld, I observed immediate and unmistakeable shilling, indicating that this is probably yet another piece of information that conflicts with the utterly unbelievable official story.

       It's completely likely the rounds in the gas tank were rounds randomly shot that way be a use of recoil. If he'd used semi auto instead of a bump stock he'd have killed a lot more people.

       You do realize the m16 can shoot accurately over 500m right? Of course you don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       No the official story (whichever one you pick) isn't real. But it's obvious you've never fired either an automatic weapon nor a ar15/m4/m16. You're the type of person that shouldn't be giving opinions on ballistics
