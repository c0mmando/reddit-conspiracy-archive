        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So he fires 2 or 3 single shots at fuel tank, people start to scatter, fires another 100 round burst, people scatter more - then still somehow from a 1/4 of a mile away still has an accuracy rate of 1 person hit for every 2 bullets fired??</p>

<p>If you did that by yourself Stephen then well done...Well done indeed.<br/>
Your brother did say you were an &#39;army of one&#39;</p>

<p>Edit : 200 of the rounds were at 1 man in a hallway who he managed to hit in the leg. So he spent 200 rounds shooting 1 man in a hallway outside his door and could only graze his leg, but then he turned on the crowd and used 900 rounds to hit 600 people a 1/4 mile away with 32 stories of elevation/angle?   </p>

<p>OK, if you say so.....</p>

<p>I also hear some arab men used 2 planes to bring down 3 buildings due to intense fires .. back in 2001 i think</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought about that too. Reguarding different world events and them being just a test to figure the ratio of people who pay attention.</p>

<p>A lot of people seem programmed to believe anything &quot;official&quot; they are told and the thought of questioning it does not even occur to them. </p>

<p>A lot of people seem scared as fuck and won&#39;t question the officials report and don&#39;t like to talk about or gain knowledge about the world we live in.</p>

<p>And then there&#39;s those that question the narrative and while I don&#39;t know anything for a fact I enjoy the speculation and looking at and discussing the glaring issues and inconsistencies in what TPTB want the public to believe. </p>

<p>I think if anyone or anything is paying attention to how the public reacts than we are on the winning side. Its a lot of generalizations and of course an individuals character decides who they are but to ignore and be willfully ignorant of the goings on in the world in 2017 is not the way to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just so we&#39;re cleared, it seems about 2/3rd of the injuries were from bullets, unless you have a different source:</p>

<p>Counting two hospitals, 200 were gunshot victims out of 300 treated.
<a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-las-vegas-shooting-20171003-story.html">http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-las-vegas-shooting-20171003-story.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many of the most critically wounded patients arrived at the 541-bed University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, the state&#39;s only Level One trauma center. <strong>Over about four hours, it received 104 patients. More than 80 percent were gunshot victims.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>On Wednesday, Sunrise Hospital revised the total number of patients it had treated down — from 214 to 200, of whom 16 died and 29 were still in critical condition. <strong>Of those, the hospital estimates about 120 had gunshot wounds, but did not release an exact figure.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, with that said, he also did this with a bump stock according to the official story.  Which, from what I have read doesn&#39;t work in the prone position with a bipod.  So this guy, was a 60 y/o out of shape gambler, with little to no firearms training, and he still had a 30%+ accuracy from a standing position from 475 yards.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve asked a bunch of my friends who were/are in the military and all of them don&#39;t think they could pull that off even in great shape.  They said just putting 1,000 rounds down range would be a physical feet all in it&#39;s self. </p>

<p>As for your question, it’s interesting that you’re willing to accept the absence of evidence of a table to explain what happened, but you’re willing to accept a far more complex series of events without evidence. The difference being: one of them fits a narrative you want to be true, and one doesn’t.</p>

<p>For the record, the question you don&#39;t answer.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m the one who brought the table... to the table.  So I&#39;m more than willing to entertain the idea he used a table.  From the leaked photos of the main room, it doesn&#39;t look like he used a perch.  Now, as for the 2nd room that was locked between the 2 room, maybe that&#39;s where it is.  IDK because I haven&#39;t seen any evidence or photos from the 2nd room.</p>

<p>Only what the official narrative has offered, so that&#39;s on them.</p>

<p>One fits the evidence provided the other (what ever you are implying) is based off of evidence <strong>not</strong> yet provided.</p>

<p>Once again, you suggested me and my friends haven&#39;t thpught about how Paddock used a window sill.  What window sill are ypu suggesting he used?  Also why are you in this sub if you feel the need to defend the official narrative?</p>

In the photo of the inside of <a href="http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3575891.1508479160!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_750/room21n-4-web.jpg">Paddocks room</a> you can see the chair and couch in front of the windows. In this [picture with from the outside with the windows busted out you can see what appears to be a chair in front of the right busted window. The busted window on the left side looks like a couch is going along that stretch of windows, but it might stop short of the window, I can’t really tell from the angle. </p>

Mabe he did, and I&#39;m open to those possibilities.  But at least, like you did, give me some factual evidence to base a counter arguement off of.  Thank you for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That, and if you listen to the audio of the shots fired, they aren&#39;t in bursts, but in continuous rates of fire.  Which makes me think it wasn&#39;t a bump stock to begin with but was a belt fed gun.  Hence why I&#39;m picking apart the official narrative, it doesn&#39;t add up, especially when I hear it was an out of shape 60 year old with no prior training, who managed 30% accuracy from 450 yards going full boar on a bump stock.  Just doesn&#39;t make sense in general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve started to suspect there was a 2nd shooter with a belt fed gun in the second room (with the 2nd broken window) and we haven&#39;t seen those pictures for a reason.  I don&#39;t buy the bump stock/bi pod/475 yards with that rate of fire.  Once you really look at the facts, it doesn&#39;t make sense at all, but a tripod belt fed gun, that makes a lot more sense, at least woth in the official narrative thus far.</p>

<p>Of course, we will never really know because, to my knowledge, they refuse to release the number of non-fatal gunshot injuries. This information has been freely available in other mass shootings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From reading a few news articles it looks like 50-60% of those with injuries had gun shot wounds. Amend the numbers to 250 shot and 57 dead. Still 300 different people hit with 900 shots would be quite the accomplishment at that range.  This is all giving the “narrative” the benefit of the doubt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its as believable as Jack Ruby committing suicide in his cell hours before his deposition into the assassination of JFK.  </p>

<p>30 years ago, they could have sold the story, but with all of the cameras, and the internet and people working together to try and piece together the information as it comes out, no way they can sell the lie.</p>

<p>Paddock didn&#39;t kill those people.  Perhaps some?  Sure, but the numbers that you posted prove that there is no way he did this.  At least not alone.</p>

<p>Thanks for running the numbers and posting this.  It is really eye opening and sheds a lot of light on what happened.</p>

<p>Everyone, we need to keep this story alive and keep pressing for answers.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought that this very thing, which is why I unsuccessfully attempted to find the number of non-fatal gunshot victims. Despite the teevee trying to create fact by insinuating as much, not all of the 600 injuries were from gunfire. Many were trampled.  </p>

<p>Interestingly enough, when I commented on social media that this key piece of info was being withheld, I observed immediate and unmistakeable shilling, indicating that this is probably yet another piece of information that conflicts with the utterly unbelievable official story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s completely likely the rounds in the gas tank were rounds randomly shot that way be a use of recoil. If he&#39;d used semi auto instead of a bump stock he&#39;d have killed a lot more people. </p>

<p>You do realize the m16 can shoot accurately over 500m right? Of course you don&#39;t. </p>

<p>No the official story (whichever one you pick) isn&#39;t real. But it&#39;s obvious you&#39;ve never fired either an automatic weapon nor a ar15/m4/m16. You&#39;re the type of person that shouldn&#39;t be giving opinions on ballistics </p>
