    <div class="md"><p>Yes! Over the past 6 months or so it has gotten BAD for me. Everyday. Some days are worse than others. But it&#39;s either long, low ringing, or a sudden high pitched tone in one ear for about a minute or 2. </p>

<p>It&#39;s getting annoying. Trying to go to sleep when it&#39;s really loud is almost impossible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have it bad. Oct 2001 it was so bad that I went to see my military doc, hearing tests and physical exams just showed some damage from an explosion near me in 1998.</p>

<p>It was hitting me in waves, no one else around me could hear it.</p>

<p>I tried white noise fans and cotton balls but they didn’t help. I did however get those awesome noise canceling headphones for Christmas and miraculously the noise was gone when I wore them.</p>

<p>It was not tinnitus, it was external. I still don’t know what I was listening too but it was very irritating and quite honestly pissed me off.</p>

<p>Here is what I learned from my experience. Noise canceling headphones and my basement works when the noise is faint. I have access to two sound proof audio testing rooms and with headphones on, it works when the noise is louder. But I can only go in them when no one is around.</p>

<p>What I know is, there is a difference between this high pitched noise and my tinnitus, but it’s close. It is external. It comes in waves but the tone can be steady while it lasts. I experience it at different volumes and I have yet to find someone else who hears it when I hear it.</p>

<p>What I don’t know. Is it real or am I psychotic. If it is real, what is it? The easiest answer is I am just imagining it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very enlightening thanks. I’ve read others mention they are the only one in the room who hears it. No history or ear damage. They weren’t musicians or around loud noises all the time.</p>

<p>I wonder if it targets some people or if they’re just more sensitive to it. The whole Cuban thing with US Diplomats complaining about it really had me stand up straight and notice. Maybe even the US Government aren’t behind it? Cuban Government denied it too. Maybe a private company testing something, Aliens?</p>

<p>Anytime  anyone here hears  it or something changes, unusual please make a post and note the time, maybe someone else here heard it at the exact same time?</p>

<p>Wonder if it’s related to the boom sounds heard worldwide lately?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it probably does just effect certain people. You only have to look at the anti social behaviour alarms they have in my country. They detect when kids are hanging around shops or places that anti social behaviour is happening. They send out a high pitched annoying frequency that only teenagers can hear so it does not effect the public ie adults. This can obviously be used in many different ways and strengths. 
Have a look at this video from 02.35 it explains about high frequency weapons.

Sometimes it flares up and sounds like a grenade went off like in the movies and stays that way in one or both ears for awhile few seconds to few minutes long.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe tinnitus is becoming more common since it results from a nutritional deficiency/toxic exposure that harms the delicate sound sensing cells. It is further made worse by modern food culture where we eat many meals/snack throughout the day. The body does recycling/apoptosis when we fast, and most people don&#39;t enter this state (12+hrs since previous time of ingesting calories). So the slightly damaged hearing cells don&#39;t get replaced often enough.</p>

<p>I get tinnitus after drinking large amounts of alcohol and noticed by accident that fasting cures/makes it almost imperceptible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did some grinding and cutting of rust/metal while fixing rusted out floorboards in an old van. Basically, I was making loud noises while inside of a metal box, and so the tinnitus got worse. It&#39;s the hearing cells dying off from taking damage.</p>

<p>I have seen so many younger people in public wearing headphones, with volume loud enough that I can clearly hear what type of music they are listening to, that I would be extremely surprised if we did NOT currently have an epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss. </p>
