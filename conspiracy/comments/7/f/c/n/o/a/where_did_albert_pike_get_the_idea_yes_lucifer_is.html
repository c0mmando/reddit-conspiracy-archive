       Did he come up with the idea or was he referring to a gnostic text?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems the elite do believe something along these lines, that Lucifer is the good guy bringing light/knowledge/self-awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there's also a gnostic text where at the last supper Jesus starts laughing at the Apostles, I can't remember which one it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm interested in what the elite really believe.   It's hard to know whats true with so many viewpoints (like what evil power is behind the elite, some say satan, others a Saturn matrix computer.

       They are being deceived into believing that theirs is the true God, Lucifer cannot create, only manipulate existing creation. He is powerful and can grant different powers truth spirits so many are deceived because they receive power or knowledge or communication. He was a high ranking cherub who dwelled right below the throne.

       I do not know precisely know the answer to your question in the title.  Their idea of Lucifer being the righteous one and Adonai being the unrighteous one goes back further to ancient Egypt and even further to ancient Babylon.  The first king of Babylon, Nimrod loosely means rebel against God in the Bible.  In the Babylonian mysteries, Nimrod represents the Sun or Lucifer.

       He is known by many names, others are: Osiris, Apollo, Zeus, Gilgamesh, Adonis, Orion, Bacchus, Ra, Mithra and the list goes on through different cultures in history. If you do some more research on these names you will find that some of the graves were found in recent years and coincide with many wars.

       Yes, you are right.  I am aware, but I did not list all of them out.  I mentioned Nimrod because it is the term the Freemasons use mostly (I think).

       This doesn't sound gnostic...
      </p>
      <p>
       The elite believe that what we call "reality" is just the sum-total of our collective understanding and beliefs... and by manipulating these beliefs they can effect the outcome of events.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evil is real, though. Meaning: an

       force exists that actively seeks to limit humanity as a whole.

       Gnostics believe in duality - good vs. evil, good vs. Satan etc. Both sides of the pole must be present in this reality. Ergo you cannot ever eliminate evil buy you can reduce its impact by increasing good.

       The ultra elite believe they're descendants of the Nephilim, who came from the sons of God copulating with the daughters of men. This is why they are so obsessed with inter family breeding amongst their stock. They believe that they have a divine right to rule because of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ultra elite act in direct defiance to God. Their evil ways is what brought the flood. Then to defy God they built the tower of Babyl. Until he scattered them and confused their languages. The UN building is the modern day Tower of Babyl.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they want to keep control over us and piss off God it seems. I've heard speculation that CERN is trying to open a portal to let the fallen angels out of their prison. The prison they were sent to after the deluge.

       That's very interesting, I haven't read they believe they are descendants of the Nephilim.  I thought the Nephilim would have died in the flood?  But they didn't die but were put in a prison?  I was thinking maybe greek/roman "gods" like HErcules was a mix of fallen angel/human.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also when God told Israel to wipe out all the people in a location (I forget where), I read that it was because they were half Nephilim.  Some people claim God was a monster for telling His people to wipe out even women and children.  Idk, either way after original sin any amount of suffering on Earth for 80 years is insignificant in light of eternity.

        I thought the Nephilim would have died in the flood?

       They managed to survive somehow. There's a scripture that says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         The Nephilim were on the earth in those days--and also afterward--when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It says "and also afterward". How they survived it is all speculation though. The fallen angels may have given them a heads up to build their own ark.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I read that it was because they were half Nephilim. Some people claim God was a monster for telling His people to wipe out even women and children
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The book I'm reading, "The Genesis 6" by Gary Wayne, makes the case that they were in fact nephilim. That would really explain why God of the OT seems like such a contradicting dick. He traces through their history and builds a pretty strong case using scripture and other pieces of evidence. I strongly recommend this book or any of Gary's many videos on YouTube.

       We see from this that Satan is Yah's creation he was created to do evil all through the world.

       We even see that Yah himself gives the earth to Satan at one point but will take it back from him later. All the while, Satan himself knows what his duty is while he is king of the earth.

       Thanks, helpful verses.  I remembered God creating evil or destruction.  For God to know his Creation before creating it, it would seem that He wrote this entire story.  It's hard to understand how we have any free will at all.  Sometimes I wonder if I'm just reacting and my soul is simply observing and has no control.
      </p>
      <p>
       But idk, I feel like God somehow made it where we have free will while he ordains everything, separating Himself from sin since He doesn't sin, but He created beings He knew would sin.

       So we see that it was always through the fathers line that made one an Israelite.

       No. You are not understanding. The documents that you are trying to provide have just been found. I like to look at it this way, the older the information the more proof that it withstood the test of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the book of Enoch truly is perfect, then it will encompass the same thing that the King James 1611 including the Apocrypha does. If it doesn't, then there is reason to believe tampering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you yourself tested it's strength against the King James? Probably not. This is the reason why if you read the Bible, it's not just some comic book where one story matters but the entire thing. Noah's flood is found within The Holy Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point you tried to make was also moot as you simply read my post wrong. I never said God flooded the earth to piss people off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said the earth pissed him off and he flooded the world, thus he is a terrible power to piss off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I quoted
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Proverbs 1:7 King James Version (KJV)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        7 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It is fear and humbleness that will be our salvation for LOVE IS FEAR OF THE LORD.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does one fear the Lord?
      </p>
      <p>
       By following his laws statues and commandments to the best of your abilities.

       The Principle of Polarity
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.
-The Kybalion
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything has two sides, everything has an opposite. Yin and Yang is an ancient Taoist teaching to explain duality in the universe. When we wisely understand that everything has an opposite, that there is always lightness and darkness, we begin to grasp the Tao, the central principle beyond duality.

       You've never heard of yin and Yang? Brahman? The concept that we all is one. Without sin there is no redemption. Without trials and tribulations there is no growth. Without darkness there is no light. Without this dichotomy there would be no
       <em>
        living
       </em>
       because friction and static is what drives it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can debate whether there are subdivisions of the One, and whether they are sentient forms of consciousness with personal goals, but that doesn't change that in the end, it is all One. It's simple math. If you are hung up on the Abrahamic framework you need to be asking yourself why god created evil. Was it a necessary means to an end that few if any can truly understand?

       Gnostics believe in duality - good vs. evil, good vs. Satan etc. Both sides of the pole must be present in this reality. Ergo you cannot ever eliminate evil buy you can reduce its impact by increasing good.
