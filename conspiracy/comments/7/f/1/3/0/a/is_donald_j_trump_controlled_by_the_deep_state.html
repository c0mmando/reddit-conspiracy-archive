       This is a simple question that has a lot of weight to it. If you look at the fact that the deep state didn't fund Donald's campaign, the fact that Hillary hates his guts, he's being repeatedly attacked by the MSM who is obviously controlled by the deep state or he's trying to close the border (deep state wants it open), is he really controlled by someone?
      </p>
      <p>
       I get the feeling he's another Kennedy type of president who is looking out for the people and not deep state interests.

       He is putting life and limb AND family on the line because he was sick and tired of watching what happens to our world. He literally had billions, a perfect life, dream family. Why waste all that only to be hated by most of the world, if not for something you reaaally burn for

       Yea but look at fox News. They are a deep state mouthpiece as well and they could have destroyed him, so many times in the year leading up to the election. But they let him through. Then do your homework and see all of his ties to the jesuits. The people in his cab. The policies of Middle East war still going strong. Sorry but you have to be pretty dense or wilfully ignorant not to see that this is just more manipulation and abuse from DS, the same as always.

       I think it's too difficult to say just yet, they are certainly influencing his actions, but I can't say whether they're actively colluding. (It's certainly far less than any recent president)
       <br/>
       Just because Trump was attacked so much by the MSM and the establishment doesn't necessarily mean that they're not on the same side either.  It could simply be an incredible act of reverse psychology, as a lot of people voted for Trump out of pure spite of HRC.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a possible outcome is that a very powerful person or group of people are directing Trump on how to get rid of the cabal, and pedophilia networks - in order to truly free America.  If Trump accomplishes this his approval ratings will skyrocket, and the people pulling the strings might reveal themselves and 'suggest' a new world order that is less sinister than what we all fear.  I'll be the first to admit that this is very much a theory at this point, but generally I think the Trump story, and reason why a billionaire wants to run for president and fight the deep state is a lot more complex than what anyone is suggesting thus far though.

       Well you say the 'deep state' didn't fund his campaign, but that's not necessarily true because for one a common criticism of Trump is that he's not actually a billionaire, he's bankrupt, thus his assets are not his own and/or he's beholden to financial kickbacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also remember his campaign was fueled by his nonstop rallying and campaign donations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Data analytics is a big reason for his social media success and outreach, and it is one reason why the Russian collusion narrative is in play, because the DNC assumed for some reason that HRC would have the same organic social media play that Trump had compared to Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence the obfuscation of Robert Mercer, Cambridge Analytica, and Peter Thiel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was it Donald Trump who coined the term deep state?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the deep state anyways?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also when you say Donald Trump is being attacked by the media that's not even the case, he's been unapologetically eviscerated 24/7 by not just cable news network, but every majority information aggregate that exists. Not to be bias but let's be clear it has been unprecedented, and it's not because DJT is unpopular, or because he's a racist, misogynist, it's simply because the media is a tool of the deep state and they would like to delegitimize his presidency, and see America collapse internally. It's not Russia that would like to see this goal through, because no conspiracies involve Russia expect for the mainstream indoctrination of cold war rhetoric.
      </p>
      <p>
       Controversial opinion? Maybe a little bit, but notice how easily people play sides, mostly were all lemmings who would rather sit around and do nothing and hope we are saved, and if not saved, let the big boys play, and join the winning side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately I believe like you, that Trump is definitely the JFK type president, I didn't exist when Kennedy was president or after, but his legacy in America is more or less positive regardless of the things he did in his life, but remember he was the president who was not to be controlled, wanted to disband the CIA, and most importantly restore public control of the money supply.

       I'll agree with you that DJT appears to genuinely care about America, and I'd say a big part of why is because believing he's serving us well is food for his ego. So I really like the guy and feel that I can trust his motivations.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that said, nobody gets to the top in this country without making compromises with tptb. Trump isn't a completely free man, and the people who he has to work with aren't completely free, either (e.g., Sessions), regardless of whether you want to believe they are good or bad. Plus, Trump (like any man) has personal flaws that get in his way, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I see Trump doing is making the best of a very complex, very difficult job. I see him accomplishing an amazing amount in less than a year, despite his very significant constraints and personal flaws.
