        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This gentleman is looking to tell his story and wants to be interviewed. I saw some of his pictures of these aliens and even heard recordings with no video. His evidence is very appealing and doesn’t seem faked. He tells me aliens have lived here forever and they live in the ground. My question is would this interview and footage be worth 4K? And what would you ask him? I pretty much have my mind made up however am looking for an alternate thought process I haven’t thought of as 4K is a lot of money for me and Xmas is right around the corner. Thanks in advance</p>

Also the audio is so scary and unlike things I’ve heard. The aliens in question had no idea the recording was happening. I can tell by the conversation the gentleman in question also lives off the grid so to speak. No internet no tv. Makes the story that much appealing </p>

<p>Demons can appear to look like a dead relative, ghost, or from what ive researched, will appear as aliens for use for the Jesuits, satanists, with the inclusion of project blue beam, in order to make people believe lucifer is the messiah</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are at least 3 different possible kinds of reptilians living underground. There is an ancient race of birdlike raptors, believed to have descended from the dinosaurs. There are supposedly tall ones with black skin. There are also the infamous Draconians which most closely resemble the appearance behavior of our myths of demons. The truth is just that they torture other conscious to get high on its loosh. They are druggies and their drug comes from tormenting others. They are also very psychic and disrespectful in its use. Some have called interfacing with them akin to mind rape. They are adepts at being self-serving parasites, seeking slavery and suffering for others. I wish everyone who wants to keep them could be damned to hell with them. Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;ll create the props themselves. It&#39;s their pleasure.</p>

<p>However, there are also reports of many other ET races living underground. Many of them may only have small outposts, while others have millions of inhabitants. There is mention of a race that resembles elephants in the face called the darrow. There are various human looking ETs. There are even some insectoids mentioned. This is an interesting planet for many. Some of them have no interest in us, but for other lifeforms on the planet.</p>

<p>Some of those underground are supposedly helping us overcome the Draconians that have covertly infested our civilization to assimilate it.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t know until we have sufficient evidence. </p>

<p>How long have you been on Earth? What caused you to leave your home planet? What does your diet consist of on Earth? What adaptations needed to be made to live on Earth? How are all of your daily living needs met? Are you aware of other beings not from Earth living among us? Are you aware of underground networks where other extraterrestrials / humans live ?  What type of craft was used to reach Earth? What is its means of propulsion? What was its maximum cruising speed? Are you still in possession of this technology?</p>

<p>Questions... What does he know about other &#39;caves&#39; and civilisations in Earth, or are they completely on their own cut off from the rest? Special technologies they use? How do they get fresh air? Light? Does he know anything about the central Earth cavity and does it have a central sun? Do they have a similar setup?</p>

<p>Make sure he&#39;s real. Genetic differences etc. I&#39;d assume they have differences from the surface population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was a kid, a being made of light visited me. I was 6 years old.</p>

<p>People could dismiss the following story as a kid dreaming, or making things up, but what I saw is still as clear in my head as my mother&#39;s face back then. I can remember my childhood as well as I can remember any part of my life. Hell, my earliest memory is literally wearing a diaper and pooping it in when my mom was trying to potty train me. At age 13. </p>

<p>(Jokes. I was around 1 or 2 years old in that memory. The point is, I have the uinfortunate recollection of shitting in my diaper as a kid. Mom chased me up the stairs when she saw me grunting, and I threw my bedroom door closed and finished the deed like a boss.)</p>

<p>Anyways, so when I was a kid, I used to have bad nightmares, like any kid does. I&#39;d often crawl into my parents room at night and sleep at the end of their bed. These continued on for almost all of my childhood. I can even remember my worst nightmares as a little kid. One of them involved &quot;Satan&quot; (my family was religious) chasing me around with a puppet of Grover from Sesame street. Satan, in the dream, was a man with a decapitated head. He had no head, just a severed, bloody neck stump, with a long iron nail sticking out of it. Disgusting, I know. I remember that being one of the most terrifying dreams I&#39;d ever had, despite the ludicrous aspect of him biting me with a Grover puppet. (Listen, if a guy with no head and a nail in his neck was attacking you with a Grover puppet, you&#39;d be pissing yourself too.) Even as the dream began to end and I had finally fled that horrific neck-stumped &quot;satan&quot;, I can remember being in a &quot;saloon&quot; (my knowledge of which came from Looney Toons cartoons) with a &quot;connect the dots&quot; on the wall. I watched as someone &quot;connected the dots&quot;, and when they did, the resulting image turned into a large fleshy eyeball on the wall, which wriggled around terrifyingly, and then glared at me.</p>

<p>So yeah, I&#39;m just setting the stage here to let you all know that I remember my childhood vividly, including the nightmares I had. </p>

<p>My dad was a pilot, so while I was growing up he&#39;d often be away flying for 7 or even 8 days at a time. During one of his frequent overseas trips I was having a bad bout of nightmares, so I was sleeping along side my mom&#39;s bed in my worn out &quot;Get-along Gang&quot; sleeping bag. For those of you who don&#39;t know what that is, it was a crappy 80&#39;s cartoon about a bunch of idiot animal characters. Youtube it. It&#39;s typical childerns entertainment, but I loved it like any kid would. </p>

<p>So this one night, I woke up in the dark in this sleeping bag next to mom&#39;s bed. I&#39;d had some sort of nightmare, however I unfortunately can&#39;t remember what it was about, and I wish I could for the sake of my story. In any case, I wake up feeling scared, get up on my knees, and shake my mom awake. </p>

<p>&quot;Mom, mom I had a bad dream. I had a bad dream!&quot;</p>

<p>Mom wakes up and comforts me. She tells me that the reason I had a bad dream was because I watched Transformers at Chris&#39;s house. Chris was a childhood school friend that I had recently had a playdate with. Chubby asian kid. During the playdate he hit his sister on the head with a hammer while we were playing outside (Not hard, just a dumb bonk on the head) and she went inside, told on him, and I had to sit for an hour in the hallway waiting for my mom to pick me up because he was sent to his room over it. But yeah, I watched an episode of Transformers with him before that.  Since my parents were super religious at the time, anything even close to being violent, including robots shooting lasers at each other, was a big no-no in our household. Mom had found out that I had watched a single episode of Transformers with Chris and scolded me for it days earlier. (I could go into a lot more about what my upbringing was like, but my parents did the best they knew how to. They were simply just idiots.)</p>

<p>Anyways, I wake up in my Get-along Gang sleeping bag next to mom&#39;s bed, shake mom awake because I had a bad dream, mom tells me that I had a bad dream because I watched Transformers, and tells me not to think about them, and that then I&#39;ll be able to sleep. She rolls over and goes back to sleep herself. So given her counsel, I kneel on my sleeping bag, facing her bedside table, and start childishly repeating the mantra to myself, </p>

<p>&quot;No Transformers. No Transformers. No Transformers.&quot; </p>

<p>Even looking back at this is hilarious to me, because it&#39;s such a little kid thing to do. &quot;I had a bad dream, mom said not to think about Transformers, so let&#39;s get &#39;er done. No Transformers. No Transformers. No Transformers...&quot; </p>

<p>Now here&#39;s the meat and potatoes of my experience.</p>

<p>As I was chanting this to myself, I felt someone touch me on my back. Being a child in the dark, with no one else home but my mother and younger brother, this should have instantly made me scream. I&#39;m 35, and if I was in bed right now, and I felt a hand on my back, I&#39;d lose my shit.</p>

<p>But I didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>This wasn&#39;t just any touch however. It wasn&#39;t just a hand on my back, or a finger poking me. See, as a little kid, I would wear these shitty kid pajamas with a shitty elastic waisdtband. I&#39;d run around the house like an idiot, they&#39;d get all twisted up, and my father would fix the twisted waistband for me by runninmg his thumbs along their edges and straightening them out. He did it frequently. &quot;Johnny, your pajamas are all twisted up! Come here!&quot; Then he&#39;d straighten out the waistband for me.</p>

<p>So as I was chanting &quot;No Transformers&quot; by myself, alone in the dark, with my dad away flying the DC-10, something reached out behind me, and did that very same, exact, &quot;waist-band straightening-out&quot; thing on my pajamas. </p>

<p>Again, I should and shit my fucking pants, because dad was away flying, mom was asleep, my brother was sleeping in his room down the hall, and I was the only one awake. </p>

<p>But somehow, I wasn&#39;t scared by this. I just simply turned around.</p>

<p>What I saw, was a being made of light, sitting at the end of my sleeping bag. I can draw exactly what I saw. It&#39;s still in my memory as clear as anything was back then. It looked like a person. Like a human. Specifically a human male. It was human size, and it was sitting on the ground with it&#39;s legs bent, and sort of holding it&#39;s arms across it&#39;s knees, like someone would sit on the ground. It was bright. Very bright. To the extent that I can remember squinting. Light shone from all of it&#39;s body to the point where I couldn&#39;t make out any definite facial features. Like, think of taking a photograph of someone, putting it into photoshop, and turning the breightness all the way up so the shape of the head is still there, but you can&#39;t see the eyes or nose or anything; all you can see is a bright outline of a human figure. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s something even more strange though that I remember specifically: despite the fact that whatever this was was so bright I couldn&#39;t see it&#39;s face and had to quint at it, it didn&#39;t illuminate the rest of the room. I mean, if you take a halogen floodlight and put it in a room in the middle of the night, it will light up everything else. But this thing didn&#39;t. Everything else in the room was still dark, but somehow, this thing was glowing like the sun, but not lighting anything else up.</p>

<p>Now, this should have been the most terrifying experience of my entire life. A scared little kid feels something touch him in the middle of the night, and sees a glowing human in his mom&#39;s bedroom. But somehow, some-fucking-how, I didn&#39;t feel any fear. Like, literally, no fear at all. No fear, no anxiety, nothing anything even close to it. All I felt, was confusion. I was confused. I didn&#39;t know what I was seeing. I looked at it, for a good ten seconds at least, squinting, thinking in my childish brain, &quot;...what...what is that? What is that thing? How did that get there? What....what is this?&quot;</p>

<p>It just sat there. I couldn&#39;t tell if it was looking directly at me, but I remember watching it as it just sat there, and I tried to reason what the fuck I was looking at. I just looked, and looked.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Johnny_Oldschool.html">Johnny_Oldschool</a> 2017-11-26</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Now, in my childish brain, I knew that things like this simply couldn&#39;t be. &quot;There&#39;s no way a glowing human could exist at the end of my sleeping bag. Those sorts of things only happen in dreams. Aha! I&#39;m dreaming! Okay, I better wake mom up again and tell her I&#39;m having a bad dream!&quot;</p>

<p>So I turned from this figure and started shaking mom, saying &quot;Mom, mom I think I&#39;m having a bad dream, mom wake up.&quot; </p>

<p>She murmered and didn&#39;t wake up this time, and after I abandoned my effort of shaking her, I looked back to the end of my sleeping bag, only to see the darkness of the room. Very, very puzzled, I crawled back inside of my sleeping bag, laid down, and eventually went back to sleep. </p>

<p>To this day my mother remembers me waking her up that night, and telling her the story the next morning. I&#39;ve even talked to her about it in recvent years and she says &quot;Yeah I remember you waking me up that night.&quot;  I&#39;ve never forgotten what I felt and saw that night, but for so many years of my adult life, I never talked about it, with anyone. I&#39;m not even sure why. Now, you&#39;d think that this sort of event would be (and is) the most significant thing that had ever happened to me. So why wouldn&#39;t I talk about that constantly? I&#39;m still trying to figure that out. I&#39;m 35, and it almost feels that the same way that I didn&#39;t feel any fear over this happening, is almost the same way I never questioned why I never talked to people about it.</p>

<p>Now, of course, a person might be reluctant to talk about this sort ofd thing happening to them because they don&#39;t want the people in their life to think they&#39;re crazy, or a lunatic, or making up bullshit for attention. And I think that maybe that&#39;s part of why I never talked about this for so long. But right now as I&#39;m writing this, it almost feels like it was something more thasn that. Like, it was less that I was afraid of sharing it, and more that for some strange reason, I just simply didn&#39;t. It&#39;s hard for me to explain right now. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent a lot of time thinking about the experience in my adult life now though. As real as any childhood birthday party or recess game of hockey (Yeah I&#39;m Canadian), I have a clear memory of feeling something touch me on my back in the same way my father would, and then seeing a being made of light sitting a few feet away from me.</p>

<p>These are the conclusions I&#39;ve drawn from this experience:</p>

<p>One, whatever this was, it had either watched me, or somehow knew how to first initiate contact with me in a way that I would find personable and loving. My father is a very gentle and kind man. When I was 20, I moved back home with a cat that had fleas. I remember coming upstairs as he was giving him a flea bath in the bathroom, and he was speaking to this tiny creature with the most comforting and soft voice, trying to help him through the experience as gently as possible. I tear up when I think about it, because I always imagine how much more gently he must have treated me when I was an infant.</p>

<p>So whatever this being made of light was, it knew that it should replicate a touch that only dad ever gave me, in a fatherly way. It somehow knew that fixing my shitty pajama pants waistband was something I&#39;d recognize as a loving fatherly touch. </p>

<p>Two, I never felt any fear when I saw it. I&#39;m 35, and when the same cat that my father gave a fleabath to jumps out at me in the dark (cause he&#39;s a fuckhead. Siamese cats basically hate you as much as they love you), I still jump. But somehow when I saw a human figure made of light a few feet from my sleeping bag, I didn&#39;t feel any fear. Like at all. I just looked at it. I looked at it like I&#39;d look at a member of my family. But even then, if my dad had suddenly materialized at the end of my sleeping bag, and I turned around and saw him, I would have jumped and been startled. I mean obviously. He was away flying, and to see him appear would have been like seeing anyone appear when they shouldn&#39;t be able to.</p>

<p>Three, whatever this was, I think that it appeared to me for many reasons, some of which I might not understand for many years still, but right now I think that one of the reasons it appeared to me was to allow me to have a much deeper perspective on what this existence is. I&#39;m a well adjusted adult who lives in a nice part of town, attends a college that he&#39;s dedicated to and successful in, and yet I&#39;ve had an experience which lets me know that there are things about this existence which we haven&#39;t even scratched the surface of. That there are life forms which are wholelly different than what we are, that have interactions with us.</p>

<p>Four, I think that whatever this was interacted with me at exactly the right time. As an adult, if this happened to me, I might be traumatized. Or maybe, I would just not experience any fear, and be fine with it, like I did as a child. But I think if I had experienced this as an adult, it would have been much different. I would react differently. I wouldn&#39;t accept it in the same way. </p>

<p>For anyone still reading, be skeptical. I don&#39;t blame you one bit for being skeptical. I mean, how could you not be. The few times I&#39;ve told this story though, what I get back is, &quot;well you must have been dreaming&quot;. I wasn&#39;t though. Ever had a dream where during it, everything was absolutely real, and when you finally wake up, you&#39;re insanely relieved that it was just a dream? Like a dream where your best friend dies, or a family member dies, and it&#39;s completely real to you, and then when you wake up, you&#39;re so fucking relieved that it was just a dream? </p>

<p>That&#39;s no different than when I was a kid, and woke up from my &quot;Satan with a decapitated neck and a Grover puppet that was biting me&quot; dream. When you wake up, you know that it was just a dream. Me seeing this light being at the end of my sleeping bag, it just simply wasn&#39;t a dream. I was awake.</p>

<p>This experience is why it&#39;s easier for me to listen to stories and accounts of &quot;Close encounters of the third kind&quot; and such. It&#39;s why it&#39;s easier for me to listen to some really far out tales that sound like bullshit fantasy, and actually consider them as perhaps possible, because I have one of my own.</p>

<p>And again, I&#39;m not some weirdo basement guy who just makes shit up on reddit because his life sucks. I&#39;m an artist, I go to a good college, I have a great life for myself. Broke up with my girlfriend recently because we just weren&#39;t clicking, got sad about it, drank alot, got over it, just a regular human like anyone else. </p>

<p>But I saw a being made of light visit me when I was a kid. And not just visit, but touch me in a way that only my father tenderly touched me his son.</p>

<p>It&#39;s still as weird to me as it is to you reading this. But that&#39;s the reality of this world I find myself in. It&#39;s not what we think it is. It&#39;s far, far more.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks! I&#39;m not much of a writer outside of internet posts, but when I do post something important to me I try to spend a decent amount of time on it. The way I see it, for me to tell others about an experience that is pretty unbelievable, I need to humanize myself as much as possible. Everything I wrote here is as true as I know how to make it, and I tried to do so in a way that would come across as genuine. </p>

<p>Life is a weird place. I&#39;m behind a month on my rent, my cat pooped in my studio today, and I saw some sort of energy light being when I was a kid. We really have very little clue as to what the true nature of our existence is at all. At least, that&#39;s how I see things, based on what I&#39;ve experienced. </p>
