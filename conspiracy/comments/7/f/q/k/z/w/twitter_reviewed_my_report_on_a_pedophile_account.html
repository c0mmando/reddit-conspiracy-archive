       No. Every pedo must be flushed out and rounded up, hang them or make them walk the plank. I don't want the child molester 4 doors down from me any more than I want him making local or natiina l laws.

       I'm not trying to support pedophilia here, but if this individual is being truthful about not being a molester, nor advocating to do such and seemingly trying to spread awareness about the existence of pedophiles that do not wish to act upon it, then why is this a problem?
We're supposed to have free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was there anything else you saw besides what is in the image?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems on a surface level that the "pedophile # molester" line is there to communicate that those are not mutually inclusive, although I'd say it's poorly conveyed and it ends up looking as if he's declaring he is one (as in he should've put the "=/=" instead.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: This will be all speculative from my part. Point just being it seems he's doing an awareness thing for pedophiles that acknowledge it's wrong and spend their lives battling urges.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2: Please offer an argument instead of just downvoting. It's a tough subject but there's little use in thinking emotionally. If this was ostensibly an offender or someone advocating I wouldn't have written a word.

       Its a touchy subject and there are other accounts like this on Twitter. So on the one had you have the "we cant normalize this" side and on the other hand we have the "some people are like this we should be open about it" side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I think this account might be a troll account because some of the stuff on it is pretty stupid. There is a post showing several photos of young women asking if anyone thinks they are attractive. Two of the photos its hard to say how old they are and one looks quite young. The post goes no to say if you think any of them are attractive congratulations you are a minor attracted person "MAP". My issue with this is that pedophilia is specifically about pre puberty kids. While finding a 17 year old girl attractive is not really the same thing finding an 5 year old attractive. While it would be wrong (depending on the laws in your area) to act on an attraction to 16-17 year old its not pedophilia. I think we have all seen young people who look older than they actually are. So yeah I guess to me this account falls under the normalization side of things, and I think its inappropriate to champion these kinds of ideas. That said I think as you do that people have the right to hold opinions that suck. NMBLA is still allowed to operate so why not this twitter account?

       Fair enough, I can see that. I haven't dug any further, but it seemed mostly lacking in content and text anyway.

       Since NMBLA has tried to remove age of consent they should never have any political influence, or have anything passed. I've only been reading more about them now. It seems obvious at the moment at least, that they're probematic and mostly a front for a an actual network. I had only thought of them as a support group that may had tried to lobby for something in the past. They should be disbanded as org (or association), but you know, here in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       this theme being pretty highlighted and mapped out, I think it's unlikely to happen at the moment. There's the other groups and echelons of this going on, and one would have to aim higher anyway I suppose.

       I think NMBLA is defiantly a front and an excuse for easy networking for some sick people. Not sure if you ever saw the interview with Jonny Gosch's mom, but she had some pretty hard core accusations against NMBLA. NMBLA has the right to say whatever its members want to say. Its one of those double edge swords that comes with free speech. Kind of like letting the KKK have a rally.

       Because the Chefs probably share his mentality. Why should they block someone of their kind? EVERY big Company is in the Satanic shit they have to if they want to keep their influence and positions. And Every i mean EVERY. And He probably wrote everything in a way so that he would get in trouble with their policy.

       I think NMBLA is defiantly a front and an excuse for easy networking for some sick people. Not sure if you ever saw the interview with Jonny Gosch's mom, but she had some pretty hard core accusations against NMBLA. NMBLA has the right to say whatever its members want to say. Its one of those double edge swords that comes with free speech. Kind of like letting the KKK have a rally.
