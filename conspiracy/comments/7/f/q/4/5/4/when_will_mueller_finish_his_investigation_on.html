<p>The Clinton Foundation connection:</p>

<p>&quot;While the CFIUS deliberations were taking place, people who stood to profit from the Uranium One sale donated more than $2.6 million to the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>Also, Renaissance Capital, an investment bank with connections to the Russian government, paid former President Bill Clinton $500,000 to deliver a speech -- more than his usual fee.</p>

<p>Even before the sale was under consideration, the Clinton Foundation received $31.3 million in donations from one person, Frank Giustra, who stood to benefit from the sale.&quot;</p>

<p>This is a small part of the big story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.circa.com/story/2016/08/24/politics/memo-undercuts-hillary-story-on-controversial-russian-uranium-deal-clinton-foundation">https://www.circa.com/story/2016/08/24/politics/memo-undercuts-hillary-story-on-controversial-russian-uranium-deal-clinton-foundation</a></p>

<p>If you were completely aware of what was going on with Uranium One you should be outraged, since you were decrying government corruption. This is the highest level of government corruption; Treason. And it&#39;s not just Hillary. It was everyone involved with selling 20% of the U.S. uranium stock to RUSSIA. There is your Russian collusion. If Trump did some illegal business with Russia he should be indicted. Period. People who defend outright government corruption, like you are doing, are a big part of the reason why they continually get away with BS like this. Wake up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya know it’s interesting you accuse me of labeling you as someone who gets their news from fox or infowars but then immediately assume I am a liberal?!?!? Sadly for your assumptions I have never registered as either party and don’t see either as a genuine representation of anyone in this country. The truth of the matter is that right wing media like infowars and Fox News have been the one that have been perpetrating the Uranium One story as of late. While you make points that I have gone back to and re-researched (points conceded), all I can say is, again, that yes Hillary &amp; her husband Bill are just as corrupt as the Bushes, Obama’s &amp; Trump
Family. I just want to say that this deal is more indicative of the corruption of Obama than Clinton, because Clinton’s committee couldn’t deny this deal. Only the president had the power to deny this deal and this should not distract from the large body of criminal activity that Trump seems to think he can get away with and is under investigation for. The truth is everyone in government is corrupt and likely guilty of some level of criminal activity and as soon as you start claiming one side not guilty is the start of all of our problems. </p>

Who would use the term &#39;perpetrating&#39; the news when they are the only MSM outlets doing actual reporting on Uranium One, other than a liberal? If you really want the truth about Uranium One I would suggest you read the many articles done by Sara Carter and John Solomon. They are doing actual reporting, not propaganda. You are correct about Obama&#39;s corruption in this. If we had equal justice under the law then everyone involved in this treason would be held accountable. I seriously doubt that will happen.</p>

These media outlets report on stories with a bias and selectively feature stories on their channels or websites that push a specific agenda. Stop chugging the Kool-Aid from one party. No politician in the house or senate has our interest as their priority. Trump isn’t who you thought he was, no political outsider will ever rise to that level without being incredibly corrupt. He hoodwinked a lot of Americans by pretending to be something so many of us wanted at that position. Wake up buddy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unpopular opinion here, so without further ado.</p>

<p>I think Mueller is actually going to drain the swamp for Trump.</p>

<p>Here’s why: Mueller is involved with investigating actual collusion with Russia during the Uranium One deal and he was shut down. Doesn’t make him a swamp creature necessarily. He is the one who slapped the NDA prohibiting the FBI informant Campbell from talking to congress. He may have been told to to do this by Holder, IDK. In 2015 we have a preservation of records order from the FBI on all communications involved with CFUIS and Uranium One communications during that time.</p>

<p>What this means, if the Uranium One deal ever reaches the investigation level, it will jeopardize any convictions relating to Mueller’s election investigation due to conflict of interest.</p>

<p>Another reason is, does Trump strike you as a shy guy that wouldn’t speak out against an enemy? He has been remarkably and notably silent on Mueller. Once he said “Not fair” but more notably “He better not cross that line” and the world screeched in unison “whatever he uncovers he can investigate”.</p>

<p>This was when congress pulled the chains off Mueller. Basically made him unfireable and some sneaky Republican tacked onto that legislation something about Mueller being permitted to investigate ALL Russian interference. All of this without a peep from Trump. </p>

<p>Oh, and Trump met with Mueller about the FBI director job opening right before Mueller was appointed SpecPro. A job he was no longer eligible for as he was maxed out at 13 years. Longest serving director since J Edgar. </p>

<p>Rosenstein also seems like a pivotal character in all of this. He was the one who recommended Comey’s firing and Muellers appointment as SpecPro.</p>

<p>What better way to give the appearance of non-partisanship that to have an Obama holdover recommend Comey’s firing and Mueller’s hiring is there? All this without Trump ever lashing out at Mueller or Rosenstein.</p>

<p>I think Mueller is just getting wound up and K Street will be gutted first</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. They had this plan set up before Mueller was appointed. Sessions acting like he&#39;s incompetent. Trump berating Sessions to do something. Both of them letting Mueller do they job he was appointed to do. Remember during the second debate with Hillary, Trump said he would have a special counselor look into her emails, etc. Mueller is the special counselor. If this is what&#39;s going on, it&#39;s brilliant. People will be in shock when they learn what Mueller is really doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just google trump money laundering. Do your research on the topic, I assure you there are countless stories written about the possibility of shady deals his properties have been involved with that reek of money laundering. The trump tower in panama is just the most recent event.</p>

<p>Also on the Fusion GPS misinformation that has been perpetrated so much by the trumpers........ yes it is true that a law firm acting on behalf of Hilary and the DNC stepped up funding for this supposed “fake” dossier, it was actually a conservative website that initially began the funding and research which provided the information about trump during the primary season when he was not yet the republican nomination. </p>

<p>Look I like to think that the democrats and republicans are both incredibly corrupt. Most in positions of power end up becoming just that. We can argue forever which side is more corrupt but in the end they both are, at our disadvantage. The truth is Trump is not who many thought he was when they voted for him. He is just another big business republican that has gotten away with a bunch of criminal activities most of his life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When they finally get somebody to drop the dime on Trumps personal involvement, or when they exhaust every possible informant opportunity they have and just go with the obvious obstruction of justice case they have on him. </p>

<p>I’m guessing 2018 for sure, maybe spring/summer to maximize the political fallout for Trump &amp; the GOP. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya know it’s interesting you accuse me of labeling you as someone who gets their news from fox or infowars but then immediately assume I am a liberal?!?!? Sadly for your assumptions I have never registered as either party and don’t see either as a genuine representation of anyone in this country. The truth of the matter is that right wing media like infowars and Fox News have been the one that have been perpetrating the Uranium One story as of late. While you make points that I have gone back to and re-researched (points conceded), all I can say is, again, that yes Hillary &amp; her husband Bill are just as corrupt as the Bushes, Obama’s &amp; Trump
Familiy. I just want to say that this deal is more indicative of the corruption of Obama than Clinton, because Clinton’s committee couldn’t deny this deal. Only the president had the power to deny this deal and this should not distract from the large body of criminal activity that Trump seems to think he can get away with and is under investigation for. The truth is everyone in government is corrupt and likely guilty of some level of criminal activity and as soon as you start claiming one side not guilty is the start of all of our problems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to have a lot of anger about the term Liberal. Also I’m aware of John Solomon, I’ve seen him on Hannitys show. Fox News is no different than CNN or MSNBC. These media outlets report on stories with a bias and selectively feature stories on their channels or websites that push a specific agenda. Stop chugging the Kool-Aid from one party. No politician in the house or senate has our interest as their priority. Trump isn’t who you thought he was, no political outsider will ever rise to that level without being incredibly corrupt. He hoodwinked a lot of Americans by pretending to be something so many of us wanted at that position. Wake up buddy</p>
