        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a very strange trend. The media will report on single incidents about a shooter complaining of being targeted by &quot;directed energy weapons&quot; and things like that, but the media won&#39;t connect the dots. They don&#39;t seem to want to discuss the fact that there is a trend here. There must be an explanation for all of this. Whatever that real explanation is, whether or not they can figure it out, the media should at least be discussing it....but they&#39;re not. </p>

<p>I would even settle for some news articles that say something like &quot;All of these mass shooters appear to have the same psychiatric illness.&quot; Why won&#39;t they discuss it?</p>

<p>The man accused of fatally shooting a woman and wounding six other people at a Tennessee church last month told police he heard voices and had visions, including an image of that particular church, a detective testified in court Monday.</p>

<p>Sampson didn&#39;t recall shooting inside the church and wasn&#39;t shooting at anyone in particular.</p>

<p>Hours before he opened fire at the Florida State University library, lawyer Myron May left a desperate voicemail for an acquaintance with this plea: &quot;I do not want to die in vain.&quot;</p>

<p>The message was part of a flurry of emails, texts and phone calls in which the former prosecutor laid bare his torment: He believed government &quot;stalkers&quot; were harassing him and using a &quot;direct energy weapon&quot; to hurt him. He said that he had sent packages to 10 people that would &quot;expose&quot; what he thought was happening to him. </p>

<p>Am I missing any examples? There seems to be a pattern here. Maybe there is something in the water? Could it be a reaction to psychiatric medications that the media doesn&#39;t want to discuss? Maybe some people are getting some kind of interference from wifi or close proximity to cell towers? That&#39;s a far-out possibility, but I&#39;m willing to consider anything at this point. </p>

<p>If I could find my tinfoil hat, I&#39;d consider some kind of secret technology to mind control potential assassins or something, but who knows...</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of the &quot;audio spotlight?&quot; It is an ultrasound device that can direct ultrasound, focused in a beam, that can be heard only when the beam is directed at you. To everyone else, it is silent. This is already being used in grocery stores for advertising: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HGln6ooGyg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HGln6ooGyg</a></p>

<p>What about &quot;Voice-to-Skull?&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nonlethal weapon which includes (1) a neuro-electromagnetic device which uses microwave transmission of sound into the skull of persons or animals by way of pulse-modulated microwave radiation; and (2) a silent sound device which can transmit sound into the skull of person or animals.

    <div class="md"><p>People can be made to go crazy. Target a depressed person and medicate them with antidepressants to facilitate a &quot;psychotic break&quot;.  What you might not believe is possible is that psychiatrists, et al. use remote targeting via telepathy and clairvoyance plus drugs to do this.  You can even make someone believe they&#39;re hearing the voice of God.  They&#39;ve got drugs to do this to people besides using technological methods, but this should never become known to the public.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is paying me to bring some common sense to this thread: mentally ill people tend to hear voices, it&#39;s not evidence of weapons being used against those people. What&#39;s more likely - that mentally ill are attracted to things like mass shootings, or those people are actually not ill and are instead being manipulated by energy weapons? One of those is the more obvious explanation, why jump to the more complicated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More to the point, the Navy Yard Shooter and the FSU shooter were both subscribers to the same extremely obscure conspiracy website, FFCHS.com (it&#39;s a controlled, disinfo, website, so I don&#39;t like mentioning it, but there it is).</p>

<p>It&#39;s one of those coincidences that sounds plausible, and yet... when you compare the rarity of a mass shooting type with average literacy and the likelihood of pinning their unique psychosis on a single website... and it&#39;s a cause for serious reflection.</p>

<p>The shooter in North Cal last week also also told his family that &quot;the whole community&quot; was against him.</p>

<p>The cause is of all these things is not MKUltra or anything that fancy. Extreme stress does things to the body and the brain that people can&#39;t imagine. The kind of stress caused by stalking, specifically. The stalking is enabled by Palantir&#39;s FALCON software, I believe it is called. That and huge federal grants for counterintelligence ops. against American civilians. You personally probably know somebody in the program. They have no idea what&#39;s going on. They&#39;re just paranoid, and their life is collapsing. The irony is that the more perceptive ones are the ones who start figuring it out and turn violent.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a domestic torture program, make no mistake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please, explain how SSRI&#39;s work</p>

<p>That&#39;s a trick question, because even the people who prescribe them don&#39;t know. How do I know this? The last psychologist I spoke to on the matter and looked at me quizically when I wondered aloud about the use of medication to way-lay brain chemistry.</p>

<p>Do they work for many people? Yes. Do they induce suicidal thoughts in the other half? Yes. Does the doctor prescribing them know exactly how it will help each patient, and what each different drug does? No. Thats why folks go through cycles and cycles of different types until they find &#39;the right one&#39;. Because the doctors prescribing generally are simply taking shots in the dark. Mental illness is mis-understood. And the medications used to treat it are even further mis-understood.</p>

<p>I wonder what give you the credence to say definitively that <strong>SSRIs dont work</strong></p>

<p>Nothing I bet, considering your bullshit is pasted all over this thread like a monkey got out of its cage. You are a total loser, and I hope whoever pays you to come on these threads and spread dis-info realizes you are shit at this simple charge you&#39;ve been given. They should can your ass and get someone who isn&#39;t a blue-pilled fuck to come on here and troll. Literally anyone would be better at it than you. </p>

<p>Harassed a lot with these weapons, the last time I pissed off PTB too much they controlled me to do something and erased my memory of doing it. Woke up not remembering going to sleep, or rather, remembering that I didn&#39;t want to sleep and blacking out not in my bed (I woke up in my bed with some clothes still on the bed that I move before I sleep) I found out what happened from evidence the next day cuz they wanted me to know so it&#39;d scare me.</p>

<p>Talked to a doctor I trust cuz at the time I was new to targeting and thought it&#39;s scary, I&#39;ll get anxiety and the drugs can help me, she didn&#39;t know any better and I believe genuinely was trying to help, after few months of prescription drugs I felt like a zombie and felt naturally I don&#39;t need drugs I stopped and I&#39;m  much better, what&#39;s interesting is the type of drugs she prescribed one was an SSRI that a TI researcher wrote is used for easier control of brainwaves, she said she was prescribing me for hyper-vigilance but <em>maybe</em> didn&#39;t want to hurt my feelings and say it&#39;s for other symptoms, what I mean to say is PTB probably induce certain symptoms with their tech for victims so they take certain drugs.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t find it but I wrote a post that a few times when I&#39;d smoke weed with very tiny hallucinogenic effects it has, they&#39;d induce an alien communication, the night they induced a dissociative disorder symptom I was high on dextrometorphan and made a mistake of taking xanax too, dissociation is a DXM side effect and memory loss is xanax&#39;s. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t mention the xanax in my other post cuz I&#39;m not a junkie, I was a casual weed person and didn&#39;t want shills to derail, I&#39;m not doing anything except very little weed now and continuing to try and piss off PTB to test if I need drugs in my system for their super weird tech to work, and cuz I don&#39;t need pharmaceutical drugs. </p>

<p>Recently a handler was thrown in my life who I found out whored for my other perps (removed that bitch from my life) she kept putting me in stressful situations and could get xanax easily and would give me a lot, made me feel good at the time so I took em, last time I saw her we fought some, she told me her family abused her a lot and was in a mental hospital in a trance state staring at the wall for a long time, wanted me to feel bad and accept her as a friend or w/e but perp or not I knew she&#39;s too far gone and by seeing her lifestyle can be controlled easily so not risking that friendship, plus a little too convenient that PTB know I like to sing and she knew lot of studios and would take me to record crap, first time she took me she left for an hour to get me drugs, I had to ask the other guy why she left cuz I was in another room and I never asked for drugs then her friend sexually harassed me in the studio, so much other shit she&#39;s done that&#39;s such obvious text-book handler crap. </p>

<p>I saw this vid yesterday how xanax is being advertised so much by young artists, there&#39;s a story of a rapper who committed suicide after taking xanax and made me think maybe they controlled him to do it with their technology <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULxmLdpM1Og">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULxmLdpM1Og</a></p>

<h2>Reportedly, extending some twenty thousand feet below the base is a bore hole containing an ultra low frequency antenna which is apparently used for secret experiments supposedly related to Nikola Tesla&#39;s resonance theories as well as low frequency communications throughout the world. Pine Gap&#39;s communication systems are the most sophisticated available utilizing satellites, microwave, low frequency and their own dedicated cable to the U S.A. Also they are directly connected to Nurrunga, North West Cape, Geraldton, Australian Defense Signals Directorate in Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney, all CIA and NSA stations, ASIO, SIS and perhaps one of the most interesting secret departments of all, the Australian Defense Science and Technology Organization which deals with U.F.O.&#39;s and crash retrievals. </h2>

    <div class="md"><p>I tell you what. I know nothing about this, and I surely don&#39;t ever want to know the truth, because the truth might be even more dangerous than &quot;just imagining things&quot;. That being said, look at this.</p>

<p>Some years ago, there was an old man running &quot;Amok&quot; in a very small village in Rheinland Pfalz, southwest germany, near the french border. 
He shot 2 doctors of his, then fled the scene and shot at a policewoman, injuring her. Then, after hours of locking himself up in a market store, he shot himself.</p>

<p>What a sad, sad tragic thing to happen, right?
But he wasn&#39;t just &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;wanted to end his live with a firework&quot;. No no. He said for YEARS he has been hearing voices and that his neighbours AND the near by military facility (Ramstein/Vogelweh) is targetting him with ... I don&#39;t know. Elecromagnetic WAVES and all that. You know?</p>

<p>He kept several illegal weapons around his house, even from WWII. I don&#39;t know yet if he has a military background himself, but still, maybe someone could dig deeper into that.</p>

<p>Have a look if you&#39;re a bit familiar with the german language, otherwise just use google auto translation function. And if not- take it as another proof that &quot;some weird people wanting to kill other people strangely tend to hear voices and or believe they&#39;re targetted by some invisible radiation/waves&quot; or something...</p>

<p>As I said, I don&#39;t ever want to know the truth there, but it&#39;s just &quot;very weird coincidences adding up&quot;, riiiiight...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Going back to Marx we see that Capitalism brings mental torment to the working class. Depression and anxiety are at an all time high in the US due to the technology. Entire schools of thought are devoted to the idea that people are the most happy in nature and not the societies we have created today.</p>

<p>Our schools and businesses have been called “factories of unhappiness” due to the mental fatigue that they put on our daily lives.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend reading Capitalism and Schizophrenia as it shows how we as people are forced to behave in a way which could be clinically diagnosed as schizophrenic, just by living our normal lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 1985 CNN did a special report on radio frequency weapons. They hired an engineer who built an “RF Mind Interference” machine based on Soviet schematics. The machine successfully transmitted images into a CNN reporter’s mind. The stunned engineer said that, given three weeks time, he could scale up the machine to use on a whole town, causing them to do things against their better judgement, see and hear things that weren’t there, etc. The pentagon said it was too sensitive a subject to comment on. Remember, these effects were achieved by civilians over 30 years ago! One can speculate that they’ve made great advances in the past decades.</p>

<p>Marilou Danley, 62, said 64-year-old Paddock would lie in bed ‘moaning and screaming’: “Oh my God”, leading investigators apparently to suspect he may have been in ‘mental or physical anguish’.</p>

<p>Danley’s comments, made during interviews when she returned to the US from the Philippines, were revealed by an ex-FBI official and reported in various outlets.</p>

<p>But the sources are said to have added that detectives are still no closer to finding out why Paddock opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers in Las Vegas, killing 59 people and injured nearly 500 others.</p>

No one would believe them about the &quot;voices&quot;. Everyone would think that they&#39;re nuts.
