       Hi, I helped promote a synchronized mass meditation/prayer to pray for arrests of DC pedophiles earlier this year in March, and I feel guided in my heart to start a series of at least 4 weekly synchronized mass meditations/prayers on consecutive Saturdays to pray for justice, healing, empowerment, and support of all those who have been sexually abused in Hollywood, DC, and elsewhere. My focus is rape of adults and especially of children. This second synchronized meditation/prayer will happen today, Saturday, November 25th 1:11 pm- 1:33 pm (22 minutes) EST (10:11 am PST). Visualize the criminals being arrested leading to fair and public trials and send light and love to those who have been hurt by sexual abuse and human trafficking. Let's pray for the safety and empowerment of whistleblowers too. The intention should not be for revenge but for saving the children and the healing of humanity.

       Thank you for all of you that participated in today's synchronized prayer/meditation.   I believe strongly we are creating more change for the better than we can possibly imagine.   I will be continuing to organize this synchronized prayer/meditation for the next several weeks.   Please join us!  The next synchronized prayer/meditation will be next Saturday, Dec. 2nd again at 1:11 pm EST, 10:11 am PST.

       How does it feel to completely waste your time to get people to talk to their imaginary friends in the sky? Praying does literally nothing because no one is listening.

       These are the meditation instructions for the last synchronized meditation that took place on February 25th (11:11am)
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         STEP 1: Go into a quite place and relax for a few minutes.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         STEP 2: Clear your mind of all distractions.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         STEP 3: Through your mind's eye using your imagination picture John Podesta being arrested. Picture him in hand cuffs and being led away to a police car wearing a bullet proof vest.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         STEP 4: Hold the scene for a few minutes and then draw another picture. This time envision John Podesta wearing an orange jumpsuit and standing in court before a judge.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         STEP 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 this time with James Alefantis, Anthony Weiner, and Hillary Clinton.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         STEP 6: View through your minds eye Comet Ping Pong Pizza closed down and surrounded with police tape. Police are carrying computers and other evidence out in boxes.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         STEP 7: Picture Televisions and news papers carrying these stories. Coverage is around the clock and the nation is in shock.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         STEP 8: Finally calm yourself and clear away all images thus ending the meditation.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       If enough people do this and picture these events in their minds then it will manifest itself in our reality. This is the power of co-creation.

       Pedophile is the US spelling, paedophile is the UK spelling.

       If you believe in a God then you pray to that God, otherwise you just visualise good things happening and focus on feelings of love for your fellow humans. Prayer/mass meditation has actually, weirdly enough, been shown to work - patients that are prayed for recover faster than those that aren't. Here's one exampel of a published study that showed faster healing of bush babies that were prayed for, there are other studies cited in that paper and others also.
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17131981">

      <p>
       And mass meditation was able to reduce crime in a city as part of a study (which OP linked to).
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always been very skeptical about all this stuff but I have to concede that I don't know everything, in fact I reeally know very little about the world and how it all works and I know that it can't possibly hurt to focus on good thoughts and feelings of positivity and love. If nothing else, it makes you feel good. So why not give it a go?

       That's not how you spelt it, so it didn't matter who we pay to, can I pray to Fred? , will that work? It doesn't seem very scientific, will it work, or will we all just feel like we accomplished something?

       I think definitive action is better, personally.

       There's actually a decent amount of scientific research (per your criteria you demonstrated with the statement "It doesn't seem very scientific) that elaborates on the benefits and effects on meditation. There was even one study I can think of that measured the effects of group meditation in particular. You are correct in your assertion on the importance of definitive action, however it is worth noting that action and the motivations and practices that lead to said action are very specifically linked. Meditation can be an opportunity to refine and motivate your approach to direct action. I would even advocate that meditation's benefit on direct action is
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       underrated, at least in my own culture. Also, I am not interested in pulling up said studies for you, nor am I trying to assert that the benefits I have briefly elaborated on are indisputable. Make of it what you will ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

       Not to derail but mass mediation leads reminds me of this short story over 10 years ago. This guy goes into to an office and speak with a man and pitches him idea of group of people who meditate same time every night with all focusing on a person hoping they die. It's morbid but it really got me started looking into meditation.

       It's fascinating how bothered and dismissive some people in this thread are about how some other people might decide to participate in a short pause to pray and meditate today. You would think OPs post was a "command" rather than a kind suggestion.

       Hmmm. I see OP using his spare time to help organize a meditation session. I haven't seen anyone else do so, have you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, if you are so concerned, why don't
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       spend less time worrying about other people and the harmless things they do to be of service and organize something you feel is more useful?
      </p>
      <p>
       I, for instance, am gathering and wrapping gifts today for abuse victim's and their families. Thursday, I baked and donated eight pies to a battered women's shelter.
       <em>
        And I'll still find a half hour to meditate

       . Crazy, right?

       There's actually a decent amount of scientific research (per your criteria you demonstrated with the statement "It doesn't seem very scientific) that elaborates on the benefits and effects on meditation. There was even one study I can think of that measured the effects of group meditation in particular. You are correct in your assertion on the importance of definitive action, however it is worth noting that action and the motivations and practices that lead to said action are very specifically linked. Meditation can be an opportunity to refine and motivate your approach to direct action. I would even advocate that meditation's benefit on direct action is
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       underrated, at least in my own culture. Also, I am not interested in pulling up said studies for you, nor am I trying to assert that the benefits I have briefly elaborated on are indisputable. Make of it what you will ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
