      <p>
       FYI THIS IS A CONSPIRACY RELATED POST BECAUSE FRANKLY, FEW PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF WHAT CULTURAL MARXISM IS.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't help but feel our country's lack of unity is due to far left (and I mean FAR LEFT, not your uncle Steve who's a democrat because he's union) implementation of  identity politics capitalizing on the tiny things that make us different and making mountains out of molehills with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the mass release of info regarding Elsagate, pedophiles/sexual predators in power, rampant gender dysphoria, the free access to unlimited pornography, bought and paid for politicians from both parties, mass human trafficking, mainstream drug/alcohol abuse, where did it all come from?
      </p>
      <p>
       Cultural Marxism was put in place by communist social scientists (Gramsci, Lukacs, Frankfurt school, etc) in American universities from 1950 on, to tear away the very foundation that this beautiful country was founded on and I fear that many of the crazy shit happening right now is a direct product of CM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Main objectives:
1. Destroy the country's faith in Christianity
2. Destroy the family unit
3. Introduction of critical theory (basically stripping away any sense of "truth")everything is subjective and even if something has worked for a very long time you should seek to endlessly criticize it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We send 18 year olds off to indoctrination facilities (universities) and they come out less talented/productive than when they went in. Entering with a somewhat thirst for knowledge and leaving with a hatred/lack of understanding of their own culture and a useless gender studies degree quite often accompanied by a $40,000.00 plus bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       For 4-8 years they are told that White equals evil and anything that is the minority is automatically oppressed. We are taught to laugh at and criticize Christianity while simultaneously taught to accept Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is without a doubt this country was founded on the fundamental values supplied by the Christian faith, obviously we have freedom of religion but to argue this country was not founded by Christians is crazy talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Less than 250 years later here we are funding the mass immigration of Muslims (the likes of which were also flooded into Europe, and are now on the verge of causing civil wars in France, Germany, and destroying countries such as Sweden.)
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2016 the state of Minnesota spent $103,000,000 of TAXPAYER money flooding thousands of Muslim Somalians into small towns in Minnesota (if that's not a conspiracy I don't know what is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anybody with a brain can tell you that a midwestern citizen of America is not going to jive with somebody who beats his wife, rapes children, and walks all over the American flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously not every Somalian Muslim has evil intentions but when they come from a country that has an average IQ of 68 (when we consider less than 70 mentally handicapped here in the states) and they follow a teaching such as the Muslim faith, they can easily be coerced into doing evil while believing they are just.
      </p>
      <p>
       The United States is a shining beacon of freedom in the world and there is no country that even comes close to guaranteeing the individual freedom of every law abiding man or woman.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why is social media so anti American? Could it be the very social media outlets you use are not only owned by far left globalist supporters, but they use it as a tool to indoctrinate the youth even further?
      </p>
      <p>
       When did it become wrong to LOVE this country with every bone in your body? Why are you considered a monster if you believe marriage was created for a man and woman? Why are real men getting harder and harder to find?
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think will happen to our country if we keep emasculating men while simultaneously importing 4th generation warfare, jihad spreading, non Muslim stabbing, fighting age males?
      </p>
      <p>
       When chaos manifests its self in front of you and it will, if you are incapable of producing the correct amount of  violence to not only match but overpower the threat you will be swallowed whole, such is life/nature and has been for millions of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter what the media will ever tell you, when it comes time to defend this country once again from true evil whether it be foreign or domestic, the ONLY thing that will save us is the sacrifice of freedom loving, family having, God fearing, American men. Just as they have time and time again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I'll catch some hate for this post because some people are simply too ignorant to recognize how truly wonderful the United States is but I really don't care.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think otherwise I would love to hear so because like I said freedom of speech and ideas is one of this country's guiding strengths.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for taking the time to read this and have a wonderful rest of your day. God bless you and these United States of America.

       Cultural Marxism was The Frankfurt School's critique of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_industry">
        The Culture Industry
       </a>
       . It was an early critique of mainstream media and neo-liberalism. Adorno had things like this to say:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The Culture Industry not so much adapts to the reactions of its customers as it counterfeits them."
       </p>
       <p>
        "this bloated pleasure apparatus adds no dignity to man’s lives. The idea of “fully exploiting” available technical resources and the facilities for aesthetic mass consumption is part of the economic system which refuses to exploit resources to abolish hunger."
       </p>
       <p>
        "The ruthless unity in the culture industry is evidence of what will happen in politics. Marked differentiations such as those of A and B films, or of stories in magazines in different price ranges, depend not so much on subject matter as on classifying, organising, and labelling consumers.

       This was a pre-internet critique of mainstream media and neo-liberalism, and ended around the time media became more democratized in the 80s, when the internet began to be foreshadowed with Zines, DIY culture, and public radio/TV. That's when the tail end of the Birmingham School declared the need to critique mass media

       "Globalism is communism". Not in the least bit, globalism as we know it, is a hyper capitalistic endeavor designed to maximize any nation state or corporation's given economic sphere of influence in a fast paced  highly competitive and interconnected modern world. It could not be more fundamentally different from what socialism, communism, or marxism actually are. You need to educate yourself becuase everything you have said is just some rediculous parroting of some bullshit propaganda half truth and in no way reflect reality. At least understand what you are talking about on a fundamental level.

       It literally is the primary driving force of globalisation. Maybe you don't have a firm grasp on what real globalisation and globalism are other than in conspiracy circles, but if you want to have a reality based conversation, globalisation is all about money.

       Although I appreciate the input, the men I referenced were self proclaimed atheists with Jewish ancestry. Seeing as how the Jewish faith has different sects within the faith  and they have somewhat varying beliefs between them, I am not ignorant enough to classify anybody under a blanket term such as "Jew" nor do I personally detest any race, as I faithfully believe human beings must be judged as individuals in a free society such as ours.

       If you want a comprehensive understanding of why "truth" is increasingly relative and fantasies abound in modern America, read Fantasyland by Kurt Andersen. He points out that anti-realism in academia is just one part of wider magical and anti-real/anti-science thinking. It is much more than just critical theory. It relates to media, technology, lifestyles and much more going back to the first colonists. It's a great read.

       I'm not fully sure what your question is asking. I think the source that I provided adds to this conversation. Not all on the left are "marxists" and not all on the left think that identity politics are good. The left-right dichotomy is also a false one, but for the purposes of this text, and your question, it might be best for you to read some of the
       <a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/koopman/courses_readings/rorty/rorty_achieving_country_ch1.pdf">

       rather than the summaries of it from a contemporary lens. Rorty has been compared to John Dewey often. His case is not so quickly dismissed as your comment makes it seem.

       A large part of the 'case against' what you write is that cultural Marxism is a figment of the batshit right's imagination, a product of hero worshipping self-aggrandising media whore profs like Jordan Peterson. No thinking for oneself, no consulting original texts, no engagement with Marx, just huddling under a security blanket of misunderstanding.

       Well aggrandize is to increase status power or wealth.  As he is already accepted among his peers as one of the most profound thinkers of our time I would say he isn't after status, if he has never gave one implication of seeking power I guess that leaves wealth.

       You said no understanding of Marx, later thinkers, etc. I believe he is quite capable of peeking into the shallow mind of Marx, or any of his predecessors for that matter, and quite frequently quotes them (and explains what they meant, why they were right or wrong, also incorporating more recent studies and finding to help back up his claim, so I am aware he understands them.

       He's a social media personality. If you acquaint yourself with the writers you quote in your first post (a very rich, rewarding and challenging experience), you'll see his attacks on Marxism are largely strawman. As is, more broadly, so-called cultural marxism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does he, and do you, have a point on identity politics? Quite possibly, but its one that many Marxists - Ellen Meiksins Wood for one - have made in a far more historically penetrating way. There's no need to be afraid of breaking the mold, of going beyond ready-made solutions and looking for other, better ways of understanding all this.

       There's a reason that cultural marxism is not really a thing outside of conservative ideologues. It is not a conspiracy of silence so much as the theories not holding up against the reading of the original texts. The theory basically lumps together all the pet hates of conservatives and attenpts to explain them through an unlikely coterie of foreign intellectuals. The strongest argument against the evils of cultural marxism is the logic of consumer capitalism and hyper globalisation. None of the trends associated with CM are directly traced to the intellectuals (most can be traced to early twentieth capitalism) and most are good if the goal is to create atomised consumers. Rampant sexualisation, hyperindividualisation, mass immigration, etc, are beneficial to international markets. This doesn't make it a capitalist conspiracy, it's just that the combined effects of advertising and media have massively promoted these trends. That's not to say the Frankfurt School had no effect, but they were part of a much broader trend. The CM theory is quite hysterical in the potency and reach ot gives their ideas (which it often misrepresents).

       Michel Foucault was a cultural Marxist who's writings were extremely influential within high academia. Just because you haven't heard of it doesn't mean they haven't had influence. It's public record of what they studied/taught and they wrote it all in their books.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cultural Marxism if you would take an hour to brush up, was a transformation of economic socialism to cultural socialism.

       They took the ideas of Marx and class warfare, transferred it to social warfare because the working men in the United States were/are treated too well to revolt against the men that pay them.

       Cultural Marxism is a made up term based upon the utterly laughable premise that the last 70 years of American Culture has been in anyway directed by anything other than the profit motive. It neither conveys a proper understanding of Marxism nor the chaotic and organic nature of culture. It is part of a rhetoric that tries to repackage bigotry as virtue, and  societal progress as a degridation, by redefining the western tradition as a conservative one, rather than as a progressive tradition based on the evolution  of human culture, society, and thought.

Then when the same cia, that the aforementioned assassinated president denounced, has it's former director, who was also a texas congressman, elected to president?
