        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Now, before we start, a resounding YES, pedophiles are the most vile people on earth.  I wholeheartedly agree that adults who prey on children should be put away for a long time.  In fact, for life if it&#39;s multiple offenses.</p>

<p>But I also see a different trend.  I see that pedophilia (along with sexual abuse in general) is the one crime where public opinion will always be <em>you are guilty</em> even though no real evidence exists.  It&#39;s disconcerting at the least.  I mean, if you are accused of stealing or even murdering, people generally have no problem with assuming you are innocent until proven guilty.  (well, except for those cases where the evidence is OVERWHELMING, like with OJ)  But with pedophiles?  It&#39;s different.  It brings out emotions in people that hasn&#39;t been seen since Salem and the Inquisition.    If you are even ACCUSED of being a pedophile, your life is over.  That&#39;s it.  End of story.  </p>

<p>Now, if it stopped there, I wouldn&#39;t have such a huge problem.  But I&#39;m noticing something else as well.  People are calling those accused of sexual contact (not even intercourse but just nudity or lewdness) with anyone under 18 pedophiles.    Now, I realize that I&#39;m gonna get a lot of shit for this, but a pedophile is someone who engages in sexual acts with adolescents before or during puberty.  Not with 16 and 17 year olds.    In fact, it&#39;s even legal to have sex with teens aged 17 in all states (16 in some).  The only point I&#39;m trying to make is that people have been told over and over again that pedophiles are pure evil.  So, to destroy people, we label them pedophiles.  And that label is all that matters.  You don&#39;t get a trial.  You don&#39;t get to refute.  Once you&#39;re labeled, it&#39;s over.    Does anyone get what I&#39;m getting at here?</p>

<p>I realize I&#39;m gonna get shit for this post.  I realize that most of you will hate me, EVEN THO I&#39;M NOT DEFENDING PEDOPHILES IN ANY SHAPE, FORM, OR MATTER.  But if anything, how you feel about my post should tell you something.  Why are you so triggered with my post?  Have you been programmed?  Are you a tool of this weapon?  Are you just a voice that the people in power use to destroy their opposition?  I don&#39;t know.  When did we become programmed to think that pedophiles are worse than murderers?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So far no one is denying except e super fucked. Thrush admitted it. Spacey admitted it. Politicians likely wont. </p>

<p>The point is accusations are seldom without evidence. McGowan named specific dates, specific locations and witnesses to her demeanor.</p>

<p>It feels lime this question is only coming up since Thrush and Charlie Rose. In other words, you didn&#39;t care when it was Trump being accused but suddenly you care when it&#39;s associates on their left.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These kind of allegations have always be a viable political weapon thats not new at all. The court of public opinion is what it is when it comes to politics. Thats why it typically takes multiple allegations and picture evidence to dislodge popular political figures. Everyone seems to love Bill Clinton in spite of a dozen accusations and logs of him on Lolita express. Its safe to assume that at least some of that stuff is true. Yet oh what a great guy Bill Clinton was is the general consensus. Its always partisan     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its always been a problem. If someone in your community wants to accuse you of being a pedo thats going to fuck up your life. Do you think that&#39;s supper common? In the case of someone who has no money to pay people off then what is the point for making fake accusations? </p>

<p>Do people use sex abuse accusations to stop people from rising to power? Yes for sure they do. In the case of trump there where quite a few allegations just before the election if you recall. Yet he got elected anyway. Look at Roy moore? I dunno if he is guilty but if it is just a tactic it looks like its working to me. Even if the allegations are true why are they only brought up now during an election? Because digging up dirt on your political opponents is standard operation procedure. </p>

<p>Moral of the story is you cant control everything in the world. Don&#39;t be a creep and it very unlikely anyone will accuse you of being a creep   </p>

<p>That being, if you are a public figure and have been, privately, a creepy perv and have been pressuring, threatening or paying people off to cover your tracks, it&#39;s time to have the talk and maybe that guy deserves to have his career ended.

<p>What I do know about Michael I don’t like or trust. </p>

<p>He was very clearly a corybantes </p>

<p>He dangled his child over a railing. Which as a father I found repulsive. </p>

<p>He never admitted to anything anyone was doing while he was alive.</p>

<p>His ranch is creepy for a grown man. </p>

<p>Now whoever ‘made’ Michael is the most vile evil creature around. But I will not look up or feel bad for Michael Jackson. I don’t need to. If he’s at peace my mocking means nothing. And if he’s at peace none of what he did in this world means anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any informed people do, most of his childhood he was isolated &amp; routinely verbally &amp; psychically tortured daily by his own father, and when his dad wasn&#39;t beating him he was allegedly being sold out to old men by Joseph Jackson. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t know anything besides what Propaganda the MSM tells you that much is clear, so stop talking, which is strange since we&#39;re on a fucking conspiracy subreddit, surely you&#39;d think people would see right pass this shit. </p>

<p>This was a conspiracy plain &amp; simple, And He Knew it</p>

<p>The minute Michael Jackson gained ownership of this valuable catalogue of songs the powers that be plotted and worked feverishly to gain access to it. In 1995 Sony Music approached Michael with an offer to pay him $95 million to merge his ATV Music Publishing with Sony&#39;s catalogue forming a 50-50 joint owned venture. It was basically an offer Michael couldn&#39;t refuse because it was very attractive and lucrative. Not only did he earned back twice his initial investment he now owned 50% of a much larger company which eventually grew to over 2 million songs! As a result of this shrewd business move Michael now owned songs by artists such as Eminem, Lady Gaga, Bob Dylan and other highly acclaimed artists.</p>

<p>In a few short years, things became sour between Michael Jackson and Sony. He was dissatisfied with them as an artist and he felt that they were purposely under promoting him. He believed that there was a conspiracy against him and the true aim of this lack of promotion was to use financial trickery to say that his albums weren&#39;t making a profit and costing Sony money. He was supposedly in the red and actually owed Sony money for marketing and promotion.</p>

<p>Michael believed that this was an attempt to squeeze him financially. He surmised that Sony believed that if he got further into debt (he had outstanding bank loans with Bank of America that he was making payments on) he would be forced to sell his 50% share in the partnership to them enabling them to wrestle sole ownership of the publishing catalogue. Things began to happen to Michael, during this time period he was accused of child molestation which he settled out of court for $20 million. After this incident, he was coincidentally once again hit with another charge of child molestation which he was found innocent of in a court of law.</p>

<p>Michael began to speak out against Sony and the head of their music division Tommy Mottola. He even went as far as launching an anti-Sony campaign which included rallies that included slogans such as “Sony kills music” and “Sony sucks”. He also recorded the anti-establishment song “They Don&#39;t Really Care About Us”. As Michael&#39;s relationship with Sony progressively deteriorated he anticipated his exit from Sony altogether.</p>

<p>On June 9, 2001 he even outright states the following: </p>

<p>&quot;The minute I started breaking the all time record sales, I broke Elvis records, I broke the Beatles records. The minute Thriller became the all time selling record in the Guinness Book of World Records, overnight they called me a freak, they called me a homosexual, they called me a child molester, they said I bleached my skin. They made everything to turn the public against me. This is a complete conspiracy you have to know that&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its always been a problem. If someone in your community wants to accuse you of being a pedo thats going to fuck up your life. Do you think that&#39;s supper common? In the case of someone who has no money to pay people off then what is the point for making fake accusations? </p>

<p>Do people use sex abuse accusations to stop people from rising to power? Yes for sure they do. In the case of trump there where quite a few allegations just before the election if you recall. Yet he got elected anyway. Look at Roy moore? I dunno if he is guilty but if it is just a tactic it looks like its working to me. Even if the allegations are true why are they only brought up now during an election? Because digging up dirt on your political opponents is standard operation procedure. </p>

<p>Moral of the story is you cant control everything in the world. Don&#39;t be a creep and it very unlikely anyone will accuse you of being a creep   </p>
