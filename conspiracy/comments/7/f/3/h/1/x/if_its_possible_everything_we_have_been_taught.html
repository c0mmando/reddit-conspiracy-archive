       I am having a real dilemma. I've been interested in WW2 history recently and have done a lot of research. My question stems from information I discovered about the start of WW2, and how Germany was trying to reclaim native German populations in Poland that were separated and persecuted after the Treaty of Versaille. This led me down a rabbit hole...

      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, if he is exactly as portrayed by our education system, media etc, then he is an awful human being. But when you seriously look into it, there is a lot of conflicting information not making it so black and white. Particularly with the Holocaust.

       call it the Holocaust, though. They call it the Shoah. But that's a Hebrew term, which back in the day that could carry negative/political connotations, so the Greek derived "hólos" (whole) and "kaustós" (burnt) were used instead.

      <p>
       <em>
        Technically

       the root words themselves don't have anything to do with sacrifice, there was just precedent for the term which was made up of the two of them to be used to describe sacrifice.

       Have you seen The Greatest Story Never Told? I personally have only seen a little bit of it, but many say it completely changed the way they view Hitler. You're delving into very dangerous territory. If you decide to watch the video, try your best to ensure that you're not being swayed by propaganda. Research parts of the video yourself. Do not be beguiled by fancy narration without facts to back it up. It's a very long documentary, so don't fully form your opinion on it unless you've seen the whole thing.

       The "gas chambers" was the original WMD canard. I've been there and seen them, too. There was no way people were gassed to death in those things. They had wooden doors that didn't even seal, and wide open drain pipes in the floor. I'm not saying the killing vans on the Eastern front I've read about weren't real (have never seen them just read about them in Treblinka, Chelmo, et al) but the "gas chambers" I saw at Sachsenhausen, for example, were clearly not intended for executions. I'm not saying they didn't work, starve, and march people to death, but to believe the "evidence" of gas chambers requires you to suspend logic. The Red Cross never uncovered them on their many visits to the camps, either.

       Curiously, no gulag exists to my knowledge as a historical site. Wonder why that is? What about the millions of Orthodox Christians who were collectivized and exterminated? Even children know about Auschwitz but don't know what Katyn means. That's propaganda.

       They didn't lie about Saddam. He was a brutal dictator that put people in meat grinders. Several do my family members were killed by him.

       I just wish the Iraqi people had the opportunity to depose him themselves, like they tried to do in 1991 without US help. I don't know why we had to pay the price of getting my country destroyed multiple times over and a million Iraqis becoming refugees just because the US wanted the oil.

       It's a figure of speech, you can find plenty of videos of Baathists beating people, making them wear superman shifts and throwing them off buildings, putting C4 on them and remotely blowing them up. It's all on YouTube.

       Sounds pretty literal the way you said it. Was about to ask if several of your family members really for put through a meat grinder. That's shit mate.

       Why do that? Because you need a certain degree of brutality to keep people in order when you're the ruling minority. He also picked up a lot of those torture techniques back when he was the CIA's golden boy against Iran.

       It wasn't that hard, really. My family was lucky, father always had food on the table (a rarity in an embargoed nation) and at my age the only thing I had to concern myself with was shutting the fuck up and not repeating the negative stuff I hear about Saddam. If I was older, as in military serving age, it would've probably been a different story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have some family members that died in the suicide bombings that started after the war too. The country is probably cursed since ancient times and will never know peace, that's what the more religious members of my family say anyway.

       You're right, I'm chatting to a spoon. Can't be arsed, I believe you. I'm hoping you saw the video and aren't just basing this on the comment section.

       Suppose if there was a Superman shirt lying around, The thrower liked Superman, made one dude put it on, sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to order a box of Superman shirts for people about to go off a roof, I can't buy it. Or were they making them in house? buy that even less.
      </p>
      <p>
       You said people not a guy. 2 Superman shirts lying around? fine. But no way were 3 or more people made to wear Superman shirts.

       Oh okay, I see the source of your confusion now, no, it was just a single guy with the S shirt, the first guy, but several were thrown off the building in that video.

       I'm not sure whats up with that video, I think I got it to play for one second then it stopped, it's from 2002, so maybe that's why.

       Isn't a Superman shirt normal clothes? A full Superman costume, sure, make note of that. There's no way he was just wearing a full Superman costume that do. But a Superman T-shirt? Gonna take a guess here and say they are pretty available for most countries in the world.

       Is it not more likely he was just wearing it?

       I'm fucking done dude, this is why it's pointless to discuss things with some people, I sent you a list of videos, some of which include people getting their tongues cut off, and you're sidetracked by some fucking Superman shirt because you refuse to let go of your preconceived notions when met with evidence. I'm done. You can believe whatever you want. Stop replying please.

       The interesting question is what kind of man would it take to keep that powder keg together with the interests of the 3 major ethnics, antagonistic religious groups, rivalling tribes and the influence of SA/Iran/Turkey injecting their own agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       And how much blood will be spilled when somebody doesn't try to keep it together is also a perspective to consider because that would surely lead to ethnical cleansing.

       You pretty much hit the nail on the head at the last line. There will never be peace in the middle east as long as long as these countries, which share a common language, history, and religion are not united. It's very easy to manipulate smaller states, such as Saudi being used by the Zionist, little country-lets being tossed around by bigger players, divide and conquer. Think 1800's Germany, with the hundreds of fractured princely states.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except in this case, us Arabs are too retarded to define what our national identity means and to work together, and will continue to work against each other's interests at the behest of our colonial enemies. The lack of education and proliferation of Islam and its 200 strands doesn't help.

       Yeah, that's totally true. I experienced the same thing in Kigali. It's dirt poor but I walked the streets there in a 3 piece suit (was representing swiss insurance company, went out, got drunk, ended up walking from a girls home at 3 am) with a rolex and you don't get bothered by anyone.

       He saw the Soviets and their Communism as the menaces they were, and his economic and military policies were meant to halt the spread of Communism into Germany. Why on earth the Western Allies waged war to take down the German defense against that threat is beyond me. With American and British help the Soviets got exactly what they wanted, which was an expanded Communist frontier far into Central Europe, including Germany. Hitler's territorial claims were his undoing, and he was far too aggressive with Poland, but it should be noted that the Soviets planned on overrunning Poland anyway. That the "Soviets were in defensive positions only" at the start of Operation Barbarossa is a complete myth, too. "Defensive positions" certainly weren't the cause of the takeover of Bukovina, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia nor half of Karelia by the Soviets.
      </p>

       Hitler wasn't perfect nor were his intentions, but he loved Germany and the German people and sought to protect them from Communism.

       As an aside, I've always thought it curious that he refused to annex South Schleswig even though Denmark was occupied and he could easily have done so. It was the only change from the Versailles Treaty that he refused to undo.

       My neighbors (elderly Jewish couple) were in concentration camps during WW2 and photos of them (can see the wife crammed on a train in the background) were used as a propaganda tool saying that this train was headed to a concentration camp when it was in fact leaving Germany. It wasn't a mistake because there are many photos of this particular train AND it's route which was being intentionally falsely reported as a train which takes workers to camps.

       Just because our system is horrible, doesn't mean his wasn't. The death camps were real (had family escape from those). BTW there are real death camps like that today in NK and no one cares. Basically all systems are horrible. Some less and some more than others. Ours has the benefit of being low violence, high propaganda.

       Having a boogeyman serves to fuel the agenda, while propping themselves up as the "good guys" by default.  Who's to say, he could have been a nation's S.S. asset/puppet.  The harder they bury and ban questioning, the more questionable the official story is to me.

       Hitler psychopath, a looser who but for politics would have remained nothing more then a failed artist. Due to some German and foreign rich people thinking he would make a great bulwark against the communists, they supported him. Hitler then paid back these rich supporters by building a war machine which made them richer. Then he set up concentration camps so these rich people made even bigger profits by paying nothing for production of weapons and armaments for which government still paid for,  and thus made his rich supporters even richer. Hitler at end of war was a meth freak with either parkinsons, syphilis, hodgkins etc..
