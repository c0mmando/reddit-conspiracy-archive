       False flag of China on US soil probably to launch a war between USA and Iran !
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you remember something similar ?
      </p>
      <p>
       They are doing great red pilling on a lot of things, I'm surprised we almost ignore it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm thinking about doing a mega thread with a red pill summary of the 3 seasons ...
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT :
      </p>
      <p>
       Damn this hard shilling -_-'
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you get it ? That's what they want to think that they control all the media, that each tv serie you can see is some of their strategy to control your thoughs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth is : they don't have the control on everything, it would be too hard, there are tons of series coming from a lot of different studios, having a string on them all would be very, very difficult (sure they some means of propaganda but they cannot control this much people without being caught).
      </p>
      <p>
       So the question is : for Mr Robot, is it a secret propaganda plot or just some random good guys in a studio that aren't controlled and that are not totally blind about what is going in the world and know what can happen and what might have happened, and they just decided to show their vision of the world to other people, maybe for fun, maybe for a good purpose, who the fuck know ?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what of these two options seems the more plausible to you ? Maybe you have a third option ?

       Ergo.. Mr Robot isn't actually redpilling anybody, in fact they are further bluepilling everyone by making it seem like such things are just fictional crazy TV stories. You know, so that next time someone tries to claim some attack was a false flag perpetrated by the US government, their friend will say condescendingly, 'This isn't 'Mr Robot' you know' or 'you watch way too much TV' and all their other friends will laugh at them for being so silly, and they'll shame themselves back into their comforting box of lies.

       Sort-of this. In Op's defense, I/we were all there once, as it offered a sense of validation and knowing that we weren't completely crazy, as our friends and family can't even understand these sort of ideas, and lack such vocabulary.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me that it's conspiritainment gatekeeping. Yes, most of us came from (and a lot here are in the process of it, at best, and just don't know it yet) a conspiritainment world, be it mainstream, or the "alternative" to mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be argued that the trick is to keep moving on. Those who just
       <em>
        consume
       </em>
       info will remain
       <em>
        consumers
       </em>
       of the programming. Others will start learning how to learn, how to discern, how to not rely on a "reputable source" but to go digging into virtual trashcans of the opposition and the opposition media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, the gatekeepers will be happy to continue to help everyone become diet-woke, as it keeps them distracted, conspiritained, missing the mark, and not even realize it. It's just a rabbit hole into another fiction, having substituted one for the other. One you start knowing fact from fiction, you can easily google facts to get more facts. I would argue that you'll know it when you reach a point where you realize, once again, that you had it all wrong. But that takes humility and a bit of growing up, in the kindest sense of the word.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that there are some here that think the phrase "Casting pearls at swine" might come to play here, and if so, I hope this at least gave you something to consider that you could pass on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Happy Turkey Day, be thankful for something, anything. It helps, in my opinion. I'm thankful that the gatekeepers dare play the wake-up game. Many will surely better them at it and learn from it. If not right away, then eventually.

       Red pilling within fiction is still superior to blue-piling by realism.

        Truth is : they don't have the control on everything, it would be too hard, there are tons of series coming from a lot of different studios, having a string on them all would be very, very difficult (sure they some means of propaganda but they cannot control this much people without being caught).
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       Look, I like you, so I want to share. You don't have to listen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to be conflicted with similar thoughts. When Jon Stewart first came on the daily show, and Keith Olbermann did his thing back then, I thought there were good guys in the industry pumping out the Truth. I'm currently really embarrassed to admit that, because I thought that I felt pretty aware of things back then, and I still think that I reasonably did, in spite of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've now known plenty of really talented musicians, artists, film-makers, actors, tech start-up types, and other creatives. Hometown heros that you'll never hear of. I've known people that had a shot in the industry and didn't have longevity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, here's how I see it. There's a lot of talent out there and not everyone makes it in. And by in, I mean getting the opportunity to have wide distribution. They're controlling the people that are producing things by controlling who gets to get in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes with tech companies. People and business don't succeed because they're the best, there's a lot of good people and business models that are worthy of investing in. They succeed because money is pumped into them. Money is pumped into them because there are strings (and/or majority stake) attached to the money.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you're not in, you're not gonna get seen, heard, distributed or bought/used as much as the competition. "They" invest in the ones that accept that they" must align to the needs of the business", ie controlled, and that's what we get to see. it's the nature of the beast.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, in regard to TV/movie media, I'm not talking about the actors, I'm talking about the writers and producers. Nothing isn't put out there that isn't allowed or meant to be. Nothing "slips by". It's borderline scientific. It has to be, if it is to stay profitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, scripts and narratives are commissioned and called for. There's a lot more tavistockian things going on than we were raised to believe. I would say look up Tavistock, if you haven't, but it may take some time to digest. It's relevant though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, yes there are a lot of studios out there, probably doing good work. You've never heard of them because they don't have the resources to get the distribution that the bigger studios get. Independent studios aren't independent. Not if they are able to compete with the big dogs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enjoy the shows and narratives, especially if they resonate with you. I liked the first season of Mr. Robot, but realized I could also just look deeper into what's going on in real life, to that regard, and I'd be more aware because of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said it in another comment here, it's being diet-woke and gatekeeping is the name of the game. But if it serves to help red-pill someone, then by all means.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just remember that you're not even giving them a fish, much less teaching them how to fish by doing this. You're serving them GMO frozen food. It's not based in reality. Literally. Based on and based in are not the same thing. Based on reality has zero weight. Zero proof. It's chasing shadows.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just saying, know what you're doing. And yes, this is all my opinion, do what you want with it.

       They are just announcing their future plans for the US, which most people will ignore. It isn't cause they are getting the truth out cause they are awesome kewl people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is because they are apart of cabal, that enjoys telling people their plans an laughing in their faces, while the dumb sheeple masses ignore it as, ohh it's just heff be TV show.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything on TV is controlled dude, you think there aren't people reading scripts, there are a handful of gatekeepers that release all movies music tv shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can already see the leftist propaganda on the show, not to mention probably all the occult meanings of MK Ultra, White Vans, White Rose. Elliot is an MK Ultra mind control victim, who has handlers. You can dive super deeply into it, but nobody is breaking out the truth dude.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same drivel, push out occult shit to the dumb masses, even announce the future to them, knowing they are to dumb to pick up on anything.
