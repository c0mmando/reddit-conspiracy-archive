<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/us/politics/flynn-mueller-russia-trump.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/us/politics/flynn-mueller-russia-trump.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>A Split From Trump Indicates That Flynn Is Moving to Cooperate With Mueller</em></strong></p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Lawyers for Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser, notified the president’s legal team in recent days that they could no longer discuss the special counsel’s investigation, according to four people involved in the case, an indication that Mr. Flynn is cooperating with prosecutors or negotiating a deal.</p>

<p>Mr. Flynn’s lawyers had been sharing information with Mr. Trump’s lawyers about the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is examining whether anyone around Mr. Trump was involved in Russian efforts to undermine Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.</p>

<p><strong>That agreement has been terminated,</strong> the four people said. Defense lawyers frequently share information during investigations, but they must stop when doing so would pose a conflict of interest. It is <strong>unethical for lawyers</strong> to work together when <strong>one client is cooperating with prosecutors</strong> and another is still under investigation.</p>

<p><strong>The notification alone does not prove that Mr. Flynn is cooperating with Mr. Mueller.</strong> Some lawyers withdraw from information-sharing arrangements as soon as they begin negotiating with prosecutors. And such negotiations sometimes fall apart.</p>

<p>Still, the notification led Mr. Trump’s lawyers to believe that Mr. Flynn — who, along with his son, is seen as having significant criminal exposure — has, at the least, begun discussions with Mr. Mueller about cooperating.</p>

<p>Trump fired Comey in May of 2017 and had full constitutional power to do so whenever he wanted to.  Trump was not under investigation at the time.  </p>

And 80% will be made silently (off the paper, black ops kind of)?
And 20% will be visible for the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Leaving cult of personality aside, the poster(s) known as Q is/are offering questions to be asked, first and foremost. If it is a larp, finding the answers to the questions is the larp. However, finding the answers to the questions has real value. It helps inform. </p>

<p>Asking questions that  can be answered by anyone by looking at mainstream sources, that helps build a better picture of the playing field, that helps try to educate people on the workings on domestic affairs and geopolitics, helps. </p>

<p>The media is not helping, as in it&#39;s not helping frame it correctly. In the example of the NYtimes article that you&#39;ve posted, it is stilled framed only as a Trump-Russian collusion case. </p>

<p>If people actually watched the hearings, took in all of the information, they wouldn&#39;t be blindsided by me saying right now that this is actually a big case against the Clinton Foundation that is being very carefully maneuvered, in Congress, and it was pre-empted by the notion that trump colluded with Russia, because DC knew, before the elections, that this was coming. It was there, in the news, for everyone to see, for a couple of years. No one saw it, because the only thing that was being framed is what the media offered.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean you have to watch the hearings to be informed. It just means the info is out there if you looked for it. People are trying to help you look for it. Others are helping you not see what&#39;s to be seen.</p>

<p>The answers to the questions could give awareness to the public of such things, if they chose more than to just <em>consume</em> &quot;news&quot;. The awareness campaign, brought on by the questions asked, has helped create  memes to help inform and validate the information for themselves. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not about waiting for answers to believe in. There are many out there finding answers on their own and are spreading the knowledge. The questions have helped. It&#39;s not just about some guy larping.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason that media figures, celebrities, royalty, social media companies, foreign governmental agents, are all getting hit right now. It&#39;s all related. I&#39;m not philosophizing, it&#39;s all there to be seen. Many just have to play catch up, if they can find the humility to look at the crazy conspiracy theorists&#39; musings and entertain them.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a cheat sheet to some of the questions and answers. &quot;Q&quot; didn&#39;t write in the answers, it was crowdsourced. Don&#39;t take it as truth. I don&#39;t even support some of the speculations, but use it to find and validate the answers yourself, if you&#39;re interested in understanding more.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.fo/hSUJN">https://archive.fo/hSUJN</a></p>

<p>Things are happening in the world at a fast pace from seemingly many directions, but they are largely connected. If you don&#39;t know why, then you&#39;re out of the loop (I don&#39;t mean that antagonistically), as many are starting to see what the media isn&#39;t showing them. </p>

<p>Good luck and Happy Turkey day.</p>

<p>why does it <em>have</em> to be? that doesn&#39;t seem very convincing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The general population doesn&#39;t, because they don&#39;t understand the game.</p>

<p>so when does the general population know something happening ... i&#39;m a little confused about when and how the public will know something solid about (say) the Clinton Foundation case that you allege is going through the motions.</p>

<p>If people actually watched the hearings, took in all of the information, they wouldn&#39;t be blindsided by me saying right now that this is actually a big case, for one, against the Clinton Foundation that is being very carefully maneuvered, in Congress, and it was pre-empted by the notion that trump colluded with Russia, because DC knew, before the elections, that this was coming. It was there, in the media, for everyone to see, for a few years at least. No one saw it, because the only thing that was being framed is what the news offered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i&#39;ll be frank with you. i don&#39;t buy it. in one swoop you say politicians keep their cards close, then you say everyone in DC knows, then you say, the general population doesn&#39;t, and then you say it was there for all to see. what exactly was there for all to see?</p>

<p>aren&#39;t you sure you&#39;re not being blinded by your bias against Clinton? she walks free. she ran for president, for heaven&#39;s sake. trump is handcuffed by mueller. his campaign manager is now multiply indicted. a man he called by name as his foreign affairs expert has pled guilty. obamacare repeal has failed. russian sanctions passed both houses of congress with veto proof majorities, why do you remotely cast askance on the whole trump-russia business while being so confident about the clinton stuff? i fail to understand your view unless i start off with the viewpoint that the Clintons are going down.</p>

<p>if you look at everything happening <em>already through the lens that the Clintons are going down</em> then sure, there&#39;s lots to see. objectively, i really doubt it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It just means the info is out there if you looked for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>shall we pause on this. doesn&#39;t this sound like you already have drawn a conclusion and seeking any sort of evidence to justify it? that&#39;s what it seems like doesn&#39;t it? and how do you know if you spend too much energy doing this and become too narrowly focused, you can spin <em>anything</em> into being supporting evidence. can&#39;t you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Things are happening in the world at a fast pace from seemingly many directions, but they are largely connected. If you don&#39;t know why, then you&#39;re out of the loop (I don&#39;t mean that antagonistically), as many are starting to see what the media isn&#39;t showing them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>are you sure everything&#39;s connected? or is that an unfounded assumption, an axiom of sorts you start off with without any shred of evidence?</p>

<p>for example, i&#39;m curious about kushner + the saudis, but i won&#39;t read into it anymore until i have more evidence. that doesn&#39;t mean i&#39;m oblivious, just objective. likewise, i don&#39;t have any evidence right now that mueller is going after the clintons. i just don&#39;t see any evidence. i see plenty of evidence of him building an obstruction of justice case against Trump. it might all be a huge showing, but there isn&#39;t any evidence of it <em>right now.</em> not unless i start to look for things supporting my pet theory.</p>

<p>i understand this is sorta weird coming into a conspiracy sub and questioning seemingly fundamental axioms about how &quot;everything is connected&quot; but that&#39;s what one does doesn&#39;t one? question stuff?</p>

<p>let&#39;s start off here. and happy thanksgiving.
All politics is theater, it has to be.
why does it have to be? that doesn&#39;t seem very convincing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Happy Thanksgiving to you too. I will start by saying that I apologize for the long response, but I hope it shows that I&#39;m genuinely interested in the discussion, even if it seems that I&#39;m side-stepping it or filibustering. If I wasn&#39;t interested, I&#39;d not have given much time to respond.</p>

<p>Yes, my argument is they have to play their cards close, they do it through theater. This is not me philosophizing, it&#39;s me making an observation about the culture. It may also be that we&#39;re defining theater differently. I use political theater, for one, to mean not saying what you feel that you&#39;d really like to, or should, at the moment, especially when it comes to wanting to put an accusation on the table, as there is due process, and, as in chess and in war, the best move is to let the other side slip up, hastily and attack and neutralize that position. But, I digress.</p>

<p>As far as everything else you&#39;ve responded with, first, I appreciate the time you spent on it and I&#39;ve read it. I can also see, from your perspective that you&#39;ve offered, how you could question if I&#39;m going into it with bias. In my opinion, that&#39;s an unfortunate leap to assume that when someone is making an argument towards something that it&#39;s from a bias against it. When then wouldn&#39;t we need to call that out for any argument about anything? </p>

<p>I will tell you, and you will just have to decide whether or not it matters, that I have no political affiliation nor am I rooting for one side or the other. I am opposed to the system, I have been before the last election, before the one before that, and before that. </p>

<p>With that said, I see the perspective that you hold, and I see it aligns with what the media has told us the perspective is. I get that. I&#39;ve started with the same information that you have. And yet, theres more to be seen that I feel that you aren&#39;t seeing. I&#39;ve seen information come out and watch the media spin it to continue to obfuscate it. It bangs the media drum and presents only the same narrative that you&#39;re showing me that you have come to understand. </p>

<p>I&#39;m only going off of what you have shared so far, to include what you feel about my speculations, as far as seeing that they don&#39;t appear to be grounded in anything to you, to be sure. I&#39;m not trying to spin what you see is out there, but I can see that you aren&#39;t familiar with the information that I insinuated is out there, on it&#39;s own and in addition to the perspective that you seem to hold.</p>

<p>So, if you don&#39;t mind, you don&#39;t have to answer, but I will ask. What allegations associated with the Clintons or their associates do you know are even being looked into by the special investigation? And no, that isn&#39;t for me to prove anything, but I can share them with you, if you tell me that you don&#39;t specifically know. I&#39;m just curious if you know that there are allegations being investigated. Because there are. Officially. Not because I&#39;m trying to make you believe that there are.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to start there, before we entertain anything else, since it&#39;s the foundation of my original response, even if I had inferred it, and the matter which seems to confound you. Are you familiar with the allegations? Has anybody associated with the Clintons, to your knowledge, been investigated yet or are being investigated? Granted there are many avenues that branch off from this, but do you <em>know</em> which one is being looked into by the mueller investigation, and which has many people in congress concerned about? </p>

<p>If you&#39;re not familiar with the answers to these two questions, then of course it&#39;s reasonable for you not to buy anything that I&#39;m saying, as, from your perspective, I might as well be making it all up, as it seems that there isn&#39;t evidence to it, based on the fact that you haven&#39;t seen it. I, however, feel that you don&#39;t yet have the background info to entertain whether or not I&#39;m just blowing smoke. And you&#39;re response seems to show a lot of suspicion that I am. I&#39;m not trying to be dickish about it, I promise. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s important for us to establish a baseline of known knowns before we continue, and it would bring me confidence (and you increased credibility, more so than already granted) if you could show me that you know what allegations are being investigated regarding any Clinton or associate. I&#39;m not even asking whether you think it&#39;s legit or not, but if you know what I&#39;m talking about. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll even give you time to look into it, but would ask that you offer me the courtesy of letting me know that this is new information to you. Not because I&#39;m looking for intellectual leverage out of the gesture, but because I would then like to choose to respectfully decline entertaining a discussion on something that you haven&#39;t had time to look into enough to form a solid position on, yet. </p>

<p>Because, it does have a relationship to all of the players and connections that you are asking about. But we can&#39;t get there if you don&#39;t know where I am starting from. And, if what I was arguing in my previous response is based on something that is new to you, I think I&#39;d appreciate it if you had a researched position on it before continuing. </p>

<p>Ultimately, my apologies if you do in fact know what allegations I am referring to and if you have well-researched it, your response just seemed to indicate that otherwise. And, if you have heard of such an allegation, but didn&#39;t look into it because you found it baseless (although that&#39;s the special investigation&#39;s prerogative), I&#39;d still know which allegations you&#39;d be referring to. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to close this response by honoring the time you put into yours with another response to another question. Sorry if this is long-winded, you&#39;re free not to have read any of this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i&#39;ll be frank with you. i don&#39;t buy it. in one swoop you say politicians keep their cards close, then you say everyone in DC knows, then you say, the general population doesn&#39;t, and then you say it was there for all to see. what exactly was there for all to see?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t have to buy it, I will clarify my position regardless. I&#39;d like to rephrase the words &quot;know&quot; and &quot;see&quot; with &quot;discern&quot;, again, for clarity. The public is in a neutered state from being able to discern what&#39;s going on in DC, in the same way that I can&#39;t discern what&#39;s going on with any hot topic you may offer me concerning your vocation, for example. I don&#39;t have the experience, perspective, nor vocabulary. You can explain it to me, it won&#39;t help me jump in and offer much of a well-educated position on it, of any worth to you. For those who naively think they can go toe-to-toe with topics outside of their realm, we call it armchair quarterbacking, and of course I get that you understand this, I&#39;m not trying to talk down. In the military, we called people who engage in this dorm room barristers or dorm room lawyers. </p>

<p>With that said, the media could put out the information, but that doesn&#39;t mean that the public has the ability to fully discern it, or grok it, as some might say. And yes, you&#39;ll have to go to opposition media to &quot;see&quot; it almost all of the time, but that&#39;s okay, it should be done, and that&#39;s what is not being done. I watch people on both sides not do it every day. It needs to be done, and, it works, because you are free to validate the data and discard what doesn&#39;t check out. And I&#39;m not talking about the article&#39;s opinions. I&#39;m talking data. Allegations, right or wrong, is data. Again, I&#39;m not talking about media allegations, I&#39;m talking about media &quot;reporting&quot; on allegations being investigated by a special counsel, for right or wrong.  </p>

<p>Thanks for your time if you made it to the bottom, no tl;dr. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>so you&#39;ve said a lot of words to actually convey nothing terribly substantial from what i can see. you&#39;re peddling in all of this &quot;feeling&quot; about &quot;stuff happening&quot; and all that, which is a bit disappointing.</p>

<p>i&#39;ll try to pick on one point:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d like to start there, before we entertain anything else, since it&#39;s the foundation of my original response, even if I had inferred it, and the matter which seems to confound you.

</blockquote>

<p>i do know who are being investigated by mueller, and no, so far no one directly in the crosshairs that touch the Clintons. is tony podesta stepping down what you&#39;re referring to? or is there more?</p>

<p>if that&#39;s relevant, i&#39;d mark it a (say) 3/10 on the relevance scale. manafort getting indicted would be like an 8/10 on that scale -- campaign manager + indictments! holy hell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll have to step away from this conversation now, as I, and others that may peruse this thread can see that you don&#39;t have as much of the story as you think you do. </p>

<p>Let them spend time with you from here, I&#39;ve given you hours of my time and even offered you simple words that you could&#39;ve googled. But since you&#39;re not delivering, it seems that you didn&#39;t even google &quot;clinton foundation mueller&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s types like you that like to philosophize and think you know what&#39;s up because you&#39;re listening to the &quot;good guys&quot; tell you what&#39;s going on, instead of doing the work. Well, my friend, they are failing you. </p>

<p>And, this is not an ad hominem attempt, but take it as you&#39;d like: your lack of knowing the ins and outs does not equal everyone else not conveying anything substantial to your sensibilities or there not being evidence of such allegations. It just takes a little bit of humility to assume that, before judging others&#39; ability to discern.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;ve offered enough courtesy of my time, thanks for responding, nevertheless. I&#39;m glad that these conversations are public.</p>

<p>sure, i might not have been humble in this conversation but you&#39;ve given me little to work with. you have to give others the benefit of doubt, and i did, engaging you thus far, but i had my own internal checkpoints to see if this conversation was going somewhere and i like to deal in facts. not idle speculation. i said that many times in the beginning and you&#39;ve done nothing to reach up to that. hence my being less humble. i&#39;m sure you understand. cheers!</p>
