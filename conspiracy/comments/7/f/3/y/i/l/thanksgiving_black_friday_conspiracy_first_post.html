<p>Did the greedy powers that be, specifically pick that after a day of giving thanks for everything you have; a day of sales, where people are willing to trample over each other to death for things that they don&#39;t need?&#39;</p>

<p>Does anyone else imagine someone in those glass towers cackling away at the irony while they clear out old inventory?</p>

<p>P.S Happy Thanksgiving! - And good Black Friday savings! I am thankful for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for keeping it real over the years (at least the real side)</p>

<p>Get fat and keep fighting the good fight my friends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 51 and &quot;after thanksgiving sales&quot; have been a thing as long as I can remember. Its just the traditional holiday shopping kickoff.  It got the name black Friday a while back, and it started as a negative. Anyone who tells you the nonesense that its the day retailers move &quot;into the black&quot; believed the horseshit.   The sakes used to start &quot;early&quot; at like 6 am. As with everything, its ballooned to starting halfway through Thanksgiving day.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Around the same time, the terms &quot;Black Friday&quot; and &quot;Black Saturday&quot; came to be used by the police in Philadelphia and Rochester to describe the crowds and traffic congestion accompanying the start of the Christmas shopping season.</p>

<p>Use of the phrase spread slowly, first appearing in The New York Times on November 29, 1975, in which it still refers specifically to &quot;the busiest shopping and traffic day of the year&quot; in Philadelphia. Although it soon became more widespread, <strong>The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in 1985 that retailers in Cincinnati and Los Angeles were still unaware of the term.[82]</strong></p>

<p>As the phrase gained national attention in the early 1980s, merchants objecting to the use of a derisive term to refer to one of the most important shopping days of the year suggested an alternative derivation: that retailers traditionally operated at a financial loss for most of the year (January through November) and made their profit during the holiday season, beginning on the day after Thanksgiving.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it started in Philadelphia in the 60&#39;s because of the congestion it caused. But use of the term spread slowly. It was still unknown as a term in LA in the mid 80&#39;s.  And, as mentioned, retailers came up with an alternative because they didn&#39;t like the negative association.</p>

My aunts and mother sat around on Thanksgiving wishing the stores would open so they could do something besides watch football.  </p>
