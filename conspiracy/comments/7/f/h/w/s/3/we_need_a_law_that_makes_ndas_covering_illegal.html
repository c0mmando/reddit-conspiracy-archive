    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t have secret courts. The sixth amendment in the bill of rights cover all of that stuff. We do have sketchy stuff like sealed warrants and other investigations based stuff that is pretty crappy if you think about it. Yet no one is getting snatched up off the street, then held in secret court trial, getting a secret sentence and then send off to real jail. </p>

<p>Patriot act allows a lot of flex but it&#39;s rarely if ever used on US citizens for crimes etc in the united states. They threaten it a bunch and maybe start out with it as an excuse to fast hold but then that person gets his open federal trial. Even terrorists from other countries get an open federal trial. The problem is people blur court orders, sealed court documents, closed grand juries and so on into the same over all mass of them all being &quot;secret courts&quot;. When the reality is if you pick pretty much anyone in federal, state or local prison and work backwards they had their day in open court. Gov might of done some sketchy BS stingray cell phone capture no warrant NSA meta data blah blah blah to get them into court, but they still get their open court date. </p>

<p>also I don&#39;t think contracts for illegal actions can be enforced. Your lawyer due to privilege issues can know you committed a crime and still defend you for that crime. Yet I don&#39;t think you can have your friend help you trunk a dead hooker and fall back on a NDA. NDA are really just a fear tactic to keep people in line. NDA after the fact as part of a legal pay off is a different issue of course. </p>

<p>Unless they&#39;re American citizens who are also muslims and visit a foreign country like Pakistan.</p>

<p>In America though, car &quot;accidents&quot; like Michael Hastings are the weapon of choice.</p>

<p>It says right there in the bill of rights &quot;In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.....&quot;. Now clearly we have rogue groups who judge/sentence outside the court system and laws due to corruption. We find out about one of those every few years or so. The first one that pops into my mind is 2008&#39;s Kids for Cash scandal with judges getting kick backs for harsher sentencing. I think stuff like that and dirty cops is about as close as we get to secret court like actions, but that&#39;s still more just outside the lines vs a true court. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know about whole Muslim american citizens in other countries side of this issue. I think the hurricane in Puerto Rico really drives home how if it&#39;s not a citizen issue happening in  the continental USA, not that many people seem to care. </p>

<p>stuff like Michael Hastings is a bit more tricky. I&#39;m sure some deaths are people getting black op&#39;ed but I doubt it&#39;s as many as some seem to think. The longer a person lives the more people they know who die randomly.  I don&#39;t see myself as that old and I still know 10+ people who died in ways that could make for a conspiracy if it was not for the fact they were average Joe Nobody.  </p>

<p>Law of averages. Bad stuff happens to good people all the time, even really random &quot;Wait, that can&#39;t be real?&quot; level of bad stuff. </p>

<p>You just can&#39;t have every single person who dies be a black bag level of operation. Some of them just have to be legit car wreck, a true heart attack and so on. It happens to normal people all the time but some how if it&#39;s a person others feel is connected to a conspiracy they they get added to the never ending huge list of people killed off due to what they knew. I&#39;m hesitant to guess as a percentage number here being it would a totally blind guess on my part. I think maybe 20%-30% are killed off by others deliberately. Then of that 20%-30% I have a sneaky feeling most of those are a one off direct action vs orders coming down from high above. </p>

<p>As in you are doing a story on some thing big. John Doe is a nobody who will get caught up in that. John Doe knows your story is going to hurt higher ups but it&#39;s REALLY going to wreck John Doe&#39;s life so they go after you. John Doe is not ordered to do it, they just do it for their own protection. Yet again, as I said before that&#39;s just a wild guess on my part. I tend to think the very powerful are much too arrogant to think a little person can ever reach them in the first place to then bother to have them killed. Does the shark really worry about the minnows? </p>

<p>So you agree you don&#39;t live in a democracy? I mean killing off a significant percentage of whistleblowers/dissidents means fascism to me.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easier to have them stalked and hence discredited as &quot;mentally ill&quot;. What percentage of people claiming to be gangstalked do you believe are actually being stalked (for DE weapons testing purposes or politically motivated)?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I would call someone looking to save themselves from jail or personal ruin the same as an organized attack on democracy.  I tend to think too many feel a person who died was killed by orders from others. When it&#39;s much more likely that if they were killed it was for someone&#39;s own personal reason. That doesn&#39;t make it right, but it also doesn&#39;t make it a conspiracy. </p>

<p>Like lets say you were doing a deep dig into a high level chevy conspiracy and then you die some how. People would leap that it was chevy or due to the bail out the US gov protecting their investment. I&#39;m saying there is only say a 20% chance your death was in anyway connected to your report. Even the odds are it&#39;s a random sales man who did it thinking his job was at risk vs say &quot;chevy&quot; doing it. </p>

<p>as for gangstalking, I don&#39;t buy into that at all. I&#39;ve watched a ton of videos of people claiming to be gangstalked and most of the stuff is well past a normal person being worn down. That&#39;s just my opinion </p>

<p>This latest revelation came in a lengthy page-one Times profile of McGowan, who said the money offer was made through her lawyer.

<p>McGowan reached a $100,000 settlement with Weinstein in ’97, but only learned over this past summer that the settlement did not include a confidentiality clause. </p>

<p>A likelier avenue for legal change runs through state capitals. California passed a law last year that prohibited the use of confidentiality clauses in civil settlements if the “factual foundation” for the allegations involve acts that could be prosecuted as felony sexual offenses. That law would apply to settlements involving allegations of rape or sexual assault—and at least three women now say that Weinstein raped them, according to a New Yorker report. However, the alleged rapes occurred in France and New York, making it unlikely that California law would govern the settlements. </p>
