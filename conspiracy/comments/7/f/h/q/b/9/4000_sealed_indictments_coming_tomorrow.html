    <div class="md"><p>I can tell u that Q has not said any specific number of Indictments.  CBTS posters are getting their numbers from Stormwatcher on twitter who has been getting the pacer records and counting them up.  But he now tweeted that some of what he counted could be things like search warrants and they are going back through with a better understanding.  I&#39;m guessing he is just a regular guy and didn&#39;t know they were different things. </p>

<p>So, it looks like CBTS again misunderstanding Q or misquote him.  Then the people who are hearing about it second hand think its fake because what people interpret him to be saying is different than what he said.  Or like in this situation something gets attributed to him, that was not him.</p>

<p>The only thing I have sen Q say that has absolutely not happened is that he warned their were going to be riots with martial law around the time of Antifa&#39;s planned days of rage riots.  </p>

<p>He later said this was leaked the way it was to threaten antifa with declaring martial law and let them know that he National guard was already on alert.  This is important because the president can not call up the national guard but once they are on alert he can take over and command them directly. The threat worked and Soros called off his mercenaries masquerading as outraged voters.</p>

<p>Everything else is our misunderstanding.  In general he said massive arrests will happen, pedo rings and Ms-13 will be taken out, lots of politicians will be pressured to not seek re-election or step down, and that the globalists would suffer regime change:  In the past 3 weeks all of that has happened or we see evidence of it being ready to happen.  Saudi Arabia, regime change, Pakistan and Germany are heading towards regime change. All else I hope will happen in the near future.  But really the world has been f&#39;ed up for a really long time and if it takes months to untangle it we will be lucky!  If his prediction about the fed reserve ending or being nationalized comes true we will all be living a lot better than we ever have. Many have died trying to end the fed. Until now it like ending Merkel, seemed impossible.  If they happen then I think Q is real.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We misinterpreted his statement that specific people we all hate would be indicted on certain dates meant they would be arrested on or near those dates.  We now realize that is not how it works.  Indictments often come long after arrests.<br/>
Those boots on McCain and HRC are covering up ankle monitors tracking them and making sure they don&#39;t get away.  Just to be clear Q did not say that, but its just reasonable deduction.  Both disappeared for a length of time and then showed up claiming injury.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Leaving aside the grotesque Nazi sympathy trolling, and the lack of any credible allegations that would support such a thing, our justice system just isn&#39;t built on such a scale. The DOJ and district courts couldn&#39;t do so many simultaneous indictments, and even if they could there&#39;s no point in indicting a defendant before a standard Article III city and then trying them before some other tribunal. (Not to mention there&#39;d be huge constitutional obstacles to such a parallel procedure.)</p>

<p>Mass trials are possible, of course. But they require very complex and very involved preparations, and I don&#39;t see how it could be done in secret. </p>

<p>The constitution requires due process and timely trials, so all of these thousands of defendants (accused of what, by the way?) would require full trials with counsel, judges, evidence, etc. And those thousands of trials would have to happen within a few months. I don&#39;t think there are enough judges and prosecutors in the country, and I don&#39;t think it would be constitutional to bring in foreign jurists who wouldn&#39;t be competent to run trials under American law. (Or to keep the effort to organize thousands of foreign judges secret for the months and months it would take.)</p>

<p>Supposedly with access to PACER (as a lawyer) the search is real simple. 
This guy is supposedly going around checking, and keeps posting numbers.<br/>

<p>On this site, don&#39;t see much option for &quot;super secret &amp; sealed stuff&quot; ...

    <div class="md"><p>Leaving aside the grotesque Nazi sympathy trolling, and the lack of any credible allegations that would support such a thing, our justice system just isn&#39;t built on such a scale. The DOJ and district courts couldn&#39;t do so many simultaneous indictments, and even if they could there&#39;s no point in indicting a defendant before a standard Article III city and then trying them before some other tribunal. (Not to mention there&#39;d be huge constitutional obstacles to such a parallel procedure.)</p>

<p>4,000 simultaneous sealed indictments would be like the NFL springing a surprise new Superbowl-sized event on us, complete with a brand new stadium and pro-level teams kept under wraps with no real leaks. It&#39;s very much impossible.</p>
