    <div class="md"><p>People like MLK were gang-stalked in a way, it definitely exists. But the targets are people who&#39;s decisions are important - and they chose gang-stalking and probably other methods of manipulating those decisions. Gang-stalking of some random schizo who has read a few conspiracy theories is not happening, it is delusion. 99% of stories we hear in this subreddit are delusions, probably even 100%.</p>

That said, I assume there are likely a,tiny nuimner of people out there who are gangtalked for some reason, but theyn usually know what it&#39;s for. I know a guy who crossed the mob for $10,000 and they continually harassed him, but when asked if he feared for his life, he said no, they won&#39;t kill you over a pioddly 10g.</p>

<p>Which is exactly how societies like the Illuminati is like saying Voldemort in a group of  theorists.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the info about MLK Jr. and the letter written by FBI agents but played off as a private African American citizen. Old-skool trolls on typewriters. Sometimes things don&#39;t change, they just get harder to spot and report. Especially when you get lies being spread about everything they don&#39;t want us to know:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its real, its happening and you better believe it!</p>

<p>I try to avoid mental illness and tin foil hat type arguments (&quot;v2k&quot;, &quot;brain to skull&quot; and so on) since they are used to misguide and confuse the general public and targets. Fake websites, youtube videos, comments, bogus mainstream media reports and so on.</p>

<p>The orchestrators definitely do not want the general public to know about these programs since it would cause outrage, hence the common institutionalization and discrediting campaigns of victims.</p>

<p>On a personal note, I have noticed how my harassment campaign has increased since being more active on online on forums pointing people in the right direction. The amount of surveillance and military styled overt/covert &quot;psy-ops&quot; utilized against civilians like me is unreal, a massive waste of resources and money all in the name of &quot;security&quot;. </p>

<p>These programs are insane and have very little to do with genuine health and safety of society. On the contrary, such campaigns lead to mental instability of the victims which, in turn endangers the individual and their surrounding.</p>

<p>As far as I know this happening the US, Canada, UK, Germany, Australia (at least).</p>

<p>On of the programs main objectives is the socio-economic ruin of the &quot;target&quot;. Moving anywhere is not a viable option for me right now. Having experienced the harassment in at least three different countries (home, semester abroad and on vacation) I doubt that moving would make much of a difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Short answer as a low profile victim: Target practice.</p>

<p>I believe &quot;they&quot; (intelligence agencies, private contractors, local law enforcement and other unknown private actors) are testing the waters on individuals that they know can be easily isolated. &quot;They&quot; want to see with how much they can get away with, without the public ever being aware such programs. So that such campaigns can be elaborated in future.</p>

<p>For more in-depth discussion as to the why I recommend this thread:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think it happens. I mean the Weinstein thing proved that if you have enough money you can hire teams of goons to intimidate people. There was a case of a guy who actually figured out who was doing it to him and took them to court, it turned out they were testing high tech stuff on him like holographic people and stuff to try to make him look crazy, but because he had connections (I think he had a radio show or something as well as having been in the military previously) they were able to surveil his home for him and confirm that there were people stalking him. Eventually his &#39;team&#39; of military dudes were able to outsmart these people who turned out to be from some University research center. The guy who was being stalked sued them and got money but he had to agree not to divulge exactly what had been done to him or how he had foiled them, which he agreed to. Bizarrely he agreed to because he saw the importance of the research for national security or something. The article I read on him (and I wish I could remember it!) made it seem like in the end he was just chuffed he&#39;d outsmarted these guys and they all had a laugh about it or something, but the guy&#39;s life had been made hell for months.</p>

<p>There was some reason for it, I think something he&#39;d said on his show or something, but he was also targeted as part of this research. Apparently some of the people stalking him or doing weird stuff to freak him out were students, presumably who didn&#39;t know what they were really involved in.</p>

<p>There are tons of random people with no apparent reason for being stalked who claim to be victims of certain technologies, like &#39;voice of God&#39; tech, where a voice is projected into their minds/ears, or energy weapons directed at them to cause pain and stuff.</p>

<p>Some of these people, or a lot of them, seem insane. But they claim part of the purpose is to make them seem insane. There&#39;s a smart lady, a PhD in physics from Oxford Univeristy called Katherine Horton, who claims ot be gangstalked and she has some interesting Youtube videos about it if you search her name. She&#39;s very convincing and is putting together a campaign to stop this kind of activity from intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>I get the impression that the theory is that it&#39;s used to intimidate people who &#39;know too much&#39; or decision-makers to influence decisions or to shut people up etc, btu that there&#39;s also an experimental side. And anyone who knows experiments with people knows that often researchers will choose a random sample, if you&#39;re testing the effects of something on a typical population. You want to get a sample that&#39;s representative of the general population and to do that you try to get your sample as randomly selected as possible, which is difficult with most medical trials etc, as people self-select by replying to your ad for participants.</p>

<p>Obviously if you&#39;re testing something like this, which is unethical, illegal and for which the purpose is deception, i.e. the people you&#39;re targeting can&#39;t know they&#39;re part of an experiment and sign a consent form or whatever (that would ruin the results), it would make sense to just randomly select people by picking SSNs out of a hat or randomly picking names from the voter register or the address book or something. I can imagine that given the people doing this aren&#39;t exactly concerned about ethics anyway, they might occasionally pick someone they don&#39;t like or someone who&#39;s stirred things up or drawn attention to themselves or something, even if it&#39;s not like they have access to big secrets or anything.</p>

<p>So I wouldn&#39;t be too quick to dismiss all these people. Many of them have led normal lives with no signs of psychosis or anything previously, and many of them report similar symptoms etc. Of course it is likely that many who ARE mentally ill get caught up in it and get confirmation and affirmation from the gangstalking community, but perhaps it&#39;s best ot give people the benefit of the doubt.</p>

The reason I ask is it sounds highly similar to the plot of the book <em>Chameleo</em> by Robert Guffey, which the writer is very coy about whether he actually means it as non-fiction, and which did not involve a lawsuit. </p>

<p>I appreciate the rest of your post as you seem to be someone who has not experienced the program but is open-minded to it, but respectfully I don&#39;t think the example you cite is something that actually happened as it seems it would draw more media attention.  </p>

Limited Hangout to get people in and then they dox them and suddenly these people are having bad things happen to them. Same deal with the guy that reported CP on the CometPP servers to the FBI. There are plenty that are paid to dig up dirt when a name is exposed and then they pass that information along to a party that may not be so nice to them.

    <div class="md"><p>gangstalking is nothing more than a community watch or loose group of individuals acting in the interest of &quot;law and order.&quot;
People are using apps like spyzie that only require a targets&#39; phone number to track and harass them, with the interest of keeping them living in fear and either winding up in a nuthouse or severely agoraphobic.
It&#39;s said that targets are chosen by private security companies, who are experiencing a huge booming in $$$$ in recent decades.
It&#39;s basically putting  enhanced &quot;cointelpro&quot; protocols in the hands of moronic civilians and their iphones etc, people who may be &quot;good&quot; as individuals, but who are currently engaged in sociopathic behavior since they are being told the target deserves it. 
Mobsters are also known to do this, as are bookies, and of course private investigators.
All the things you read about helicopter stalking, V2k, and anything that seems crazy is actually misinformation, posted to hide this very simple program of community based policing. It&#39;s also been referred to as &quot;big data&quot; policing, or &quot;proactive&quot; policing, because the targets are followed around and subjected to various &quot;morality&quot; tests, and an amateur dossier is created which is later used to torture the target with tracking, taunting, pervasive rudeness, bullying etc etc..
the people who engage in the &quot;gangstalking&quot; do not know the target personally, and generally only see a blip on a screen or receive text notification via a private whatsapp group that the target is in their vicinity. The police are cooperating with this community spy program, and in fact, love the results.</p>

<p>Whereas, only high value targets and targets attempting to elude and relocate are physically stalked via foot and vehicle. Low value targets are geo-stalked. See the geo-stalking wikis in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>. </p>

<p>Private security companies are not paid to choose targets. They are some of the perps that are paid to conduct the targeting.

THIS is an example of misinformation- this entire post. It must be a troll doing these type of posts. Don&#39;t believe this crap, &quot;gangstalking&quot; protocols are nothing more than martial law and citizens having authoritarian power they cannot handle.</p>

<p>Obviously, you did not read the references I cited. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Go do the moonwalk in front of someone every time they look out the window of the restaurant where they are eating. What do you mean &quot;It&#39;s not real&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is not an example of street theatre. My references described the types of street theatre. If someone repeatedly stalked a person to a restaurant and did the moonwalk outside of the restaurant&#39;s window, that would be an example of stalking and harassment. Not gangstalking. The victim could apply for a civil harassment restraining order.</p>

<p>You have not described gangstalking protocols. Not all perps are citizens. Many perps are illegal immigrants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its real, its happening and you better believe it!</p>

<p>I try to avoid mental illness and tin foil hat type arguments (&quot;v2k&quot;, &quot;brain to skull&quot; and so on) since they are used to misguide and confuse the general public and targets. Fake websites, youtube videos, comments, bogus mainstream media reports and so on. </p>

<p>The orchestrators definitely do not want the general public to know about these programs since it would cause outrage, hence the common institutionalization and discrediting campaigns of victims.</p>

<p>On a personal note, I have noticed how my harassment campaign has increased since being more active on online on forums pointing people in the right direction. The amount of surveillance and military styled overt/covert &quot;psy-ops&quot; utilized against civilians like is me is unreal, a massive waste of resources and money all in the name of &quot;security&quot;. These programs are insane and have very little to do with genuine health and safety of society. On the contrary, such campaigns lead to mental instability of the victims which, in turn endangers the individual and their surrounding. </p>

<p>On of the programs main objectives is the socio-economic ruin of the &quot;target&quot;. Moving anywhere is not a viable option for me right now. Having experienced the harassment in at least three different countries (home, semester abroad and on vacation) I doubt that moving would make much of a difference.</p>

<p>Only very recently I released I was in some kind of modern &quot;Cointelpro&quot;/&quot;Zersetzungs&quot; program so I haven&#39;t dared discussing it at face value with others at this point.</p>
