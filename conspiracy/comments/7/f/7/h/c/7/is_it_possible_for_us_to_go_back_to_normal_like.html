       The only way this would be possible is if a large majority of humanity turned their back on the system being forced down our throats.  This would be a huge sacrifice in terms of quality of life and that makes it very unlikely to happen.  Humanity would need to turn their backs on banks, cable companies, phones, pretty much every technology we take for granted.  Many people would be put in prison if this happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole fake world is being propped up by greedy fucks who only care about dollars.  The more dystopic society becomes, the more we try to escape.  Unfortunately we are programmed to think the way out is to buy more comfort or distraction.  This ultimately strengthens the prison bars around us.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way out is inward, as the illusion starts to unravel you realize that all you care about is meaningless.  Your car, your house, your job, your body, these are all boxes you live in that trap your infinite spirit.  When we stop associating our identities with the consumer crap and limiting social constructs they try and fill our lives with, we realize what we truly are.  From there, anything is possible.

       I raised my daughter with no TV and no Peanuts, Disney, PBS, or any other plastic merchants. I have never heard of a parent doing that before or since.
       <br/>
       So there's a start. Now all we have to do is convince other parents to do the same. In other words, it isn't going to happen.

       AWESOME! Thanks! Here is Prince's hero, and main musical inspiration, Todd Rundgren weighing in.

       If people on this sub looked into this mysterious person who was the main driving force, and actual coder, of much of modern digital recording tech, they might learn something.
       <br/>
       Prince sure did.
       <br/>
       ''It has been alleged that Mark Chapman read the exchange between you and it fuelled his feeling of betrayal by the former Beatle.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't blame the world. Blame yourself, then blame John Lennon. I don't feel any connection to Mark David Chapman. I never met the guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Were you creeped out when it transpired that on the day he murdered John Lennon he left a copy of Runt: the Ballad of Todd Rundgren by his hotel bed, that when he was arrested he was wearing a Hermit of Mink Hollow promo T-shirt and that he was obsessed with you and your music?''

       He was the man who pioneered doing entire albums with literally zero assistance from anyone, playing all instruments, doing all voices, all production, and all the engineering.
       <br/>
       The mass media suppresses Todd, and he will never be in the rock hall of fame. He makes most musical artists look like stumbling beginners.
       <br/>
       Everyone who records digitally can thank him for writing the code, with his keyboard player Roger Powell.
       <br/>
       The videos of Todd lectures and talks are fascinating. He paved the way.

       Says who? I bet committees of songwriters wrote half the crappy drivel supposedly written by Lennon/McCartney. Paul Mc is a fucking hack who has never written a decent song, especially in the last 40 years, where he did jack shit.

       She is a major brainwash programmer in the ad business, unfortunately. Educate your kid on brainwashing, and hypnosis, and sometimes they chase the money using what you taught them.
       <br/>
       It's hard to believe, for me that that's what she does.
       <br/>
       She knows what she is doing is shitty, but she fears the future, and is not sure how to proceed. She is trying to get enough money to get back out. I hope she does it. She doesn't follow my advice, now that she's thirty. She is a bit infected by the ''you go girl'' feminism of today, that tricks women into being corporate slaves like men, as if that was a proper goal to free women.
       <br/>
       All that gets a person is the freedom to be some corporate board's bitch, 14 hours a day.

       I'm curious what you think the alternative to "being corporate slaves like men" is? Last I checked we all need jobs regardless of feminism. Well unless of course we manage to reach financial independence and retire early, which I'm hoping for and see as one of the only ways to escape it. I hate being a "corporate slave" but there's almost literally no way around it.

       Women joining the workforce en masse devalued labor and decreased wages, so now it's way harder for people to raise a family on one income. The fact that most men had a wife and children to provide for also used to be taken into account in how much they were paid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today everyone is more atomized than ever, the individual is now seen as the building block of society rather than the family unit. Men and women compete against each other for meager wages while their kids are raised by strangers. Mom can't be around because she has to go push papers in a cubicle for 40 hours a week like dad. Meanwhile, the corporations support the feminist narrative that this is "empowering" because more people in the workforce = cheaper labor and bigger profits for them.

       I mean isn't it empowering because no women can survive on their own economic backbone without having to rely on a man? Sounds like the very definition of equality. Under that logic we shouldn't have gotten rid of slavery because it introduced thousands of people into the workforce.

       look into the tax expenditures allocated to women over the course of their lives and then compare those amounts to the funds allocated to men. every working man subsidizes every woman (whether or not she works) at his own expense.

       It is worth the exchange on simply based on the fact that your kids won't be looking at screens, and neither will you. Your family will interact with each other more by extension; this is where the main factor here. Kids thrive off human interaction, even if it mere eye-contact or the familiar sound of their parent humming; even if they are just observing their parents idly talk to each other(and they are watching, trust me) they are soaking g up everything you say and display like sponges. I sincerely believe that as a society we have all but abandoned our children in favor of amusing devices and the incoming generations are suffering as a result, because they have nothing to guide them other than what they see and hear from screens.

       I agree wholeheartedly with everything you said, and I really like the thought of that, tbh. It is sad when I see nieces and nephews with tablets and phones, handed out like pacifiers. And they do a good job at that. But at what cost? is what I wonder. I won't be able to answer that until I can see how they function as adults.

       I need answers like this too. Makes me think that balance is v necessary. We were already planning to let them watch whatever they want at friend's houses, but at home maybe no TV but free use of Youtube etc might be good balance. Not sure at this point. I know overprotection is detrimental, and would lead our kids to being societal outcasts, which is unfair definitely isn't the goal.

       They will end up being social outcasts at an early age, having a much more negative affect on them than watching cartoons.
I see where you're coming from, and I very much so limit my kids tv and pod time, and content. But they also need to experience the "norms" of the world and also be taught how to be skeptical and question things they see and hear on tv and the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       99% of the parents of their school class won't be limiting these things, and the kids in school with cast out any other child that is different. Sad, but true.
I was made fun of and shunned for not having fucking brand name shoes and clothes in elementary school. Kids tease and make your life hell. I want my kids to fit in at an younger age, until they are mature enough to decide for themselves, when presented with alternatives, on what lifestyle to lead. Whether it's minimalist, or cord-cutter or tech fiend.. Educating your kids is key, not just hiding them from the shit the world puts out.

       Average age is about 40 from what I've seen. I find the older someone gets without being introduced the harder it is to teach. But some of the older folks learn quite fast.

       I was raised this way as a child.  I have 10 years of professional success under my belt and am currently in medical school to be a doctor.  Other children I know who were raised this way have even greater arcs than my own.

      <p>
       Raising children away from popular media gives their minds space to grow into their full and proper potential.  It is a gift beyond measure, one I will do anything to pass on.

       Where did I say anything about careers?
I'm talking about social lives and not being able to relate to other kids your age.
I bet you didn't have much of a social life or many friends growing up, besides maybe ones in the same situation/lifestyle as yours as a child.

       I would say I had a well-rounded childhood and teenaged years.  Was it like everyone elses' childhoods?  No.  But I have never been lacking in socialization.  If anything, quite the opposite: I am able to relate to much broader range of people in many more types of situations than most seem comfortable with.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a specific example regarding socialization: on Friday nights, we didn't go out to movies with friends or hang out skateboarding or whatever else kids do on Friday nights.  We went contra dancing.  Very different lifestyle, but it served the purpose of socialization quite well and I
       <em>
        promise
       </em>
       you that being able to dance and comfortably relate to the opposite gender on the dance floor is an excellent talent to have.

       You've got a point but op is still right. 80's seem to be the last decent decade. I mean, inflation has doubled since then so its pretty reasonable to think the 80's count as 'the good ol days'... We'd all be making the same money but paying half as much for food/gas/rent etc.

       This argument misses the point than anyone individual has limited control over the society they live.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its kind of like telling someone living through the Cultural Revolution (or anyother revolution).  Oh, you're just being dramatic - you're free to do whatever you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that technology isn't a disruptive force in our lives is ridiculous.  Tecnhology produces revolutions.  Have you ever heard of the Gutenberg Printing Press, and how much that turned society on its head?  How about the Industrial Revolution?  The thing is these revolutions used to be rare.  Now they are commonplace, and many people feel like they are happening so fast there is no time to adjust, which in turn creates feelings of extreme uncertainty in which people find it impossible to get their bearings.

       This is false.  You control your local area.  Stop living in a bubble and you'll see.  An easy way to get out of the bubble is to bake for your neighbors and talk to them or join a church or other civic organization.

       Honestly I think you may be in an electronic bubble. Try disconnecting for a couple days, go hang out in a cafe or public place and make conversation. Especially with older people, not everyone is a zombie. Technology is a big part of our lives now and it's ok to be wary.

       Nah, technology is mostly liberating. Look at the biggest problems in the world and the possible solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Private banking. A crony capitalist nightmare. Completely infiltrated all levels of government and is so intertwined in our economy and money creation process that there's no easy solution. This was as true in 1980 as it is today, the only difference is now we have a bit more power thanks to technology. Bitcoin and other crypto currencies, the ease of wiring and trading funds over the internet, etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       Corrupt media. In 1980 things weren't nearly as bad, but that's hardly relevant. The media that is entirely owned by special interest and political bias. Our only savior, again, is the free internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on. I think technology it's liberating humanity. It's one of the best tools the regular person has.

       They're just victims of fear. They fear the things they don't understand. Technology has the ability to be the reason for the social revolution we so crave. The spread of information so fast and instant and the ability to learn so much by having a simple device in your pocket has the ability to force change in so many ways. Which is why countries like china try so hard to restrict it. Obviously there are negatives to such technology but it has a net positive impact because the information is there for those that want and are able to comprehend and find it. Of course uneducated simpletons will fear it because they lash back at anything they can't comprehend but for people like you and me it can be extremely liberating at the same time if used for reasons that expand out knowledge and understanding of the world around us. You are 100% correct in saying technology is liberating humanity. And I too could go on and on about that but you have to remember some of our audience here in this sub are frequenters of TD and have the same level of intelligence of a dog.

       Honestly not surprised to see that here. The level of intelligence I see from people in this sub matches perfectly with someone who wasn't educated enough to know the differences from a credit union and normal bank.  Why anyone would use a normal bank over a credit union is beyond me but of course they probably didn't learn about the differences in school based on the things I hear from people here sometimes.

       I believe you. Tried to make a 250.00 purchase at an AT T store and was told they don't accept cash. My card had been compromised and used for fraudulent purchases, it was deactivated and I was waiting for the new one to arrive. They also refused a check (remember those?) so I left empty handed. 
People don't believe me when I say my crisp, green cash was declined.

       This sounds nihilistic and that's not my attitude towards life, however

       I used to get passionately angry about all of the things I see here on this sub. Then I realized what good is it doing? Do I honestly think I can change things? I dont work for the president or know any secret information. All I can do is be informed and thats not enough, honestly.

       Don't give up or give in, stop using technolgy if you wish. It's your life and you don't have to be a sheep if you don't want to. If you don't have anything that could give your life meaning then go out and make it meaningful. If that's working against the system then so be it, if that's being present for your parents or children then so be it.

       Wow. You consider the 80s normal? This is when latch key kids erupted into our society. Wall Street decimated the country, politicians carved out the country for personal gain, and we had frekn Ronald Reagan threatening the world with his Star Wars program.
      </p>
      <p>
       The work force tanked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Horrible Urban Legends gripped neighborhoods. Remember the razor in the apple and poisoned candies myth? It took off after the Tylenol tampering incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satanic rituals were imagined to be everywhere. All we heard about were day cares that abused children, so parents struggled with working, having kids and then trusting them in day cares.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dungeons and Dragons, horror movies, heavy metal and punk music, scared the hell out of a lot of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       AIDS epidemic and the gay community...people had irrational fears of being in the public for fear of getting AIDS from gazing upon the glorious backsides of a beautiful gay man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the drug epidemic, teen pregnancies? I know kids who were never allowed outside because their parents knew crack was being sold at the bus stop and that all girls were hoes just “begging for the sex!”
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you do drugs and have sex, you’re gonna get a crack-baby.

       My personal favorite was all of the hypnotists and regressive therapies where people created false memories from their past.....why is this important? Alien abductions, being abused, all kinds of crazy shit hit the planet. Stupid Shirley McClain and her dumbass movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       “WOLVERINES!” Red Dawn, World War III as a TV miniseries.....the 1950s war scares were still very real.

       The 80' were crazy fun. But, like the 70's, please let us not ever revisit that era ever again. Too fuckin' embarassing in every shape, form and fashion.

       I grew up in the 80s and can confirm that is the perception I had as a kid, and still feel that way about the time, that it was the last time of an Era that people born after really won't understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though there were dangers "out there," like with the Soviets, wall street, and razor candy, things very much changed in the early nineties when the internet started to materialize.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think in 100 years we will see time divided at this point, pre internet and post internet, the same way historians look at the printing press as an important division in time.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the op's original question, unless people purposefully opt out or isolate themselves, then no, it's not gong to to back to how it was in the 80s.

       Yep. The Daily Show did a segment years ago where, I think it was John Oliver, went looking for the "good old days" that tv pundits always long for when bitching about how terrible the country is now.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the answer is always "when I was a kid", basically. I think the 80s and 90s were great, but I was a kid. All I had to worry about was nothing, because I was a kid. The crack epidemic and AIDs epidemic didn't bother me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you go back decade by decade, there's always good shit and bad shit and you only remember the good shit as a kid. Even people who grew up in the 1930s during the depression remember it fondly, even thought they struggled for food and shelter, etc.

       I disagree that any of those were "true." The McMartin case is an infamous example of a head-strong prosecutor using manipulative tactics to get kids to say things that 100% did not happen, leading to the wrongful conviction of a lot of people.

       You're right. But my disagreement is based on evidence. There's countless articles and books about it. Here's an article by one of the "victims" explaining what the police did to the kids to make them implicate the teachers.

       "We were examined by a doctor. I took my clothes off and lay down on the table. They checked my butt, my penis. There was a room with a lot of toys and stuffed animals and dolls. The dolls were pasty white and had hair where the private parts were. They wanted us to take off their clothes. It was just really weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I remember them asking extremely uncomfortable questions about whether Ray touched me and about all the teachers and what they did--and I remember telling them nothing happened to me. I remember them almost giggling and laughing, saying, "Oh, we know these things happened to you. Why don't you just go ahead and tell us? Use these dolls if you're scared."
      </p>
      <p>
       Anytime I would give them an answer that they didn't like, they would ask again and encourage me to give them the answer they were looking for. It was really obvious what they wanted. I know the types of language they used on me: things like I was smart, or I could help the other kids who were scared."

       McMartin has always been one I haven't been able to get a good sense of, but from my research I would say that the Presidio case was certainly 100% true. Why do you disagree about Presidio?

       I don't think there's any good evidence at all that the Presidio case was true. The situation was similar to McMartin, although the therapist played a much greater role in concocting the abuse scenarios in the Presidio case.

       Can you support that with evidence? If you recall, there were many therapists involved who interviewed the 60+ children who claimed abuse. 5 children were verified to have had STDs. Multiple children identified by name the Army Colonel and his wife who was allegedly involved in the abuse - a name which comes up in multiple other cases from that period. You must know the sordid history of the FMSF?

       That's not the whole story. In certain cases, there is a systemic element to the abuse. For example, the Catholic Church systematically protects abusive priests. It is insanely dangerous to assume that it's only a few bad employees in every case. Sure, that happens too, but sometimes child abusers

       the day cares and mostly hire people who are complicit (often family members). Even worse, there may be organization at a larger scale related to child trafficking via day cares. This has been connected to MKUltra, for example.

       Not sure why you consider ritualized abuse and torture to be hilarious, but that stuff really happens. The spiritual side of it may be pure nonsense, but kids still get tortured and sometimes killed by these lunatics, making it anything but hilarious.

       I fear false saviors and things that happen in back rooms and dark places.

       You've got a point but op is still right. 80's seem to be the last decent decade. I mean, inflation has doubled since then so its pretty reasonable to think the 80's count as 'the good ol days'... We'd all be making the same money but paying half as much for food/gas/rent etc.

       Love your post, just wanted to come in and say the one time a kid died from halloween candy poison (his own dad did it) was in the 80s and took place like 15 minutes from where I live. That being said, for some people an 'urban myth' kind of feels like a reality.

       this is seriously a massively warped perspective on what the 80s were and it's clearly a perspective gained from "academic study" of the 80s, wherein history gets rewritten after the fact and narratives are formed that are more reflections on the present day mentality, rather than firsthand experience.

       Sure.....anyway...
      </p>
      <p>
       OP’s post was about the 80s being a simpler time and how it might be better if we could go back before technology ruined it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before we do that, how about we go into the 80s with our eyes wide open. Let’s call it for what it is. The 80s weren’t all that great. “Except for the fact that i slept with your mom, a lot.”
      </p>
      <p>
       All I wanted to express with my post was that if we do go back, here are some things that happened back then, that kinda sucked, “like your mom did, on me, throughout the 80s.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Cause guess what else the 80s were about? Mom jokes. Do you really want to relive “yo momma so stupid, she complained to the M&amp;M company that all she got was W’s?”
      </p>
      <p>
       How about having to rewatch Eddie Murphy’s Delirious for the 1,000th time on HBO? “Ice cream.....but you can’t have none, you on da welfare...it only be funny for so long.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Dude, I had fun in the 80s, but that’s cause I spent it doing your mom...

       all this is is some millennial who wasn't even there during the 80s and doesn't know anything about them, trying to put them down and paint them as negative because they're fondly remembered by conservatives as a time of conservative prosperity. the left does this crap all of the time. everyone who was alive during the 80s, and is alive now, and can actually compare the two can see that this isn't even a discussion worth having

       I agree except that razor blades in apples and needles in candy bars was a huge thing in the 70’s when I was little (&amp; maybe before) so that when the Tylenol poisoning’s took place (a few towns away from me in Chicago suburbs) we all said, “See- it is that simple to fuck with stuff.”

       Yup, entire Bible Belt Communities. They had book burnings, record burnings...I watched as some Pentecostals read from a DM guide and then Exorcised the demons from it before they burned it. All the while some crazy nut screamed crazy things because she was “speaking in tongues.”
      </p>
      <p>
       And guess who was there to whip some of those flames? Our freedom of speech protectors, the Press just fanned and fanned the fear.

       Honest to God I don’t know how we avoided actual burnings at the stake....

       I love the 80s as much as anybody, and I'm somewhat wistful about the Cold War, but everything you said is true. I think technology is what you make of it. It's just a tool. It has, however, brought the psycho out in many people, or at the very least uncovered it for everyone to see.

       There is a contingent of the Alt-Right who worships the 1980's as this halcyon age when America was actually great, and they make me fucking laugh hysterically.  Probably why they're actively trying to bring back the Satanic panic.

“Talk to your doctor about viagra” in the late 90’s was 
“Talk to your parents about Kool-aid” in the late 1980’s.
“Moooooom it’s got vitamin C in it!!”

       Don't think I haven't fantasized about it.  I have about $300k equity in my house. She bought the whole shebang for $75k.  Taxes are like $200 a year.  Her biggest expense is gas.  I could live like that for $10k a year, which gives me 22 years on just my equity.  Not even counting interest on that money if invested.

       If we're throwing around alternate timelines, I'd like to see what the world would look like if the anti-war movement in the '60s had been successful instead of undermined. Imagine a few less decades of American Imperialism. Imagine a world devoid of the US military-industrial complex.

       Just playing devil’s advocate here:
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the we pulled out of Vietnam and it became communist? American imperialism ends and huge shockwaves are felt globally by foreign leaders that interpret them as the beginning of the end for the American empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the USA focuses more on infrastructure, legalization of drugs, education, and other social issues the Russians see a chance to spread their influence around the world. Britain and France are then left to fight the battle of ideology alone and lose their influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If instead all the military bases the US has around the world were Russian, how would our society be different? The pacifist is an easy target for an aggressor.

       There is a fundamental misunderstanding of why socialism and communism were becoming popular in the developing world. These countries were shaking off centuries of colonialism. If our elite had instead embraced policies that were mutually beneficial instead of trying to back rightwing dictators to establish Banana Republics all over the world, it would've been a different story.

       Well, if you want something that was somewhat normal I would say the 60s without Vietnam and the red scare would be normal. But yeah, I think it's much worse now with technology controlling people's lives. Try going out to dinner and eat without someone pulling out their phone, or all the people collectively pulling out their phone. It's nearly impossible. I hate it.

       going to shops to shop is inefficient , most of the times you won't even find what you need and the big shops will monopolize everything anyways like home depot or todays amazon .
I agree with the rest though.

       I was a kid in the 80’s and it stunk ass to high hell. Challenger disaster, threat of Cold War turning active (Russians were out to get us), expensive electronics that didn’t do shit, bad hair, bad clothes, analog everything that was large, heavy, and super expensive, home alone most of the time while both parents worked multiple jobs to make ends (barely) meet, pedophiles everywhere constantly tryna get me (not joking... had one start stroking my hair when I was 10 while waiting in line at Kentucky Fried Chicken (before it was KFC) right in front of my evil stepmother). Computers were expensive pieces of shit with laughable “capabilities”, just to name a few things. Oh, let us not forget The Night Stalker, Richard Ramirez sneaking into peoples’ homes at night to slash them to death so many were afraid to leave their windows open. Mikel Gorbachev and that weird red dagger thingy on his head. Effing Ronald Reagan closing down mental health hospitals turning countless boards of severely ill patients on to the streets. AIDS crisis erupting whole effing Reagan CUT funding and promoting it as a gay disease further encouraging stigma, fear, and ignorance. A recent documentary talked about the 80’s being the most violent decade. Hell, drive-by shooting and violent freeway road rage was borne. Yeah... the 80’s were a real blast.

       Sorry that era sucked for you. It was great for me. Quiet life in the suburbs surrounded by two parent families like mine who lived " boring" and normal lives, no crime to speak of them in my town. ( Now it's a shithole. So glad my parents left long ago.) Kids need boring. They don't need to be traumatized all the time by worrying about violence and crime ( or absorbing it from all the gruesome and sadistic media we have now--it's way too graphic for young kids and creates trauma.)

       Definitely though by the late 80's the dark specter of AIDS was something that I was worried about, along with other things in the world; but mostly I had the luxury of the happy self-involved narcissism of a decent childhood--which I'm very grateful
for.

       I was referring more to the burden of technology and a harkening back to a simpler time for individuals. No matter how far you go back there is always political agendas and strife, but it feels like now we’re just helpless plebs who only care about the next iPhone launch. No one seems to care about anything real anymore (except those awakened souls), but even the I would wager that they are dependent on technology for more than just their basic needs.

       I want it too. So much. I've downgraded to a dumbphone, gone paper-based with note-taking/planning/calendaring/contacts/blogging (bullet journaling covers all of these bases for me; it's fantastic), I'm planning on buying a good ole fashioned alarm clock and my next step is to start shopping in actual shops again, as you mentioned, OP. No more Amazon!
      </p>
      <p>
       Reality HAS changed, and I've gone along with it, but I'm realising that I don't want that kind of reality anymore. I want the old one. Once a gadget-lover, I have completely done a 180 and realise now that high technology isn't an extra in my life that I desperately need.
      </p>
      <p>
       Phones are nice. I'll have one of those. Refrigerators etc, all those things are important to me. Tech that keeps hospitals running, new medical advancements, emergency services, essential communications, etc etc, is a godsend. I love tech, if used for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in my daily life, what I need most is human connection and immersion in this amazing world that I've been blessed to be a part of. Excess technology... is just a distraction.

       I've heard this alot, but I really disagree. Sure, everyone bitches about something in their time, but the advent of social media and the rise of personal tech has completely overhauled the basics of human interaction in an incredibly short time. Changes happen every generation, but the past 30 years has been absolutely revolutionary, and IMO we have yet to see if it is a positive thing or not.

      <p>
       the third world war already happened, and the threat of nuclear annihilation was one of the propaganda tools which was particularly effective in getting the citizens of the various involved countries to support it. the rapture is more likely to happen than large scale nuclear warfare, and i don't think the rapture is an even slightly credible belief.

       hey your entitled to your opinion, but i think nuclear holocaust will eclipse those two by quite a bit. Also those emp from them will destroy all electronics that we rely on so much now, that many wouldn't know how to live without.

       no, it was many things but a world war it was not. A series of proxy wars over the years, with almost attacking each other directly, is not the same as a world war.

       I have windows 10 and it recently updated my computer and it totally ruined the screen resolution.  Everything is so stretched out I can hardly use it.  I've tried everything to fix it and it won't go back.  I restored it to a date prior to the update and it worked for about ten minutes and then automatically went back to the messed up screen.  Everything is distorted, I hate it that you have no say in when/what they do to update your computer with this brand of windows.  It makes me want to throw the computer away.  I needed to rant this one out :(

       Cancel all your subscriptions, and season tickets.  They are more habit than benefit.  Cancel your charge cards and only use debit cards.  No money = no spending, and no compound interest charges.  That's a big step back to 1950's normal.  It's your money, keep it.

       I encourage parents to get their children involved in the performing arts or other creative pursuits. ( Not trying to groom them for a life in Hollyweird, but to encourage development of social skills, personal confidence, and right-brained intuition/ imagination.) Turn them from a mindless passive consumer of media into a confident creator. Those skills will remain with them for the rest of their lives.

       Cool! That's the other thing--learning how to do/fix/make stuff. We need to bring back the idea of apprenticeship and make it more popular instead of having kids force fed into over-priced and often useless college studies.

       I’m pretty high in corporate America, all the nic nacks and normal corporate stuff people would have. Since I was a kid I wanted to live off the land with chickens and goats. As I’m older and we have smart phones, social media and other technology. I️ literally sit on my ass all day, I will die early and not do anything other than work at this rate.
So I am currently looking at homes in Hawaii or Mexico. I️ will be making the change for my health and wellness. You can’t change the world but you can change yourself.

       As long as you know your field it’s just a matter of speaking well to it. It’s a lot of meetings, so you have to dress the part and be pretty sharp in there ready to respond. You have to be good at financials as well, the higher corporate people mainly deal with ebitda and budgets. 
Lifestyle is nice, I never really think twice when buying something. When buying a lot of clothes or something I don’t really add up the price first.
Corporate is really cut throat though, they will drop you like a ton of bricks if something goes wrong. I’ve always wanted a very simple life but just ended up here.

       For the past couple hundred years everyone who's lived a reasonably long life has seen great  technological change in their lifetime.  We can't go back to the 80's just like they couldn't go back to the 50's.  I agree that it's unnerving.

       The thing I've noticed, which is not exactly earth shattering, is how much more disconnected as a society we've become since the 1980's.  Real life relationships have been replaced with digital relationships.  We fear each other now.   We fear everything now.  We are a fear based society, and continue to allow these fears to serve as the impetus for an ever encroaching tyranny.

       Mobile smart phones have created a tech-dependent society. Culture is dictated to us through social and news media. Get rid of the mobile phones/high tech and our society will become self-sufficient and culture procreative. Don’t get me wrong, I’ll miss AC, electric lights, movies, music, my car, etc. but independence requires sacrifice

       As an 80's kid it is weird to hear myself repeating the same alarmist concerns the "old folks" were going on about back when I was still developing. They were right, in a sense, that media would undo the family unit, though I doubt that even the most worried back then would be able to imagine a scenario where children younger than 2 interact with screens more than their parents or siblings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I look at my kids, ages 3 and 2, who I was lucky enough to have with a partner who shares most of my views and I can't even fathom how much their development could have been negatively impacted them if we had abandoned them to technology and convenience.

       I don't consider the 80's normal by any definition of the word. In fact, I don't ever want to be normal anyway. Normal is something akin to a person who abides by the 'society', a good little sheeple. Be yourself, not what other people want you to be.

       The solution here is to live with friends and family and people you trust. This is the next big trend. Because we have almost nothing in common with our neighbors anymore, people will move to live near like-minded people - people they can trust a little more than the random dude upstairs whose lifestyle is exactly opposite yours.

       Not sure if it's been mentioned, but there's a pretty large dead zone in the north east part of the US. You could go move there and live like people did in the 80s. Also you're in control of your life.

       Part of me wants to go back to that level of technology from back then because I don't like the way tech is used/abused now (not to mention the social effect it has had and will keep on having on society). However, if this tech did not exist, I would have a very limited scope and vantage point of the world around me, my book collection would be nowhere near the breadth of knowledge that it is today, and I'd talk to maybe a small group of friends sparingly, instead of being able to send people hundreds of miles away from me funny stuff to keep the friendships fresh and alive.

       I sometimes wonder if people also feared there was a massive indoctrination going on the day scripture was invented. Like, would people say: "I miss the day our kids learned of our history by oral tradition, not in these 'writings' only some people can make.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that I don't acknowledge the systematic idiotization of society by media, but I like to challenge myself by analyzing the possibility that maybe I'm just afraid of technology, or simply getting old.

       The point is that in the 80s, American society was relatively successful at protecting the innocence of many if not most children. Thus, those children were able to have the luxury that we call "childhood."
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, some children from that time were being molested, raped, abused, and neglected. Maybe many more than society was aware of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, the adult world has been forced onto children at a younger and younger age due to declining media standards, civilizational malaise, and the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we can do for the next generation is to carve out a time in their earliest years where they are protected, physically, emotionally, and morally, and given guidance and education that they will need when they become adults and face the terrible nature of the real world.

       Yeah we should do it. Not get rid of the technology but clearly limit and restrict its usage to proper and good causes - not spying , tracking, manipulation, brainwashing. etc. I think we'll come to it sooner than later.

       I would argue that if you take a bigger picture look, the 1980s were not normal at all. A large, vibrant middle class is not historically "normal". The 80s were an anomaly from a few decades of post-war boom, fruits of civil rights activism and the early returns on globalism being more evenly distributed across all classes in the USA. We had yet to come up against any limits of growth, oil was cheap, there was still some elasticity in the biosphere etc etc. A temporary oasis of materialism.

       It's the best societal control mechanism ever invented. Everyone is tied to it now and there is no real alternative. Most companies won't even cut you a check anymore or even a stub. I don't see any way out of it now and when print is obsolete then history can be scrubbed to suit an agenda. Millennial's won't remember or care. They will be easy to manipulate.

       Now this has got me thinking.  Objectively what was the best decade of the 20th century? Going mostly from memory...
      </p>
      <p>
       1900's: (hell if I know)
      </p>
      <p>
       1910's: WWI 1914-1918. Spanish Flu Pandemic 1918.
      </p>
      <p>
       1920's: Prohibition. Fuck that.
      </p>
      <p>
       1930's: Great Depression. Double fuck that.
      </p>
      <p>
       1940's: WWI 1939-1945. Not cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       1950's: Post-war nuclear scare. Korean War. Racial integration and backlash.
      </p>
      <p>
       1960's: Cuban Missile Crisis. Hippies. Free Love. LSD. More racial unrest.
      </p>
      <p>
       1970's: Gas shortage. Tail end of Vietnam War. Older hippies.
      </p>
      <p>
       1980's: Yuppies. Corporate America. Cold War.  Japanese cars. AIDS. New Coke. Beige.
      </p>
      <p>
       1990's: Must See TV. Email. Dial-up internet. More AIDS. Really old hippies.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what I got for now. So from what I can tell, the 1950's weren't so bad if you were white, and the 1980's and 1990's seemed like fairly non-controversial times - no big sense of impending doom at least. If I had to choose, I'd have to go for the 1900's because 1) my ignorance is bliss, 2) this was right before cars started to become a thing, 3) the 80's and 90's were cool but too corporate for my tastes.

       Ah the 1900's, rickets, polio, smallpox, high child mortality rates, incredible pollution, the great red scare (Known these days as the First red scare) - It's all subjective. When I was a kid adults would talk with wistful nostalgia about the 60's, a few years ago everyone who wasn't actually alive in the 80's were talking about the decade like it was a golden age of entertainment and excitement (It wasn't). Nostalgia seems see 20 previous as the golden age of mankind usually, that's about how long it takes humanity to completely change it's habits into something new, unknown and to some, quite sinister and scary.

       Social media is the tobacco of this generation. I don't understand how people willingly give away every detail of their life like that for free for the world to see. A lot of insecurities and false fantasies exist in the cesspool known as social media. There's a mental health epidemic that started when Facebook took off and at this point it's an issue that needs to be addressed. Facebook is one of the worst things that ever happened to humanity

       Is it possible for us to go back to normal? Like 1950's normal? People helped each other out, kids respected their elders, you shop for actual needs not frivolous wants, pay with the fruits of your hard work and loving sacrifice...I cannot be the only one who thinks hedonism has ruined the world. I don't want to be part of the "Me generation."  Scares the poop out of me.

       There will be two "races" of humanity. Those who got the chip inserted and those who didn't who will eventually become outlaw rebel exiles. It will be like Invasion of the body snatchers as everyone we know and love disappears into the permanent digital world. 
At Thanksgiving I asked the family: once the tech is available would you get chipped? You'd be amazed how many said hell yeah! Ask your family and friends then talk them the fuck out of it.

       The murder rate in the 1980s was nearly double what it was in 2010. 
From what I've heard about the 1980s, most of the country felt really unsafe.

       The 70s were the best decade in my opinion. Race relations were actually improving, middle class wages were yet to stop growing, the nfl wasn’t totally corrupt, star wars and the muppets and skylab and the 6502 cpu and the trans  am was badass. Also funk music and high times magazine.

       This currently does happen in very, very small pockets of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       My children run free with the neighborhood every day and I do feel concern but never really worry.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 26 kids under the age of ten on our block. The kids really bind the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       We make a concerted effort to shop at the local pharmacy, pubs, shops, etc...everyone I know tries their hardest to avoid big box stores.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually feel like my family is a part of a community that honestly cares for al its’ members.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our street has an active Facebook chat (take that for what it’s worth, it does keep us talking on the hourly basis) and we regularly congregate spontaneously in the sidewalks.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have problems, very bad problems- we are only a stones throw away from some of the worst prostitution and drug riddled sectors of Birmingham.
      </p>
      <p>
       We’re probably in the 1% of communities, but we are very lucky and thankful. We are very close with all our neighbors, group together in times of need, celebrate in times of joy.  We have parties about once a month and regularly meet, visit and drink and talk in the street
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve never experienced another place like it. We live in Homewood, a suburb of Birmingham, Alabama.
      </p>
      <p>
       We’re the small town odd place out- but we are still fighting for the world we want to create and the world that our children should enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s out there- we exist

       I spent the 1980's yearning for the kind of technology we have today, mainly in the form of video games and entertainment. The same problems were beginning to take hold even then, but with first generation VR having arrived means the day is soon coming when people can cocoon themselves into a false reality simply by putting on a pair of glasses. Try riding the bus, everyone is glued to their smartphones.

       Then get off the internet ya goon. These things still exist if you disconnect yourself. High technology has only ruined the lives of those who let it consume them. Notice in my post history how I go days if sometimes weeks with out posting? Go out and have a life. Tech isn't stopping you. Only you are.

       Go to an old folks home and ask some senior citizens; 50's-70's is viewed as the most "normal" time.
      </p>
      <p>
       1910's War. Democratic Marxists parties viewed as biggest threat to status quo. Leading Marxists attempt to prevent it, are assassinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       1920's Clusterfuck as world deals with internal issues and try to isolate Marxists - biggest geopolitical issue is the birth of the USSR, the subversion of democratic Marxism, and its replacement by authoritarian Stalinism.
      </p>
      <p>
       1930's War. Started due to the subversion of democratic Marxist parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       1940's More war. Ended with Soviet Stalinists being viewed as biggest threat to the status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       1950's Korean war, bloody back and forth fighting in trenches. Again, a war against authoritarian Communists. Coups in the middle east against democratic Marxists, they are replaced by authoritarian Monarchists. COINTELPRO is very much a thing, liberal democratic influences suspected of being Marxists or sympathizers are targeted and sabotaged by the state apparatus.
      </p>
      <p>
       1960's Vietnam war.  A war against authoritarian Communists. Liberal Democratic president is assassinated following a deliberately srapped invasion of a bordering authoritarian "Communist" dictatorship. MLK Jr. is assassinated. Malcom X is assassinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       1970's Vietnam war continued. The USSR is invading Afghanistan, the cold war is very real. COINTELPRO ends due to public outcry, War on Drugs begins, targets same leftist elements, especially along racial lines. Cocaine becomes big.
      </p>
      <p>
       1980's Unions are basically dead, the US is in the cold war. CIA known to be smuggling cocaine into black neighborhoods. South America has been fucked like a choirboy handing out viagra.

       Get rid of your cellphone, get rid of facebook and twitter. I've been going on 45 days without phone and most social media minus reddit. I need something to read while at work. Its amazing how quickly it changes your mindset and how social you'll want to become.

       Supposedly the internet and technology will become so advanced, we won't even notice them anymore. Like you won't need a device to access anything. Internet will just be everywhere, like in the wallpaper or clothing fabric. At that point, we'll be looking at people when we're talking to them again, like we did before we had smart phones.

       You are right. It's sad and only going to get worse . An example of this is me writing on here when I've got kids dogs and everything that should make me happy but I'm sure life is designed to be stressful,relationships doomed to fail because we throw things away and replace ,we don't fix anymore.  They stopped trying to make light bulbs that last forever when they realised it was better if we kept having to buy them. So after writing this I promise to put this phone down and do something that makes me happy

       Technology has connected in so many ways today it is easy to take it for granted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I lived in the 80s. It was hard to get in contact with other people if you did not live physically close to them. There was basically only landline phones. You had to know where someone would be at a certain time. It that person was traveling it was nearly impossible to contact them.
      </p>
      <p>
       People were totally dependent on the mass media for their news and information on the world in general. If you wanted to publish something yourself it was incredibly hard and an expensive, practically impossible. The only other option were obscure books that nobody knew about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your opinion counted for nothing. Unlike today where you can post on forums, setup a website or make a video and easily many other people. I would not be "awake" today if it were not for the Internet.

       I carry a cellphone strictly for emergencies that I only receive or make a call on only once in blue moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       About a dozen years ago I did an experiment. I stopped watching TV for three months. Whenever I attempted to look at it after that I couldn't bear the completely contrived, simplistic, and completely unreal picture of human beings and the world I was being presented with not simply by fictitious entertainment but more importantly with what passes for the so-called "news" and the information that it didn't rather than did provide, and I haven't watched it since.
      </p>
      <p>
       I use only cash for virtually all of my everyday purchases and make small talk with the shopkeepers and cashiers that I routinely deal with or to break the ice with people next to me in line while waiting at any lengthy check-outs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I walk my dog along the same route around my neighbourhood twice a day and nod, wave, say hello, or stop and chat for a minute or two with people I have seen and who have seen me regularly doing that for years, now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I'm almost 70 and have lived my entire life that way and if I was to encounter you along my way OP, provided that you weren't wearing earphones and your eyes weren't glued to a smartphone you'd realize that you're not living in that world that seems to scare the shit out you unless you choose to, while I and many others still don't and never ever will.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's far too small and confining and there's always so much more all around to take in, be aware of, and be at ease with by simply doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the "real world" and it's always there, what you do in it and with it is up to you, not anyone else. Let them distract themselves to death and completely loose themselves in everything that is artificial, instead of the real thing if that's all that matters to them. They aren't worth the time of day and they won't give it to you, either, even though they always know what time it is because it's always right in front of their noses on the devices that they're afraid to take their eyes off for more than a few seconds at a time.

       Normal?  I don't even know what is considered "normal" here in the U.S., not even back in the 1980s.  It was a mixed bag era, where entertainment for the most part was surely better than today. . . but it was by no means perfect.  I think I had a culture identity crisis back then because of that - never had much of a social life mostly because I didn't really "buy in" to a lot of stuff promoted by television and movies back then.  Society was not really all that accepting of intellectuals, geeks, nerds, etc. . . and Lord help you if you were also black and conservative on top of that. . . sure, "The Cosby Show" and "Family Matters" were great for their time. . . but the way Steve Urkel was portrayed in the latter really grated me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, I would expect to get into debates, attacked at times, maybe win a few people over.  Back then people like me were marginalized out of existence, so to speak. . . we were basically invisible.  I was not connected to much of anything back then, while these days I have met several new people in person after chatting via social media.  The opportunities to make the most of your life are probably greater now than then, just don't allow technology (and social media) run your life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more I look at entertainment over the past 20-30 years, it appears that a lot of what was there was a gradual progression in promoting the upcoming AI regime.  Television, music, movies, video games - you name it, it was all hidden in plain sight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another great thing today is the ease of access to independent journalism/media - back in the 1980s we were mostly limited to the Big Three networks for news, which allowed corrupt politicians to stay under the radar.  They can't do that no more!
      </p>
      <p>
       But we still have a zombie problem today.  It's getting worse, but at least more people are aware of it now, with growing numbers picking up on it daily.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only good thing I can remember from back then was the diversity in computers on sale.  There was something for everyone, unlike today (MacOS X vs. Windows vs. Linux vs. *BSD; iOS vs. Android; Intel vs. AMD).
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe one day we can explore other physical dimensions which are much saner than this one and put down roots there, but until then, or until things change for the better here, I can't think of any good way of doing this short of moving to a Russian town (and that's not for everyone).

       I'm curious what you think the alternative to "being corporate slaves like men" is? Last I checked we all need jobs regardless of feminism. Well unless of course we manage to reach financial independence and retire early, which I'm hoping for and see as one of the only ways to escape it. I hate being a "corporate slave" but there's almost literally no way around it.

       Honestly not surprised to see that here. The level of intelligence I see from people in this sub matches perfectly with someone who wasn't educated enough to know the differences from a credit union and normal bank.  Why anyone would use a normal bank over a credit union is beyond me but of course they probably didn't learn about the differences in school based on the things I hear from people here sometimes.

       Honestly I think you may be in an electronic bubble. Try disconnecting for a couple days, go hang out in a cafe or public place and make conversation. Especially with older people, not everyone is a zombie. Technology is a big part of our lives now and it's ok to be wary.

       I would say I had a well-rounded childhood and teenaged years.  Was it like everyone elses' childhoods?  No.  But I have never been lacking in socialization.  If anything, quite the opposite: I am able to relate to much broader range of people in many more types of situations than most seem comfortable with.

      <p>
       For a specific example regarding socialization: on Friday nights, we didn't go out to movies with friends or hang out skateboarding or whatever else kids do on Friday nights.  We went contra dancing.  Very different lifestyle, but it served the purpose of socialization quite well and I
       <em>
        promise
       </em>
       you that being able to dance and comfortably relate to the opposite gender on the dance floor is an excellent talent to have.
