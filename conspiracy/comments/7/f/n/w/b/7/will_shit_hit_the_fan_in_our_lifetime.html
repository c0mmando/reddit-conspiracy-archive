       I’m 21 years old, been opened to how shitty our gov is and they type of things they’re said to be involved in. From 9/11 to black ops assassinations. I’ve retained quite a bit of knowledge about it all. 
Was doing some traveling for thanksgiving &amp; couldn’t help but think about how great this country is at the same time. I can walk down the street and not get into a gun fight over my religious beliefs, people aren’t getting beheaded everywhere and I’ve got smooth roads to drive around on. 
I am African American &amp; honestly I think this BLM shit sucks, I hate it. I hate that the media spent so much time and effort into talking about the worst possible shit. 
It’s conflicting because I’m a red blooded American &amp; would be willing to fight and die for the chance to uphold all these freedoms that we take for granted at times. But will that happen? I’m our life, do you think the time will come for us to take matters into our own hands? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. Thomas jeffs knew his shit, and I think it’s over due. I’m not coming at it like a terrorist, but it feels like something is going to happen to get people off this sub and out on the street where the real changes are made.

        BLM.

       The truly woke don't buy into that nonsense.

       Also, there are lots of people just like you are waiting at the guard. They may not be the first ones to charge but are ready to join in when shit hits the fan. In my opinion, there is a very big portion of the population that fall into this category.

       My understanding of BLM is so different. What does their message mean to you? The original message not some individuals rage message. What was BLM started from?
      </p>
      <p>
       I will tell you because most who don't agree are ignorant. They see what happened in Texas and think that was a goal of BLM. BLM is not against police. BLM is against the killings of innocent OR unarmed African Americans
       <em>
        by
       </em>
       the police.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't focus on what you want to to ignore a bigger message. People use Texas to dismiss but that was NOT the intentions of that original, morally sound message that did NOT encourage violence but instead discouraged it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, is your conflict with BLM, or with the individuals who twist the message or incite violence through their own means and will?
      </p>
      <p>
       BLM is an ironic statement that in context really just means "Hey, did you forget we're equal too? That our lives matter as much as anyone elses and you should try NOT to kill us before doing it so casually?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen shit where cops go through so much to NOT shoot the person, do you know how easily they have shot and killed some unarmed and innocent (meaning they didn't deserve to DIE not that they didn't commit a crime of some sort, because it varies by case obviously) black people??? Or do you stick your head in the sand and blame the victims for things everyone can supposedly freely own and wear like hoodies? Or for being a color or combination of color and stature that makes a police officer afraid?
      </p>
      <p>
       Blame who is supposed to be blamed and tell these cops to start following protocol and give better training.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is one place where possible racism and/or racist acts are horribly detrimental, it HAS to be the courts jails and police, and this is SYSTEMIC so yes the effects can STILL BE FELT TODAY and you can trace the influences through the history of black people in America.

       My views about BLM is virtually identical with Lord Jamar. It's one that was given to the black community by radical leftists with a political agenda. This makes is an illegitimate movement in my eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the sentiments behind why BLM exists, I agree with it 100%. Black lives do matter and while not all, police have been systematically targeting this group for decades.

       Now that is a statement I can get behind. Denial of the movement is fine so long as you understand it. I most likely won't be at a Pride rally supporting but I definitely won't be there trying to shut down their message.

       They do, but in saying that in response to BLM, you miss the entire point of the movement. No one is saying other lives don't matter, if that was the message that would be the message.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you respond to a person touting Gay Pride saying straight people have pride too??? All Lives Matter is just as rude.

       Nope, i see what is happening on all levels and i know BLM is a symptom from a bigger problem that is behind the veils of all created duality.
      </p>
      <p>
       By focussing on one part that is going wrong to one part of a population it is easy to get caught up in duality and completely miss all other points related to the same basic problem while sometimes adding to the problem at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not only black people under attack, no, the whole of humanity is under attack on many levels and singeling out one specific problem can make it better, but often makes it worse when the message gets spinned or drowned out. People are being distracted and kept in misery for many reasons, but the most importent reason is to keep us from uniting and finding out our thrue natural powers.

      </p>
      <p>
       We are all humans, we are basicly all the same and all part of one. Fighting amongst ourselves over all superficial and created duality is hurting us all and makes that we miss the most important things in this "reality". Becouse all the biggering between us we are being distracted from looking into the actual source of all duality and it pushes us into a victom mode instead of the Loving mode we should be in. Our ego is the problem here and it shines through in any thought you have and action you make while creating your and our "reality".
      </p>
      <p>
       The above list of "dualities" only seem dualities in this 3D "reality" we are experiencing, if you start looking deeper within yourself you will find out we are indeed all one and everything is energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two energies governing this reality and one "rule":
      </p>
      <p>
       Fear and Love create the maze we are in and the truth shows us the way through it. Love will shine a light so you don't need to stumble too much. Fear creates all duality and negativety that is keeping us distracted so we don't see the truths that could lead us to the most beautifull path through this maze, but instead we let us lead to the most dark locations some can think of.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have the power for change within ourselves, but we'll need to figure out who we actually are and what we are capable of before we can use our power in the most effective and Loving way. Fighting over any created duality is not helping any cause and violence is even making the problems worse. In the beginning we are all one, there is enough for everybody and once we find the truth within ourselves there is no reason for fear left.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasoning over any unnatural unbalance and trying to solve the actual problems can help, but we should include everything in these conversations and not get too focussed on one (easy to miss-use) sliver of the huge problem we have as humanity.

       I'd also like to piggy-back and say that responsibility is key for ownership of one's reality, lest it be programmed for us.

       You are right about this counrty being a safe place, for now. The only reason we arent beheading eachother is because the petro-dollar system was rigged in the 70's. Once this system changes america will become the existential shithole that mirrors its spirit. But USA is in no way shape or form the greatest country in the world. The ONLY thing that makes us great is gun ownership. Think about how many issues the public, or even the awake, are doing nothing about.

       What is shitting the fan exactly? What is this fetish for wanting there to be some global meltdown? You want change. Be apart of things that really matter and can bring about change:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Demand change in our education system. We need a new infrastructure based around giving people the ability to learn, not memorize facts.
       </li>
       <li>
        Proper nutrition education. People's health are a priority as it affects IQ and productivity and happiness.
       </li>
       <li>
        Support alternative energy solutions, incorporate solar energy into your lives.
       </li>
       <li>
        Learn a skill or trade that will prove useful in the future for mankind such as electrical engineering, civil engineering, biotech research, etc.
       </li>
       <li>
        Help other people whenever you get a chance. Whether through your money or physical capabilities.
       </li>
       <li>
        Love other people. Love yourself. Believe and trust one another.

       I agree, I think we are about to see major change, it is long over due.  OP is correct, we do have an amazing country... but somewhere we got off course.  We became more concerned about being politically correct and love for God and Country went out the window.

       That's totally false.  We didn't have veterans missing limbs in the past because everyone died from infection for the most minor wound.  Now you can lose 4 limbs and still live.

       Yes but now we have bombs that can level entire cities and handheld weapons are not only more powerful, but are also way more affordable and more readily available than ever. If you think the lack of death from infections in industrialized country's soldiers (because there's still a large amount of countries where a minor infection can still very easily kill you) outweighs ALL of that, then you're woefully misinformed my friend.

       Yes, it is. Is it easier to kill with a muzzle loading rifle or by dropping a JDAM on a house? Is a smooth bore cannon deadlier than an Abrams? Don’t be an idiot.

       You are arguing that it’s harder to kill people nowadays. The casualties from the wars of the 20th century prove otherwise. You have a retarded point.

       My statistics flat out say more died from one war with more primitive technology than all of our more modern wars.

       More people live after being shot in the modern age and you claim it is easier to kill someone.

       Your logic is "cause nukes" when we don't even drop nukes.  "Cause bombs" when we tell cities before we bomb them.

       I don't think political correctness is what is killing driving us off the path.  Political correctness is just a symptom.  It's greed, pure and simple.  Greed is destroying our ideals and stopping us from reaching our goals.  And it's greed that is keeping us worried about making it day to day and paycheck to paycheck while the 1% take all the resources for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just the elites we have to fight, it's systemic greed ingrained into our culture in the past 25 or so years.

       I disagree - I think the people we need to be conversing about are just like us. All colors and creeds, with all sorts of backgrounds. The difference is they hold power and are corrupt. There is no "political incorrectness" in discussing that - but there are so many red herrings that people think are causing issues that the big actual boogeyman is just laughing on the way to the bank.

       Grab some popcorn, it's happening right now and not a lot of people don't know and/or understand it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pay attention to the Mueller investigation and discover that what is going down is exactly the opposite of what the media is presenting. You may have to look at "opposition" media and validate it for yourself, but it's up to you to look, to include the fringe "conspiracy theories" that nay-sayers (especially on this subreddit!) tell you is larp-worthy and "a distraction to real conspiracies".
      </p>
      <p>
       Or just wait, things are happening all around and will only ramp up. It's a bizarro world, indeed, when, in truth, understanding what's unfolding in the world is best accomplished by going as mainstream as you can with your sources
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       not fall for the opinions of any of them, but rather, google up on geopolitical names and events that you know nothing about. Plenty of mainstream "scandals" to choose from right now, Hollywood, tech industry, DC, Saudi Arabia, China, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try to remove any left/right biases, if you can (but I think from your BLM comment, you're airing on the side of good judgement). Just follow the information. In my opinion, even though you may cringe at the idea of who's doing the good work out there, you'll eventually find that the bad guys that you wished somebody was doing something about, are getting things done to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be asked why I don't just tell you, just give you a quick answer. I wish it were that easy, but there's a lot of background info and playing catch up that needs to be done by oneself, as you'll have to unlearn what the media has framed as relevant, which leads audiences down disinformation rabbit holes and fallacious conclusions. Otherwise, you'd push back on every word I said. It's out there to be found. Many are waking up to it, even turning 180 in their world view because of it, and that number is exponentially growing by the day, in my opinion.

       It really is an interesting time. This mueller investigation is quite expansive, it'd be something else if he and trump are working together to take down the deep state.

       Also it'd be a real nice "told ya so" moment. But I dunno. No clue anymore. Just read and wait. It's killing me.

       I hear ya. We've been raised with (or have been assimilated into) a 24-hour news cycle and sit/drama narratives that wrap up in an hour, and also those that tease and wander, without resolution, for many seasons. But, I know that you get that.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, there are many that don't have the fortune to explore the world (whether experientially or through academic study) from a geo-political perspective. I often see armchair-quarterbacking of how things should resolve and on what type of timeline, which sucks people in and breaks their hearts every time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It calcifies into a world view of learned helplessness at worst, and denial, at best. And I don't blame them. To say that past performance doesn't predict future results would be an overly simplistic defense, but I will say that all there is to consider is the present, in spite of,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       with regard to, past experiences. Allow me to rephrase that to remove the superlatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Refer to the past as it of course can serve us well, but ensure that the knowledge-base regarding the present moment is always up to date, for best results. It's easier said than done, for sure, but that's what keeps me going. To each their own.

       I won't attempt to change your mind on that, as I don't have a simple answer for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if I may ask you to consider taking a look at all of the people and organizations being dismantled or taken down at this time. You'll see that they have all done things, both worthy of their descent from power, arguebly, and also not a fan of the current administration, and many are
       <em>
        directly
       </em>
       connected his buddies you mentioned. I would say expect to see more of that as the days pass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, some would say that no man nor women puts themselves into such a position of power, they are elevated and represented by a multitude of individuals that offer their personal investment towards that end, for reasons only they can offer, which I'm sure you'd also agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, consider, especially, how large political body counts and the neutering of military agencies (to include military intelligence) can have extreme blowback, even if it takes years, maneuvering and trying to figure out who "their guy" will be, to have the resources to bear to knock the dominos down, once they set it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not here to prove to you that that's what's happening, I'm offering it up as a reasonable thought, as history shows precedence, if scrutinized enough.

       He’s also put a lot of his buddies in positions of power. People who are highly unqualified like Betsy Devos. And endorsed a pedophile. Whatever good you hope he’s up to I’d love to hear what he’s said that would lead you to believe that. Nothing I’ve heard from him suggests it.

       Turns out that some of Clintons cronies that are put into the current administration happened to do some punishable offensives while previously collaborating with a Dem Whitehouse, also.

       Here's an example, current Sec of Commerce, Wilbur Ross. You'll hear more about him in the coming days, he's starting to make the news regarding the investigation.

       Idk it’s just that to me, “Make America Great Again” and “Drain The Swamp” haven’t described a movement of the people in the right direction, just more of the same or worse. Nothing at all indicates to me that Trump wants to replace the establishment for the people. At best we are watching a rift or shift of power amongst the elite. We would be naive to think any of these people’s actions reflect the wishes of anyone but their own clan.

       Online, it refers to a claim that a person is trolling others by playing a character and pretending to be a real person, often with super secret identities and knowledge, conveying information that compels the reader to participate in solving a problem or saving the world from CIA alien robots from the future. Often the post contains a warning of impending doom, or at least infers it.

       When predictions (stated or inferred) invariably do not pan out, it seems to serve an matter of pride and validation for those who were vocal in their disbelief, I suppose as evidence of how impervious they are to deception and indicates their mastery of applying critical thinking, whatever that concept now means. (spoiler: it now means asking for a "reliable" source, calling out ad hominem or confirmation bias, maybe invoking occam's razor or explaining the burden of proof of extraordinary claims, but little else).

       I feel maybe we're beyond shit hitting the fan, beyond the definable
       <em>
        event
       </em>
       of shit hitting the fan, of a bomb being in the news; it's just one thing after another now, crashing waves on an already volatile sea. It seems that so many things are happening that should be, and perhaps would have been really newsworthy but they're drowned out, normalised. It's like everything's been simmered down and leaved together, so even these pretty huge, crazy things are shoulder-to-shoulder with so many others that we're overloaded, saturated, confused as to their meaning. Still, big things do happen; events like Vegas, I suppose, being a pretty big one. I guess if you browse this sub you know the ins and outs of the "news" around these parts atm. But whether shit will hit the fan in terms of some aggravated drive towards some new way, or new "agenda" being rolled out, who knows. I think it'll be more subtle, more insidious than that. I think all that's left now is to see the wood for the trees. Don't wait for something to happen; it's all live, baby, and we gotta react to things as they come, hopefully, with a careful amount of insight in to the bigger picture; i.e. outside of even this bubble of "alternative thinking".

       And before you answer I don't condone the violence associated with BLM. I'm going to assume you don't either, but I don't put that violence on BLM. Those were individuals who chose to do those things but that's not the message of BLM to me. That's not what I saw it start as OR develop to. But no that anger I don't agree with.

       Term limits an antidote for government waste
      </p>
      <p>
       If you could even begin to imagine the enormous waste in the operations of the federal government, it would give you serious pause at tax time. Politicians always threaten dire reductions in the most visible public services — police, fire, education and health care — while budgets are packed with pork, thanks to payoffs from special interests enabling congressmen with $174,000 salaries to leave office as multi-millionnaires.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider the waste inherent in the federal jobs program of the previous administration, which vastly increased the federal workforce by hiring three people to do work formerly done by one. With not enough real work to go around, government employees spend endless hours in repetitive annual training for such challenging tasks such as operating a fire extinguisher or using a telephone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our government acquisition process is the most convoluted, complicated, inefficient method of purchasing things ever created, and had it been used during World War II, we would have lost the war. The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), along with the Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFAR) contain thousands of pages of wasteful procedures, requiring more than a year to complete the very simplest of acquisitions. With these arcane acquisition procedures compounded by continually changing specifications made by senior officers, the Air Force takes so long to develop a new airplane that its electronic systems are out of date before it ever leaves the ground. New systems are then expensively integrated into aircraft already on the production line, while suppliers are given pricey contracts to keep producing outdated technology for earlier aircraft.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Air Force’s F-22 Raptor is a prime example of government inefficiency. Originally designed in 1986, the Air Force ordered 648 planes costing $87 billion in 1991 dollars. Many years, changes and billions later, a total of just 12 planes were delivered in 2012, but their price tag and $70,000 per hour flight cost renders them too expensive to risk sending aloft. Used just once, in 2014, they served as escorts for less-capable planes bombing ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria. Since F-22s are not being flown, their pilots are not acquiring the seat time needed to fly them safely, so they will probably never be used again.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is business as usual for the Air Force, however, which stores many thousands of factory-fresh, pristine and low-mileage military aircraft at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona. Sorted by type and lined up in perfect rows, they stretch across the desert landscape to the horizon. Thanks to the vast inefficiency of the acquisition process, billions of dollars worth of brand-new military aircraft, including the new C-27J transport, are flown only once, directly to this Air Force boneyard, never to be flown again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is this happening? The answer is simple: The lack of congressional term limits allows defense contractors to establish longterm relationships with senior congressmen, filling their pockets and emptying ours.
      </p>

       Congress is the greatest private club in the world, so no congressmen will ever vote for term limits. Salaries for these part-time jobs are only the beginning, as special interests, lobbyists and the military-industrial complex fill their campaign chests with many millions of dollars in return for favorable legislation. Since the only heavy lifting in a typical congressman’s day is getting up to walk to the cafeteria for a subsidized gourmet lunch, it is no wonder that many of them continue serving for 30, 40 or 50 years, then pass on their posts to relatives with the same last names.

       The Founding Fathers wrongly assumed their successors would be gentlemen in their own image, lending their varied expertise to the country for a term or two, and then returning to their businesses and professions. Given the Founders’ success in establishing our republic, with the longestlasting Constitution in the world, we must not judge them too harshly for this solitary oversight, born out of idealism. Selfless heroes who risked all for the cause of American independence, they never foresaw the rise of professional politicians, whose primary skill is exchanging government favors for financial contributions.

       We should now be well aware of the evils of the congressional seniority system, which purports to benefit the taxpayers by increasing the power and influence of its longerserving members. This side benefit is of dubious value, serving only to placate the masses. The true mission of the seniority system is to act as a poison pill against the imposition of term limits.
      </p>
      <p>
       So long as we still have the vote, however, we have the power to impose term limits via the ballot box. Simply vote just one time for your preferred House and Senate incumbents, and eventually there will be no one left in Congress who has been there for more than two terms. Then one fine day we will have de facto term limits, and the Founders will smile upon us.

       trying to fix it is pointless and unless people are dire. food shortages no entertainment. there won't be any reason because most are comfortable. regardless of tpb promoting disease and abusing kids.

       easiest change is removing or changing systems. ie with technology (which has its own risks of being suicided) or finding an alternative to money

       A civilization does not break down within a few months or years. It dies over many decades. Just look at the Soviet Union. That's why the food-stocking preppers are wrong. Even if they stock food for several years, it will run out long before the final collapse.

      <p>
       In our western countries, the average worker is not starving yet. So we must assume that the final collapse is still more than 20 years in the future. Before that, you will likely be one of the people who starve to death.

       Of course they could. I did. But it takes creativity and effort, both which cost time, which many do not have due to working constantly for low wages.

       Food stamps are a big cushion. Take away someone’s cushion and they will either throw a fit or learn to sew. I’m not sure where the average food stamp recipient falls in that scenario.

       It will happen over night! You will wakeup one day and you will never get yesterday back, the new future will be permanent, and if you don't like it there will be camps for you, or a bullet to the head as an other option, that is a fact!

       Yes but now we have bombs that can level entire cities and handheld weapons are not only more powerful, but are also way more affordable and more readily available than ever. If you think the lack of death from infections in industrialized country's soldiers (because there's still a large amount of countries where a minor infection can still very easily kill you) outweighs ALL of that, then you're woefully misinformed my friend.
