    <div class="md"><p>Yes - I don&#39;t necessarily believe that something sketchy is afoot in my dog&#39;s specific case.  It could be that while he was watching tv, something disturbing came on, or something external to the tv happened -- and so he just began to associate the tv with something very negative.  But, I&#39;ve thought about what dogs can hear, versus what we can hear, and I thought maybe someone in r/conspiracy might know more.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I threw out my TV, over half a decade ago. Cost too much and I only have internet. Even just that is like 70 bucks. With TV, would be too much. </p>

<p>I wonder if there&#39;s some kind of subliminal programming that goes on with TV. If you go visit somebody and watch it, take a look at the other person, almost in a trance, staring, zombied right out. </p>

<p>The computer&#39;s pretty bad though, if I&#39;m surfing around reddit, checking new stuff, you almost have to pry yourself away or you can sit there for a few hours. The other day I was checking r / all, then sorted by top, then all time. Wasted like a good 4 hours of a Saturday morning. You have to use will power and shut &#39;er down. haha. </p>

<p>Who knows, maybe there&#39;s some kind of subliminal programming emanating from the screen. I use a 47 inch LED that you normally use as a TV and it&#39;s a few feet away from me at the end of the table. </p>

<p>It could be the TV screen throwing out some kind of subliminal fast pulse, or who knows what. </p>

<p>The only spare time I have for browsing around the internet is when I&#39;m having a bite to eat. After that, don&#39;t want to waste too much time. I have to work on offline stuff instead of wasting time with distractions. Otherwise, you can waste a decade being a fan of somebody instead of a content creator. </p>

<p>I force myself to shut &#39;er down after a little while, sometimes. Only have a few hours of spare time per day after work. You know better and just shut it off, even though you want to keep checking the next page or watch other videos, or movies. I can&#39;t keep up with all the movies coming out. It&#39;s pretty bad. Maybe check what&#39;s out once a season. At least I don&#39;t waste time watching sitcoms and sports. Watching TV or a computer monitor is almost like being in some kind of a trance where you have to pry yourself away. You want to keep checking out interesting things going on in the world. </p>

<p>Now let&#39;s get into what you mentioned about your dog. It&#39;s interesting how it used to like watching TV. Sounds like in recent years, something changed. When was this that your dog liked it? Was it the 4x3 aspect ratio, CRT monitors? </p>

<p>The last TV I had was a CRT plugged into analog cable, not digital. The picture looked good. If I&#39;d plug that analog cable into the LCD before this LED, analog cable had all kinds of bad snow, it looked worse than CRT. You&#39;d need digital for it to be clear. Meanwhile, on the old CRT it looked clearer. You also have this flicker rate with those CRT&#39;s. You would see that if you&#39;d film it with a video camera. Horizontal line moving by. The LCD and LED, you can film it and it doesn&#39;t have that. </p>

<p>In the conspiracy realm, you may have heard things about the &quot;Smart&quot; generation of gizmos, apparently they&#39;re all bad and spy on you. Who knows if they have signals or flicker pulse rates they emanate which might affect someone&#39;s brain. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, I haven&#39;t looked into it. I think I only heard they&#39;re all like spy devices. Do the TV&#39;s have like little webcams on them? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t like any of the &quot;smart&quot; generation of devices, even the damn phones. I don&#39;t trust any of it and still have a flip phone. You see how people are complete zombies since those smart phones. They&#39;re total addicts like junkies who need a click fix. </p>

<p>So what do you think&#39;s going on with the dog? They hear a higher pitch than we do. You know, like the dog whistles. Years ago I bought one of those dog whistles to try and record it. But later noticed mics don&#39;t go much higher than what we can hear. haha. </p>

<p>I wonder if you&#39;d record one of these new TV&#39;s with a mic that covers that range we don&#39;t hear, if you&#39;d be able to see some kind of spectrogram signal in that high range. </p>

<p>A few years ago I looked into bat animal sound recordings. Normally most sounds that are recorded don&#39;t go higher than what we can hear. The mics don&#39;t even go there. These bat recordings were captured with a mic that was in the higher levels. I think the kHz level was high up. I took these files and pitch shifted them lower to the audible frequencies. Then slowed them down. Now you could hear the bats, it sounded like monkeys. I had posted an unlisted spectrogram screenshot recording and posted it in r / videos. Later noticed this UK news outlet wrote an article about it. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3513771/Squawks-squeals-screams-grave-eerie-sounds-bat-calls-revealed-chilling-audio-clips.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3513771/Squawks-squeals-screams-grave-eerie-sounds-bat-calls-revealed-chilling-audio-clips.html</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile I only have my experimental tunes on my youtube, I don&#39;t want all kinds of unlisted clutter of joking around or tweaking audio for people. Had deleted the files. Good thing they backed it up with their own source. Only noticed later that there was an article. </p>

<p>Well, I wonder if there&#39;s some kind of high range frequency emanating from these new generations of TV&#39;s that is disturbing your dog. If there is, you&#39;d need one of these mics to record it, then you could view the spectrogram to see if there&#39;s any fishy pulse going on in those ranges. Might be able to lower the pitch and slow it down or something. Could be something going on. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anything about subliminal mind control programming, if it&#39;s even possible. You hear stories. I can&#39;t think of any in particular but who knows if there is. Well, maybe this is a method where you could detect it. </p>

<p>If I were you, and if the dog used to like CRT shows, maybe get an old one, and test it out with like a player or something. </p>

<p>It could also be the damn cable that generates a signal. When I used to have cable I wanted to record sound effect samples from the TV. But couldn&#39;t do it live because you&#39;d get some bad buzzing if the cable was plugged in. I had to record it on on the TV&#39;s VCR or later a DVD-RW, then unplug the cable to be able to record on the computer. The DVD I could transfer the file on the computer and not have to record it. The cable buzz is probably just a grounding issue. That&#39;s most likely what those noises would be. But who knows, maybe could be some odd subliminal mind control programming signal that&#39;s coming through the damn cable plug itself. This would go on no matter what channel it was tuned to. </p>

<p>What was going on with your dog, why was it ok before and something changed and it didn&#39;t like it. I&#39;m guessing it was around the time things changed from 4x3 aspect ratio to 16x9. Then these flat screens and digital. If something&#39;s &quot;digital&quot;, who knows what kinds of signals may be getting transmitted. </p>

<p>In the conspiracy realm, you hear all kinds of outlandish stories like even signals coming through damn electric house plugs. Some kind of mind programming. I don&#39;t know about any of that. I think I heard David Icke mention it quickly somewhere. </p>

<p>You also have these bad curly fluorescent bulbs that supposedly throw off some bad fast pulses which affect people. I don&#39;t like the pulse of them. Maybe the LED ones might not be as bad. I know I don&#39;t like those bulbs at all and never bought any yet. The other day, used up my last incandescent bulb. So I&#39;ll have to pick up one of these new types soon.</p>

<p>If I were you, I&#39;d run a test with probably an old CRT and a player like a VHS. Don&#39;t even plug the damn cable wire into the unit. I&#39;m guessing your dog used to like the CRT and 4x3 aspect ratio stuff. Maybe they started carrying some kind of subliminal signal with the digital generation. I don&#39;t know about any of this, I haven&#39;t heard any concrete evidence or credible sources. But I did hear a little and I&#39;m guessing there&#39;s some kind of signal your dog is detecting. That would mean, there might be a way to record it somehow. Could be visual, but my guess is the way dogs hear higher frequencies that we don&#39;t, all kinds of things could be going on in that super high pitch range and we wouldn&#39;t even hear it, right? It could be like some totally disturbing tones to put people on a bad trip. I&#39;d trust your dog on this one and seriously look into the matter, somehow. Maybe get one of these bat mics. Hang on let me find that info. </p>

<p>Found an old bookmark of when I was looking into it. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.avisoft.com/usg/microphones.htm">http://www.avisoft.com/usg/microphones.htm</a></p>

<p>Look at these frequency ranges. Frequency range [kHz]  10-120, 10-110, 10-150, 2-250, 10-150. Meanwhile, we can only hear up to 20kHz. <em>&quot;The frequency range of dog hearing is approximately 40 Hz to 60,000 Hz, of course depending on the breed of dog as well as its age.&quot;</em></p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what those bats were, I think 192 maybe. Just dealing with those files was tricky. I think the site I got the noises from was, <a href="http://www.batcalls.com/">http://www.batcalls.com/</a> Let me download one and take a look at the properties. </p>

<p>Tried opening the wav with Sound Forge and an error. Was able to open it with Izotope RX. Says it&#39;s 250,000Hz, when normally a CD quality wav is 44khz. There was also something about how in the spectrogram view, even though the file was 250khz, in the display amount it was &quot;half&quot;. Like right here, looking at it, the &quot;end range&quot;, is 125000Hz, visually. I had asked somebody in r / audioengineering about what the deal was there. I thought it was a 250khz file why is the visual graph limit maxing out at 125khz. I forget the reason but the tone frequency display was half of the file properties. I just thought of something.. if you have a 44khz CD quality wav, the display maxes out at 22khz. Something about half for the Hz frequency display compared to file properties. <em>The Nyquist frequency is the bandwidth of a sampled signal, and is equal to half the sampling frequency of that signal.</em></p>

<p>Looking at this bat wav file, the spectrogram noises are going on just above hearing in 30kHz range. All I did was pitch shift them down into a range where you could hear. I think I might have used Sound Forge for this.. not sure how I got it going. But as I said, couldn&#39;t even open the damn file with it just earlier. If you play them, you don&#39;t hear anything eh. It just sounds like white noise moving by fast. </p>

<p>Anyways, it&#39;s something for you to look into, where you could actually see some kind of proof that your dog is detecting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much for that information!  I won’t be as able to conduct auditory experiments the way that you do, but if someone else out there has that proclivity, then you’ve certainly provided excellent instruction.    </p>

<p>You asked about what kind of televisions we were using.  At the time, my dog still spent some time at his previous owner’s. At my house, we had LCDs with regular Comcast cable, &amp; the previous owner had LCD’s with DirecTV.  We both noticed the change in his behavior at the same time.  Over a period of a few days we couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him, because he was so fussy and so upset--and we both separately came to the same conclusion: that he suddenly hated television and wanted it off!  I should also note that he can somewhat tolerate a television being on during the day—but he definitely doesn’t like it.  (And honestly, he used to really love watching tv, and not just animals!)    </p>

<p>Anyway, I just threw this out there because I read about various conspiracies that have to do with frequencies and mind control and I wonder…</p>

<p>(Also, I listened to your batcalls audio that the Daily Mail posted.  The batcalls were much more intricate and very different from anything I would have expected--very, very cool. Great work!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember with some old CRT TV&#39;s, sometimes when you&#39;d turn them on, you sorta sensed this super high pitched noise that would go away when it was off. These new TV&#39;s since the LCD&#39;s don&#39;t do that. I don&#39;t know if that was something with the tube. You&#39;d think this CRT high pitched noise would have bothered the dog. But it sounds like it was never around those old TV&#39;s. So it was always LCD&#39;s. What changed then that the dog didn&#39;t like? Sounds like it was these setups you mentioned then one day it didn&#39;t like it. </p>

<p>Who knows, but you never hear good things about Comcast. If there was some subliminal signal going on, they might not be &quot;good guys&quot; and could do this type of thing. </p>

<p>I mentioned a bit about these curly light bulbs. Heard David Icke talk about them. Was a little strange when they almost outlawed the incandescent and you can&#39;t even buy them. Seems like this was around the time that they changed from the 4x3 aspect ratio TV&#39;s and moved to digital. Then these &quot;smart&quot; devices came out. Might be some kind of programming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of fluff written online which I don&#39;t put much stock in tbh. Afraid I don&#39;t have any written sources on file - my comment is based on experiences I&#39;ve had of walking dogs through woods that have had place memories of rape and occultic practices. There was also a season where I was experiencing a lot of spiritual attacks in a variety of ways and the dog would get stressed and anxious &quot;for no reason&quot; until we prayed for protection from unfriendly powers in the area. At which point he&#39;d settle down, and relax while still clearly in &#39;look out&#39; mode. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fired up a new thread wondering if any pet psychics can look into what&#39;s going on with your dog. I heard one on this late night Coast to Coast AM radio show years ago. She was pretty good with describing things from the animal&#39;s point of view and you can understand more what&#39;s going on. </p>

<p>I think your situation though, it&#39;s this conspiracy stuff with perhaps some type of subliminal mind control programming that emits from the TV these days. That&#39;s a whole other angle though with no proof. This pet psychic stuff may detect this conspiracy matter though, who knows. I think that&#39;s what&#39;s going on.
