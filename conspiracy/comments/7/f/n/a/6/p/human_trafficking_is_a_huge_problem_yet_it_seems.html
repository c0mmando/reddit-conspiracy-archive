    <div class="md"><p>I see from your other comment that you are a cop in Ohio.  Good.  I am glad that you are aware that something is not right.  </p>

<p>From what I have gathered, the US government funds its operation from criminal activities, such as drug and human trafficking.  I am still trying to figure this out, but I believe our Federal income tax goes to the international bankers and corporations.  I believe that our Federal income tax is not used to benefit the American people.  </p>

<p>I think this is why they are keeping troops in Afghanistan and elsewhere.  They need to control the flow of drugs so they can take that money.  </p>

<p>I agree with what you say in your comment.  Also, if certain people want to deal with the Saudis, you don&#39;t offer them money or gold or oil.  They already have plenty of that.  What the Saudis don&#39;t have are little blonde hair and blue eyed children.  A great source for such children are certain war zones, especially in the Slavic countries.  I totally understand Putin&#39;s attitude towards the West.  Putin understands what is going on.  I recommend listening to Putin&#39;s speeches.  He is no fool.  </p>

<p>Putin Discusses Satanic Pedophile Cults in Western Societies:  </p>

<p>It is important to realize that the people who rule the world are Luciferians/Satanists.  I am not talking about politicians.  Politicians are mere pawns.  I am talking about the people who come from families that have ruled the world for thousands of years.  </p>

<p>Let me know if you need sources.  </p>

<p>Also, I hope you are not a Freemason...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK.  It sounds like you are aware then.  </p>

<p>We really need people like you to side with the American people and to be loyal to the U.S. Constitution.  The New World Order globalists have gutted the American middle class because to make it easier for them to take over America.  I think they secretly envy North Korea.  They would love to implement the North Korean model over the entire planet so they can live as gods.  No joke.  That is really what we are dealing with.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think is costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy a human? I&#39;m pretty sure I could get a young one for like 20-30K and thats in the US and I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing. Could probably get that down to 2-3k in Mexico after some networking. </p>

<p>Answering your question nothing is done about it because it&#39;s an impossibly huge problem and general public would panic if they knew the scale of it. Some high level folks are also deeply involved, but they&#39;re just a small part of why we don&#39;t see real attempts at corrective action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Human trafficking&quot; is a catch-all scary term for what, most of the time, is regular prostitution. Prostitution should be LEGAL. How can it be illegal to sell something that you can give away for free? If prostitution was legal, it would take away the black market of pimps and rings. It would be safer and cleaner for both the women and johns. What needs to be handled is child trafficking. Legalize prostitution. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the same with drugs. It&#39;s been proven by other countries. Legalize drugs and drug addiction and overdose deaths goes down dramatically.  </p>

<p>I would never condone human trafficking, kidnapping, buying, and selling of children.  Anyway— </p>

<p>They are drunk on the chrism.  There&#39;s a process to the thing. </p>

<p>&quot;Any and all investigation of the &quot;Finders&quot; was immediately stopped, all evidence was supressed and denied, and the abused children were released back to the adult perpetrators who had been arrested &quot;in the act&quot; and the CIA resumed its ongoing covert operation of the &quot;Finders&quot; cult which is used to procure and produce. The story of the Finders cult is the story of the development of child/assets to be used to entrap politicians, diplomats; corporate and law enforcement officials; to sell child/victims to wealthy perverts to raise money for covert operations, to train some of the child/victims to be professional operatives and assassins of a totally cold, multiple personality, mind control nature.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well what should be done about it is volunteering, training, speaking out about it (in person too), and being assertive enough to start programs where there aren&#39;t any. OP might just be out of the loop and there might be many services locally. Solely posting to a forum is pretty passive way of getting anything done. If their job is missing this, they should request it and also, I hope, post their findings about their efforts.</p>

<p>Sorry to get kind of ranty. I just hate when people are all talk and no action. There are plenty of local opportunities to help people in need.</p>

<p>Best thing Trump has done? Maybe repealed the ban on gun ownership for mental health sufferers. If nothing else it lessens the fear of getting help, and the ACLU was against it, and I side with them often. </p>

<p>Maybe the strike on Syria when they, reportedly, used chemical weapons again. It was a soft target and got the message across. </p>

<p>Mostly it’s just incompetence across the board for Republicans though. Time is ticking, Dems are likely to flip the house in 2018 and no major legislation has been passed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because our whole USA economy is only alive right now because of it&#39;s illegal activities. All our manufacturing jobs are gone, we import near everything we need, sky high debt to pay for wars for no reason, etc etc. Our drug and human/organ trafficking is the only  thing keeping us alive besides our military strength. Plus the fact that invading a country that almost every citizen has a gun is very tough logistically and financially.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its because we just dont care enough. Now, hear me out: you, me, and probably everyone else in this thread cares about it. The vast majority of Americans probably care about it, including govt. officials. The problem is simple though. When we hear about issues like the sex slave trade, or starving children, or extreme impoverishment, we dont think of the western world. We think of the least developed countries, LDCs, like many countries in Africa that struggle with these problems. We do not often look at the US as having people suffering from the same issues. We don&#39;t want to accept that a lot of the same issues that african and other regional countries suffer from are issues that we have at home. Bringing these issues to the center of attention in a big way that could actually lead to solutions means accepting that these issues exist in the west in a big way too. And no one wants to think that children starving is an issue in Chicago. No one wants to accept that people in Mississippi are forced to live an extremely impoverished lifestyle. We dont want to believe that the children who are sometimes abducted from their parents are forced in to sexual trafficking in places like Ohio for god&#39;s sake. Once we can accept that the modern world suffers from some of the same extremely backwards problems that other places in the world suffer from, then we can become able to talk about these issues and proposal real solutions. Dont treat this issue as a conspiracy. Treat it as a reason for you to run for office whereever you live and make stopping human trafficking something you plan to focus on. It seems to me you have passion for stopping this, so get out there and run on a platform of stopping it, or if that&#39;s not up your alley, do something to let people know that this is a really issue in this country that we need to grapple with</p>
