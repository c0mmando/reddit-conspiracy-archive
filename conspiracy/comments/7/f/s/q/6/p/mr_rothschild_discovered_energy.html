        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Mr. Rothchild&#39;s Energy Discovery</p>

<p>What Mr. Rothschild had discovered was the basic principle of power, influence, and control over people as applied to economics. That principle is &quot;when you assume the appearance of power, people soon give it to you.&quot;
Mr. Rothschild had discovered that currency or deposit loan accounts had the required appearance of power that could be used to induce people (inductance, with people corresponding to a magnetic field) into surrendering their real wealth in exchange for a promise of greater wealth (instead of real compensation). They would put up real collateral in exchange for a loan of promissory notes. Mr. Rothschild found that he could issue more notes than he had backing for, so long as he had someone&#39;s stock of gold as a persuader to show his customers.</p>

<p>Mr. Rothschild loaned his promissory notes to individual and to governments. These would create overconfidence. Then he would make money scarce, tighten control of the system, and collect the collateral through the obligation of contracts. The cycle was then repeated. These pressures could be used to ignite a war. Then he would control the availability of currency to determine who would win the war. That government which agreed to give him control of its economic system got his support.</p>

<p>Collection of debts was guaranteed by economic aid to the enemy of the debtor. The profit derived from this economic methodology mad Mr. Rothschild all the more able to expand his wealth. He found that the public greed would allow currency to be printed by government order beyond the limits (inflation) of backing in precious metal or the production of goods and services.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I may, Mr. Rothschild is a perfect example of the harvest of a negatively polarized entity. It is quite a feat the Rothschild have accomplished, Individually and as a group of negatively polarized entities. For me personally, it&#39;s gratifying to see after the previous ascension being vastly over polarized in the positive. Those possessing the wisdom of the positive polarized harvestable entities understood very well. We do not proceed separate but together. Positive and Negative together. This is a question. Do you serve self, or do you serve others? Do you seek control, or do you wish to be controlled. This goes strait to the anderstanding of control systems used in today&#39;s ecosocietal situation. Tech to make your life easier. Giving up free will. Or retaining free will. </p>

<p>Anyhow. Throw a shot back for Mr.Rothschild. cheers buddy. It&#39;s been a hell of a haul and it&#39;s great to see.  Not so great inside the system tho. I think he vastly underestimated the level greed would take hold in society. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I know. This Logos is like no other. It&#39;s a logos where everything within it can be simulated. This is big thought to lay your mind to. As we creak toward becoming a class 1 civilization we will have creative powers available that other octaves in creation do not have access to in this way. This means all the space races and junk. If they are not walking around right now experiencing this experiment in manyness they are just voices in your head. It&#39;s nice to have a bit of potential exopolitics rolling around intellectually. Just in case. </p>

<p>Our system. Right now. You&#39;d better be legitimately creating something better everywhere or shut it.  It just doesn&#39;t ever seem to actually get better.  The problem is doing something requires sacrifice skill, knowledge, passion and work. It&#39;s not easy. It&#39;s worth it. </p>

<p>Now he&#39;s gone. How do we untangle his societal influences? I have no answer to that. </p>

<p>Or he&#39;s old money and I hope his greedy kids squander it all. Or they do something decent with it. </p>

<p>In the end. Serve the Creator. It&#39;s a better methodology. Skip all that light dark evil good crap and Create. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was the Montagu family that created the Bank of England. Their cousins the Barons Norman established the Bank for International Settlements. The Montagu family&#39;s bank Samuel Montagu &amp; Co. went into contract with HSBC as Montagu Private Equity. The Rothschild family are overhyped and are knighted by the British Crown. Also the French Rothschild family intermarried with the Aldobrandini family of Rome. The Rothschild&#39;s are vaguely mentioned as the &quot;guardians of the papal treasure&quot; in the Jewish Encyclopedia. The Black Nobility and Este, Orange-Nassau, Stuart, and Hanover families have massive wealth concealed in private banking.</p>
