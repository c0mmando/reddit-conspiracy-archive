Some will even take a liking to you and let them pet you. They&#39;ll come up to you to get their rub on.</p>

<p>Now, Turkeys are much less intelligent than Humans on Darwins Scale. This got me thinking:</p>

<p>What if there is a massive planet somewhere with 75-100 foot aliens who are 100 times more intelligent than us, and they have human farms for the sole purpose of using us for their annual Thank Aliens Day.</p>

<p>Humans are then cooked and eaten</p>

<p>Useful Idiot.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing. A Scientist in Academia could be a super genius about a topic, by could be virtually retarded when it comes to socializing or when it comes to artistic ability, or predictive analysis, i.e. entertaining a bunch of speculative what if possibilities.</p>

<p>I learned early when I was young. I was in a high school post punk band, was the drummer. We all hated the tyrant like principal and told the singer to write a song about him being Hitler and that school was prison we need to break out of.</p>

<p>We performed it at the talent show knowing he was there. We fucked up, we did not foresee the consequences. He came down on us hard and fucked with us badly for the rest of our years there. </p>

<p>You can be a genius and lack foresight </p>

<p>its not make believe. The banks exist because of everyone agreeing to bail them out with tax dollars, give them power over you, and to siphon off interest.</p>

<p>If you buy a house for $100k on a 30 year loan, you end up paying 3 times or more (depending on rates) the amount of that house, all enriching the select few.</p>

<p>College in the U.S. is also built this way. Many other systems as well</p>

<p>A tree is real</p>

<p>That&#39;s what your mind is superimposing over it. A tree isn&#39;t thinking that it is whatever you are calling it, or that it is real or not real.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>money is fantasy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The paper money is coming from the tree. However, sure its a fantasy everyone is agreeing to believe in, just like tree</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the belief is broken, the monetary system crumbles.</p>

<p>Your mind is also creating the belief that you are that mind and that body, and that once the body dies that you no longer will exist</p>

<p>I do, because I remember from before I entered into a fetus/body.</p>

<p>That&#39;s your projection. I dont think anything of myself because pure awareness is merely aware, prior to thoughts. So I Am, before thinking. </p>

<p>Scientists are say we may be in a Simulation. So that would be mean, something is running the Sim. If that Something/Someone is Nefarious, then we are most definitely having something harvested from us, maybe its emotional energy, maybe its metaphysical units, maybe its something else we are currently unaware of.</p>

<p>This is why I like studying the Gnostics, Buddhists, Hindus, Mystics, Seers, OBE&#39;s/NDE&#39;s. Some of them are saying there is a false God over this planet who is the sim controler</p>
