        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I get it-- black and white is easier. Complexity is hard. It&#39;s far simpler to conceptually process difficult things as black/white, either/or, good/evil. It makes sense that this perspective would be embraced and promoted by base propagandists with predetermined agendas who need not adhere to facts or reality-- it makes sense that surface-level non-thinkers would be so compelled by binary worldviews. </p>

<p>In my research and armchair observations of the conspiracy &quot;community,&quot; I have found binary determination processes to be a persistent infestation. But as alleged truth seekers and veil-destroyers, we are the last subculture that should be swayed by such things. It seems that not only has this happened to some degree, but it&#39;s become the MO of many prominent conspiracy ideologues like Alex Jones-- he and his cronies have morphed into Breitbart X, where everything is based on emotion, fear, and base simplicity, nearly always politicized in obvious ways. </p>

<p>While President Trump also weaponizes this perspective any time anything vaguely conspiratorial is breached, neoliberal media has also embraced this in their coverage of Trump and his scandals (largely as cover for not having to examine their own failings and bullshit, covert embrace of the oligarchy while preaching egalitarianism, etc). They&#39;ve seen that such an approach works wonders in rallying support for their causes, fueled on oppositional rage and more non-thinking emotion. </p>

<p>I believe that when complexity is eschewed in favor of easy simplicity, doom follows. You no longer have informed debate because debate is challenging, instead you have screaming matches and team sports. Nuance becomes outlawed-- you pick a topic, line up your preset theories, and go to war. </p>

<p>But war produces nothing but more war. You lose all human overlap and shared experience. We should know this better than anybody else. And who benefits from binary, emotion-based thinking-- elites, the absurdly wealthy, ideologues, the controllers, the real conspirators.</p>

<p>If you read my whole rant, I appreciate it. I find it relevant, you may find it bullshitty and/or it&#39;s own type of propaganda-- fair enough.        </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Slippery slope both in how much your conspiracy-everywhere thinking can lead you into becoming radicalized in some way, and in the notion that those who believe in conspiracies or believe they are done are about to join ISIS or some nutzo militia. </p>

<p>I read some of the ISIS magazines recently. They couch everything under fundamentalist, theocratic nonsense, posing this as the cure to very real critiques of US imperialism (shitty wars, murdered innocents, destabilization, you get the gist). And they have a ton of fuel based on how major US media (aligned with both parties) demonized all Muslims after 9/11, through Iraq, and to this day really. Yet none of that can ever justify the actions such radicals take and promote.</p>

<p>All strains of Neo-Nazis are radicalized in a similar, it&#39;s all a conspiracy against us kind of way.   </p>

<p>It&#39;s like...you can believe and know that predatory forces are manipulating the proletariat in order to serve their own ends in various ways, but one must oppose this short of joining groups who propose murderous and hateful solutions. I think that if one ends up viewing <em>everything</em> as a conspiracy against them or those they identify with, they&#39;re basically a functioning schizophrenic (I have personal experience with a suicide-victim friend of mine). It can truly be a slippery slope. </p>
