<p>The whole issue here is that he was circumventing federal safety standards. The fact that he was a microbiologist, that many of the participants were staying at hotels, that Peter Thiel invested in the company the guy started after the guy died of cancer this year, none of that really matters. </p>

<p>Do you think North Korea reports accurately about the day-to-day in South Korea?</p>

<p>Your view is very naive. For someone who likely believes that American intelligence agencies have power over CNN and the likes, a la Mockingbird, do you really think that foreign agencies are not going to be under the thumb of their own intelligence services, such as the agency that would come to replace the KGB a mere 30 years ago?</p>
