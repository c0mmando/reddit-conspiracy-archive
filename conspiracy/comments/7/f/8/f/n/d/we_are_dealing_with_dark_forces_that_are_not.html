       The abusers that are in great positions of power are simply not human and are put here to help create negative emotions, the most negative feelings you could ever imagine, hopelessness, unloved, worthless.
      </p>
      <p>
       They spread these feelings throughout the world through rituals, that are very real and worship and feed a negative power that currently is trying to control the entire planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       These beings are interdimensional and can manifest here on Earth and enter humans to carry out their agenda, creating negative emotions and turning people away from the true nature of humans. Humans aren't evil and they aren't abusers by nature, these people are possessed by the forces of darkness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a high ranking witch admitting to you that the forces of darkness are at work with him.

       Something evil is controlling the planet and causing wars and death and overall negative feelings.
      </p>
      <p>
       When good men do nothing, evil wins. We need to build an army and oust the people in power that are worshipping dark forces. The dark forces that control us have no authority, we are human and have free will, that free will is what they are trying to influence.

       So I'm going go write this even though it may not be well-received.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my abusive relationship with my ex, I feel I witnessed demons of many levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) He drank heavily. One summer he decided to quit drinking. We, together, poured mountains of alcohol into the drain. As we poured the last bottle, we both literally heard hard footsteps walking away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody was home.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) That sobriety did not last very long. One night we were partying with friends. I did not drunk much (maybe a beer or two). I fell asleep, and I woke up randomly. Nobody has to believe this part.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw three dark beings looking over me. At first I thought it was my ex and his friends, but I looked on the floor and they were all passed out drunk. Suddenly the beings realized I saw them and started whispering frantically, as if they couldn't understand how I was seeing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They disappeared, and at the time, I thought maybe I was dreaming. Now I'm not so sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) In his rages, he would strangle and beat me. In this state, nothing. Nothing could connect with him on a human level. No matter how much I cried and begged for him to stop, he would not. To me, it was as if possessed by demons.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even if NOT, he had no element of humanity at these pojnts. He was not human (at least in those moments)
      </p>
      <p>
       I have many more stories, and I have since escaped the relationship. I talk about this abuse a lot as it is my way with trying to cope and understand it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When he was beating me to near death, though, there is really no way to understand or justify it. Again, I would say he had his very own set of demons.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know how they call some alcohol spirits? I think that it is possible demons attach themselves to certain things.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) His eues. I have not seen him in a long time, but his eyes are empty. The bible does say eyes are the window to the soul, and maybe it is possible to lose your soul to demons or another force. His eyes are dark and empty now, and they aren't always that way.

       Even though it means little, I'm very sorry you had to go through that. Looking for silver linings, I hope it has helped you grow into the strong and very intelligent person you very clearly seem to be. Maybe the three dark beings were in control of them? Maybe in our dazed state that alcohol causes and the strong emotions alcohol can bring, it makes it easier for demons to take over our physical selves. Maybe the satanic 'rituals' are to cause such negative emotions that the victim is much more easily susceptible to invite a dark force into them. These people are not human and I'm glad that your in a better place now away from your demons, you can say you fought with demons and won I suppose, a demon can't take over a good soul :). I believe the eyes are our gateways to seeing peoples emotions and intentions, when someone has that 'blank' look I believe it isn't them and they are capable of the most atrocious actions imaginable.

       Thanks it does mean something.
      </p>
      <p>
       In sharing that story, it is likely I will face ridicule as many do not want to even think there is something beyond our physical selves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, interestingly, I had an experience with three beings of light, too. This was a completely different experience and I'm willing to share it if anybody wants!
      </p>
      <p>
       I also find it interesting that many "Christians" I know do not believe in demons.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, many of these people seem to disregard any of the "negative" stuff posted in the bible like end world prophecies and such.
      </p>
      <p>
       I subscribe to a lot of conspiracy forums and the consensus seems to be "let's not talk about that!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I go to church and while I love my church, I rarely hear about evil or demons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is important these topics are discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of the reason I think people have difficulty waking up is they may not have seen or experienced true evil. They may not even begin to comprehend it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean it really is incomprehensible. How he can live with himself is beyond me, but then again, he's a meth head now from the last I have heard about him.

       Yes, please do share. I had an experience as did my Mother. I was 12, laying in bed one night and I had this sudden warm feeling come over me, I felt safe and not scared of anything. I then proceeded to invite what I thought could be a 'ghost' to interact with me. A brilliant white light then manifested in the centre of the room, filling the room and sending shivers down my spine and making my hairs stand on edge, I now realise this was an energy, a good energy that manifested to oust whatever I invited in that day. Turns out the house I was living in at the time was built on an old graveyard but I found all these answers after many years being oblivious and wondering what that light was, I've never seen anything like it before. My Mothers experience was when she was walking home from a night out with her sister and they had an argument and went their seperate ways, My Mother decided to carry on through a dark lane in the middle of the night while her sister took a turn back onto the streets. It was then my Mother saw a white figure standing infront of her and she turned around and followed her sister and not proceeded up the dark lane. I think the church don't speak of these beings because it is controlled to make us ignore the dark forces, we can't fight and resist what we don't know exists.

       I believe this is because, just like every other facet of society, major denominations and churches are controlled behind the scenes by those who have become powerful through these entities. Project Mockingbird exists in the church. No one should be surprised. A red pilled Follower of Christ is a serious threat to them.

       Well said.

      <p>
       People often jump on me about religion when I mention I'm a Christian.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really wouldn't even consider myself religious as I trust very few institutions. Even though I like my church for the fellowship, I am careful to believe everything they tell me.

       about to say something. Dont take this the wrong way:
      </p>
      <p>
       there's a whole theory, that women are attracted to alpha jerks who are unstable troglodytes, all on a subconscious level as well, and this includes getting beaten and manhandled, some psychologists say it's to make up for any sort of harder discipline or spanking from the biological father.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I was never an alpha, more a lone wolf IDGAF type who played alpha if necessary, however I did date this girl who wanted me to hit her, choke her, had rape fantasies and so on. I tried often to figure out where this was all coming from, considering she cam from an educated liberal background with a highly respected Father who was a Big AG Professor

       Yeah I agree. My username, by the way, is an ode to wake the F up about everything. I dont really do the whole redpill with women schtick. I'm more do my own thing, go my own way, and if something happens with someone then cool, and if not then cool, I still keep doing me and focusing on goals/hobbies/interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I have a mother and sister and respect them both. Honestly, I think porn and western culture via movies, ragtags, shows, sexualization via media culture as programmed an objectivation of women

       IMHO the whole 'essence' of any formalized groups is the development of "power", whether it be the 'power of the group' Or to get the 'group' to 'empower' their leaders in a variety of ways

       "red  pilled" comes from the film The Matrix, where Morpheus offers Neo a choice of two pills, a blue one, which if he takes it, he will go to sleep and wake up tomorrow as if nothing has happened and he will be able to go back to how he was living
      </p>
      <p>
       OR
      </p>
      <p>
       he could take the Red pill and "things will never be the same again"!
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, 'red pill' is/has been used as a reference to a certain group of men and their ideology However
       <em>
        these days
       </em>
       it's becoming a much more generalized way to refer to someone who is no longer 'fooled' by the Bullshit that surrounds us and the businesses which bombard us with Bullshit ... to
       <em>
        see through
       </em>
       their 'bullshit', to 'see it' for what it
       <em>
        truly is

       , is someone who is 'red pilled'

       I read a comment a little while ago along the lines of "When Jesus was here on Earth, He talked more about Hell than Heaven." That's stuck with me ever since and I can't help but remember it when I hear Christians unwilling to discuss anything other than the positives in the Bible. I do love all of the positivity and hope within, there's nothing else like it out there, but to ignore and selectively believe in the things the Bible warns about could turn out to be pretty foolish imo.

       Yes I was really disappointed because I wrote a post about how Jesus would have definitely been a conspiracy theorist, and they removed it from true Christian with no explanation as to why.

       It just made me realize that even Christians themselves are in denial of the evils of this world.

       I've had demons take over on substances for sure.  Psychedelics also work very differently with true believers than it does with the lost (experience with 40+ chemicals).  I had one even give me his name and followed me back from a trip to Peru through a ritual knife I bought that was dedicated to a demon (I didn't know at the time, but I woke up cutting myself with the knife and it wasn't me controlling my arm, and it was very clear on who it was and what it was doing).

       I've seen demon "possession" first-hand. One of the telltale signs is the eyes. They look black, hard, beady, almost inhuman. This is definitely a change from their normal eyes.

       I too have seen what I believe was demon possession. I was with this girl in a room with 1-2 other people when she started acting really weird and saying her name was some weird jibberish. I could smell sulphur her voice sounded off and her eyes looked hollow. After a short time she just kinda snapped out of it the smell went away and she acted like it never happened. This girl was big into terot cards and familiar spirits. One of the other people with me when it happened was her sister who straight up wouldn't acknowledge at all what just happened. The other person just shrugged it off like she was just being silly but also seemed kind of freaked out by the whole thing.

       Don't ever, ever give into this form of gang stalking, it is intentional, it is designed, it originates from weak minds.  It will never stop; you're doing things right.  Know you have considerable support, much of it silent.

       TMoR shows up just in time to show us there are varying levels of negative and evil spirits in the world.

      <p>
       Some as intense as what you noted, some as low-level juvenile as TMoR.

       Hey look girlfriend. Bible says at the name of Jesus, EVERY knee shall bow. Every. Knee. The truth will be known eventually. God is real. Spirits, both good and evil, are real. Scoffers will be silenced on that day!

       What's kind of cool is a few years ago anything about Jesus or spiritual in general would be downvoted like crazy. I think people are waking up as the world sincerely seems to be more evil daily. Or the exposure of the evil is more apparent.

       I've seen and heard enough to 100% believe you. The TMOR guys are just self assured losers with nothing better to do with their time. Ever meet one of those slovenly unattractive people who think they know everything and scoff at people to make themselves feel better? That's who they are. Forget about them.

       Not trying to downplay your story, but sleep paralysis is an interesting thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know how we have dreams we don’t remember? We also have nightmares we don’t remember.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes it’s possible to become semi-conscious and open your eyes, with part of your brain still having the nightmare, and not be able to move/only have minor motor control.
      </p>
      <p>
       This can result in the contents of the nightmare/dream being superimposed over/inside your field of vision. Like unlocking a computer and the screen saver continues to play only on parts of the screen.

       Since my pastor went to school for this stuff, he really knows the bible inside and out.

       the eyes being "a window to the soul" would suggest that something meaningful about the soul is able to be inferred just from the eyes. The eyes being "the lamp of the body" I would say speaks more to this, that the inner qualities of a person are more perceptible, that is, visible, depending on the quality of his eyes, which function as a lamp that reveals them. Not sure if this is helpful or not, but maybe having a sense of these two distinct ideas when looking over the verses and the context will have some value to you. Cheers

       I've had demons like your ex's and still do, I keep finding better ways to lock them up. They come back in my worst moments and are pretty much the reason I'm quarantined from the dating pool, and I accept it. It's literally for everyone else's own good I die alone than hurt someone the way I've hurt my mother and everyone else. I've literally treated everyone like my enemies at least once, including my own loved ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still have to take responsibility. Every time I look at myself in the mirror, dark and empty describes what I see in myself perfectly. God doesn't seem to want to answer all the prayers I made, fucking begging him to close that void, but he doesn't want to so I may as well do it myself. God only helps those who help others... so if I'm helping myself, why would I need God?

       Well then what the FUCK is true belief in God anyways? Am I supposed to spin in circles tapping my head? Because that's what it all sounds like to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had so many Christians tell me "oh the reason you're suffering is because you don't believe enough!"
      </p>
      <p>
       And you know what? My belief will never be adequate to your standards because you'll just keep moving the goalposts. "Oh you're not believing how you're supposed to believe anymore, you need to act THIS vague ass way now. You need to follow this shitty koan literally. You need to go stone those guys over there kissing, because they're kissing."
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me what the fuck true belief is supposed to be then.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry but I still believe, but when "true belief" gets brought up, it's always a No True Scotsman. "If they just
       <em>
        believed properly
       </em>
       none of it ever would have happened to them!"

       Whow dude, never said He wasn’t helping you because “you didn’t believe in Him enough.”
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m just saying I️ felt disconnected when I️ didn’t truly believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I️ absolutely believe that the challenges we get are actually blessings, because overcoming that challenge gives us the strength or skills required for us to either rise to our best, or prepares us enough that we don’t get just flat out crushed when he hit the next hurdle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve always thought we’re never given anything we can’t handle, so the more difficult the challenge I’m actually flattered that God/Universe/whatever you want to call It thinks I’m strong enough to handle a situation even when I️ doubt myself pretty severely while in the middle of it.
      </p>

       Also you may be conflating spirituality/belief in God with religion. They are definitely not the same thing. Not even close; all Catholics are Christians but not all Christians are Catholics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion requires spirituality, spirituality does not require religion in any shape or form.

       I apologize for my outburst. I agree, spirituality should be seperated from religion. I don't like religion, the relationship seems best. I pray that this is a God I'm praying to outside the hologram rather than using it. The cosmic egg and all that.

       It’s all good brother in life! I definitely know it’s a sensitive subject with a lot of self righteous people with a whole lot of judgement so I get the defensiveness, thank you for recognizing it and keeping your heart/mind open! I’m virtually the only one in my family that has any sort of active Faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       One way I’m able to tell if it’s an entity in “the hologram” is that I will explore the emotion that comes with what I perceive to be contact. If it’s not 100% Pure Love (even if it’s only a speck of light in the darkness, that speck should be 100%) then it’s a demon pretending to be God/All-Spirit/etc. I hate saying this but you’ll likely realize this when you feel it, it happens to me as almost a vision or deep perception into an infinitely complex plan and my essential part in it (we all have an essential part to play). Seeing a glimpse of that grand design is probably the most significant part for me, I have a tendency to overthink from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’d also keep my eye out for synchronicity. If it’s not happening regularly I’ve always taken that as a sign that I’m not quite on the right path!
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve also started watching Joel Osteen every couple days (lot of bad media out there but I find his 30min sermon that is broadcast to help me focus on God for an uninterrupted half hour), I find it gives me a chance to reflect on recent events in my life and approach them from an open heart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Excuse the staccato thoughts, I’m writing this mostly stream of consciousness so I’m just writing what comes to me!

       Stopped reading at Joel Osteen. I have no respect for him and his prosperity gospel and his hypocrisy. He's a fucking wolf in sheep's clothing and he'd fit better through a needle than enter the Kingdom of Heaven, if it even exists in the first place, which it's rpobably a metaphor for living life that got twisted into afterlife stuff.

       Now do you see why I get so defensive about this shit? I see subversion everywhere in religion, especially Christianity.

       I don’t subscribe to any religion, just my connection to God. I do zealously believe in him though. I don’t zealously look to convert people, just share my experience if it feels natural.

       You sound like you have a lot of internal hate which you might be directing outwards so as to not feel it so deeply and so personally.

       Yeah man that’s the struggle, you can disagree with something and argue against it without it bringing up such negative hot anger. You’re he only person who loses when you get “lit” talking or reading about him. Guarantee it doesn’t affect Joel that much.

       Yes, I have anger problems and I've prayed to God and I feel better for now and all that shit, rinse and repeat.

       I think I'm praying to the right God, not Joel Osteen's God. He could have opened up the Houston Astrodome for disaster refugees and helped out with disaster crews, but now. Reserved it for himself and church members. "It's up to God to save everyone else now."

       So much for being a good samaritan then.

       I think there's more humble Christians to look to than Joel Osteen. I'm sorry, but he's living in a mansion off his church tithes.

       Ah if it’s a struggle what lesson would we learn if God just “fixed” it for us? No thanks, that’d be too easy. I try to enjoy the struggle/challenge now because I know there’s no getting away from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s like you’re standing at the base of some stairs and at the top is you solving your anger issues. So every time you run into this issue and try to solve it you walk up the first two steps and start to feel better (and the rest of those steps could be pretty hard to climb) so you step off and go about your life. It’s not that climbing the stairs doesn’t work, it’s that you feel better after a couple of steps and don’t want to finish climbing them because you’ve already started to feel better. You feeling better after praying IS God helping you up the first few steps.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you feel better “for now” do you spend time after deep diving into “why?” Even when I think I’ve dived as deep as I can, I keep asking “why’s that?” until I get what I call, a perspective shift on the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Why did I shout at him?” He made me angry (did he? Or did I choose to be angry as a response? Did I have to respond with anger? Was there a better response that would have achieved what I wanted?)
“Why was I angry?” Well he did X to me.
“Why did he do X to me?” Because he thought I did Y to him.
“Why’d he think that?” Well because I did Y but was justified in doing so.”
“Why did I feel justified doing that?”
“Why did I do Y to him?” Etc. Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually then I’m thrown in a situation where I’m challenged on that specific issue and if I show, based on how I handle it, that I have really learned and incorporated the lesson it really doesn’t show up as a significant problem in my life after that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would read both sides of the issue just in case you only heard from the court of public condemnation, I don’t know the absolute final details and story, nor do I know someone’s intentions when they make decisions. Even if he is at fault, God hates the sin not the sinner. I’m not gonna post a bunch of info to argue it because that’s better done on your own if you want, if not then that’s perfectly ok.
I originally heard about him from my Ghanian friend, and checked the show out. It’s a nice background when I’m cooking dinner or to just set aside a few minutes to hear someone talk about one of my favorite subjects from a different perspective.
I can walk into a store and not buy everything the person is selling, I can take or further examine the things that draw my attention; it’s the same with watching, it helps me think about God and my life and I incorporate the pieces I find have value while discarding the rind.

       Would be great if God gave me challenges I can tackle instead of giving me mental disorders that make it impossible to even begin something. So then I'm stuck getting all emotional and then attracting people like you who would love nothing more than to shove your corrupt religion down my throat.

       This is why it's so much better to clam up, because there's so many evangelical zealots like you going around playing head games with sick people like me. Fuck you.

       Once again, I apologize. I'm paranoid and I do this same thing with my best friend because I've lost a lot of faith. Maybe not as intense as with strangers so as to drive them away out of my anxiety, but she's one of the strongest people I've ever known as she goes through her sex change, male to female, as well as her experiences as an LGBT Christian.

       She's a Christian and my best friend, so because you didn't snap back at me and start doing the same angry shit I do, you can PM me if you still wish to talk. I won't snap at you again.

       For what it’s worth, I believe you. I experienced  similar circumstances with my ex, although admittedly much less severe. The relationship was wrong from the very start (she walked out on her husband who was, according to her, abusive toward her). It started out as a friendship, despite the fact that many of my peers saw it as me taking advantage of a situation for my own gain (which I suppose was partially true), however I
       <em>
        absolutely
       </em>
       cared about her and believed her to be a helpless victim in the situation. The first surprise for me came when I learned that she was a heavy drinker. I’m talking two or three full glasses of wine every night, no exception. She had to have it. This went on for about a month until I got my first of many experiences with what I believe to have been some kind of demonic possession.
      </p>
      <p>
       One night we were watching a documentary, and I remember finding it very interesting. She was ready for bed but I decided to stay on the couch and continue watching, which was not typical (we would always go to bed together). Some time after that I had fallen asleep and woke up a few hours later. When I went into the bedroom I discovered she had taken up most of the bed. As I gently tried to roll her over to make room for myself, she emitted in a deep, aggressive, raspy voice “DON’T TOUCH ME OR ILL SLIT YOUR F%#&amp;ING THROAT”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that prior to this, she hadn’t been anything but gentle, soft, and always conducted herself in a positive, loving matter. Her morality was a bit questionable(the way she dealt with the situation with her husband and some of the things she said from time to time). But I and everyone else that knew her considered her to be a great person. Although I was scared shitless after this first incident (didn’t get a lick of sleep that night), I brushed the incident off as being a result of her intoxication/the fact that she was asleep and didn’t think much of it. That was until it happened again a few weeks later, and then again and again. Sometimes I would wake up to her screaming and weeping, “no! no! Leave me alone please!”. The amazing thing was
       <em>
        every single time
       </em>
       I brought this up to her the next morning, in an effort to get her to seek help, she had absolutely no recollection of what had transpired. She actually found it humorous and most of the time believed that I was making it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short, we eventually broke it off, due to a variety of reasons. She ended up getting back together with her ex husband and now has a child with him, and as selfish as this makes me sound, I couldn’t have been happier than I was when she broke the news to me because it meant that I wouldn’t have to deal with it any more, but it also meant that I wasn’t just leaving her by herself to deal with her issues (which was basically what had kept me around for as long as I had).
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason your situation reminded me so much of mine was your comment about the eyes. Sometimes she would stare into the distance, wide eyed, and nothing could snap her out of it until she was “ready” to. That feeling you describe-emptiness, coldness, it was all there. Very scary stuff. The entire experience was an emotional roller coaster and enough to deter me from seeking out any more romantic relationships.

       I wonder if alcohol, in a way, gives these demons permission to take over a person's body, especially when really really drunk and blacked out.

       There is definitely something to this- I’ve always found alcohol consumption to be very paradoxical- everyone knows it’s bad for them.  Nothing good really comes from consuming it, yet it is so widely accepted and championed by mainstream culture. I mean you can literally throw any negative statistic or fact in the world out there, and the best most rational reply you’re ever going to hear is “well they TRIED to make it illegal and it didn’t work, therefore...”

       It does. That's one reason I don't drink. Well, I don't mind a glass of wine here and there, but I do NOT like the feeling of not being in control of myself, so I drink rarely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine someone who loses control a lot. It's easy for those entities to gain entry.

      <p>
       Also, surgery under anesthesia is also a vulnerable time. And you can pick up these non-physical parasites from other people.

      <p>
       Another reason not to have casual sex.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to be careful who you spend time with. You'll draw them in, too. I think it's a mirror neuron thing.

       You are correct, as a man/women Imbibes they basically become puppets for spirits to 'drive around' and cause ruckus.  Blacking out is when you are quite literally a remote control body for spirits to play with.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next aspect is related to who you associate with.  Your drunkard friends all have parasites attached to them, and if they happen to find an easier target they will attach.  Bars, clubs, strip clubs are where these spirits hang out looking for their next host.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, it not any different than kids playing a game like Grand Theft Auto where the first thing they do is assault someone.  It's all about how much chaos you can cause laughing at someone else's expense.

       I've woken up to demons (shadow people) before and fully believe you. I was living with my dad who was a bad alcohoc. I think that when the person that the demons are interested in sleeps they move about attempting to cause fear and misery so that they may feed on the negative emotion. Some people will say that they are a symptom of sleep paralysis, but I wasn't paralysed. I believe the demons cause the paralysis. I was blessed and given words to cause them to flee, "In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to leave this place now." With those words they left my room and I've not seen one since.

       Nope, you're definitely not alone, and I, for one, don't think you're mentally ill. I have heard nothing good coming from TMOR as of late. I hope to read more from you. I respect you for having the courage to speak out.

       Many witchdoctors will get drunk or high on marijuana during their rituals to call the spirits into them. As far as hearing footsteps that are not there, that is classic demon activity. Protect yourself and rely on God.

       I'd be inclined to agree with you, for the most part. I do think there's the possibility of extra dimensional shit we can't sense, though. I mean... With a comment like that, I'd hafta assume you've dabbled in psychedelics at some point

       My girlfriend now comes from a previously abusive relationship very similar to what you are saying and the way she has told me about the stuff she lived through and the words she uses are exactly the same as you. She has told me that her ex would literally tell her that he was a demon during the moments when he was beating her, the only reason he didnt kill her is because she fought back with all her might and was able to leave. She has said the same thing about the way his eyes looked just blank and empty, she swears that in more than one occasion she had fully black eyes just like a real demon would. I 100% agree with you about the evil forces in this world. I hope you find peace and love in your life &lt;3

       Sorry you went through that. I'm sure you're a stronger person because of it!

       Your story reminds me of this one particular time I almost died. At the peak of the incident, I could hear these strange voices speaking in a foreign tongue, who seemed to be contemplating what to do with me. They sounded aboriginal or something. It was very odd!

       Have you ever had something similar?

       Very sorry to hear about the abuse. You’re very strong for making it through that, as for you seeing three figures when you woke up one reasonable explanation for this could be sleep paralysis. Not saying I don’t believe you, that just sounds fucking terrifying.

       I can't believe people are eating this shit up. Tales of demonic possession and witchcraft in the past have all been likely due to sleep paralysis, but you try telling that to some of the loons in this sub.

       I mean, I sort of believe in the paranormal. Or that there's things occupying the same space as us that we can't sense. But, y'know, Occam's razor. Sleep paralysis is the more logical explanation.

       Was your ex circumcised? Men who are circumcised are capable of the most insane fits of rage especially when they are drunk. Why do European men get jolly when they drink while Americans tend to brawl and fight when they are drunk? This has been observed countless times when our soldiers and tourists are overseas. The European men can get drunk and it does not cause a problem but when Americans get drunk we get violent. Drunk men beating their wives is a uniquely American problem. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the circumcision. Circumcision is trauma based mind control. It is no coincidence that when circumcision rates started rising in the late 1800s it mirrored in the temperance movement for the prohibition of Alcohol. The temperance movement was largely lead by woman who were getting beat by their drunk husbands. This was never a problem before but when circumcision became fashionable in America our men started beating their wives. It is insane how this happened and how people blamed the bottle instead of the knife.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a reason Jews and Muslims aren't allowed to drink alcohol. It is affects them differently because they are circumcised and makes them lose their minds. Americans are the only people in the world who are both circumcised and drink alcohol. America was also the only Christian nation to ever take it upon itself to complete ban alcohol because something went horribly wrong with our culture in the late 1800s early 1900s. I will say it again. Drunk men beating their wives is a uniquely American problem. Other cultures have abusers too but they beat their wives when they are sober. There is a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circumcision is the perfect crime. It is done to people at a time in their lives when they cannot remember it happening. However, the trauma never goes away. It merely gets buried in their subconsciousness. Alcohol brings the trauma to the surface where it is expressed as an incredible rage. To understand where this rage is coming from one has to understand that circumcision is torture. Circumcision is surgery without anesthesia. It is as painful as having your fingernails ripped out and is akin to be skinned alive. Babies have screamed so hard their lungs collapsed and have had heart attacks and ruptured organs. Around 200 babies die every year from circumcision. Those that survive the ordeal are scared for life and will never be normal emotionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can we expect men not to lash out at the world when as their first experience in life is to be tortured just hours or days after being born. The extreme pain coming from having the most sensitive part of their body crushed in a clamp and then cut off without anesthesia rewires the brain. Go look up a few videos of babies being circumcised on YouTube. It will be a real eye opener from so people.

       I normally would never post something so personal, but this really resonated with me. The night before my dad took his life (a previous alcoholic who I had seen take many 'demonic' forms as you kinda described) he came into my computer room and stared at me. "Holly, go to bed." But not in a strict dad tone, but in a demanding, empty and dark tone. I said in a minute etc and he kept saying the same thing. When i took my headset off and looked at him, holy god. It was the scariest thing ever. My heart dropped and his entire figure was just completely dark, like he was a shadow or something. His aura was really scary, like his presence sent chills. His face was the scariest part. I couldn't really see it but it was just so intense and almost demonic. I went to my mom's room and told her that I thought he had been drinking again. He hadn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also note that two months before he did it and first quit drinking, he told my mom and I: "you don't know the demons I have." In the most serious voice I had ever heard him use. And he was a very successful and prideful business man, not some nut.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't necessarily believe in 'lizard' people, but I do believe there is some major darkness somewhere in our world.

       I appreciate your comment. 10000000%, evil and demons are real. I also have had things happen that made me think demons tie themselves to alcohol and other addictions. I’m glad you are no longer in that situation.

       I really admire your honesty -- What is it to exist without empathy for your fellow man?  That's not living; it's just surviving.  I've always believed the the 5% population without conscience is responsible for 90% of global misery.

       He did different jobs. He worked in construction mostly, and then lost the ability to do that due to drunk driving.

       He lost his mind slowly after that.

       Sounds about right.  My ex-girlfriend is a narcissist and couldn't keep a job either (drinking/drugs).  The years we were together was the most stressful time of my life.

       It's always interesting to see what professions that kind of people are in.  Seems they usually can't hold a job.

       I have a somewhat similar story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I accidentaly got blackout drunk before a highschool semi-formal and all was well as I was being a complete idiot at the dance. I then got caught for being drunk and when I did I did not react well. I told everyone to fuck right off and no one could control me. Not even the cops that are always at the dances. The staff then called my mom and I did the same thing to her and even she couldn't calm me down. She said my eyes did not look right, like they weren't human. Then called my older brother to come help and he eventually got me into his truck and he saw my eyes and knew I didn't look right when looking into them. He said I just didnt look human. He told me the score of the Leaf's game and for a brief second he said I looked right, and I said "Really?" And seemed happy as they were winning and it was a playoff game. Eventually they got me home and I ended up running outside my house to go back to the dance and the cops who followed us home put me into their car and took me to the tank. They put me into own drunk tank as I was acting too crazy. Which was understandable. The first thing i
i remember after I began sobering up is screaming at the cop telling how fucked the system and the world is, right from my cell. My mom picked me up in the morning and she wasn't mad. She was legitamitely concerned for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point i'm getting to here is that very recently before this I began to be 'woke' due to my brother explaining the reasons of the terrors of the world. It seemed I was not human during this blackout state that I do not remember at all. It has really made me scared of losing control while drinking since I had been blackout drunk before that but had never acted in that way when someone told me something I need to do when I didn't want to do it. I also had my onset of depression a few months before this too which makes me even more concerned and curious on what the true causes of the outburst I had. I know I was excited for the dance as it was my last one but I would have never expected myself to act like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most concerning part of this story is that both my brother and my mom told me my eyes did not look human or right at all.

       I looked demonic. Scary shit.

       I'd like them to watch the 'witch' video I linked to in the post and tell me he isn't being serious when he says that dark forces are at work with him. His track record speaks for itself. I also always wonder why 'Prince' Charles sent him a box of cigars with a note saying ‘Nobody will ever know what you have done for this country. This is to go some way in thanking you for that.’

       I watched the video in the comments. It seems to me that "Selling your soul" is just hyperbole for selling out.... If I started worshipping the devil right now, would I become a famous celebrity? This shit just seems so silly to me.

       You don't have the connections to make that happen, so no. However people who are dark occult practitioners recruit others based on the person's knowledge and goals, so if you worshiped the devil enough, in the right ways, sure you could become famous

       It is advantageous, short-term. At the cost of your humanity. At the cost of compassion, love and freedom of expression. You will get what you want, but eventually all will be taken away from you in such a fashion that you'll regret not only making the choice, but even having been born.

       Maybe they are just bypassing this post, because it is so ridiculous. We have a scientific explanation for pedophilia, why would you make it about them not being human. It's the kind of thinking that religion promotes, and it's dangerous. Religion has never fought pedophilia any better than every day people, in fact it has given abusers of many kinds a shield to hide behind and power to hurt more people. So kindly fuck off with this attitude that religious people have some edge over atheists when it comes to understanding this subject.

       Your post is much more presumptuous then the OP's and is therefore pretty ridiculous in it's own right. You have no idea if their post is being bypassed period, no less why it would be. There is no complete explanation of anything with science, which is why people turn to their own judgement and beliefs, religious or otherwise, to move past the ambiguity.

       If pedophilia is a mental illness why aren't all pedophiles kept in a secure hospital for the rest of their existence? There's a reason the prison sentences are so pathetic.

       Ok. I can get behind you not believing in witches, that's completely fine. But OP saying "Something evil is controlling the planet and causing wars and death and overall negative feelings." Yep. Christians believe that. So do Muslims. Probably the majority of the world believes that just as there is a force of light, there is an opposite, negative force of darkness. That makes people healthy, not crazy and helpless.

       Or, you know, some people are just more sociopathic than others.  Those that are that way gravitate towards positions of power.  To give these sociopaths an “out” of “hey they are being possessed by evil spirits” is not going to benefit anyone who truly wants changes in our society.  If you cannot accurately figure out the problem in society than you will NEVER find the solution.  So chasing invisible boogeyman won’t get anyone anywhere.

       Is it not possible we are both the light and darkness in this world? Why does there need to be another party to try and justify the evilness of humans? Is it too scary to realize that your fellow man can become such a "demon" &amp; you can too. We barely know jack shit about our brains and consciousness at all so here we are blaming God&amp;Satan.

       It's not about scary/not scary...in fact, parts of what I believe are far scarier! It's about looking around and realizing that this is no accident. That this complicated world needs a designer. In addition to everything God has done in my life, personally. "For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse". - Romans 1:20. Meaning that everything in creation points to God's existence.

       It's a fair question. I think a better one is, why does it continue. But the doctrinal answer is, love cannot be forced from us. Love requires a choice to
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       love. If we are forced to love, we are only puppets or robots, not humans. So unfortunately, many choose evil instead of good. Evil has short term highs and benefits, after all.

       Frankly, I think you're a coward to ascribe everything that's bad and evil on some all-encompassing entity that's outside your realm of tangibility. If you had to admit to yourself that maybe, just maybe, it's humans that are behind it all and that we're all perfectly capable of harboring evil and darkness inside of us, then you might have to actually take some personal responsibility in your life instead of throwing up your hands and relying on some other intangible entity to fix everything for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if by chance it doesn't fix the world, then, well, it was all of a part of the grand cosmic plan anyway. Right.

       Yeah, I find it hard to talk back against this sort of nonsense. There's no logic in this, even the fake logic is flawed. What, we all have self-defense mechanisms, so people who commit suicide or cut themselves must be fake humans. We all have instincts to eat, so anorexics must be fake humans. We all have instincts to kill to survive, so anyone who doesn't kill animals must be a make human.

       i've personally witnessed things that are consistent with this thesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       some speculation.  these beings require emotional levers.  they need some kinda pre-existing issue to play off of.  if everyone was in a social design that was caring and inclusive the levers available would be less abused.  why?  because we do have free will, and we can project what the effect of choices are within the context of our current existence.  so if you're mostly cool with how society is, and you don't have much reason to make "extreme" choices, the imposition of their control would be balanced by free will and rationality.

       Supposedly it has to do more with thought patterns, goes to show why things like addictions and habits are so hard to beat, there could be an entity trying to make you do "it" so that you feed it that same energy  whatever "it" is.

       I'm in agreement with this. Some powerful emotional entities are: shame/guilt, pointlessness/hopelessness, and of course fear, but more-specifically fear of losing everything one has (material or not) or fear of retribution (guilt/shame play in here as well)

       This is speculative.

       Anger is our greatest strength, true anger if controlled is YOUR anger, if you are angry because someone is hurting someone and you want to stop it, there is nothing that can taint that anger, I have no true if this is true, its not aggression, its not violence, its anger/rage, I have no other means of describing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember growing up I would here kids say: "I blackout when I fight", theres always 2 kids who say this, the kid who actually does his own thing and some reason gets picked on and snaps, the second the threat is stopped so does his anger, then there are kids who pretend they black out, blindly rage, act like idiots, get knocked down a few times and still get back up even though its clearly done.

       The manifesto is exciting but doesn't really offer any insight. Das Kapital is the real meat of Marx but its long and extremely dry. Still, if you're looking for a text that explains why the world is what it is there's nothing better. You often times hear people say the whole text is debunked due to the labour theory of value being proven wrong by the transformation problem. What you don't hear is the solutions to the transformation problem like the temporal single system interpretation that have been devised in the last thirty years.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, its extremely dry. There are a plethora of youtube videos explaining the basics though. I'd recommend the labour theory of value.

       When I was young I would have tall shadow people walk into my room and stare at me while I was frozen in sleep paralysis,,  after that happened for a couple years, I'd wake up in the Astral plane version of my neighborhood and float around until I'd get "butterflies"  in my stomach and wake up ,,,  I don't think any of this is crazy,,,,

       Jokes aside, I know it feels good to disassociate all that is evil from our psyche, but come on. The evil comes from within. Maybe not for all people, we're all born with different brain chemistries and grew up under different circumstances. But if you look at the history of humanity, you'll find it marred by war, genocide, murder, rape, and pillage. That's just who we are dude.

       You're being equally naive to disregard the idea that maybe humans throughout history have been influenced to commit war, genocide, murder, rape and pillage. Why are you assuming that dark beings are only present now and were not present for thousands of years already?

       Humans are shitty, nature is shitty. what is natural, is not necessarily "right". Nature is genocidal, just as

       And this is why we need societal structures, to stave off the "demons" of our inner nature. We have many compasses to guide us, from empathy to archetypes.

       We can do it, but not by blaming others (be them your neighbors or demons), and only ourselves.

       I see your point, but why would societal structures help? Individual morality would help and small strictures of the people are essential for freedom in my opinion but not necessarily morality.. I am inclined to believe the people are the top are into something more than just immorality though. There's something deeper..

       In a nutshell, Jesus is the answer to the problem of original sin.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were created by God, to be with God. With the seducing of Satan (formerly Lucifer, the fallen angel), mankind rebelled and went his own way. The suffering fallen world is a result of us turning away from who we were
       <em>
        meant
       </em>
       to be- it went against the natural order of things and creation was perverted. We weren't supposed to get old, get sick, die, hurt one another. Sin brought pain into paradise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus was literally God in human form and His purpose was to come to everyday people, teach the people about who God really is (God had a pretty bad rap thanks to the false priests of the day), how much God longs for us to be back with him, and then to die as the ultimate sacrificial lamb to wipe the slate clean for those who accepted His sacrifice. Jesus is the bridge between man and his original creator.  Nothing man does (good works) can bridge this gap. This is the difference between Christ and all other gods. Faith him Him alone brings salvation, not works.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't 'convert' to Christianity without faith. It's not something you just decide one day to be. Many "Christians" of today have no idea who Jesus really was, and don't care, because the organized religion has been coopted by false teachers.  My suggestion, ask Jesus himself to send you the holy spirit to show you the truth, with a genuinely open mind and heart. There
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a truth of who you really are, no matter how much the world tries to confuse you and belittle it. No harm in asking and if it's real, your eternal future may be on the line.

       The Christian concept of eternal heaven is horrible. Forced happiness for eternity. Also, the gospels ALL DISAGREE about Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can’t ask Jesus to send me the Holy Spirit because I cannot believe in the supernatural. I would have to have blind faith to believe Jesus could read my thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       So God let sin come to paradise, so that we should believe in him and his human sacrifice of a son, who is also him. He let sick corrupt us because he created Lucifer. He could vanquish Satan at anytime because he is all powerful, yet we have to trust him and play through a game of trust the sky god or else he might let Satan duck with you or just fuck with you himself like Job or Abraham.

       I get that different experiences lead us to certain beliefs. You seem to have made up your mind about the character of God. That's completely your prerogative, but I wanted to offer a perspective on your first question "why the Christian God".  I suppose the truth, whatever that may be, will come to all of us someday.

       No I haven’t made up my mind, it’s just that these ancient texts provide essentially no evidence for the type supernatural behavior you speak of. And when you start saying one text is more true than another it seems fishy.

        The Christian concept of eternal heaven is horrible. Forced happiness for eternity

      <p>
       Do you know what eternal heaven actually means? And how is it forced happiness if it is you that is making the choice?

      <p>
       If you label anything non-material as supernatural, you set yourself up for not believing in anything :/ Almost every school of thought speaks of an unseen force that holds all together, whether it's called the Holy Spirit, Consciousness, aether, or whatever else.

       Then skip out on Jesus for not and make do with God!

       We have free will, even if we use it to choose to believe that we are separate from God (which is the Original Sin). Believing you are separate brings forth all kinds of other worries to come to show you (if you have eyes to see it) that you are, in fact, not separate from God.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still on the fence with the whole Jesus concept. There is a lot of conflicting information regarding his identity and his works. Some say he is the Son of God, others say he was a mystic and spiritual teacher, just like Buddha. For now, I'm suspending furthering any beliefs on Jesus.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       We could choose to do so at any time, too, and yet we do not. To some, Satan is an entity, to others, he IS the worst of the worst emotions/acts (shame/guilt/hopelessness/pointlessness/pedophilia, etc), and to others, he is that which is negative. The common denominator in those three is that Satan is representative of negativity. We can choose to banish these negativities (such as greed, judgement, injustice, etc) at any time, and yet, for the most part, that goes ignored. I'm not talking about banishing them world-wide, I'm talking about banishing them in yourself and living by the example of love. It's our choice whether to live in God's Kingdom/Heaven (unconditional love), or in Satan's/Hell (fear/separation/illusion/etc). Our everyday actions brings shift us.

       No I’m saying that in order for god to exist, we would need free will, and it’s looking like the concept of free will is going the way of the dodo. So the evidence mounting points toward no god. If we had this debate in 1670, you might have a point.

       Because we can measure brain activity and examine neurons, synapses, how what we do and say is determined by a sting of previous events. We didn’t have these scientific facts in 1670, but your god theory has remained the same.

       Yes, but the scenarios around those choices, you have no control over. You don’t think your thoughts before you think them, they just appear. If anything god is pulling the strings, if we’re talking about a deistic god who created the universe and peaced out. That’s really the only god that I would say people have an argument for. And there’s still no way to prove a deistic god, you need blind faith to even suggest you know the origins of the universe.

       You don’t choose how your parents raise you. You don’t choose what your boss dictates. You don’t control how your teachers teach, until maybe college. You don’t choose where you were born. You don’t control your neurons. Your temperament can change based on a bad smell in the room. All of these things affect whether or not you brush your teeth twice a day. Free will is an illusion.

       "He could vanquish Satan at anytime because he is all powerful, yet we have to trust him and play through a game of trust the sky god or else he might let Satan fuck with you or just fuck with you himself like Job or Abraham."
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard time and time again AHYH (not YHVH/Jehovah, different 'gods'. Translations from Masoretic jews corrupted the original Torah) is an 'All-loving, creative Father'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps one day you'll have children, though I don't condone having them, but those who do will understand this better. A father of a child loves his child more than himself and willing to give up his own life for the child's if needed; selfless love. Be it the child is good, God willing, or if the child becomes bad, no matter how much wrong choice the child makes, the Father still loves the child. The child is forgiven, time and time again.. up into a point where iniquity is the only feeling in the child. It is then the Father dismisses the child and finally lets go.
      </p>
      <p>
       in·iq·ui·ty: gross injustice or wickedness. a violation of right or duty; wicked act; sin.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so:thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. 15 Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till
       <em>
        iniquity
       </em>
       was found in thee."
      </p>
      <p>
       Would an all loving 'God' immediately smite anything and everything as soon as it made a wrong choice? Would the owner of the dog immediately punish it for wrongdoing, though the dog has no knowledge of what it did was wrong if done by its nature; or rather, the trainer show it the right way? When does abuse begin because the act of correction from wrongdoing? Does it ever?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, the 'ALL MIGHT GOD!" of all could destroy everything, you're right; but if He did, what is the point of creation? A father doesn't abandon his child from the child's wrongdoing but rather, shows the child the right choices in hopes the child chooses them. A 'loving parent' hopes the child becomes good by his/her own choices, and through parental guidance, does the parent begin to comprehend Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I challenge you: If you ever have children, are you willing to abandon the child from an act of iniquity? When do you 'cross the line' as a 'Loving Father'? (which is much discussed in the Bible)

        We were created by God, to be with God. With the seductive leading of Satan (formerly Lucifer, the fallen angel), mankind rebelled and went his own way. The suffering fallen world is a result of us turning away from God and from who we were meant to be- it went against the natural order of things and creation was perverted. We weren't supposed to get old, get sick, die, hurt one another. Sin brought pain into paradise.

       I can't answer this whole thing, because I'm not Christian, but I'll reply anyway.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        why would the Christian god allow such suffering and have us believe on blind faith?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why would any God allow it? We are beings of free will. We have the choice to make any decision in any moment. We can choose to play into our wants/desires and material needs, or we can appeal to our higher nature, the nature of love and guardianship. Without first being given the choice to choose one way of life over the other, we would not have free will. We see all kinds of people because they can reflect our values, or our possible choices. Here, you can see everything from pedophiles/mass murderers, to inventors, priests (the good kind), activists, etc. Most schools of thought speak of a kind of "cleansing" or awakening period. Where one solidifies the choice of service to self (ego) vs service to others (which in turn, aids the self). As we continue to choose (or not to choose) things, the choices will disappear or become more prevalent in society.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you continue towards light and love, you will bring forth Heaven for yourself in the world, and the world has no choice but to reflect that for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you continue towards ego, greed, fear and hate, you will bring forth Hell for yourself, and will see all kinds of things you really don't want to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're in between, and keep playing to both sides... I'm not sure what the future has in store for ya! But I have a feeling that not choosing can be worse than falling into darkness.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Should everyone convert to Christianity?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Hard to tell at this time, but as time passes, The Way will become apparent. As we stop using logic and rationalization to guide us, we will lean more to our intuition, to our heart-brain. Until the "best path" become apparent, it's important to choose what path seems to spread the least harm/discomfort. Which would be the path of love, compassion, self development, peace and knowledge.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Because as it stands half the world are demons right now because they pray to false gods.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       All are given the free will to worship what they please.. Whether it's god or its idols, or whatever else. There are always people of God to show others what they are missing out on.. and those others can choose to see from whichever perspective it is that they want to use to play out their lives. Praying to false Gods doesn't make you a demon, or demonic, unless/until the presence of God becomes undeniable, and people still choose to revere their material things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things take time to fold, unfold and fold back. People would literally lose their sanity if everything always happened quickly/obviously.

       Man is condemned to be free, because once thrown into this world he is bestowed the ultimate power of choice. Rephrasing Sartre there, but I agree completely. Free will has the capacity to encompass the darker bits of humanity. It’s a disservice to what could be a really powerful movement of collective self-awareness to discard it as “demons”.

       I've been studying this extensively after dealing with some fuckery in my life from dark forces and wanting to share with people that are interested / understand. My ex has a demon, I've talked to it when he's black out drunk. When I started figuring out what I'm about to share he started getting worse &amp; pushed me away &amp; won't let me help him. I used to think the idea of dark forces was silly. Then I worked with a shaman (bad move) that taught me about them but then attacked me - pretty much my life and health and relationship went from thriving to shit. So I had to get smart &amp; started studying spiritual warfare. After going to my local church the pastor basically didn't have a clue what I was talking about. What I have found in my research is that alien encounters and encounters with dark forces can be stopped when commanded in the name of Jesus Christ. The bible says he gives us power &amp; authority and we too will cast out demons like he did. From several books I've read - Spiritual Warfare by Karl Payne, What Demons &amp; Spirits Don't Want You To Know by Stacie Spielman and Defeating Dark Angels by Charles Kraft, we give them a foothold or legal rights (the shaman taught me about legal rights / laws of the universe) through emotional traumas or inviting them in through work with shamans, occult, generational curses, getting black out drunk, certain new age practices, so many other ways. To get rid of them we have to go back and identify where we may have given them a foothold (this can be an arduous process &amp; must be done correctly), cast them out in Jesus name, fill the vacated space with the Holy Spirit, pray to God and then not do things that let them in again. Then spiritually grow by being able to identify the ego and walking a path where we seek to share, forgive, love thy neighbor - basically service to others vs service to self. Jesus Christ name gives us more power and authority than the dark forces have. We just have to learn how to use it correctly to defeat them. And this isn't about Christianity as a religion which I think has been twisted. It's about the teachings of Christ (which were mostly parables and sometimes difficult for us to understand). I have a ton of resources &amp; have considered compiling them on a website for other's that are interested and need help.

       I think people do a great service when they look at evil humans and say, those people are not human. We must recognize, that, those are human, and that within each human is the capacity to do great good, and great evil. It is understanding this, that within every human lies this capacity that we can defeat evil and never repeat it, because evil is a human quality, as much as good is, and it is one some of us choose to have, and one we can choose to defeat.

       That's a cop out answer to avoid the reality that satan and demons (aka fallen angels) are real. The Bible is true and at some point genuine conspiracy researchers ought to catch on to that. Obviously we all have the potential to do evil, but that doesn't mean there aren't dark entities fanning the flames in the background.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elite at the top, the ones who conceal knowledge of the truth in every way possible, are satan worshippers. What does that tell you?

       I thought so too. I went to college. I'm smart. People who went to college are smart. They read books. They give lectures. They teach and they're well read. They are no fools. Politicians and those in high places of power are learned. They went to college. They're like me. They wouldn't be fooled by superstition.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when I heard they worship satan, either the report is false... they're schizophrenic, or they are hiding something. They analyze financial reports, run committees, lobby, campaign, write books, cite research and apply theory. How are these people into worship? And why is it behind doors? They talk scientific and atheistic on the front. That's the face I seen in public, and then I hear these reports, exposing, evidence, and busts of secret gatherings, rituals, worshipping, rooms, relics, relationships, meetings, what's the deal? These aren't halloween parties they're having. They're not playing pretend worship. And this at the highest levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're not stupid. They're not schizophrenic. I don't think so. Do you?

       The only demons are the humans who let themselves become one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The potential to be every criminal, from a petty thief to Adolf Hitler lies within each Human.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as much as does the potential to be every heroic and good person. From the unnamed and forgotten charity worker, to Jesus Christ himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       These potentials are all within us, and are all very human.
      </p>
      <p>
       By recognizing that evil is another human quality, we can confront and defeat it. By understanding it, the circumstances that led individuals to take those paths, we can prevent it from happening again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The emotions they went through, the events, the tragedies, the joys, the ideologies, their thought processes, etc. While it may be comfortable to say, there are demons in the world, and that humanity cannot be demonic if it chooses, this doesn't confront and give us the tools to defeat evil before it begins.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe there are no Gods or Demons, these illusions exist to control the human spirit and mind, to make you perceive the world in a way that benefits the social elites, and limits human potential.

       I agree.... its hard for me to believe it all even though I have seen some pretty disturbing stuff discussed in past few months. Saying its demonic entities feels a bit like a cop out when the true evil is prob from the people themselves. I have seen people do some pretty fucked up stuff or have backwards thinking just cause they are nasty people.

       There is also the possibility that many of these group gatherings are not as satanic as suggested, but just rich people with weird fetishes having fancy costumed orgy parties. I dunno, and don't think I want to know, but have the feeling more evidence will keep coming out so guess we will see.

       We are not all the same that is the main reason I think this. Do you think you have the potential to be a child murdering pedophile? I know I don't have that potential. There is cold blooded, pure evil 'people' out there, most have had decent lives. Whether we are here to learn lessons remains to be seen but at this point I can say that all humans are not the same and do not have the same potential. We have come here in large groups with different intentions.

       Lets be a bit more straightforward. Yes all people have a capacity for great and terrible things. Its NOT doing those things that proove ourselves both empathetic and restrained. When one lacks empathy they don't have capacity for good , just as empathetic people cannot be disassociated sociopaths. Human beings are capable of extremes the rest of nature isn't. Nature maintains balance and harmony. Evil has no symbiotic or natural place. Evil , defined by the poster in this case as powerful people purposely steering the direction of mankind/western civilization towards a culture of self depreciation violence and depravity. In doing so , such an individual is entirely out of harmony with the planet itself. Therefore such malevolence , cannot be human or natural as I am profoundly convinced it does not originate from within a man because it does not originate within nature

       There is no capacity in me to do great evil. If you think that about yourself then please get help before you eventually do it. I'm talking about paedophiles being evil and you're telling me you have the potential to do the same, that doesn't sit well with me.

       Yeah, it's called humanity. Sorry, but it's true. To normal people, psychopathic people completely devoid of empathy appear to not even be human, because they are capable of horrible things that most of us are not, and don't even lose a wink of sleep about it. No other animal is as bad as humans are to their own kind, to the rest of the animal kingdom, and to the earth. We are special, alright.

       Are you sure about that? Sorry to ruin your rosy optimistic feel good post, but look at psychological tests that give people unlimited power, ones like Stanford Prison experiment or smaller ones where people simply get to zap other people in other rooms just for the hell of it.

      <p>
       To you, these horrible people who obtained power through horrible means must be aliens or demons, but it might be time to consider that humans are capable of being terrible and some are incapable of even realizing it or caring.

       It's like "Ancient Aliens" the alien guy thinks every ancient technology must have been made by aliens because he doesn't understand how people are capable of creating that stuff themselves. In your case, know that people are capable of destroying it also.

       The only thing I have to offer from the op perspective is that all of the experiments you present are tested on adults after they have been manipulated by our sick society. When you look at babies do you believe that they are evil? The question becomes are we born with evil potential or is it a learned/ programmed quality. I don't know enough about it to make a claim either way just wanted to present that thought. Thanks for your post, definitely makes one think.

       I don't have and raise kids so I might not be qualified to observe their true nature, but I've seen experiments and countless videos with children as well. If they think they're not being observed, and with perceived power, they seem to usually do the "wrong" thing. When they eventually learn their actions have consequences that can hurt them, they start to control themselves. When they grow to adults, the control remains
       <em>
        until
       </em>
       (and if) they feel they have power and don't have to answer for their own actions, then they lose control again and do the wrong thing, every time. It seems people enjoy hurting other people by nature, and not just for their own benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       My opinion is that we all have this "evil" potential inside us, but most of us learn to suppress it, and know that we would hurt ourselves if we don't. FWIW humans are a parasite on this earth, and the kind of parasite that kills its own host. Time and again we see this true, no matter how much we wish it weren't.

       Don’t you think that maybe this view of human nature is a little.... simplistic? Or naive? Good people can do awful, awful things and still think they are good (generally while on some moralistic crusade) and likewise bad people can do good things. Good people can do bad things for good reasons; bad people vice versa. It’s not interdimensional; it’s multidimensional. This is one of the beautiful, effed up things about human nature: Nothing is black and white.

       You can be a sociopath and not be an evil sadistic fuck wad. I often feel the lack of an emotional response to things that typically insight strong emotions in people. I think about tragic things happening and how I just feel nothing about them. I act a way because I know how people should react to things like the death of a loved one or some great loss but the truth is I feel nothing. Am I evil? No. Am I committing any crimes? No. I understand the rules and I just play along.

       As for me, too. Humans can get desensitized, but that does not mean they're necessarily socio or psychopaths. You may not be evil--as am I--because you do not feel intense emotional responses; however, true socio and psychopaths view other humans as playthings and do not care to learn acceptable social norms. I am able to mimic what others feel and usually force myself to feel the same, but it is hard for me to sympathize because I over analyze things and try my best to find logic. This does not mean I am a sociopath, nor (if you are the same) are you a sociopath. I suggest you research Robert Hare's studies and/or attend an abnormal psychology class at your local community college to further understand the human brain and its wirings. People are quick to turn on each other and mystify why others do what they do; mental illness is a true epidemic and "humanity" is not what you subjectively see it to be.

       The old testament, yes, god sends satan to test job, because the lesson is, as i interpret it, is that job was pure and joyful, having not been affected by tribulation, so god sends his earthly child to start tormenting job, testing his spirit, and beautifully so, as job suffers he curses god and the world, but amidst the falling into despair, there they are, his friends, rebuking him even as he dies horribly, the voices of reason (gods help) reaching him through his friends. And job accepts, is humbled and overcomes and does the only thing anyone can do, shut up, take it, love it.

       Well, my point was, for those Biblically inclined, the notion of an evil architecture governing parts of our planet is already explained to us by Jesus. Stay on the bright path, weather storms, expect joy in the next world, await Jesus return to Earth (soon, possibly). And, don’t blame God for the evils inflicted upon Man by Man.

       There are no such things as demons or angels, as there is no such things as human beings, there is only god and god only, not even a creator and the created, nothing is separate and/or independent. There is no struggle of any kind on any level. As the sun shines effortlessly, so does the earth breeds humans as the grass grows, and the grass grows and feeds animald and animals humans, what are humans fed to? Gotta ask the real questions

       Neurological disorders are common, and our society is a factory for mental illness, by design. The fact that some people think it's even possible to be positive without a negative balance proves that. I can post three articles, then backwards relate it to prove that positive people are psychopath enablers who create these monsters in our society. I question the sanity of anyone whi claims to be a good positive person, yet views and pushes smut like this offhand. You are what you repeat.

       They simply want you to believe they are not human. They've carefully crafted this image for themselves through books, articles, "interviews", film and television. If we believe they are monsters, then we also believe we are powerless to do anything about our virtual enslavement under 'them'. It is the full power of propaganda in all it's glory.

       I've recently become aware of this. It started with researching the LV shootings and then the Sandy Hook fake shootings and then 9/11 and then it snowballed. I spent days and days reading stuff, watching videos, etc. when it finally dawned on me, this, what we're currently experiencing, is world-wide and goes way beyond a single groups ability to control. People want to claim it is the illuminati or the Soro's folks or the Left but having read so much for so long I have concluded it is much bigger than any of these, or even all of these combined. In other words, you're right, it is an other-worldly entity at work here. But then, it's supposed to happen. Read the Bible. And no this, it's not going to get better, not yet. Not until God finally puts a stop to it, as the Bible says He will.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now here's the thing. Most everyone you try and tell this too will horse-laugh you out of the room. This is bordering on, at least in their minds, insanity. Just wait. Soon everyone will see that this is all very true.

       OP. I believe the same thing. The way ISIS were killing people (in this day in age in humanity) by the 1000s and putting them is mass graves made me truly realize that evil exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's either that or the powers that be know the truth about life and there is no such thing as good or evil and heaven and hell, so they take advantage at any expense while they're here on Earth. But it's BS, because I know for a fact that good and  God exist.

       The Christian concept of eternal heaven is horrible. Forced happiness for eternity. Also, the gospels ALL DISAGREE about Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can’t ask Jesus to send me the Holy Spirit because I cannot believe in the supernatural. I would have to have blind faith to believe Jesus could read my thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       So God let sin come to paradise, so that we should believe in him and his human sacrifice of a son, who is also him. He let sick corrupt us because he created Lucifer. He could vanquish Satan at anytime because he is all powerful, yet we have to trust him and play through a game of trust the sky god or else he might let Satan duck with you or just fuck with you himself like Job or Abraham.

       I can't answer this whole thing, because I'm not Christian, but I'll reply anyway.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        why would the Christian god allow such suffering and have us believe on blind faith?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why would any God allow it? We are beings of free will. We have the choice to make any decision in any moment. We can choose to play into our wants/desires and material needs, or we can appeal to our higher nature, the nature of love and guardianship. Without first being given the choice to choose one way of life over the other, we would not have free will. We see all kinds of people because they can reflect our values, or our possible choices. Here, you can see everything from pedophiles/mass murderers, to inventors, priests (the good kind), activists, etc. Most schools of thought speak of a kind of "cleansing" or awakening period. Where one solidifies the choice of service to self (ego) vs service to others (which in turn, aids the self). As we continue to choose (or not to choose) things, the choices will disappear or become more prevalent in society.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you continue towards light and love, you will bring forth Heaven for yourself in the world, and the world has no choice but to reflect that for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you continue towards ego, greed, fear and hate, you will bring forth Hell for yourself, and will see all kinds of things you really don't want to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're in between, and keep playing to both sides... I'm not sure what the future has in store for ya! But I have a feeling that not choosing can be worse than falling into darkness.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Should everyone convert to Christianity?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Hard to tell at this time, but as time passes, The Way will become apparent. As we stop using logic and rationalization to guide us, we will lean more to our intuition, to our heart-brain. Until the "best path" become apparent, it's important to choose what path seems to spread the least harm/discomfort. Which would be the path of love, compassion, self development, peace and knowledge.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Because as it stands half the world are demons right now because they pray to false gods.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       All are given the free will to worship what they please.. Whether it's god or its idols, or whatever else. There are always people of God to show others what they are missing out on.. and those others can choose to see from whichever perspective it is that they want to use to play out their lives. Praying to false Gods doesn't make you a demon, or demonic, unless/until the presence of God becomes undeniable, and people still choose to revere their material things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things take time to fold, unfold and fold back. People would literally lose their sanity if everything always happened quickly/obviously.

        We were created by God, to be with God. With the seductive leading of Satan (formerly Lucifer, the fallen angel), mankind rebelled and went his own way. The suffering fallen world is a result of us turning away from God and from who we were meant to be- it went against the natural order of things and creation was perverted. We weren't supposed to get old, get sick, die, hurt one another. Sin brought pain into paradise.

       It's not about scary/not scary...in fact, parts of what I believe are far scarier! It's about looking around and realizing that this is no accident. That this complicated world needs a designer. In addition to everything God has done in my life, personally. "For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse". - Romans 1:20. Meaning that everything in creation points to God's existence.

       As for me, too. Humans can get desensitized, but that does not mean they're necessarily socio or psychopaths. You may not be evil--as am I--because you do not feel intense emotional responses; however, true socio and psychopaths view other humans as playthings and do not care to learn acceptable social norms. I am able to mimic what others feel and usually force myself to feel the same, but it is hard for me to sympathize because I over analyze things and try my best to find logic. This does not mean I am a sociopath, nor (if you are the same) are you a sociopath. I suggest you research Robert Hare's studies and/or attend an abnormal psychology class at your local community college to further understand the human brain and its wirings. People are quick to turn on each other and mystify why others do what they do; mental illness is a true epidemic and "humanity" is not what you subjectively see it to be.

       about to say something. Dont take this the wrong way:
      </p>
      <p>
       there's a whole theory, that women are attracted to alpha jerks who are unstable troglodytes, all on a subconscious level as well, and this includes getting beaten and manhandled, some psychologists say it's to make up for any sort of harder discipline or spanking from the biological father.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I was never an alpha, more a lone wolf IDGAF type who played alpha if necessary, however I did date this girl who wanted me to hit her, choke her, had rape fantasies and so on. I tried often to figure out where this was all coming from, considering she cam from an educated liberal background with a highly respected Father who was a Big AG Professor

       Your post is much more presumptuous then the OP's and is therefore pretty ridiculous in it's own right. You have no idea if their post is being bypassed period, no less why it would be. There is no complete explanation of anything with science, which is why people turn to their own judgement and beliefs, religious or otherwise, to move past the ambiguity.

       Whow dude, never said He wasn’t helping you because “you didn’t believe in Him enough.”
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m just saying I️ felt disconnected when I️ didn’t truly believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I️ absolutely believe that the challenges we get are actually blessings, because overcoming that challenge gives us the strength or skills required for us to either rise to our best, or prepares us enough that we don’t get just flat out crushed when he hit the next hurdle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve always thought we’re never given anything we can’t handle, so the more difficult the challenge I’m actually flattered that God/Universe/whatever you want to call It thinks I’m strong enough to handle a situation even when I️ doubt myself pretty severely while in the middle of it.

      <p>
       Also you may be conflating spirituality/belief in God with religion. They are definitely not the same thing. Not even close; all Catholics are Christians but not all Christians are Catholics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion requires spirituality, spirituality does not require religion in any shape or form.
