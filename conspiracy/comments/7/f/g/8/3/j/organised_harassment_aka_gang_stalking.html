    <div class="md"><p>Gang Stalking is not real, at least not in the way it&#39;s portrayed on YouTube and in this sub.  There is no mass organized systematic approach to gang stalking people who &quot;know&quot; thing they shouldn&#39;t or for &quot;harassing&quot; people who are &quot;enlightened&quot;.</p>

<p>This is a paranoid delusion typically symptomatic of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.  If you believe you&#39;re being stalked, go for a walk with a friend of yours somewhere you frequently go.  You&#39;ll notice very quickly that everyone you claim is &quot;stalking you&quot; actually isn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So your rebuttal to the very overwhelmingly poor handling and treatment of mental health issues in healthcare in the U.S. is a wordpress blog about something that happened to one person in the UK?  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at some of the common symptoms of schizophrenia</p>

<p><a href="https://mentalillnesspolicy.org/medical/schizophrenia-delusions.html">https://mentalillnesspolicy.org/medical/schizophrenia-delusions.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>One simple form of a delusion is the conviction that random events going on around the person all relate in a direct way to him or her. If you are walking down the street and a man on the opposite sidewalk coughs, you don’t think anything of it and may not even consciously hear the cough. The person with schizophrenia, however, not only hears the cough but may immediately decide it must be a signal of some kind, perhaps directed to someone else down the street to warn him that the person is coming. The schizophrenia sufferer knows this is true with a certainty that few people experience. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How about another symptom pertaining to delusions?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In many cases the delusions become more complex and integrated. Rather than simply being watched, the person becomes convinced that he/she is being controlled by other persons, manipulated, or even hypnotized. Such persons are constantly on the alert for confirmatory evidence to support their beliefs; needless to say, they always find it from among the myriad visual and auditory stimuli perceived by all of us each day</p>

<p>Paranoid delusions may on occasion be dangerous. “During the paranoid period I thought I was being persecuted for my beliefs, that my enemies were actively trying to interfere with my activities, were trying to harm me, and at times even to kill me.” The paranoid person may try to strike first when the threat is perceived as too close. . . .</p>

<p>A relatively common delusion is that a person can control other people’s minds. One young woman I saw had spent five years at home because each time she went into the street she believed that her mind compelled other people to turn and look at her. She described the effect of her mind as “like a magnet—they have no choice but to turn and look.” . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should be more aware of mental health problems considering you adamantly believe in GANG STALKING.  It&#39;s nothing more than a narrated, broadcasted version of someone&#39;s symptoms.</p>

<p>Scientific TI type believes only high value targets or targets about to elude and relocoate are stalked by vehicle and foot. acknowledge geo-stalking. </p>

<p>No &quot;boots on the ground&quot; regarding stalking unless the TI is a high value target or is eluding. Targets are geo-stalked and tortured via spy satellite, over the horizon ultra-wide band radar, GWEN towers and wireless mesh networks. See the geo-stalking wikis.
Boots are on the ground regarding break ins, theft, interdiction of mail and packages and flashing the BIOS of TIs&#39; computers.</p>

<p>When I say &quot;do your homework&quot; I do not mean go looking for tin foil hats on youtube (confirmation bias), I refer to the act of at least attempting to acquire a little knowledge on the matter. Did you at try to read a little on <a href="https://fightgangstalking.com">https://fightgangstalking.com</a> ?</p>

<p>However, I have to agree that there is allot of skewed reports, even by genuine &quot;TIs&quot; that may be sincere. However the compromising nature of these psychological operations purposely misguide not only the victims but the public at large.</p>

<p>It is in human nature to seek and find patterns that may not even exist, to help us understand the world around us.</p>

<p>This works both ways: Targets that have been psychologically compromised may jump to the conclusion that reptiles are after them. Non targets face a similar dilemma, confused and scared, can explain the &quot;phenomenon&quot; effecting targets as a form of mental disorder.</p>

<p>So as you can see, it&#39;s a little more complex than that. To fully understand what is happening to targets of organised harassment (&quot;Gangstalking&quot;) you will require a little knowledge in an array of fields including history, politics (corruption), economics, sociology and psychological warfare.</p>

<p>The reason why the perpetrators of these crimes can get away with it (not only due to plausible deniability) is because one can anticipate that the vast majority of the general public will not be informed enough (or even have the time/interest/resources) to understand what is going on. On the contrary, perpetrators can create a couple of dis-info sites, send some emails to media outlets about the &quot;delusions of gangs stalking&quot; and voila, let the non-judicial practices commence.</p>

I admit that it sounds delusional or possibly drug induced. I am of sound mind and body. I am no Salmun Rushde {sp}I have pissed someone off with my opinions I guess. I wont anchor it to a particular group, that is what they want. I am the classic TI: being followed, nasty stares, notification of owner/mgt at retail outfits to inform them of my horribleness, brighting, street theater,  GPS tracking over exposure to colors and sounds, sound harassment, energy weapons so I get crying jags, anger, lethargy, numbness etc then they turn the knob down and I am fine.. Luckily I understand behavior modification techniques, and the need for power and manipulation of perps by their handlers. I familiar with the subject but could not understand why me. My weapon: The Constitution of The United States, I live happily and am very kind and polite to the poor misguided perps. The exposure of the game will decrease its power. It is used in the guise of gaining brownie points in heaven, community watch groups, and some perps participate for excitement and patriotism. I dont care who or why. They thought I might just lay down and die. They are cowards and I can destroy their delicate opinions and unsophisticated tactics with reverse psyop tactics. I thought we had evolved beyond this. </p>

<p>Inadequate response. You need to respond directly to <a href="/u/MAGICHUSTLE">/u/MAGICHUSTLE</a>&#39;s criticism of white cars (color coding in street theatre).  &quot;Genuine TIs&quot; are not illuminati theorists TIs.</p>

<p>Solely because they read or watch David Icke TI types. Extremely few TIs have created their own theories:</p>

<p>Due to TIs not submitting meter reports, shielding reports, biomarkers lab tests for radio wave sickness, medical records of other directed energy weapons injuries, etc.</p>

<p>False. You need to ask the TIs who believe they are being stalked by vehicle for the license plates. You need to ask the TIs who are being attacked by directed energy weapons for biomarker lab tests, meter reports, shielding reports, etc.</p>

<p>Alibi. TIs are ignorant about state laws and federal laws prohibiting gangstalking or attacks by directed energy weapons. See the laws wikis in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>. TIs are ignorant and lazy about applying for a civil harassment restraining order.

<p>Can you identify a perp disinformation website? Other than the defunct FFCHS and the current PACTS organization, I do not know of any. Whereas, there are dozens of TIs blogsites and websites that plagiarize each other and fail to substantiate. TIs wrongly believe that creating a blogsite identical to other TI blogsites will bring awareness. Whereas, the multiple identical websites brain wash TIs and the public. &quot;There&#39;s thousands of TIs&quot; whereas there are merely a few dozen websites hosted by a mere few dozen TIs. &quot;They are all saying the same thing. It must be true.&quot; Whereas, no one is substantiating and what they are saying is 90% illuminati theories such as street theatre.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK let me help you.</p>

<p>First, the MK ULTRA GS connection is thus: GS is part of a continuation of the CIA mind control program. It is the logical outgrowth of the 1950-1990s activities that ARE proven but you seem to think that the sources are imaginary so I can&#39;t help you there.</p>

<p>Three  reasons many gs videos are unconvincing. Some are produced by shills in order to muddy the water. Some are produced by actual victims who are unaware that they are sensitized to the stimuli they constantly see but that which looks normal and uninteresting to anyone else. Some are produced by people who think they are GS&#39;s but are not.</p>

<p>The existence of intentionally poor evidence and evidence presented by paranoid people doesn&#39;t obviate the existence of the issue. Just because there is bad evidence doesn&#39;t mean all evidence is bad.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://youtu.be/V4uCUYNeIqE?t=4m27s">video</a> is a combination of &quot;unaware&quot; and &quot;good&quot; evidence. If you didn&#39;t follow this fellow&#39;s videos, the first 4.5 minutes might seem simply paranoid. And what happens at 4.5 minutes might seem like a sick person walking by another sick person. But it&#39;s not, it&#39;s very good evidence of a perpetrator mocking a victim. At the start of every video this fellow does, he states the time &quot;according to his watch.&quot; The perpetrator is mocking this habit, &quot;Six thirty seven p.m.! Sunday, record all the particle!&quot; is a reference to the victim referencing the time in every video he does, and recording many, many videos.</p>

<p>This stunning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLc9-jqCT08">GS example</a> speaks for itself, I will only point out that the stalking -- the literal, spot on, in your face stalking -- is not just a cop pushing someone off a particular piece of property, as the cop continues to stare at the victim well past the point that he has stopped pushing him away.</p>

<p>This is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0qqc2UUJFI&amp;amp;t=1s">a video of a former perpetrator</a> who quit after he realized that what he was hired to do was wrong. He describes meetings at City Hall, and being paid in gift cards.</p>

<p>This is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lWNVluhlsQ">multi-hour directed energy weapon attack</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Missing from the mental health diagnoses available in the DSM manuals to date are two factual, documented, indisputable phenomena that so affect human function, it&#39;s hard to understand how they could be overlooked.</p>

<p>The DSM  -- and its doctors who came to conclusions about mental illness -- does not factor in MK ULTRA/Monarch mind control programs, and domestic child abuse.</p>

<p>The U.S. and Canadian governments -- and certainly others can be inferred -- engage in systematic mind control torture methods to create assassins, secret couriers and sex slaves. The Church Committee focus in the 1970&#39;s was on the documents that had been stolen and exposed. The CIA didn&#39;t admit to anything that wasn&#39;t already out of its control. The hearings therefore concentrated only on what the CIA had been caught doing, which was non-consensual unwitting LSD experiments.</p>

<p>Since then, well over 15,000 CIA documents distributed through FOIA requests (that&#39;s as of 15 years ago) prove that government programs used torture and abuse to create Dissociative states in order to create mind controlled assasins, sex slaves and couriers. </p>

<p>1996 Presidential Commission on Bioethics witnesses claimed that were used as of the age of 9 -- and saw children as young as 4 -- in government facilities where the witness/victims were strapped to tables, injected with radiation containing substances, put in solitary confinement (sensory deprivation), and taught sexual techniques in order to entrap those who would fund the CIA&#39;s projects.</p>

<p>Mind control&#39;s history goes back at least as far The Egyptian Book of the Dead, which documented using torture to create slave behavior.</p>

<p>Not proven in documentation because so much about Josef Mengele and Project Paperclip was a lie to get around allowing war criminals into the United States, it can be logically inferred that Josef Mengele worked on a systemization of the torture methods to create mind control programs both in Germany and in the United States. </p>

<p>Proven and not in dispute, Dr. Ewan Cameron performed torture on children to create mind control programming techniques. The Canadian government admitted the crimes and paid both victims and victims&#39; children. Cameron was the founder and head of many psychiatric associations.</p>

<p>Dr. Jolly West ran the Neuropsych Institute at the University of CA Los Angeles for over 20 years where many MK Ultra mind control programs were perfected. Anecdotally we often see music stars suspected of being under mind control programming brought to the Neuropsych Institute for re-programming. Kanye West recently was taken there after ranting to his audience about freeing their minds. He appeared on Ellen afterward, unable to remember simple statements he had made about his own children.</p>

<p>The only people who said that MK ULTRA stopped in the 1970&#39;s were known liars at the top of the CIA. There is no evidence that the mind control programs were shut down. </p>

<p>Why do the professionals who put the DSM together fight so hard to prove DID does not exist or that it must be therapist-induced?</p>

<p>We have plenty of significant studies and experience dealing with the constant, repeated presentation of child abuse with dissociative states. We have CIA-documents proving systematic abuse of children to create dissociative states. And we have the psychological professionals who made it their business to control the MPD/DID portions of the DSM to dismiss and resist any possibility that child abuse and torture can create multiple personality fragments.</p>

<p>To understand the targeted individual, you have to understand Project Paperclip, MK ULTRA/Monarch and the fight against dissociative disorders within the psychiatric profession.</p>

<p>In Paperclip, the U.S. government (in the form of a man named Harry Armstrong) brought hundreds of Nazi scientists to the U.S., including many who were CONVICTED at Nuremberg and then pardoned by the U.S. We suspect from victim testimony and images of one of many &quot;Dr. Green&quot; pseudonyms that one of these scientists was Dr. Josef Mengele.</p>

<p>In MK ULTRA -- a blanket term for 168 sub projects -- the U.S. government created front organizations to sponsor university projects to create mind-controlled slaves. This continued into Project Monarch though we use &quot;MK ULTRA&quot; to refer to mind control programs. We don&#39;t know the current program names so we use the old terms.</p>

<p>Jolly West was one of the most important MK ULTRA scientists, and was the founder of the False Memory Syndrome Association.</p>

<p>So yes, I do believe there is a conspiracy around the diagnoses attributed to targeted individuals.</p>

<p>In the U.S., the government is literally torturing Americans in order to preserve American freedom.
For the best list of references, please see Dr. Colin Ross&#39; &quot;The CIA Doctors.&quot; I would also refer you to Dr. Robert Duncan, U.S. whistleblower who worked on mind control torture programs; and Dr. Barry Trower, GB whistleblfower, who worked on MI5/MI6 effects of microwave and radio frequencies in order to induce physical and mental illnesses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to get heavily involved in this thread or argue with anyone because if you believe it&#39;s mental illness then I can&#39;t convince you. However, if you are open-minded to the possibility, and want to read some reasonable, mainstream knowledge, mainstream science, non-absurd theory sources:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/5p0zhw/counterintelligence_disruption/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/5p0zhw/counterintelligence_disruption/</a> -- this is a good brief summary by a Redditor</p>

<p>microwavedindividual&#39;s &quot;categories&quot; are that Redditor&#39;s idiosyncratic viewpoints and do not reflect the views of most TIs. For whatever reason, that Redditor does not even participate in the primary gangstalking sub. I have no idea what he is talking about with &quot;illuminati types,&quot; &quot;Icke types,&quot; etc. Organized stalking is a primarily Deep State-operated/contracted counterintelligence disruption program that is completely explicable through things we know from mainstream media sources and mainstream science and has nothing to do with illuminati, Icke, &quot;follow the white rabbit&quot; type conspiracy theories, or anything like that. Also, from what I have observed, most TIs don&#39;t believe in (or at least don&#39;t experience the use of) &quot;energy weapons&quot; or &quot;remote mind control&quot; or anything like that. Happy to discuss further if anyone has any questions or wants to have reasonable discourse, but like I said, not going to really argue whether it exists or not.</p>

<p>You certainly can convince people believing its mental illness. Mental illness has biomarkers and specific brain imaging. TIs who are attacked by directed energy weapons and their own cell phone and router have radio wave sickness biomarkers and electric shock biomarkers. See the mental illness wikis in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>.</p>

<p>Other evidence would be other injuries, license plates, meter reports, shielding reports, etc.</p>

to some people. </p>

<p>Just the opposite. By mentioning mental illness, you make people think of mental illness. Submit a post in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a> describing gas lighting and the symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia that you believe TIs have.

<p>By &quot;average&quot; do you mean &quot;innocent&quot; which is the term <a href="/u/lonely_monkey">/u/lonely_monkey</a> used in his post? &gt;Most TIs acknowledge that they are average people -- they just happen to have been caught in the crosshairs of an overgrown security budget for various reasons.</p>

<p>False. Are you basing your conclusion on any survey or the bulk of written testimonies or torture reports? If so, cite the testimonies and torture reports. Whereas, most TIs do not acknowledge they are &quot;average&quot; &quot;innocent&quot; people. </p>

<p><a href="/u/triscuitzop">/u/triscuitzop</a> complied with your request for censorship despite his comments below acting innocent of all censorship.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedIndividuals/comments/79klgo/closing_rtargetedindividuals_part_3_is/dp4r7wh/">https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedIndividuals/comments/79klgo/closing_rtargetedindividuals_part_3_is/dp4r7wh/</a></p>

<p>If <a href="/u/pogomaster12">/u/pogomaster12</a> was still a mod, he not only would have not stickied the post but would have removed it. <a href="/u/pogomaster">/u/pogomaster</a> 12 has removed David Icke TI type posts and banned David Icke TI type:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedIndividuals/comments/79klgo/closing_rtargetedindividuals_part_3_is/">https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedIndividuals/comments/79klgo/closing_rtargetedindividuals_part_3_is/</a></p>

<p>The banned created two David Icke TI type subs: <a href="/r/reptiliandata">/r/reptiliandata</a> and <a href="/r/gangstalkingmkultra">/r/gangstalkingmkultra</a>. These are where the David Icke TI types have gone to until this year when curiosity36 asked to be a mod of <a href="/r/psychotronics">/r/psychotronics</a> and invited a former David Icke forum mod to mod. Activistethos is omnisense.</p>

<p>Having said that, your alibi for dismissing the types of TIs because you don&#39;t know what I am talking about is ridiculous. Read the references I cited in other comments in this post. Also read the TI types wiki: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Organized stalking is a primarily Deep State-operated/contracted counterintelligence disruption program </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that is completely explicable through things we know from mainstream media sources and mainstream science</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False. There are many papers published in medical journals and science journals. <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a> wikis archived them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It has nothing to do with illuminati, Icke, &quot;follow the white rabbit&quot; type conspiracy theories, or anything like that</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree it has nothing to do with the illuminati. I disagree it has nothing to do with David Icke. David Icke&#39;s message that cell phones and cell towers are mind control is correct. David Icke practices what he preaches. He uses a landline phone. So do I.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, from what I have observed, most TIs don&#39;t believe in (or at least don&#39;t experience the use of) &quot;energy weapons&quot; or &quot;remote mind control&quot; or anything like that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you mean by &quot;remote mind control?&quot; Do you mean remote neural monitoring? Synthetic telepathy? Microwave mind control? Peer reviewed papers established these. The papers are archived in the wikis in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>.</p>

<p>Regarding your claim &quot;most TIs&quot;, cite written testimonies. Cite a survey analysis. I did. See the Surveys wikis in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>.</p>

<p>In 2015, head mod Tok-A-Mak censored directed energy weapons in <a href="/r/gangstalking">/r/gangstalking</a>. Are you basing your assumption from recent posts in <a href="/r/gangstalking">/r/gangstalking</a>? Read the older posts prior to the censorship. Even after the censorship, some subscribers post on hearing voices. Directed energy weapons induce hearing voices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to have genuinely experienced the program.  My experience ended years ago now.  You are correct about “remote mind control” and “energy weapons” - those that believe these happened are one of three things: </p>

<p>1)actually suffering mental illness: unfortunately this community attracts many people that are in reality delusional,</p>

<p>2) disinformation- there are next to zero “sources” of information that are genuine.  Almost all of them include information about real elements of the program and splice that information with fantastical elements that the average person will see as crazy.  That’s why very often you stumble onto a page describing real psychological methods used only to conclude it’s a ploy by “Satan’s robots” or the Illuminati using lasers or beams or whatever on people. </p>

<p>OR 3) genuine targets that believe the disinformation:  especially early on, it is easy to read a document describing a lot of what you’re experiencing coupled with its own explanation (community watch groups, vigilante gangs, etc who will begin with these tactics and eventually move onto using energy weapons) - and your mind will start noticing things that seem to confirm the explanations you read.  Also a couple of innocuous comments can be directed at you to take advantage of this confirmation bias.</p>

<p>MY OPINIONS: it is a futile exercise to try to convince others of the existence of this program.  All you can do is tell other targets to learn to stop worrying about it.  It can’t actually hurt you beyond the damage you do to yourself and your reputation.  Nobody outside of “handlers” know any real information on you or your life.  It only appears this way.  It is a much smaller operation on an individual level than you’d ever think.  There is no need for significant manpower or even a highly intensive effort after the initial stages which prime you to interpret actual coincidences as coordinated events.  It is an expertly crafted illusion which allows targets to experience this as a large, manpower-intensive gangstalking operation while others close to them don’t even notice the slightest hints of it.  The people around you that you know personally that DO drop the occasional hint-you have the power to convince them that the line means anything you want them to think it means.  You can use it to your advantage and once you start doing this the program will end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m sorry if this turns out to be an overly long response or if it does not end up being helpful to you.  I had 2 sources that were helpful to me when piecing everything together but I’m almost hesitant to share them because both of them contain a certain level of disinformation and can easily be interpreted the wrong way.  But to a true target you should not have an extreme amount of trouble separating the disinformation from the good advice.  The overall best source I’ve found (which is no doubt a recording of someone that is an insider in the program) is this audio (it is 85% accurate with about 15% of crap.  For example he entertains directed energy weapons but if you listen closely and read between the lines you will hear that he says DEW “is not specifically part of this program.” ) The key is listening very very closely to what he actually says vs what he merely suggests could be possible.  Also try to listen for certain loaded terms: for example “mind control technology” doesn’t have to mean anything high tech-it could mean “power of suggestion” “deceptive techniques” “propaganda” etc.  A target should get a lot out of this:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DQF-kJexYXQ">https://youtu.be/DQF-kJexYXQ</a></p>

<p>He brushes up against the question you had starting at exactly 25:00. “And that person who acts out, he has no idea that his actions or words are significant to you.  That’s why they’re using so many double meanings or subtle hints.</p>

<p>The second source is 90% bullshit with good and helpful information scattered about.  Ignore all the crap about chemtrails, bioapi and any other technological explanations.  If you read something here that isn’t immediately familiar to you then ignore it completely:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dataasylum.com/gangstalking-targeted-individual-information.html">http://www.dataasylum.com/gangstalking-targeted-individual-information.html</a></p>

<p>The relevant quote there regarding your question is:</p>

<p>“What your friend says must typically be in a context of something that could be said anyway in that situation and means nothing to them”</p>

<p>Forget these “sources” though-let me make up a fake, kind of extreme, practical example.  Say you are in Las Vegas, get drunk, have sex with a prostitute and end up contracting herpes.  Lol sorry just first thing that came to mind - had to be an embarrassing situation.  Then say a week later a friend of yours randomly starts talking about Las Vegas and randomly says “you gotta be careful out there... who knows you could find a hooker and get herpes!”  Your immediate thought is that it’s not a coincidence and that your friend knows what happened in your private life and is now using this information against you.  In reality if you treat it as an actual coincidence and laugh it off he will never know you felt his line was a reference to you.  What if he was just straight given that line without any context and just repeated it word for word to you?  Let’s say you responded “funny, I said the same thing to my friend when we were there last week after he got a little crazy.”  The person that told you that line will, at most, think he was repeating it to you because that’s the same advice you gave your friend.  They don’t know the context of the harassment they give... they give lines that you will interpret as harassment but that they don’t.  You can take their lines and make them think they refer to anything you want.  You can take the “harassment” and use it to build your reputation and not hurt it if you’re good at it.</p>

<p>In 90% of cases you are best off ignoring all the harassment altogether.  Most of the time that same person will be given a second, contradictory line on the same topic a few days or weeks later.  It is designed so that the people giving the harassment can not possibly infer anything about you with any real certainty.  You can either spin it to your liking or ignore it.  Once you understand this you’ll see it is those people that are in the dark about what this is all about much more than you.  Then you will slowly learn it is all a big show with no purpose but to lead you astray-that there is no “big meaning” they’re trying to communicate to you-no rumors swirling behind your back.  Purely a message to make you believe crazy things and to cut down on your credibility and confidence.  If the program starts doing the opposite, if it starts to become neutral or even beneficial to you, then they will eventually give up and it will be over.  Note this could take a year or more for this conclusion to be reached, but it WILL end.  I hope this was helpful.  If you disagree that is fine but I’m not here to debate just to spread my perspective.</p>
