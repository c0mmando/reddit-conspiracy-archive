       I thought this was interesting given the current Elsagate panic:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The version of Sleeping Beauty with its chaste, true-love kiss that most of us remember from Disney or the Brothers Grimm derives from a 17th-century Italian tale called Sun, Moon, and Talia by Giambattista Basile, based on folk legends dating from the 14th century. In these early versions, the sleeping princess is raped and impregnated by a passing king â€“ but it all ends well because after she wakes and recovers from the initial shock of finding she has twins, he returns and marries her. This constitutes a happy ending."

       Definitely. Childhood itself didn't really exist in the past as it does now. That doesn't mean that reality was good. In fact, childhood was often a time of hard labour and scarcity in centuries past. But it wasn't all bad, by any means.

       all present is better that any past in my experience, some lucky people had a comfortable life before, but we have averaged that nice experience over time, technology has made all better, regardless of what scaremongerers would have you believe

       Strictly speaking that is right, but we can tell from archaeology that health, for example, and living conditions are generally far better now than in the past. Just taking the example of giving birth, we can see that women and their child had a high risk of death. That has dropped massively. The list of such is quite long. So, no, we can't be sure that life now is better, but we can make an educated guess using historical and archaeological records.

       You don't know any of that.  I'd say there's a 100% chance that 99% of what you know about history is BS.

       For instance, most people don't realize that the Greek gods were actually politicians.  For instance, Zeus the god of lightning is probably more clearly translated as the politician that brought electricity.

       Egyptians did brain surgery.  People somehow just assume they did it without anesthesia, but that's stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's far more likely that the opposite of what you believe is true.  That is, we may only be two hundred years past the last major cataclysm, and while it's the best point in the past two hundred years, things were likely much better before then.

       I enjoyed this reply thoroughly, I agree wholeheartedly, The stuff we just assume was discovered its being re-discovered, maybe for the 10th time already, I am still attached to my "things just keep improving with time" cause it has been true for me, at least in health, peace and opportunities

       The idea that history is a straight arrow of progress pointing up is very comforting, and I think that's why it persist.

       Many years ago, I was dating a grad student that was taking a history class, and she was called out by the professor for stating that the present is better than the past.  She explained it to me, and it sort of opened up my mind.

       But, even in recent history, in the 1980's M.S. in the US was a treated and curable disease.  Autism rates were lower.  Cancer was rare and unheard of a hundred-fifty years ago.

       I have been aware for a few years that modern humans have been on earth for 200.000+ years, must have ascended and descended many times, James burke's lectures taughtme that all inventions are really just combining two things that already existed and that the more we communicate the faster connections emerge, eventually an important connection is made and we ascend a little, like finding out that ceramic ovens can make better metals, it took us 1000 years for that connection to be made this time around, may have been made faster on previous cycles,  some of the best videos I have ever seen

       Every fairy tale is based on some hard knock life stories. It's not a conspiracy. The hard-knock stories continue to this day they just get labelled differently.
      </p>
      <p>
       To judge the past in a modern frame also doesn't make sense. Today some woman gets mad by the mere affection of a man, cries indecency or harassment, yet lives a single life of neurotic anxiety, bitter and depressed. A woman gets taken by a man 300 years ago but he provides for her for a lifetime. It's relative to the environment.

       So you think rape for a woman in Saudi Arabia is morally relative to, say, groping her in the West? I mean, under some forms of Sharia the rapist must marry and provide for the victim.
      </p>
      <p>
       And out of interest, do many women "cry indecency" when you are "affectionate" to them? How do you show your affection? Sounds like you're doing it wrong.

       This isnt a conspiracy. The stories adapted by Disney are much different to the originals, why? Because of culture. Also because these older versions tend to be much weaker stories in structure and plot holes

       I agree, this is not a conspiracy at all. But it is certainly interesting given the current moral panic over Elsagate. It reminds me of the Satanic Panic of the 80s.

       Old stories exist in the context of those times. Many of which were not serious in nature. Will people, in thousands of years, read our dead baby jokes and presume it in any way reflected the reality of our society?

       Perhaps not, but you can read a hell of a lot from a culture's stories. They are probably the single most important vehicle for understanding a culture. Of course, they should not be taken literally (see: the Bible).

       The problem is that this kind of "useless" information and the ridiculous conclusions that some arrive at from those are now being used to water down the current scandals reveiling while make conversation about this topic more difficult due to the stupidety of argumenting with ancient stories.

       I have been aware for a few years that modern humans have been on earth for 200.000+ years, must have ascended and descended many times, James burke's lectures taughtme that all inventions are really just combining two things that already existed and that the more we communicate the faster connections emerge, eventually an important connection is made and we ascend a little, like finding out that ceramic ovens can make better metals, it took us 1000 years for that connection to be made this time around, may have been made faster on previous cycles,  some of the best videos I have ever seen
