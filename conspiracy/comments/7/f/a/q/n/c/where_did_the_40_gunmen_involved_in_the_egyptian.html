<p>How would you get them from Syria to the Sinai peninsula? Most likely...by water. Air would be too risky regarding detection.</p>

<p>What might you do to distract attention from the Mediterranean sea?</p>

<p>Possible answer - Create a distraction with an Argentinian submarine on the opposite side of globe.</p>

<p>Latest large terrorist attacks...Why Egypt? Why Mogadishu? To justify US troops to secure Gulf of Aden and Mediterranean coastline...(see &quot;Operation Odyssey Lightning)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/pentagon-approves-expeditionary-medal-for-odyssey-lightning-operation-1.477559">https://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/pentagon-approves-expeditionary-medal-for-odyssey-lightning-operation-1.477559</a></p>

<p>Despite denials from the Pentagon, evidence suggests there is a ramping up of operations in Libya and Somalia.</p>

<p>What&#39;s really going on, on the island of Socotra? Is this the new &quot;black site&quot; that Academi is using, compliments of the UAE?</p>

<p>What happened recently regarding Lebanon&#39;s prime minister in Saudi Arabia? What happened recently in Saudi Arabia? </p>

<p>What is the final objective? Iran...</p>

<p>How will it be justified? By blaming the next 9/11 on Hezbollah.</p>

<p>When and where will the next 9/11 occur? Best guess..12/24 at the US Treasury Department Office next to the White House.</p>

<p>More to come...</p>

<p>Edit- When was the last time the Treasury building was remodeled? Who did it? What other buildings is this company involved with?</p>

<p>Who was the first person in charge of the Treasury Department? What was his first day on the job?</p>

<p>Uhm, no, you&#39;d need a closer distraction. The border guards and military in Egypt aren&#39;t going to be distracted by an Argentinian submarine missing. </p>

<p>You also don&#39;t have to ship in Syrian fighters to Egypt when there are already ISIS in Egypt (albeit in the Sinai Peninsula) and Libya is next door (lots of fighters there, and ISIS too). </p>

<p>While I don&#39;t know if ISIS is an American asset, and you could be right on the bigger point of the US using them to cook up a reason to start sending troops in, it&#39;s a real big reach to say an Argentinian submarine is going to distract Egyptian security services.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Distracting satellites as they pass over the Mid East... looking for an Argentinian sub? That still doesn&#39;t make sense, you can use satellites to recon different areas as they orbit. Some geospatial sats are probably constantly directed at the mid-east and  can&#39;t peer near Argentina anyways, but the ones that move, yeah I think they can take more than one picture per flyby. </p>

<p>Make a horizontal list of the numbers 1 thru 9.</p>

<p>Now..not counting the number 2 in the very bottom box next to mosques...count all the yellow numbers in the boxes, (don&#39;t count the small yellow numbers 19,28 at the top of picture) and assign each total above its number in the horizontal list..example...there are a total number of two 1s...place the number 2 over the number 1 of the horizontal list. there are a total of five 2s, so place the number 5 over the 2 in the horizontal list...and so on.</p>

<p>If done correctly a 9 digit number 251032211 should be achieved..</p>

<p>Now drop the first 2 from that number (making it an 8 digit number) and place it above the 9 digit number so that the 5 is above the number 2, the 1 is above the number 5 and so on...you will have a blank space over the number 9 in your original horizontal list.</p>

<p>Now add the two numbers and place the sum &quot;below&quot; the original horizontal list..example: 5+2=7 (the number 7 should be written beneath the number 1, 1+5=6 (the number 6 should be written beneath the number 2..and so on.</p>

<p>5 1 0 3 2 2 1 1
2 5 1 0 3 2 2 1 1
7 6 1 3 5 4 3 2 1</p>

<p>The number 13 that breaks up the countdown sequence will be explained in a post very soon...but for now..</p>

<p>Obviously a pattern emerges. I think this is definitive proof that there is a coded number message in the Infographic..it&#39;s beyond any possible coincidence</p>
