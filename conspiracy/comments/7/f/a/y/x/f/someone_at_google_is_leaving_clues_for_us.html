        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Oldschool r/conspiracy style post here.</p>

<p>To start off do a google image search for chromecast. The chromecast logo is an obvious well known (in the occult conspiracy community) 666 symbol. Everyone can see that clear as day. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.staples-3p.com/s7/is/image/Staples/s0994908_sc7?$splssku$">https://www.staples-3p.com/s7/is/image/Staples/s0994908_sc7?$splssku$</a></p>

<p>Does not mean much by itself though. BUT, if you consider what the symbol is matched with (the word CHROME), you can understand the message.</p>

<p>666 we know will be some type of religious/political mark. What religion possibly??</p>

<p>Ch.rome = Church of Rome</p>

<p>Logo = 666 symbol</p>

<p>So someone at google is trying to warn us that the Church of Rome is the false religion the bible talks about that will enforce its mark on the world.</p>

<p>Just something to think about </p>

<p>Edit: so figured id just make a followup for people who consider that theory to have any merit. So if catholicism could be the false christianity of the bible, what would be the true christianity?</p>

<p>There are many groups of people who look at christian history to find the answer. 
<a href="/r/originalchristianity">/r/originalchristianity</a> has varying sources that can help.</p>

<p>The bible would only describe ministers of righteousness as ministers of God. This verse says the devil inspires people to act as if they are true ministers of God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you know that the very word &#39;catholic&#39; was used by Ignitius of Antioch in the 2nd century already?</p>

<p>Or that the Greek derivative of the word &#39;catholic&#39; (meaning &#39;universal&#39;) is in the Book of Acts (kath olēs)?</p>

<p>Acts 9:31 (Greek Bible), “ai men oun <strong>ekklēsiai kath olēs</strong> tēs ioudaias kai galilaias kai samareias eichon eirēnēn oikodomoumenai kai poreuomenai tō phobō tou kuriou kai tē paraklēsei tou agiou pneumatos eplēthunonto” EKKLESIA KATH’OLES.
The term “Catholic”, derived from the Greek word καθολικός (katholikos), which means “universal” or “general”, was also used to describe the Church in the early 2nd century by Ignatius. The term katholikos is equivalent to καθόλου (katholou), a contraction of the phrase καθ’ ὅλου (kath’ holou) meaning “according to the whole”. Thus the full name Catholic Church roughly means “universal” or “whole” church. END QUOTE</p>

The term “Catholic”, derived from the Greek word καθολικός (katholikos), which means “universal” or “general”, was also used to describe the Church in the early 2nd century. The term katholikos is equivalent to καθόλου (katholou), a contraction of the phrase καθ’ ὅλου (kath’ holou) meaning “according to the whole”.

    <div class="md"><p>Protestants killed other Christians.</p>

<p>Additionally, one person claiming that Catholic Church was not the true Church from the beginning does not make it true.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there is substantial evidence that the Catholic Church is the true Church.  Did you know that the very word &#39;catholic&#39; was used by Ignitius of Antioch in the 2nd century already?</p>

<p>Or that the Greek derivative of the word &#39;catholic&#39; (meaning &#39;universal&#39;) is in the Book of Acts ?-- (so even earlier than Ignatius of Antioch).</p>

<p>Acts 9:31 (Greek Bible), “ai men oun <strong>ekklēsiai kath olēs</strong> tēs ioudaias kai galilaias kai samareias eichon eirēnēn oikodomoumenai kai poreuomenai tō phobō tou kuriou kai tē paraklēsei tou agiou pneumatos eplēthunonto” EKKLESIA KATH’OLES.  EKKLESIA = Church  KATH&#39;OLES = Catholic</p>

<p>The term “Catholic”, derived from the Greek word καθολικός (katholikos), which means “universal” or “general”, was also used to describe the Church in the early 2nd century by Ignatius. The term katholikos is equivalent to καθόλου (katholou), a contraction of the phrase καθ’ ὅλου (kath’ holou) meaning “according to the whole”.

<p>There were groups of christians who did not go around killing people while the catholics were way before the protestants.</p>

<p>You realize the group of people who took the title &quot;catholic&quot; were not ever the only group of christians around.  More than likely the christians who were tortured and martyrd by the cartholics were the actual christians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The French church just announced they are changing the Lord&#39;s Prayer. Instead of do not submit me to temptation, it&#39;s now do not let me succumb to temptation. </p>

<p>I like that. The previous version made God sound evil. And that &quot;evil&quot; version was introduced in the 60s and 70s, when the pope&#39;s Audience Hall was built -- the snake building with the statue of Abaddon.</p>

<p>So maybe we are beginning to undo some of that negativity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, there are a number of different areas of discrepancy - the books of the New Testament record the teachings of Jesus and his apostles, while the Catholic Church describes itself as continuing in the authority of the apostles. The Catholic tradition alters a lot of things, and in the Catholic worldview, these alterations are justified by the authority of the church. You can read up on it if you want, it&#39;s way too much for me to launch into some big thing, but I&#39;m sure there&#39;s all kinds of resources out there if you want to read something.</p>

<p>long story short, if you consider the New Testament to be authoritative, and your objective is truly to pursue God, I promise you, your spiritual development will be guided appropriately, and you will know God by the central role of Jesus. Whereas on the other hand, if your objective is to pursue God, and you consider the Catholic church to be authoritative, you may get lucky and be <em>derailed from your course</em> by the Scriptures - but otherwise, best case scenario, your spiritual development will be guided away from the real meat of the thing, which is Christ, and worst case scenario, you will be encouraged to seek further spiritual development through the avenue of a deeper involvement in the Catholic church, in which case, you will be taught to channel demons and invite possession onto yourself, and you will be told you are communing with angels.</p>

<p>I know that&#39;s a radical thing I just said, but that&#39;s where I&#39;m at with this, and I don&#39;t say it for no reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The earliest manuscripts we&#39;ve discovered of the New Testament texts predate the Catholic church by a few centuries. Modern day Bible translations rely on these early copies of the manuscripts, so there is no interference from the Catholic church. There&#39;s a lot of popular misconception out there about the historicity of Christianity and the Bible&#39;s texts. Wikipedia should set you straight though if you want to look into it.</p>

<p>As far as &quot;Protestant Christianity&quot; and any &quot;power structure,&quot; I don&#39;t really need to rely on any of it in particular, although I&#39;m sure various believers have various legitimate pieces of the puzzle. It is good for believers to help each other, and it is good that we support one another in the ways we are expected to support one another, and in some cases that might include correcting one another&#39;s doctrine or holding each other accountable to a proper standard of behavior - but at the same time, to believe in Christ and correctly seek the good is largely an individual endeavor, so I don&#39;t need the approval of any church in particular to do it, and neither do you. We already have a sufficient rendition of the words of Jesus and his apostles, and they are extremely comprehensive. You might go wrong if you put your trust in this or that Christian authority all willy nilly, but if you keep yourself equipped with the source material, you yourself will be in a position to judge rightly, and you will be able to keep yourself from being deceived.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>The text of Revelations 18:11-13
11 And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:</p>

<p>12 The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,</p>

<p>13 And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.</p>

<p>It can&#39;t be Rome, based on the importance of commerce.  If Rome was destroyed it would have little effect on the world economy.  If New York was destroyed, well, that would be devastating.  </p>

<p>I am going to copy and paste a response i gave to someone else here to answer your question.</p>

<p>Deut12:31</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You must not worship the LORD your God in their way, because in worshiping their gods, they do all kinds of detestable things the LORD hates. They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire as sacrifices to their gods.
See that you do all I command you; do not add to it or take away from it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It specifically says you cannot worship the true God in ways pagans worshiped their gods. The practice is specifically condemned.</p>

<p>Does not matter if your intentions are good. It simply says not to do it.</p>

<p>Also the catholic church killed other christians... That was not something Jesus told his followers to do... You can look up Quartodeciman controversy and how if you followed this bible verse -</p>

<p>Lev23:5</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD&#39;S passover</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You would be killed. If you simply wanted to celebrate the christian passover the way Jesus did with his disciples, the catholic church wanted you to be murdered for &quot;heresy&quot;. Among the many other evils it did. Just look up how in the 1600s they massacred a group of christians called the waldensians.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldensians">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldensians</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1487, Pope Innocent VIII issued a bull for the extermination of the Vaudois.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Massacre of Mérindol (1545)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Duke&#39;s forces did not simply slaughter the inhabitants. They are reported to have unleashed an unprovoked campaign of looting, rape, torture, and murder. According to one report by a Peter Liegé:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The duke of savoy was a catholic general following the popes orders to kill people as recent as the 1600s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I question is 666.  It&#39;s not the three numbers.  The scripture says six hundred threescore and six.  Based on the scripture its an actual number and has meaning as a single number.  Not 3 6&#39;s together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe jesus was a guy who travelled East and learned of true spiritual practice, then when he brought it back and taught of the true nature of reality (that we are God, that this reality is temporal, etc) the Roman empire didn&#39;t like that as it opened up people&#39;s minds so they didn&#39;t mindlessly obey the empire. So they killed him, killed all his followers of the time, and then rewrote the bible in a way that discredits anything he really did and subverts further readers to live in the way they instruct. Not true freedom, which is what jesus was about. To be liberated from oppression. Christianity at the time of jesus was probably a lot closer to Hinduism/Buddhism/jainism than what it is today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn’t that what the New Testament is all about ?
Jesus wrestles back and reestablishes the concept of God as a loving, all providing, benevolent force, while simultaneously destroying the angry god motif, that uses the temple to ritualize blood sacrifice for the “atonement of sin”. He turns the whole Old Testament on its ear, and fundamentally changes old world Jewish tradition forever.</p>

<p>The old sacrificial system is what was fulfilled. We are no longer to do animal sacrifices. We also do not enforce the death penalty because Jesus died to remove that. </p>
