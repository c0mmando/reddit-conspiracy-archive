<p>With the amount of data uploaded onto not only YouTube but many other platforms and servers, humans will only be able to do so much so algorithms not only to check tags but using visual recognition to weed out those that are suspect.</p>

<p>For now though, probably best to stick to the old Tom &amp; Jerry cartoons. Lots of slapstick violence in those but were never suggestive.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen some interesting comments on youtube as well. It&#39;s kind of ironic in a way. How so?</p>

<p>The people making these comments only feel safe to do so because they feel anonymous. But  comments like these are one of the biggest reasons we&#39;re seeing a push for internet ID.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I heard yesterday about this on bbc radio, they seem to be talking more about comments on videos of young youtubers. They went on to mention that reporting tools apparently haven’t worked properly in around a year (They could see the video reported, but not the comment). </p>

<p>To me, it sounds like they’re trying to pre-emptively confuse the issue by having something slightly less creepy to talk about that “Elsagate” will get lumped into as being a part of. “Have you heard about these pedos on YouTube?”. All they have to do now is make it look like they’re trying to do something about the comments, and people will assume they are trying to prevent weird videos too...</p>

<p>I don’t like the BBC as a company; I don’t trust them as a company. Always do more research on anything they report. I’ve heard news stories with half truths and inaccuracies. They are supposed to be impartial, but they have an agenda and pretty much everything is twisted to fit what they want. Wouldn’t to say to the same levels as CNN or Fox, but I know too many people who just implicitly trust them no matter what. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree, this wasn&#39;t directly about the &quot;elsagate&quot; kids videos but rather the commentators on normal videos who make pedo comments &quot;out in the open&quot;. They once again blamed the algorithm and ended by saying something like &quot;well there are so many videos, we can&#39;t police them all&quot;.</p>

<p>The &quot;algorithm&quot; excuse can be easily refuted if you research &quot;Project Owl&quot; YouTube&#39;s (Google&#39;s) project to combat &quot;fake news&quot;. </p>

<p>What was worrying was that they didn&#39;t mention the elsagate videos at all, which was quite strange considering how current the issue is.</p>

<p>Multiple threads every week.</p>

<p>YouTube have known for a lot longer than us.</p>

<p>They ignored us and mocked us with the usual conspiracy theorists bullshit for months.</p>

<p>I ask how many children have been abused since this was known about?</p>

<p>How many children have been exposed to this sick shit ?</p>

<p>When did YouTube first realise this was going on and why were no steps taken at that time?</p>

<p>If YouTube is directly responsible for one child being abused then they should be shut down.</p>
