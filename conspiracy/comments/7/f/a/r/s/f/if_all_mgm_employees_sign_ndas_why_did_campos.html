       I see your point.  I would say the single shooter theory would be their story, very lacking in detail as you pointed out, but they've definitely tried to get the multiple shooter theory under wraps.

       I wouldn't argue that, hard to say really. I could see people confused in Laos and really believing there were more than one when there wasn't. Could be planned misdirection. But MSM nipped it in the bud ASAP best they could.

      <p>
       There is no "allow" for this issue. The police can't restrict a person who is not charged with something just because, that runs into a problem due to the bill of rights. The "Don't leave town!" line is near meaningless outside of just simple intimidation if you are not charged with anything. It's why some high profile murder suspects in the past just get fallowed 24/7 vs just held or house arrest. Being the police are not legally allowed to do that with out charges.
      </p>
      <p>
       as for the NDA stuff, do we have any links or info about that? First I've heard of it really. I think the reason we don't see more MGM like info is people just want to keep their jobs and I suspect the feds and MGM management locked up the vid of anything Paddock related. Feds to stop leaks, MGM to stop leaks and help PR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a guess here but I figure Campos spoke being he was getting paid in some way. You could tell in the interview he is terrible at public speaking at any level, never mind possibly millions of people. He wants that reward, so he buckles down and plows past the interview.  It was still terrible as I suspected it would be, much like every interview with a Joe Average who makes news.

       I guess in light of the hotel biz and location that would make sense. High rollers would not want to their wins/loses or whatever talked about by others.  As for the other employees not talking etc, I'm guessing it's lack of media going after them? I would of thought MGM would of done some sort of 60min/dateline/whatever story with management trying to say how normally blah blah blah "Don't worry, please still come to Vegas!" etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Figure that high $$$$$ level PR firm MGM hired shot that down as a terrible idea, as in why I guess I don't work for a high end PR firm.

       There is no "allow" for this issue. The police can't restrict a person who is not charged with something just because, that runs into a problem due to the bill of rights. The "Don't leave town!" line is near meaningless outside of just simple intimidation if you are not charged with anything. It's why some high profile murder suspects in the past just get fallowed 24/7 vs just held or house arrest. Being the police are not legally allowed to do that with out charges.

       as for the NDA stuff, do we have any links or info about that? First I've heard of it really. I think the reason we don't see more MGM like info is people just want to keep their jobs and I suspect the feds and MGM management locked up the vid of anything Paddock related. Feds to stop leaks, MGM to stop leaks and help PR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a guess here but I figure Campos spoke being he was getting paid in some way. You could tell in the interview he is terrible at public speaking at any level, never mind possibly millions of people. He wants that reward, so he buckles down and plows past the interview.  It was still terrible as I suspected it would be, much like every interview with a Joe Average who makes news.
