    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. He&#39;s the closest thing to Ron Paul left in politics, calling out the banks/Fed/CEOs for their bullshit. Obviously his social views are different, but Sanders alone has come the closest to flushing out cockroaches in DC, and seems to be the only one who wants to.</p>

<p>Had he not had his candidacy ripped out from under him with election rigging and a media blackout, Sanders would be president right now. He didn&#39;t take a dive, he had states like New York, Arizona, and Nevada literally cheated away from him until Hillary&#39;s lead was insurmountable.</p>

<p>Honestly, I feel like most Trumpers who voted on &quot;draining the swamp&quot; should switch to Bernie since it&#39;s clear that&#39;s not what Trump is doing at all.</p>

<p>Its nuts if you think people who believed in that platform would turn tail and vote D/R.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why people think he sold out when it eventually reached a point where it was no longer possible for him to win, and he held out until the convention where he made one last pitch to superdelegates telling them not to vote for the candidate under FBI investigation. They didn&#39;t listen, and kept a very damaged Hillary in the race, who of course lost.</p>

<p>If anything, it will be Bernie and a much younger VP without as much name recognition, but the same policies, to take over as heir apparent; probably Tulsi Gabbard or Nina Turner.</p>

<p>The true boogeyman is &#39;shills&#39;. You have no proof that shills are dictating the conversation, and honestly it makes no sense for shills to be on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, since it&#39;s already dominated by one side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, that&#39;s not it.  </p>

<p>There is something driving this wave of discontent with Bernie though; something that is, paradoxically, both wholly organic and inorganic at the same time.  </p>

<p>Sadly, I&#39;m afraid none of you will ever know who is responsible because it&#39;s fallout of a war you don&#39;t even know is being waged, nevermind who and/or what is on each side.</p>

<p>Enjoy the show, my conspiracy minded friends, shit-winds are a blowin&#39; </p>
