       Go to the 1:35 mark in the video in the above Tweet. Trump is addressing the Coast Guard and talking about selling weapons to foreign countries. He says we don't even sell our best equipment to allies because you never know when an ally can turn against you, as we'll see very soon. That's a pretty bold statement, and I'm curious what he means by it. Any guesses on which ally he is referring to?

       I mean the saudis who had the weapon deal from under obama go through? And are tied to everything as much as big bad Israel as everyone here likes to claim.

       I think trump got the saudis under control, Israel maby.  I dont think he like Benjamin, and he is in hot water these days. Or maby Fiji. You know, because Q anon said look for clues, and he then he drank from that water bottle a week ago in a wierd way, positioning his hands just so everyone could notice the Fiji logo, and Fiji is a major player in human trafficking. That my best, but yours could be just as right

       I'm not saying they will. As I stated, I was casting a wide net. They are one of the largest US arms importers and there are problems in the relationship, and the north korea issue could strain things depending how things go. My finger was pointing more at the Phillipines, anyway

       I don't get it?  It's OK to fantasize that Trump is dropping hints about Hillary with absolutely no evidence at all but if you point out that the FBI is no longer sharing information about the Flynn situation with the White House which is indicative of Flynn now cooperating with the FBI regarding the larger Russia investigation that is "fantasy"?  Amazing how touchy you partisan hacks are.

       It sort of seemed like he was saying that war is make believe and we won't be doing that as much anymore, but dont worry, we'll still make sure you guys are ok 401k-wise. Then, of course, Frito-lay gets a product placement shot, because the food companies are going to be furious if we stop funding war.

       But Turkey is the nation with the second biggest army in the NATO, right after the US. And American nukes are stationed in Turkey, I don‘t really think that Turkey will just turn against the US, they are just playing on both sides for now. Btw didn‘t Trump like Erdogan?

       Good catch. Israel, which I think is creating their own weapons. Could turn on us, or rather, we could turn on them. Saudi, which has no reason to not be a ally to us. And then China, which we don't sell stuff to but we are ally's. Their is some weird CIA/North Korea/ china ally thing that I think is what he is talking about. He said our stuff is always a little bit better, that's a interesting thing to say. I wonder how much more advanced our tech is than that of other counties or if we even have a advantage

       Sadly I dont think its anything.  he was talking to a kid in the video.  In one part he says, the economy's never been better, he chuckles and gestures presumably to a kid and says "in your whole long life the stock market is higher than its ever been".  he smiles and pointed down low, I think to where a kid is.  So later on with that statement about allies turning, he looks at the same kids and smiles and says "you will find out soon enough".  Meaning that kid as they grow up will realize allies turn on you.

       Ah yeah, I see r/conspiracy is still run by r/The_Donald.  Trump doesn't give a shit about you, and will destroy everything you hold dear.  Net neutrality will end.  The tax plan will pass, enriching the mega-rich while raising your taxes, in addition to ending health insurance for 13m which will sharply increase your premiums, and opening ANWR for oil drilling, stepping on the gas pedal of climate change.  A financial collapse from the bubbles of student loans, real estate, and a record-low holiday spending season, will come early next year.  There will be even larger bailouts compared to 2008, and unemployment will shoot up to 20-25%.  "You'll see soon enough."

       Even according to your Orange King's own tweets the unemployment rate "will drop under 4% (in 2018)"... so how would we drop 16 points in less than a year if your number is the "REAL" unemployment rate?

       The numbers were cooked under Obama, they continue to be cooked under Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       By definition, unemployment numbers don't include people who've stopped looking for work after their benefit runs out. It also doesn't include underemployed people. If the definition included everyone of employable age who are capable of full time work that aren't working full time, it would vastly exceed 4%.

       How old are you that you have any bit of trust left in government, particularly the US federal government?

      <p>
       I don't buy into pizzagate, though I do believe that the CIA is involved in human trafficking. 9/11 was used to falsely justify the invasion of Iraq, so yes, I guess I do consider it a kind of false flag. Sandy Hook happened, but was instantly politicized (never let a crisis go to waste) to try to further the gun control agenda.

       Again, this isn't about Trump alone. The jobs numbers have been cooked for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's about inflating the citizenry's collective ego, or confidence. That "financial crisis" back in '07? Complete recovery on the jobs front. Everything is fine, continue to consume, citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line is, after a certain percentage, that unemployment figure becomes politically untenable. People start demanding change, and that's the last thing any politician wants. Plenty of motivation for a government to fudge their job stats.

       Oh good lord. Trump's mouth is intended to get people talking, which creates the thing he speaks. His issue is the allies that don't like... him. Those usually still like (feel sorry for) us, the people. But our president is not of the people.

       Tell me this: which President hasn’t been rich, self-centered, manipulative,  etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don’t like him because you need someone to hate. You don’t like those of us who voted for him simply because we don’t think like you.  And you think ALL 40 million of us that voted “Trump” on the ballot actually voted for the man. Everyone I know that voted for him voted strictly because it was a giant FUCK YOU to a system that has branded us white men as racist, intolerant, homo-phobic, deplorable people whose concerns and problems are not considered legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, fuck that. We’re tired of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now you’re all wallowing in shit. Just like we were when we were told we had to invade Iraq because of WMDs, told we could keep our doctor, told we were NOT to show pride in our country because it might upset those who have been allowed to invade our land.
      </p>
      <p>
       No sir. You get to wallow in the same shit of dismay, disappointment, and angst that I’ve been drowning in since the end of the Reagan era.
      </p>
      <p>
       Petty? Yup. But I’ll be damned if I was going to vote for another fucking Clinton.

       Nope, that's not good enough. If you wanted a big fuck you to the system, you'd put someone in there that's qualified to break it down. That person is not trump. By a long shot. All it did was convince the thinking, rational rest of the world that lunatics, racists, rapists, inbreds and retarded idiots had a shot at the platform and couldn't do anything more than turn it into a college beer party...so it will be taken away very soon and the crackpots won't get another shot now that everyone knows you're all incompetent hate fueled lunatics.

       I think he means one of two things. (Possibly both) 
Seemed to be a young person he was speaking to earlier in the video, when he mentioned the "best stock market of your entire life" as it's the highest in the last 17-18 years or whatever (I say this because in each response directed to the younger person trump seemed like he looked directly at them.) However he could also be dropping some hints, maybe referencing China and NK, Trumps pushing for more and more sanctions on NK and maybe one of those deals with china included them doing the same. Time will tell..

       Britain is potentially the biggest threat.  Brits actually do have a pair of balls between their legs, and have good common sense.  All the intelligent white Brits can see their country is being sold off to the dogs and they only need to sit down for one minute of logical thinking to decide that they must leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       White flight from Britain is a very real thing.  Whilst the Government allow 6 to 700,000 mostly Muslim immigrants in each year, roughly 300,000 white Brits sell up and leave.  This has been going on for over a decade now.  If you go to the UK the 'brain drain' is starkly obvious.

       The people you talk to now will mostly be devoid of any logical, free thought.  They will just quote what they have been told to say by the BBC.  "Whites are racist, our history is all false, Muslims must be supported".  Or they are absolutely clued up but lack the money to gtfo.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the current rate, Britain will be majority Muslim in just twenty years.  Then what do you think will happen?  Do white Brits seriously think these Muslims will defend white, non-Muslims?  Of course not, they will kill you.  It's your own children/grandchildren who will die and then Britain will be 100% Muslim and also become the strongest nuclear force within Islam.  Muslims are already joining the British Army and Police force - not to help the Brits, but because they know they'll be taking over soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't worry about the Royals, or your history, it'll all be wiped out soon enough.  Your wonderful British elites are wiping themselves out, committing suicide if you like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?  Because they are all in occult secret societies.  You do know this don't you?  In these occult societies the idea of dualism is for the ignorant, the profane.  There is no right or wrong!  Everything is a magical ritual.  The most important magical ritual is the ritual that all of nature performs every year.  That of death and rebirth.  They are sacrificing everything!  Including themselves!  There is no dualism!  Everything is a ritual!  Wake the fuck up!

       Turkey ? Possibly ADhabi or Israel. About 5 yrs ago, A UAE C-130 landed in India for fueling on its way to western China. Flight manifest wasn’t correct so Indian authorities searched the plane and discovered US and French supplied advanced anti-ship missiles. In the 80’s the US discovered Israel had been reselling US supplied TOT a/t and Hawk SAM to Iran in exchange for emigration of Iranian Jews.

       I'm not saying they will. As I stated, I was casting a wide net. They are one of the largest US arms importers and there are problems in the relationship, and the north korea issue could strain things depending how things go. My finger was pointing more at the Phillipines, anyway

       Again, this isn't about Trump alone. The jobs numbers have been cooked for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's about inflating the citizenry's collective ego, or confidence. That "financial crisis" back in '07? Complete recovery on the jobs front. Everything is fine, continue to consume, citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line is, after a certain percentage, that unemployment figure becomes politically untenable. People start demanding change, and that's the last thing any politician wants. Plenty of motivation for a government to fudge their job stats.
