<p>He says the left foot had to compensate too much so he switched to give it a break. I don&#39;t know what the actual story is here, but I&#39;m not buying this explanation. The whole thing is very odd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it sounds like he has a tear because of the cancer treatment so if he was wearing a boot on one foot to help heal the other and then the other tendon got overworked because of the boot and the other healed enough why wouldn’t he switch feet?  </p>

<p>I’m not a medical expert but it seems to make sense in a logical  way. He hurt one side, probably the way he walks is harder on that side, but then the extra strain of walking with the boot hurt the other side. </p>

<p>So it’s not like he had a major injury and was wearing the boot. He has a side effect of his cancer treatment which weakened the tendon and now the other side is suffering from being over exerted.  </p>

<p>I dunno it makes sense to me. Maybe I’m just more sensible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Explain to me how that logically doesn’t make sense?  He’s going through cancer treatment which one of the effects of said treatment is the weakening of the tendon. So with that knowledge one can assume both sides would suffer from the weakening right?  </p>

So, an 81 year old man partially tears his achilles tendon, and can walk on it without a boot 17 days later, but wears the same boot on his other foot because he compensated too much to one side and weakened the other side in those 17 days?

<p>Not believable, because it&#39;s been only 2 weeks since the initial injury and he would not be able to walk on that foot. If he overcompensated and injured his other foot, he&#39;d be in a wheelchair because now both legs are injured. It hasn&#39;t been long enough for the Achilles injury to heal.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense to move a boot from an injured foot to an uninjured one AND leave the uninjured one (even if it&#39;s recently healed) unprotected. This would just damage the recently healed foot again. So, no this does not make sense. We can cross it from the list.</p>

<p>I’m saying you have to look at things logically and decide which makes more sense. It’s hard to keep secrets even in a small group of friends so keeping these huge secrets between hundreds and thousands of people just seem improbable.

<p>Ok, so sticking the boot on the other foot was stupid then?</p>

<p>So let&#39;s say he had a &quot;senior moment&quot; and stuck the boot on the other foot. Are you saying that none of his aides, assistants, or doctors would have corrected this stupid move that very same day? Or are we to believe McCain is entirely responsible for his own medical care with no supervision from any medical professionals?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>McCain switching it on his own is not very plausible because someone assisting him would have corrected it long before a public appearance or official statement was made. A doctor switching it is not very plausible because it doesn&#39;t make any kind of medical sense. (He&#39;s walking on a recently injured foot that&#39;s being subjected to the same stresses that supposedly injured his healthy foot.)</p>

<p>Why would an alleged monitor switch ankles? Chaffing and skin infection from the ankle strap required a relocation - or whoever is handling him just wanted to fuck with his cover story.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t know. My only point is that McCain switching booted feet does not make sense within the context of his official statement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m so sick of this stupid ankle monitor theory. No one... I mean no one... has any reason or evidence they can point to that he is wearing one. He is wearing a damn medical boot and someone somewhere decided to say he was wearing an ankle monitor and then everyone just jumped on that pumpkin ride. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve asked people to legitmately give me a reason why they think he is wearing one and I get nothing but &quot;but he has a boot thingy on&quot;. No one can provide a motive for him to be wrapped in one but so many love to theorize about him having one. </p>

<p>Can someone give me one straight up reason why he would have this and back it up with just one fact? Just one... that&#39;s all I&#39;m asking for at this point.</p>

<p>Nah, that would be stupid. The entire point of coded communication is to be inconspicuous, and changing the foot you&#39;ve got your temporary medical brace on is anything but inconspicuous. </p>

<p>Wearing a certain colour of shirt or something is a good example of coded communication. Anything that requires you to do something outside of the norm is not. </p>

And how does having the boot on the left foot help it with compensating? Just rest, or go around in a wheelchair. Makes no sense at all. very weird. But could be nothing. Can&#39;t imagine really what it could be. Unless this whole boot wearing thing is some way of communicating something secretly to others. Like &#39;boot on right foot means this&#39; or &#39;boot on left foot means that&#39; or something.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why not just have a boot put on each foot if they are both hurting?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because if you had boots on both feet you would have more difficulty with balance and risk falling further injuring yourself. A wheelchair works for the early part of recovery but you can&#39;t just sit in it forever. Sooner or later you have to get on your feet so they can start working up to handling the strength of your body and normal walking again.</p>

<p>People are really grasping at straws in this thread. The dude is old as fuck and is on his way out the door. I mean seriously... he made himself a laughing stock with Palin and he has one foot in the grave and another on a bannana peel. He has been pushed aside to the margins. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he was dead in 2 years.</p>

<p>Look, this point I can understand. His opposite foot probably did have to compensate too much and was overworked. Perfectly reasonable, logical sense.</p>

<p>But think about this. </p>

<p>By switching the boot, it means that NOW his recently RUPTURED ACHILLES TENDON of an 81 year old cancer patient is the foot that must do the overcompensation.</p>

<p>What in the everloving fuck? This can be a career-ending injury for a 28 year old NFL athlete.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey doc my other legs getting worked pretty badly what do we do?&quot;</p>

<p>I also read that the tendon is not fully ruptured. It is a minor tear. Minor to moderate Achilles tendon injuries should heal on their own but maybe because of his age and condition he needs to use boot to save his legs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i had a broken ankle and switching the cast would never have been something i did, taking it off sure, but immobilizing the working foot and then forcing the other ankle to flex would be the stupidest fucking idea ever.</p>

<p>The boot keeps the injured ankle from rolling or flexing (or foot or whatever) thats why you wear it on that foot. So if you have a real injury and you switched it that would guarantee that while moving the injured leg would be making movements it shouldnt be and cause great pain and further damage.</p>

<p>all that being said johnny rocket is pretty fucking stupid.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the same thing but I broke my back and have to walk with a cane. I definitely have a predominate side (<em>my right</em>) that I lean heavily on when walking with my cane.

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea why the boot switched sides, but the latest photo was taken at his daughter’s wedding. He probably walked his daughter down the aisle to give her away, and the father always walks on the left side of the bride. It’s a lot easier to manage a boot on the left, or outside, leg in this situation.</p>

<p>Just imagine a bulky boot on the right leg while escorting a bride down the aisle....it could be quite problematic. </p>

<p>Every parent hopes their daughter’s wedding will be as perfect as possible, so it’s nice that his health condition allowed him to accommodate for this.</p>

<p>I broke my ankle almost a year ago now (really, really badly, spent 5 weeks in the hospital) and had the pleasure of being stuck in one of these things for 12 weeks after the plaster came off... there is no damn reason whatsoever to be putting this thing onto the non-injured leg. NONE. A moon boot is a brace that stops movement of the ankle joint completely and provides support to the rest of the injured leg, whilst allowing the pt to safely put some weight onto the limb. I&#39;ve never seen anyone with less than a fracture use one of these (and I am an ex nurse/paramedic/firey), also where are his crutches? He&#39;s 100% faking this crap.</p>
