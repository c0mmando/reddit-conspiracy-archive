<p>Why am I saying this? Although I deny the holocaust (WWII allied propaganda), I cannot stand folks who demonize all Jewish people.  &quot;THE JEWS DID IT!&quot; Prove it. Prove that WWI and WWII were committed by God fearing, Shabbat keeping Jews. </p>

<p>Unless you can equate Zionism to Judaism, you shouldn&#39;t be blaming Jewish people for the mess we find ourselves in. </p>

<p>I believe part of Zionism&#39;s success is appearing to be one and the same as Judaism.  </p>

<p>People see acts of Zionism and attribute them to Judaism. Your hate for Zionism is now a hate for true monotheism, as Judaism is defined.  </p>

<p>Speaking of mountains....how much ash is produced from the burning of ~6 million people? Mountains? How much time does the burning process take for burning an average adult? Explain the process for me, in a logical, easy to understand manner. </p>

<p>Also, Why are there no traces of Zyklon B found in main, alleged gas chambers, yet it is only found in small gas chambers used to disinfect inmate clothing (as the Germans documented the spread of typhus)?</p>

<p>I like that point of view. Very much true; however, when it comes to &#39;The Holocaust&#39;, one must get definite answers to certain questions. For example, did Germans stuff millions of Jews into gas chambers, gas them, and set them all on fire via ovens? Did Germans make soap and lamps out of Jews? Yes or No? There is no middle. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Holohoax&quot; is just as much a hoax as the narrative story.</p>

<p>Not sure if I understand your point. Holohoax implies Holocaust narrative is false. Why is that a hoax? Elaborate. </p>

<p>Concentration camps existed, and do exist; however, they were never used to make soap out of Jews. Neither were they used to gas/burn them to ashes. Concentration camps were designed where inmates (potential enemies of the state) would work for their freedom, in times of war. Nothing more, nothing less. The majority of deaths within these camps were due to Typhus, starvation due to allied bombing (near end of war), and natural deaths of course. Having said that, I would imagine Nazi officers took their anger out on a Jew here and there (perhaps even killed some intentionally out of spite). There are documents stating the consequences for such Nazi officers who took it in their own hand to punish inmates. It was not allowed. National Socialist Germans were not evil people. </p>

I absolutely will, but i do have one more question i wanna ask, just about zyklon B (or whatever the chemical was) and why it was.... i suppose found at the camps? Or generally why it exists if not used for killing. 
I suppose i just answered my own question, it was probably used as a bio weapon huh? Like mustard gas</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not OP but I can get this one. Zyklon B was the preferred pesticide for treating lice and fleas. I have even seen examples of pre-WW2 advertisements for Zyklon B being used in delousing chambers (which look suspiciously similar to the &quot;gas chambers&quot; found in some concentration camps.)</p>

<p>Delousing was important because lice and fleas are a vector for typhoid fever, a deadly disease that can easily spread in close quarters, especially among people living in substandard conditions.</p>

<p>In fact, many of the pictures of the dead we have seen in the concentration camps display the symptoms of typhoid fever, and a lot of evidence points to these deaths being caused by that and malnutrition due to German supply lines being destroyed by Allied bombing.</p>

<p>Oh, and the 6 million figure is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dda-0Q_XUhk&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">almost certainly inaccurate.</a> </p>

<p>Jewish prophecies in the Torah require that 6 million Jews must &quot;vanish&quot; before the state of Israel can be formed. &quot;You shall return minus 6 million.&quot; That&#39;s why Tom Segev, an Israeli historian, declared that the &quot;6 million&quot; is an attempt to transform the Holocaust story into state religion. Those six million, according to prophecy, had to disappear in &quot;burning ovens&quot;, which the judicial version of the Holocaust now authenticates. As a matter of fact, Robert B. Goldmann writes: &quot;. . . without the Holocaust, there would be no Jewish State.&quot; A simple consequence: Given six million Jews gassed at Auschwitz who ended up in the &quot;burning ovens&quot; (the Greek word holocaust means burned offerings), therefore, the prophecies have now been &quot;fulfilled&quot; and Israel can become a &quot;legitimate state&quot;. </p>

<p>I would like to see a poll or something more tangible prior to accepting it as truth; however, I can see why most Jews would want to be Zionists. I would also not be surprised if you were accurate. After all, they&#39;ve got Christians brainwashed enough to join in droves...so why not Jews?
