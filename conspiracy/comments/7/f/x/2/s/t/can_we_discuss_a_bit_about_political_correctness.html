       Political correctness is not about being correct or speaking up with respect, it is only about silencing people, perpetuate a state of self censorship, stop people from talking about subject that do matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       To give you an example.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you even dared to say "Refugess in Europe are violent people, they rape women and children and they have openly admitedly their desires to take over Europe", you would be labelled a bigot, a racist, islamophobe.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you dared to criticize the official narrative about 9/11, or the Las Vegas shooting, or JFK assassination, then you are a "Conspiracy nut", a "Conspiracy Theorist", a "truther".
      </p>
      <p>
       If you dared to say "Jews run Hollywood, the main stream media, the banks, and the Government".. we all know it, you would be an "anti-semite", a "racist", a "NAZI".
      </p>
      <p>
       This is weaponization of language, make something unquestonable even if it is absurd and an outright lie, by stamping a label on anyone who dare to criticize that thing, then people become afraid to criticize that thing. They censor themselves by avoiding talking about the 600 pound gorilla in the room.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there are a lot more examples of weaponization of language, but i couldn't remember them all. Feel free to add your own example.

       If TPTB can convince the majority into believing a narrative then the minority will be labeled crazy for doubting it. The trick is that the minority will either actually go crazy or at the least appear crazier the harder they try to convince the majority they are right or they will give up. It's a win/win for TPTB.

       Political correctness is a tool of critical theory (cultural Marxism) designed to break down traditional culture. Political correctness is not about being nice. It's about policing how people talk.

       Some dolt tried to pull this shit on me yesterday too. I said something to the effect of "feminists think women can do no wrong" and at the end, in order for my statement to ring true for this person, it boiled down to:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         I needed to prove this by citing 51% of feminists saying this outright.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I needed to resurrect the dead who began modern feminism and have them say it.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       That's the trick. Unless it's documented somewhere in a peer reviewed liberal biased scientific report, then anyone who contradicts their idea of a subject is magically moved outside of the spectrum. "Well that wasn't a TRUE feminist" you'll hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing happening here nobody is suggesting all refugees are violent lawbreakers. Anyone with a speck of critical thinking can see that. Yet this guy is doing exactly what you're discussing... weaponizing your speech in a way by twisting your words. Thing's you've NEVER said, now being used to prove you're a bigot.

       Valid point, but the sample size of white people is much larger. Saying "whites in America are racist" is still off. Saying "whites are racist in a specific part Virginia where we have numbers showing there are the most white on black crime" is probably accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       So OPs example was "Refugees in Europe are violent people, they rape women and children and they have openly admitedly their desires to take over Europe". Now one could probably find many many articles supporting this groom the last 16 months alone. Is it really necessary to be reductive for the sake of being reductive and pretend it's a racist comment?
      </p>
      <p>
       The sample of refugees is smaller, so any crimes are highlighted. If you have 10,000 refugees and 1,300 have been convicted of a violent crime, that's a lot more interesting than saying there's 4,000 KKK members out of the 230,000,000 white people in America.

       And it's not even true. The pawns who go to your local synagogue every Saturday are just that, brainwashed pawns. And it's the zionists who have the overt power. That's not to mention the other figureheads. If you're a Christian for instance, ultimately you are a pawn of the Vatican, even though chances are, you're Protestant and don't even realize you are their pawn, and may even see them as an enemy.

       <em>

       All refugees in Europe are violent and raping women? If you think that, it is pretty racist. Indian people run 711. So what if lots of jewish people get jobs in Hollywood. Christians run Congress and the white house. Men account for over 95% of murders. Should we do something about men? Why are white people so hopelessly addicted to opioids. Are they all drug addicts?
