       Everything is backwards.  First world should mean we do our best to provide the best of the best when possible.....but our primitive and foolish notions of health and freedom for all does not compute with the religion of business.  The bottom line is more important than people.  A bunch of digits on screens some place determines who gets what.  Like the universe cares how many digits are in my account, as if that determines our worth.

       It's a business.....the business of keeping things how they are no matter what.  Fuck, its a cherry ride for the people who owns/operates world banks, currencies and the like.  They don't want things to even out.  Balance is bullshit to them.

       I do mate. I cook for thousands upon thousands of people every year. To be able to put together a truly honest meal is getting harder and harder. You must make from scratch and thoroughly research your sources of raw ingredients. This of course includes water.

       Exactly mate. I'm a Le cordon bleu qualified chef. I preach about the water I get to use here. Nz. It's getting worse though. Industrial farming and these big water bottling corporate giants isn't helping. And it's not just fast food. Healthy food has glyphosate in it and so do we? I think that is the other big problem. They feed us food laced with weed killer, it gives us cancers, and sugar loves cancer. So unhuman.

       The "unavoidable" aspect applies to almost all food and consumables I think.

       I guess the only way to get around it is to use distilled/DI/RO water and grow your own food with known pure plant seeds.

       Nope, twilight is garbage. You might have a stock version, I have "blue light filter" on my S8 for example. Otherwise root and get cf.lumen. You should be rooted and on LineageOS with microg anyway but not everyone knows to look for ROM compatibility when buying phones (in my case my 6P broke and there was nothing else with a headphone jack).

       I eat a decent amount. Always have. If cigs were apart of my daily life or even soda I’d probably be severely overweight. How I do not partake in those and i can wake up and not feel like shit while still keeping a bigger mass.

       Not me, but I am in a tiny minority in America. I am pretty sure people are more mindful of the dangers of fast food now than they were 5 or 10 years ago. It takes a long time to turn a boat this big, but I think there is some progress at the personal level, if not the legislative.

       I agree that more people know of the consequences to some degree, but I would bet that the people eating fast food regularly has increased over the last 5-10 years. (if anyone has any statistics on that, that would be great)

       Yeah, we need some stats here. I would genuinely like to know if we are just witnessing the spread of more useless "awareness" or if behavior is actually changing. Or if numbers are just pushing around a bit. Like one group is eating it much less than in the past, but another group picked up their slack. Things like that.

       Not fast food, but I️ saw recently that bottled water was the most bought bottled beverage in 2017, for the first time in a long time, decades even, if I️ remember correctly. Idk the trends in fast food but the general public seems to be shifting away from consuming things that are terrible for your health.

       Hmmm that’s a great point i didn’t even consider. Awareness of the horrible things in tap water has spread recently, could very well be the case. im sure an in depth analysis of the statistics at hand could shine more light on the ins and outs of it all, but im on mobile and its 4 a.m here so ima be lazy and learn more about this topic tomorrow.

       I just posted a straight fact and got downvoted? That’s weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercially available plastic water bottles became a thing in the 1940s. However, the material was not cost effective until the early 1960s when high-density polyethylene was developed and introduced to the public. I️t was at this time that bottled water became common.
      </p>
      <p>
       My Grandfather has worked as a supervisor in a bottling plant for Nestle for as long as I️ can remember (I️ hate Nestle as a company, just pointing out that they’ve been bottling water for a long time.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I️ said bottled water became the most popular water for the first time in decades, you came out and stated something that was false by saying bottled water hasn’t existed for decades. You just haaad to correct me over something that was hardly relevant to my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, I’ve personally been alive for “decades” and bottled water was not just invented during my lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re sayin shit that is wrong, and calling me dishonest? That doesn’t make any sense dude/lady. Even if bottled water came out only exactly 20 years ago in 1997, that’d still be “decades” which would still make my first statement accurate, and your statement false. You’re just being very obtuse.

       i have one point and one point only: bottled water has been around for decades. You refuted that point, and i proved you wrong. Just admit it instead of putting all these words into my mouth. You said bottled water hasn’t been around for decades, even tho it has. You’re wrong. Big fuckin deal. Quit dragging it out.

       It's a product.....no angel tears from heaven.  Vaccines are a fantastic idea with zero real scrutiny.  They are the perfect target to take over and controll.  Make money but also pump garbage into people which turns into a role of the dice depending on the vaccines.  Some are critical.  No one likes malaria shots before going to africa but it would be a good idea.  Some vaccines are a product and a money maker pure and simple.  Flu vaccines every single year?

       Sugar industry has been working for the better part of a century to hide the links between sugar and diabetes/cancer/other stuff. A lot of modern food, especially fast food, is literally engineered to be addictive and with little to no regard for the health effects of the food.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's some pretty compelling evidence to suggest that the agri and food industries coordinate with the pharmaceutical industries at least in terms of type 2 diabetes and related disorders, but it may run much deeper than that. I mean, If I where a major share holder in coke I'd be a fool not to also be a major shareholder in companies that sell diabetes supplies and insulin etc. It seems unlikely that anyone has 'proven' high level coordination, but executives and high level investors would be idiots if they weren't coordinating the synergies available to them.

       Distilled water, no more shots, zero fast food, no processed foods, but still [probably] too much sugar. It is hard to get rid of the sugars, cause it is in everything, even naturally. It's probably the worst of them all.

       No white sugar is the key. Cut that out and youll be fine. You need some sugar for your cellular processes to function. Its not the worst of them all naturally, its the worst because like you said, its in everything.

       Just not eating the added sugars in processed foods is enough for most people. You can also try limiting high-sugar/low fiber fruits, but beyond that you'll be unnecessarily restricting your diet. The fiber in most vegetables and fruits slows the absorption of any sugar enough so you won't experience the insulin response that makes sweets so harmful.

       No. I do not believe that is true. Distilled water is a great way to avoid fluoride and other contaminants found in the water supply. It tastes great. I use real salt [with trace minerals] and prepare the majority of my own food.

       Fast food doesn't make you overweight for one. A continuous caloric surplus does. Just like sugar doesn't cause obesity. It's just a common trait with obese people that most of their eating habits involve eating out and high sugar intake, it's related to poor health choices.

       Eh... fast food in general is higher in calories, provides less satiation, and has less nutritional value. While you

       What do you mean "those foods"? Sorry but the law of thermodynamics isn't different in anyone's body. A caloric surplus is all that is needed to directly cause weight gain. And no I wont check out a book called Salt Sugar Fat by Michael Moss because these people who right these books ignore proven facts so they can sell you shit to over complicate the subject and further make things worse for people that actually want to learn proper health and nutrition. Salt is an essential electrolyte to humans and is only a threat to those with hypertension. Sugar is a threat to those who only eat sugar while lacking other macros, micros, and fiber. Fat is essential as well. People became massively overweight in this country because these are the same people that 100% don't have a clue how many calories they're consuming on a daily basis.

       Junk food will make you want to eat more, causing you to eat more, creating the caloric surplus that leads to weight gain. I maintain a low steady weight even though I never count calories because I have a healthy diet and reach satiety before I overeat; when I start to eat more junk food, especially too many sugar and simple carbohydrates, I easily overeat and gain weight because my appetite isn't being satiated by the food.

       "Junk food will make you want to eat more"
Define "junk food", and how does it make you want to eat more?
      </p>
      <p>
       "sugar and simple carbohydrates" 
Sugar is a simple carbohydrate. Let's be honest here. You're repeating the same bullshit rhetoric and ignoring actual facts when it comes to this shit as anyone else on the carb scare. Sugar isn't bad. Carbs aren't bad. Sodium isn't bad. Fat's aren't bad. What's considered healthy and junk food is primarily subjected on ones own needs. I can eat vegetables and and fruit all day and have a cookie. Does this make my diet healthy? In reality no. In your logic yes, because it's people like you that ignore balance which is the key, and instead love to over complicate shit, ignore facts, and repeat the same bullshit rhetoric which is partially responsible for other people being so informed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Balance is key. This means getting enough water, fiber, micro/macro nutrients, and yes "junk food". The 80/20 rule is miles more "healthy" for ones body physically and mentally than dropping certain macros or electrolytes and blaming them for the sole reason of causing obesity, which in reality is false 100%. Calories in calories  out is 100%, not 99%, not 50%, but 100% responsible for weight gain/loss. In terms of health that's another story.

       "Junk food" is calorie dense food lacking in vitamins and minerals, generally highly processed, often containing a wide variety of additives, and in modern times usually precisely formulated with specific ratios of salt, sugar, and fat in order to induce overeating. I'm not demonizing either sugar or fat when I say that, I'm referring to the role
       <em>
        flavor
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        texture
       </em>
       can play in satiety, and scientists have determined that those three ingredients are key in enhancing the cravability of a food. Carbohydrates in junk foods are also stripped of the fiber that normally satiates when carbohydrates are consumed in their natural form (like fruit or brown rice), making things like crackers, cookies, juice, and white bread also easy to over-consume. Food and the human body are complicated things so it's easy to sound "over-complicated" when talking about them, but it's actually not so hard: try to stick with foods close to their natural forms (or, if processed, processed in such a way that you could replicate in your own kitchen), eat nutrient-dense foods, and learn to pay attention to your body's satiety signals once you've gotten back on track with a decent diet.

       One thing that stands out to me in this area is the economic incentive of a hospital. You get nothing from helping someone live a long healthy life. However, if they suddenly need a triple bi-pass operation done by a surgical specialist all of a sudden this is a highly lucrative patient. Hospitals are rated on how many of these specialists they have and cases they treat instead of how many cases they prevent all together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Preventative medicine will always be the best for the public, but behind closed doors the profit motive required something other than a healthy population to pray on.

       They are trying to change that but its complicated. Physicians often don't want to do interventions but feel obligated because in our legal system there is no accounting for risk or probability and its a system that rewards doing vs waiting. It does not work this way in other developed countries which is part of why their costs and outcomes are better (the other part of the equation is everything from the diet issues detailed in this thread to the lack of labor protections in America like limited vacation time, no guranteed severance pay, dependence on work for insurance, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       Our system needs to be regeared to favor preventitive care, scale bag costly interventions without demonstrated benefit, and invest in making life in America healthy, and change mal practice approaches.
      </p>
      <p>
       But at every step there is fierce resistance from advocacy groups that have turf to protect, device manufacturers, pharma companies, food industry etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The soft drink tax in Chicago was repealed and NYs was banned... and maybe its not popoular, but if you are going to guzzle corn syrup and flavoring you should pay back a bit for the negative externality of when those chickens come home to roost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similiarly, other products with high sugar content need to be taxed just like cigarrettes or at least we need to stop subsidizing industrial corn but trust if me, if prices go up a pop eyes or kfc or even on processed food at super markets you will have a truly united angry mob bridging rural-urban, red-blue, racial divides.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can blame the governemnt but its not monolithic. We consumers dig our own graves. There is resistence on regulating or changing the health care system. There is resistance trying to get some standardization to medical practices. There is resistance to pricing foods to reflect the negative externality of their health effects. There is resistance debeloping public transport so we live elss sedentary lives. There is resistance to labour protections so our work lives are less terrible. And not all of its from monsanto, gsk, medtronich etc...

       I get where you're coming from, but historically, being overweight was actually viewed as a symbol of beauty, prosperity and health from the Renaissance period to maybe the mid 1900s. Reason being is because it was a lot harder to have a steady supply of food back in those times and most people experienced a steady supply of famine and hunger. The wealthy, successful people were the ones that had all the food. I imagine someone from the middle-lower class would be quite surprised, but people saw a lot of things differently altogether that far back.

       The "overweight" that was considered attractive historically was tiny compared to the obese bodies we see today. Look  nude portraits created by artists in the centuries you mention, the vast majority feature women who would be considered thin or average today.

       This is arguably the most important topic to get red-pilled on, as our bad diet is the foundation upon which the (((medical mafia))) rests. Fast food and soda are about the worst of the worst, but to be blunt: Humans are eating the wrong diet for our species. Luckily, we can reason through this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at your body. Very little hair. You wouldn't survive the night, let alone the winter, in most parts of the world before the advent of fire and tools. Our bodies evolved for millions of years to be suited to that environment. Humans are a tropical species, and our diet should reflect that. In a tropical environment with no fire, no tools, what would you eat? Fruit! Just like most primates.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, as modern humans we should be eating primarily fresh, raw fruit and dark leafy greens. Then make some tweaks to reflect your more recent ancestry -- maybe add some eggs, fish, a little clean meat. Avoid grains and bread, avoid dairy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, we can adapt to other diets. Our bodies can run on a wide variety of fuels. But there are consequences, most notably acidic buildup leading to tissue degeneration. We group symptoms of these byproducts into
       <strong>
        "diseases" -- entirely an invented concept
       </strong>
       -- and are sold various pharmaceuticals to treat these symptoms, never the cause. Wouldn't want to lose a customer!
      </p>

       Please take this post to heart.  As a meat eating human, I find 80/10/10 to be a big challenge, but I've gone multiple week stretches of nothing but whole raw organic fruits/veggies for 2 meals a day and whatever I want for the 3rd and felt WAY better.  Lost weight, lower pain levels, higher energy, etc.  Long term just requires the discipline to keep the fridge stocked with those fruits/veggies.  They taste great, but old habits die hard.  McDonalds isn't on every corner for no reason...

       Fruit is definitely good for you but you can eat too much of it. Your teeth won't forgive you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agreed about the dark leafy greens. The info here and on the internet suggests a balanced diet with fish, occasional meat (pig, beef), VERY occasional poultry, with a majority of your food coming from dark greens with a moderate amount of fruit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fruit is good but you can't claim it's some miracle diet. It's not. Primitive humans would not have been eating fruit everyday anyway. You can't always find it and different areas have different kinds.

       been at it for 26 years without issue. And frankly it'd be silly if eating fruit was bad for our teeth -- imagine monkeys' teeth falling out after a couple years. On the contrary, it's a western diet that destroys teeth:

      </p>
      <p>
       Pre-tool, pre-fire humans would ALWAYS choose fruit over catching and eating, say, a raw, feathered wild chicken. I live in the tropics -- Central America. Wild fruit trees are common here. Again, this climate is where primitive, pre-tool, pre-fire humans lived. You can sleep outside at night, year-round, and not freeze to death.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will actually claim fruits are a miracle diet -- or, rather, that's what we should've been eating all along, and straying from it leads to all manner of health problems. It's the core component of cancer treatment, for example. I've posted many links above if you care to research future.

       Well, if you really want information on Monkeys and Apes. They do get them, but they just die instead of living long enough to deal with it like we do.

       Apes/Monkeys don't last 50 years in the wild. If they do, they are extremely lucky. So they don't deal with dental issues like we do.

       Except now we know that, basically, anything more than a single piece of fruit is  bad for you. It's basically just like eating sugar and it's hard on your liver.

       In some ways fructose is even worse for you than sucrose.

       You realize there are many many rigorous studies that contradict this right? Based on data, your diet should be about equal parts fruit, vegetable, and healthy starchlike legume, potato,whole grain, etc.  It is possible ot overdo it on fruit, but most people are nowhere near that point and never will be. You should be eating many different types of fruits and veg daily, full stop.

       In the same line of thought, your body is a river...
      </p>
      <p>
       2/3 of the body is water, it goes from head to toes and back around, through billions of tiny canals, you could picture it as a very large river that moves very very slowly, and reaches to itself in a circle (yes it's physically impossible but that's ok)... with a smaller river flowing in, what you drink, and some flowing out (pee, poop, respiration, transpiration).
      </p>
      <p>
       The river has to be slow enough for us to live with it, unfortunately that means it has to be slow enough for many other forms of life as well, such as germs... but in any case, the point is you can't change the speed of the river. What can you change then? What happens if you drink like an ass and increase the input? You overflow your river so there is more flowing out, but you're also diluting it, which is not uninteresting, it combats stagnation, and it builds up over time, the more you dilute your river, the cleaner it gets, up to a point because your dirty body likes to clean itself in the river heh. What if you lower the input? Water goes around more times, it accumulates the crap your body throws at it (sure you have filters, but filters don't last forever and they need to be cleaned every once in a while), and much like stagnant water, it opens the door to infections. Which is easier for the immune system to defend? The clean river or the dirty river? Hmmmm...
      </p>
      <p>
       How often you dilute your river and with what is up to you, but i can attest that ever since i started diluting my river with clean water, i hardly ever fall sick. And whenever i see someone coughing, i see a dirty stagnant river heh.

       So how is this successful, when other deemed "healthy" diets, like paleo, limit the sugar in all forms (including fruit) and focus on primarily meat and leafy veg intake?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't a high fruit intake cause or exacerbate diabetes, just like any high sugar intake? Also, I heard that fructose is especially bad for the liver?
      </p>
      <p>
       Asking these questions as I'm curious. I'd love to eat a high fruit diet, but I can't at this stage work out how high sugar could in any way be beneficial. Do the nutrients counteract it or make your body more adaptable to the higher sugar intake, or something? And explanation would be great, with sources. Thanks!

       , not sugar, is bad for diabetes. It keeps the sugar in the bloodstream, preventing it from absorbing into the interstitial tissues. So a high fruit diet that is also high in fat would indeed be a problem. But it's the FAT that's creating the "blockage". Eating meat badly exacerbates this problem.

       This is absolutely not true. A type 2 diabetic has a problem uptaking glucose for cell use due to faulty insulin response mostly due to genetic predisposion and a long history of a high carb/sugar diet that eventually over burdens the cells ability to uptake respond properly to insulin. A diabetic patient consuming limited fats and high carbs/sugars will spike their blood sugars regardless! Diabetes is a chronic progressive disease due to insulin resistance so its intuitive that limiting sugar/carb intake with regular excersize would slow the progression.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also understand diabetes manifests as a metabolic disorder initially but you cant say "Fats not sugar" exclusively because thats absolutely false. You want to prevent DM2, eat a balanced diet and stop eating shit laced with sugars and fats. Everyone has been trying to eat low fat everything yet diabetes is rampant like never before. Our bodies arent ment to process the insan amounts of sugars people eat!

       The fat itself inhibits the insulin response:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When we eat too much fatty food, a thin coating of fat lines the blood vessel walls, the cells’ insulin-receptor sites, the sugar molecules, as well as the insulin itself. These fats can take a full day or more to “clear” from the blood, all the while inhibiting normal metabolic activity, and preventing these various structures from communicating with each other.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thus, too much fat in the blood impedes the movement of sugar out of the bloodstream. This results in an overall rise in blood sugar, as sugars continue to travel from the digestive tract (stage 1) into the blood (stage 2) but cannot escape from the blood so they can be delivered to the cells (stage 3), which await their fuel.

       First of all fats are broken down into cholesterol and triglyercides and are transported around the blood as lipoproteins. Yes there is a connection between high cholesterol and atherosclerosis through various mechanisms however it's not like fat goes into the blood and just coats everything so therefore insulin receptors cant work. It doesn't work that way at all. Don't you think if it were that obvious than medical studies would have figured this simple connection out forever ago??  There is a link between diabetes and other metabolic disfunctions but I'm sorry the author of your reference is misleading you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would suggest reading up on known patho-phys and then hitting up some evidence based medical articles from pubmed before spouting off this disinformational nonsense. Lots of unknowns and controversial ideas on diet with much I agree with, as long as its logical and make sense with known scientific mechanisms. I can tell you right now that insulin-glucagon mechanism is pretty well mapped out and has been extensively studied. This author's knowledge on this particular matter is lacking and not based on facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is open for debate would be cholesterols actual role in heart attack and stroke and why physians may be missing the mark on using current LDL, HDL, and TG goals as markers for clinically significant reductions of heart disease

       If im spewing technobabble than what are you spewing? Truth not based on current science? All I'm saying is that we all need to make sure we do our own research on these diet claims so that we aren't sharing disinfo.
      </p>
      <p>
       For years, I have been saying that the insane amounts of sugar put into our foods unknowingly and being backed by shotty articles claiming "fats not sugar" has been poisoning all of us for now 30 years. Look around you, look at how many people are obese. Hell overweight is the new normal BMI. I have read many books written about these new diet philosophies and I agree with much of it however ask anyone in medicine if the science makes sense to say fat, not sugar is bad for diabetics and you'll quickly realize that "technobabble" is based on solid understandings of basic metabolic processes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, if you have no evidence and just believe this guys "knowledge" over medical professionals than thats cool. Do an experiment, go tell you diabetic friend to eat no fat and a diet high in sugar. Tell me what his blood sugars are everday. Next tell him to eat diet high in fat and no sugars and tell me. I can tell you the answer based on experience but you probably know more than me after reading a book

       First off, taste good is completely subjective and carries no weight in an argument. What you are lookin for is preservatives/additives that make the food “taste good.” These substances have a more direct affect on your body than vaccines ever would (even though Im perfectly okay with them).

       That's freedom. If fluoride is good for you, have it in toothpaste and other products that people can choose to buy. Same with vaccinations. Give the free people a choice. Not everyone eats junk and they shouldn't be forced to put other junk in their body just because other people eat at McDonald's.

       It goes so far beyond this though. There's plenty of people out there who cook every day with plenty of fruit and veg in their diets but unless you can afford to eat solely organic produce and never touch anything inorganic, you're still being poisoned, your health is still at risk. It fucking sucks to be honest. Almost all food on the planet has been weaponized.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Prolonged excitation of the nerve cell can occur from too much glutamate, which is toxic. Neurobiologists recognize that glutamate can cause harm when the messages are overwhelming, as in stroke or epilepsy. Molecules called transporters aid in keeping glutamate in proper concentrations around nerve cells. Abundant evidence points to glutamate as a destructive factor in ALS

       It’s funny.
I think of this all the time.
Im 100 pounds, one of the tiniest, skinniest people I know (and I was NOT like this my whole life either.) my dad only bought organic; we weren’t allowed to eat McDonald’s or soda or shit like that. I at one point was petrified of any food that wasn’t organic or non GMO. I felt super happy, connected, etc, so much more aware and different than my friends. So much more energy. Everyone else that I knew ate like shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ironic thing was that I had no problem smoking weed and cigarettes tho (wtf is wrong with me?)
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve gotten to the point that I don’t care about the food I consume and I truly notice that I am SO UP MY OWN ASS and kind of depressed. But that’s a whole other can of worms that has nothing to do with my eating habits.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, whatever it takes to dumb down the masses and make them not realize. They’ll do it.

       I disagree with this because of my own experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been overweight for most of my life. I've lost and gained weight, here and there. I can eat one
       <em>
        average
       </em>
       sized, home-cooked meal a day comprising of what is recommended on the food pyramid - just that, no snacks, no other meals, nothing else - and I gain or maintain my weight. Bearing in my mind, calorie intake on this day is a third of what it should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I can have three meals a day, home-cooked that are low in carbs, and I lose weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can also have just one home-cooked meal a day, that is low in carbs, and lose weight. This kicks me right into ketosis, so I don't feel hungry at all which enables me to last until the next day. I'm not getting all the nutrients that I need, though, so I don't do this often.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, at least, it's not about the HOW MUCH it's about the WHAT. And I do believe that it's probably this way for everyone else. A fat person can be fat and an undereater. Totally possible, because it happened to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish people wouldn't equate fat with overeating.
In fact, more than the WHAT, it is probably about hormones. And I can bet that these days, everyone's hormones are out-of-whack in some way.
And someone with messed up hormone's isn't going to let go of their fat easily. Especially if they have a cortisol problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       In many cases, weight loss isn't a result of addressing the amount ate, but the hormonal problem that is the cause of holding onto the weight, and eradicating the element of the diet (or lifestyle!) that is causing the hormonal problem.

       Everyone’s bodies different. Some people can eat fast food 2 times daily and still be as skinny as a nail, others who do the same can become obese from it. Also depends on how active you are, if you’re eating fast food and you’re active in some way you’re not gonna gain much weight. I went from 250 to about 190 &amp; ate what I wanted, but just drinking pure water and counting calories. To me, it sounds like you should probably try to walk a mile or lift weights or something. But in my experience, as long as you do my overdue the fast food and your calorie limit and you’re active, you’ll be fine. But like I said everyone’s different

       I have fat pockets that won't burn, post-surgery. It's kinda insane to look at myself naked at the moment, because you can see my abs and then this flubby pocket that hovers over my scars.  As an infertile woman, getting the "oh, are you pregnant?" question and looks is pretty shitty feeling.

       Fast food being awful it's not a conspiracy anymore. It has drugs in it and some of the meat isn't really meat. Even mold won't touch the fries. People just don't care.

       mildlyrelated, but in the city i lived in, something quite strange happened to the water. one part of the city (one of the poor parts), everyone got sick from the water, myself included. at first some of us thought nothing of it, until we saw a few of our friends (from different parts of the city), and none of them were sick. at all. the water was completely fine. which may be something, or nothing, but its wierd the poor area got sick, because you would think the whole city has the same water supply.  but personally  im sure the university (aka the mafia that run the city) have a completely different supply coming into their area for themselves, the rich part, and the wealthy students

       So, I buy lots of organic, non-GMO or from local farms. And I'm single, on a budget, and can STILL afford to eat well.
      </p>
      <p>
       But last night, after completely fucking up a meal from scratch, I ordered a calzone and salad. And a Sprite. But, at least this place makes their own crust and bread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Junk food is easy, fast and addictive. I'll be making my meals today from basic ingredients. I used to make batches of veggies for tacos or stir fry and eat them over multiple days. I'm now trying to budget my time for a meal prep every evening. Turn on some good music. Prep my ingredients. Give my begging dog some veggies. And if I actually clean off my kitchen table, sit at it and not on the couch.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, with delivery and tip, I spent $30 for essentially one meal. That's fuckin insane.

       I eat a decent amount. Always have. If cigs were apart of my daily life or even soda I’d probably be severely overweight. How I do not partake in those and i can wake up and not feel like shit while still keeping a bigger mass.

       In the same line of thought, your body is a river...
      </p>
      <p>
       2/3 of the body is water, it goes from head to toes and back around, through billions of tiny canals, you could picture it as a very large river that moves very very slowly, and reaches to itself in a circle (yes it's physically impossible but that's ok)... with a smaller river flowing in, what you drink, and some flowing out (pee, poop, respiration, transpiration).
      </p>
      <p>
       The river has to be slow enough for us to live with it, unfortunately that means it has to be slow enough for many other forms of life as well, such as germs... but in any case, the point is you can't change the speed of the river. What can you change then? What happens if you drink like an ass and increase the input? You overflow your river so there is more flowing out, but you're also diluting it, which is not uninteresting, it combats stagnation, and it builds up over time, the more you dilute your river, the cleaner it gets, up to a point because your dirty body likes to clean itself in the river heh. What if you lower the input? Water goes around more times, it accumulates the crap your body throws at it (sure you have filters, but filters don't last forever and they need to be cleaned every once in a while), and much like stagnant water, it opens the door to infections. Which is easier for the immune system to defend? The clean river or the dirty river? Hmmmm...
      </p>
      <p>
       How often you dilute your river and with what is up to you, but i can attest that ever since i started diluting my river with clean water, i hardly ever fall sick. And whenever i see someone coughing, i see a dirty stagnant river heh.

       No. I do not believe that is true. Distilled water is a great way to avoid fluoride and other contaminants found in the water supply. It tastes great. I use real salt [with trace minerals] and prepare the majority of my own food.
