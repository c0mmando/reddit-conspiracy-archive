        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The world&#39;s elite/governments/central bankers have been wanting to switch to a cashless digital money society for a long time. But how to get everyone to make the switch? Print out massive amount of fiat currency, while slowly introducing bitcoin and crypto into the free market. As massive money printing devalues fiat currency, people will flock to the new &quot;decentralized&quot; cryptocurrencies themselves. They will happily give up their cash.
People seem to think that since you can&#39;t just create bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies out of thin air that it cannot be controlled by central banks or the elites that currently control the system. That isn&#39;t the case though. If you look at how cryptocurrencies are created, they are mined using lots of electricity and special computer equipment completing algorithms.
Google and Amazon and Microsoft and Facebook, etc already have massive supercomputers and AI and will be able to mine crypto at 1000X the rate of the entire rest of the world. Combine that with secret advanced energy systems(zero point, harvesting energy from the ionosphere etc) they will have basically unlimited electricity and unlimited computing power. </p>

<p>Yes it is decentralized now and nobody can technically create these currencies out of thin air like with fiat. But when one entity(NSA, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, CIA etc.) has so much computing power and energy that they can mine a million bitcoins in the same time that it takes the entire rest of the world to mine a single bitcoin, they will have the same exact power over the monetary supply as the central banks have always had.</p>

<p>This might be an end to the Rothschild banking empire, but thats only if google and the rest of the tech oligarchs haven&#39;t already made a deal with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK so criminals and pedophiles use the usd. It has strengthened against other currencies significantly since it&#39;s inception. Now is the government responsible for how people use it? No, of course not. Bitcoin is a technology first and foremost. It being used as a currency is just one application. Sure people use it for crimes. Many more people use it as a legal way to trade goods and value. The point is, just because criminals use a technology or currency doesn&#39;t make it a bad thing. Bitcoin isn&#39;t even anonymous - it is very, very traceable. The entire ledger and all transactions are completely available to anyone. The US banking system isn&#39;t like that. Nor is monero, another CryptoCurrency that offers complete anonymity when used properly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great argument. Ive been thinking about this one alot as ive started investing in cryptos. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/reuvencohen/2013/11/28/global-bitcoin-computing-power-now-256-times-faster-than-top-500-supercomputers-combined/#29215b956e5e">Here</a> is a Forbes artictle that explains how the bitcoin network alone is already the most powerful network of computers ever created. It would be extremely difficult for the government to hide such big mining facilities. You need a very big chuck of space to host a mining rig of 10k+ computers. It makes me wonder what casinos are doing with the gfx processors inside all of those slot machines that run 24/7. On this side of the argument regarding classical computing, it would seem HIGHLY unlikely that anyone else, other than the bitcoin network itself, owns a botnet of millions of computers worthy of disrupting the the current crypto exchange. This is because the difficulty of mining a bitcoin increases with each one mined, the power it takes to mine 1 right now is ridiculous. What im actually concerned about are the theoretical capabilities of a quantum computer that processes above 50 qbits. In a sorta convoluted way, a quantum computer can process information forwards and backwards in time sorta kinda. But if this shit can mine 1 mil bitcoins in 5 seconds then ya we are fuuuuucked.</p>

<p>You mean like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Data_Center">1 million square foot data center</a>?           </p>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting that&#39;s what the NSA is doing there, but I suspect it would be possible for the government of the largest economy of the world to monopolize the bitcoin hash rate if they put their mind to it. Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies use an ASIC-resistant hash algorithms which <em>might</em> make such a thing too difficult/expensive.           </p>

<p>The bitcoin Proof of Work system is theoretically vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm">Grover&#39;s algorithm</a>, but that only provides a quadratic speedup over existing non-quantum algorithms. Transaction signing is vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor&#39;s algorithm</a> to a much more viable degree. Although quantum computers can reduce the problem space a great deal, they will still be slower than non-quantum computers for quite some time, and it will be a while before QCs with enough qubits come around. There are quantum-resistant algorithms in the works to make cryptocurrency robust against these algorithms, and imho I think we&#39;ll have plenty of time to switch over to them before disaster strikes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, but your theory relies on a fundamental misunderstanding of how bitcoin works. </p>

<p>Yes, super computers exist. Can they mine bitcoin? No. You&#39;re right they use special computer equipment - they are called ASICS or application specific integrated circuits. Meaning they are programmed to only function on one application. In this case, bitcoin. I won&#39;t go into the algorithm in detail, but they are trying to find very large numbers(let&#39;s use primes for this example). The entire network is testing trillions of numbers per second until the right one is found every ten minutes on average. That solution number changes depending on the transactions made during that time.</p>

<p>As more people mine, the larger the prime number gets, and the harder it is to find. The inverse is true if less people mine. That way, on average, a number is found every ten minutes. </p>

<p>Now, the power of the entire network is more powerful than the top ten supercomputers in the world <em>combined</em>.  That makes the network very secure. </p>

<p>Theoretically if one actor were to achieve over 50% of total hashing (number searching) power, they would control the network and be able to censor it. What would actually happen is the rest of the actors would see this attack and fork - making a separate chain from the lone attackers chain, and bitcoin would continue. In fact, bitcoin has forked many times, but still maintains top hashing power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is not the computing power, but an economic question of opportunity costs. A company worth billions of dollars(which might be worthless in the future) can spend a billion on new crypto mining equipment, and can also cover the inflationary costs of electricity. If it costs 100k for the new ASIC miner, and 15k a month in electricity to buy it, a multibillion dollar company can grow at 100X the rate of the average crytpto startup. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK so ABC company does that. And they gain control of over 50% of the network. Everyone else quickly realizes that the same miner has mined the last 100 blocks. They fork and say fuck off, and continue on. Now ABC company is no longer mining bitcoin, they are mining ABC coin. </p>

<p>Or, everyone realizes it, and sells all their bitcoin plummeting the price. Now ABC company is mining at a loss. And for how long can they afford? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you can&#39;t just fork and take half the power supply with you. Crypto mining has taken up so much electricity that whoever controls the flow of electricity will control the crypto supply. Just like Kissinger said, control the oil control the state. How would someone mine for crypto if they had a limited supply of power? A fork could occur and whichever side had more electricity could completely overtake the other side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What would ultimately happen is the trust in the network would be reduced to ashes along with the value. If ABC company took over bitcoin, no one would use it because it is now centralized and untrustworthy. It loses its intrinsic value as an immutable asset. Eventually something news will come along that doesn&#39;t require as much electricity as bitcoin and it&#39;s proof of work algorithm. There are already many different coins testing out other algorithms. One will win. You&#39;re right. It probably won&#39;t be bitcoin because of the electricity costs. </p>

<p>Remember though, miners don&#39;t mine individually, they mine in pools to amass their hashing power. But none have reached the theoretical 51%. A few came close but miners volunteered to leave to stop it. </p>

<p>Centralization is what would kill bitcoin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>10k at what price? At the price of the suckers that do not understand it. I tried bitcoin in 2009 and it was to hard for normal people. I tried mining in 2013 and that is also a suckers game to compete with Chinese miners. People so not understand bitcoin because they do not understand what the blockchain is. Bitcoin is not a payment or money replacer. Bitcoin is the simple demo equivalent of moving a mouse on a scree. Blockchain is a way to commonly agree on an idea </p>

<p>Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies use ASIC-resistant proof of work systems which theoretically keep mining decentralized. We&#39;ll have to see how effective that is.             </p>

<p>Well, the original whitepaper was called &quot;Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System&quot;, so I suspect the creator(s) would disagree with you on that point. In your opinion, what is bitcoin?            </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>As the first idea of its kind, bitcoin was bound to be immature. However, it can be forked to include new ideas, and it has inspired many other cryptocurrencies which are more sophisticated.          </p>
