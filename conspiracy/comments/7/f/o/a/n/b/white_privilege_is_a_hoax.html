<blockquote>
<p>Crack and cocaine may be nearly identical on a molecular level, but people who are charged with possession of just 1 gram of crack are given the same sentence as those found in possession of 18 grams of cocaine.</p>

<p>This 18:1 sentencing disparity is actually an improvement from the previous sentencing gulf of 100:1, thanks to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, but as new research shows, any disparity unfairly targets crack users, who are more likely to be black, low-income and less educated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like you don&#39;t. Every time that phrase is touted out it is used as some kind of excuse for why that individual is in the predicament they find themselves in. </p>

<p>Using the example offered here, saying &quot;i got x more years because crack is scheduled higher than cocaine even though they are the same drug&quot; is nothing more than an excuse and smoke screen to distract from the fact that the fool who got arrested was using/transporting/selling an illegal drug.</p>

<p>If he/she had followed the true and narrow, then it wouldn&#39;t make any difference at all how either drug is scheduled. Using the &quot;social construct&quot; excuse is a mere method of him/her avoiding personal responsibility for their situation. </p>

<p>Also, as I have come to learn, nearly every time some SJW uses that term, there is a legitimate reason for the difference they are complaining about. Here for example, crack requires an additional manufacturing level not required by cocaine, it is also has a user base that often engages in other violent crime and crimes against property to sustain their habit. </p>

<p>No, but it is racist to specifically target the one of the two most common forms of a drug that is essentially identical and used by black people significantly more often for harsher punishment.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, also, that crime has a victim. Drug use does not.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a harder more dangerous drug </p>

<p>&quot;No, also, that crime has a victim. Drug use does not.&quot;</p>

<p>So you&#39;ve never seen what crack does to a community but you&#39;re aware of these laws about Crack? </p>

<p>When crack is introduced to a community everyone is affected, LEO and civilians alike are more likely to be murdered. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take up the White Man&#39;s burden--
Ye dare not stoop to less--
Nor call too loud on Freedom
To cloke your weariness;
By all ye cry or whisper,
By all ye leave or do,
The silent, sullen peoples
Shall weigh your gods and you.</p>

<p>Take up the White Man&#39;s burden--
Have done with childish days--
The lightly proferred laurel,
The easy, ungrudged praise.
Comes now, to search your manhood
Through all the thankless years
Cold, edged with dear-bought wisdom,
The judgment of your peers!</p>

<p>HEY, I’m not sure why you’re following me around attempting to lambast me for a comment made in obvious jest - but you’re wrong.</p>

<p>Temperatures on the moon are very hot in the daytime, about 100 degrees C. At night, the lunar surface gets very cold, as cold as minus 173 degrees C. </p>

<p>I repeat, the dark side of the moon is -173 degrees Celsius. All the lack of an atmosphere does is increase the temperature disparity between day side and night side (on account of an inability to trap any heat or insulate the surface). </p>

<p>I wouldn’t go running around calling <em>other</em> people stupid, bud. </p>

<p>It was a mechanism for social organization and control. The good old divide and conquer. In other words, a cruel hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Umm whoever proclaimed white power. Literally whoever ever did that claimed &quot;whiteness&quot;. </p>

<p>Segregation bred &quot;whiteness&quot; and now that I think about it did that start white priveledge? </p>

<p>Clean &quot;whites only&quot; fountains and unkept &quot;blacks only&quot; ones.</p>

<p>The whole bus thing. The front was a privilege was it not?</p>

<p>&quot;Whites only pies&quot; I could go on for days about where white people claimed whiteness and were glad to be white rather than black because you had ADVANTAGES. 
Or maybe not even that they had ADVANTAGES, but that they DIDN&#39;T have DISADVANTAGES!</p>

<p>You can change laws and things but attitudes and minds aren&#39;t so willing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who said anything about oppression? You&#39;re attempting to change the goalposts but you&#39;re speaking on a totally different topic now.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same as the situations where people get reduced sentencing as opposed to others who get the norm for doing the same crimes. Who said the ones who got the norm were being oppressed? The conversation is about the ones who get certain passes or privileges because of their connections or money, and more often than not these people are white if you want to bring it full circle.</p>

<p>But here you are trying to deny that even money changes the situation. Does no one or no family have an advantage in America?</p>

<p>Funny question but I&#39;m employed and have held various positions, though I&#39;m far from rich. What does that have to do with the conversation though? Other than if I had to go to court and couldn&#39;t afford the best attorney?</p>

<p>Let me ask you if you can find this data.</p>

<p>How far OVER the minimum minority hire OR acceptance threshold do these companies and colleges go? Im going to go ahead and assume not far. They are only going to do what they have to. Hence why it exists in the first place. </p>

<p>It was implemented for a reason, and it wasn&#39;t what is being claimed in that article. And things are different now so the numbers may need some adjustment as with any laws that we have that are outdated, but it shouldn&#39;t be completely done away with. </p>

<p>What am I, a white male citizen of America, legally allowed to do that any other colored citizen is not?
What law, statute, regulation, or doctrine enforces white privilege?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what white privilege is, genius. It&#39;s not about getting a super special White Guy Starter Pack or having explicit laws protecting our status (and relegating o others to status as second class citizens), it is about the myriad ways in which minorities are discriminated against on a day to day basis that not only do you never have to deal with, but you have the <em>privilege</em> of being in a position to not even consider it. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to worry about getting pulled over for being black and driving a nice car in the wrong neighborhood. You don&#39;t have to worry about loss prevention getting in your face as though you&#39;re shoplifting simply for being black. You don&#39;t have to deal with old, rude people screaming in your face like you&#39;re a moron simply because you&#39;re black. </p>

<p>It&#39;s things like these and thousands of other similar little things that add up to what people refer to as &quot;white privilege,&quot; and maybe someday if you learn to think outside yourself you&#39;ll understand what is being discussed rather than having this sort of kneejerk &quot;well where&#39;s muh privilege&quot; reaction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The white privilege here is that you literally <em>cannot seem to conceive</em> of a situation in which things do not operate in that way. There is no racial profiling, and if there is then you just magically get a lawyer and (most importantly) win your court case with no problem. I guess your problem is less that you&#39;re racist and more that you have this delusional belief in Just World Theory, where everybody just gets what they deserve. Anyone who goes to jail <em>must</em> have broken the law. Evidence is never planted, police officers never cover for each other, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ll just cut and paste this from the last thread the OP started, who for some reason has felt the need to do this twice:</p>

<p>In a broader sense I (as a white dude) am less likely to be discriminated against when attempting to rent an apartment or when applying for a job (based on the whiteness of my name on a resume). I am not followed around department stores when shopping or harassed by security simply for cruising around a store without purchasing something (a thing I have seen happen many times from years of working at a large department store chain downtown). </p>

<p>As a white single straight dude I probably have the largest dating pool of eligible women to choose from, because of the inherent (or sometimes overt) biases of ladies when choosing a partner. </p>

<p>On a personal level, as a frequent pedestrian and sometimes driver in my diverse city, I am practically invisible to police officers - I can drink beer while walking or smoke a joint or simply be walking in a nice neighborhood and not get harassed, a privilege that my friends (who are not white) most definitively do not enjoy (and I have personally witnessed it, as well as frequent anecdotes from them - “driving while black” is an all too familiar “crime”  they get pulled over for). I am much less likely to be harassed for my casual drug use (I enjoy me some marijuana) than if I were non white, based on both personal experience and arrest rates for marijuana in my state. </p>

<p>I also get to enjoy the privilege of not having white people as a whole judged for the actions of the individual. Whereas people will say that the way an individual Black/Chinese/Mexican/etc acts is how <em>all</em> black/chinese/Mexican/etc act. It is something I’m aware of and I don’t take for granted. </p>

<p>This is just off the top of my head. I hope these examples helped, though I don’t pretend to be an expert (i am not an anthroplogist or sociologist or economist or whoever looks at all of that). </p>

<p>Glad I could contribute. </p>

Speaking from my own experience of growing up in an 85% white town, attending an Ivy-League school and then landing a lucrative trading job afterwards, I can still attest that there were many things that would have been better if I we&#39;re white.<br/>
The worst of it probably was when I was growing up, the kids in elementary and middle school were just brutal to me and constantly teased me for looking different, as less than 1% of the school population was Indian like me. I often felt like an outsider in my own home town. However, I dealt with it, made a few friends who didn&#39;t care and was able to do well. There was also constant rumors about how my family was poor, couldn&#39;t afford to live in the town, was loving on welfare or lived  in a shack on the side of  the road. In reality, my parents were entirely self-made multi-millionaires. By the time high school rolled around I was mostly left to myself, as long as I didn&#39;t try to break into the &quot;in crowd&quot;. I didn&#39;t care, but my younger sister had a pretty rough time in high school. There were a few instances where she would walk into a house party with her friends and was told that she had to leave right when she walked in. Her &quot;friends&quot; put up an argument but ultimately went in while she had to wait outside or walk home. 
Also, once I started driving while in high school I got pulled over in town twice for speeding (10 and 20mph over). Both times I was given a ticket. Of my 5 closest friends (all white), they were pulled over in town 7 times total, and we&#39;re never ever given a ticket. I shudder to think how different the reactions would have been if we had done worse stuff.<br/>
Then, for college, I attended an Ivy-League school, with certainly no affirmative action help, as 3 students in my school with SAT scores 300 points lower than mine and class ranks 10-15 lower than me (I was 2/350), got into my top choice, Cornell while I was rejected.<br/>
Once I was at Penn, I considered joining a frat. I went to rush with a few of my friends and we all got bids. However, on bid night, a vocal minority of the current brothers started chanting &quot;white is right&quot; and shouting that they only wanted white pledges. Apparently they had created a &quot;faction&quot; called &quot;Jolly Old &lt;frat name&gt;&quot; with the purpose of pushing for only allowing white guys in. I was pretty uncomfortable and turned down the bid cause of that.<br/>
Later, when applying for internships for after freshman year through cold calls and emails, I noticed a lot of my white classmates would end up with far more interviews per contact attempt than me. I generally would send 50 emails for 1 interview, while other people would send 5-10.<br/>
Same story sophomore and junior year, but since there was a formalized on campus recruiting thing I felt I wasn&#39;t at as much of a disadvantage because of my name.<br/>
Now, I&#39;m contemplating joining a country club when I move to the suburbs, but am worried about similar issues with that.<br/>
I don&#39;t claim that it&#39;s awful to be a minority here, and I&#39;ve definitely been born into a nice situation, but my life would certainly have been easier as a white person, and I&#39;ve constantly felt like an outsider in my own homeland.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Black people tend to be the most vocal when it comes to white privilege but I would argue that it can be a deflection from immigrants. Immigrants have the least privilege of all...yes even below black people. At least most black Americans have the opportunity to have generations of American ancestors and education and access that came with that. </p>

<p>You have immigrants coming to the US that are used to living on $2 a day or less and even making $5 an hour under the table in the US makes them happier and more hopeful. </p>

<p>Can&#39;t stand when black people screech about reparations or scream white privilege because they can&#39;t get a job when immigrants are now the shadow labor fueling the US economy. Get outta here! </p>

<p>Next time you go to your favorite restaurant whose in the kitchen and bussing tables? Surely it&#39;ll be an immigrant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My parents left Bosnia back in December of 1996 right after the civil war in what was Yugoslavia. My dad had only $200 in his pocket, my older brother and sister, and my mom, pregnant with me at the time. They came to this country not knowing a single word of English. Not a single word. But my dad had been an electrician for years and let his hands do the talking. When I as born in 97 there was 10 of us (my family and other Bosnians living together at the time) sharing a 2 bedroom apartment. You would only hear my dad complain that he couldn&#39;t get enough money. He never bitched about being a political refugee in this country. He never bitched about how unfair it is. He never complained about how some &quot;systemic racism or institutionalized racism&quot; kept him from succeeding and keeping a roof over our head, clothes on our back, and food in our stomach. He just did his work, made enough money to move us out of that 2 bed room apartment and into our own house in Missouri where we lived for almost 20 years. So when people say there&#39;s systemic racism or institutionalized racism, that&#39;s a bullshit excuse. I can guarantee you. Because I&#39;m willing to bet you, someone just doesn&#39;t want to put in the effort, the work, into bettering themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has there been a system of white enslavement here? Did local governments create laws that made it harder for whites specifically to get jobs while simultaneously creating anti-unemployment laws while white unemployment was high? Was there ever laws criminalizing substances often used by white people? Did the USgovernment subsidize the murder of groups of white people?  My grandparents had access to institutions like housing/car loans much more easier that black people of the time; and they didn&#39;t lower property values for simply living in a neighborhood. Before the &quot;white guilt&quot; bullshit, go read some fucking books. And yes, Irish were indentured servants and Italians/Germans etc were targeted for a few years, that&#39;s apples to oranges though based on a few factors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say that it is a hoax.</p>

<p>It is an exercise in semantics.  White privilege is simply the absence of racism.  Since racism does indeed exist, the absence of racism also exists.  Hence, white privilege exists.</p>

<p>However, in a racist environment dominated by whites (as opposed to South Africa where it is dominated by backs, or places in China where it is dominated by Han), nobody gets anything extra for being white.  It is simply that nonwhites get less than they would had they been treated fairly.</p>

Most of the time I get positive responses and in those examples people tend to ask more often if I have Latin or native American ancestry, but on the rare ocassions people go negative and decide to use racial slurs, I am <em>always</em> regarded as white. I have an older sister who primarily gets complimented as being an attractive Indian woman, but when people receive her negatively she is always a white bitch. </p>

<p>In short people are ridiculous and we need to just keep fucking until everyone is so mixed that the completely false concept of race is no longer relevant and we can just celebrate cultures rather than focus on ridiculous divides based on ethnicity and perceived genetic superiority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like you don&#39;t. Every time that phrase is touted out it is used as some kind of excuse for why that individual is in the predicament they find themselves in. </p>

<p>Using the example offered here, saying &quot;i got x more years because crack is scheduled higher than cocaine even though they are the same drug&quot; is nothing more than an excuse and smoke screen to distract from the fact that the fool who got arrested was using/transporting/selling an illegal drug.</p>

<p>If he/she had followed the true and narrow, then it wouldn&#39;t make any difference at all how either drug is scheduled. Using the &quot;social construct&quot; excuse is a mere method of him/her avoiding personal responsibility for their situation. </p>

<p>Also, as I have come to learn, nearly every time some SJW uses that term, there is a legitimate reason for the difference they are complaining about. Here for example, crack requires an additional manufacturing level not required by cocaine, it is also has a user base that often engages in other violent crime and crimes against property to sustain their habit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the naivete of 80&#39;s nihilism wore off, the groggy, hungover, neon masses took on an earth toned New Age approach to making everyone feel worse about having fun without including <em>everyone</em> in their party. So they got all inclusive and started creating a new amorphous blob of lifeless morons scared of the edge their hippie parents got to experience in full force. They created &quot;Team Building Exercises&quot; and &quot;Corporate Synergy&quot; and anyone who didn&#39;t get it was immediately sold a pair of Adderall or Zoloft grey-scaling glasses to keep their dreary shit day to day from spiraling into an actually enjoyable existence with an integrated, colloidal diversity. </p>

<p>Anybody who notices the &quot;wrong&quot; differences (sexuality, skin color, biological sex) or doesn&#39;t praise the &quot;right&quot; differences (gender identity, mental health, physical handicap) is a bigot racist privileged shitlord and is socially demoted until there&#39;s no semblance of moral fiber on which they can stand up to an accusation of being the aforementioned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Irish were able to slip back into society once colored people were targeted. Not to mention the entire southern economy alone was based on owning black people for quite sometime. No ones saying the Irish didn&#39;t endure similar conditions, im saying it was for less time and there were less barriers to entry (to use economic terms) for merging into American society.</p>
