        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>The Conspiracy of Evil</strong></p>

<p>The first time he hit me, it was because I asked him why his ex was invited to the party.</p>

<p>His eyes changed, shifting slightly to the left, right before he hit me that first time.</p>

<p>Nobody was home. Nobody could hear my screams as he took the end of a broom and beat me all over my body.</p>

<p>I ran up stairs to his bedroom, and I locked myself in the bathroom. He pounded and pounded, and he broke the door down. He continued to punch me, and then he punched the wall.
I ran into this bedroom and fell on to his bed. He began strangling me, and I knew it was quite possible I might die in that moment, as you can only really be strangled for so long. With all my might, I somehow got his body off of me (he was twice the size of me), and to this day, I do not really know how. 
To be honest, I don’t remember how it ended as I can recall the numerous beatings I experienced, but I will have you know, and I still struggle with the shame of this, is that I forgave him, and I kept on dating him.</p>

<p>Part of it was fear, self-esteem, the cycle of abuse, and so many other factors that I probably do not have time to delve into psychologically. My therapist, who I went to after this abuse, told me I fell into an abusive relationship because I was abused as a child (but that’s an interesting story). (Side note: please do not mock me for seeking therapy to deal with trauma).</p>

<p>But one reason I now see clearly is that I truly did not understand evil at the time. I thought it was a mistake and that it would not happen again. We all make mistakes right? How could somebody really be evil? Doesn’t everybody have the potential for good? He was just in a bad mood, and he did not mean to do that, right?</p>

<p>My naiveté in some ways, kept me in that abusive relationship. Now, I am not ‘victim-blaming’ here. As mentioned earlier, abuse is complex and my abuser was truly evil. At the time, though, I could not think of him as ‘evil’, but now I see differently.</p>

<p>In a society that cherishes moral relativism, I feel that we are drifting further away from believing things or people are actual evil. Because of this attitude, I feel that is why some evil continues to exist. ‘They can’t be pedophiles – they are our leaders!’ ‘Satanism isn’t real – they don’t actually do any of that stuff!’ ‘He is the leader of the church – how could he do something wrong?’</p>

<p>This types of beliefs keep people trapped in this ideology that there is no true evil in the world. Perhaps it is protection, or perhaps in some ways, many of us have developed some type of ‘Stockholm syndrome’ to deal with the evil in our nation. While I cannot find a perfect word for this, I feel that many are simply in denial of evil in our nation. In this article on good and evil, Koch writes,</p>

<p>“Peck’s serious point was that the problem with the New Age movement and prevailing attitudes today was the denial, not so much of Hell, as of the existence of evil. Peck believed that evil was an ever-present part of life and he marshalled some good evidence for that view. But I think the hardest issue for a thinking person to decide today is whether good and evil really exist at all, as a force outside (as well as within) humanity.

<p>To me, the question is not whether or not evil exists because I have experienced it first hand. However, I realize that not all have, and the conspiracy behind this all is that in  world where many believe evil no longer exists…well, more evil will happen. 
In this post, I not only want to support my claim that evil exits, but I also want to explain how people are blinded by evil itself, and how that may have severe implications. I also want to discuss some of my own experiences with the occult, and my exposure to evil entities firsthand. </p>

<p><em>Warnings (I have to do this for sh</em>**<em>):</em></p>

<p>You do not have to believe my story, and there are maybe different explanations to things I have experienced, and I am open to them. It is hard to share some of my experiences, so I am hoping that people can at least have an open mind. In the end, it is up to you to decide what is true, and this is just one story of many. Please do not mock me for my experiences.</p>

<p><strong>Denial and Comfort</strong></p>

<p>When I finally grew brave enough, I did finally share with a few friends that I had been abused, and that I needed their support. I was shocked to see so many people completely dismiss my story, and remember, these were my friends. One of my friends even invited him over for dinner a few weeks after I told her of the abuse! Quite honestly, I feel it just may have been too shocking for them to even consider I might be telling the truth. I’m not really even sure anymore. </p>

<p>I feel like the reactions of my friends is a great indicator of our culture and society altogether. In America, I feel that people are more comfortable and distracted than ever. In constant comfort, it is difficult to relate to those who are suffering. Sure, we may feel bad about things we here on the news, but we may simply may not be able to relate to it. Here are a few contributors:</p>

<p>*People are experiencing information overload: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567422308000367">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567422308000367</a>  </p>

<p>*People are too distracted to care about what is happening in the world around them:</p>

<p><a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2016/01/20/research-college-students-more-distracted-than-ever.aspx">https://campustechnology.com/articles/2016/01/20/research-college-students-more-distracted-than-ever.aspx</a></p>

<p>*People are removed from situations because they are experiencing through a screen most of the time. Studies show that our screens are likely making us less empathetic:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2014/08/are-our-phones-making-us-less-empathetic.html">https://www.thecut.com/2014/08/are-our-phones-making-us-less-empathetic.html</a></p>

<p>*In fact, many are in denial that evil even exists, and I’ll discuss moral relativism in a moment:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/the_spectator/2011/09/does_evil_exist_neuroscientists_say_no_.html">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/the_spectator/2011/09/does_evil_exist_neuroscientists_say_no_.html</a></p>

<p>The problem is that whether we are too comfortable, too busy, too distracted, or too disconnected, we become removed from the true evil that exists in this world.</p>

<p><strong>Moral Relativism</strong></p>

<p>This is my favorite topic to fight about online, but I will keep it simple. The new age movement is on the rise, and there is this new kind of belief that all is ‘good’ and necessary, even the bad. While I can understand that argument to extent, and I do believe there are shades of greys when it comes to certain moral situations, the truth still stands that there is true evil in this world. Just in case you do not know,</p>

<p>“Moral Relativism (or Ethical Relativism) is the position that moral or ethical propositions do not reflect objective and/or universal moral truths, but instead make claims relative to social, cultural, historical or personal circumstances. It does not deny outright the truth-value or justification of moral statements (as some forms of Moral Anti-Realism do), but affirms relative forms of them. It may be described by the common aphorism: “When in Rome, do as the Romans do.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_moral_relativism.html">http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_moral_relativism.html</a></p>

<p>Again, I am not denying that there are not shades of grey in many moral circumstances, but to say objectively that there is no true good or evil in the world seems ridiculous to me, especially when I think about really vile situations (like the ones I have experience din life). When I think of the most evil situation I can think of, I think of someone willingly raping and torturing a child. Is that objectively evil? Could anybody defend that situation in any way? I’m sure you could think of countless truly, purely evil situations in your mind, and I think we could agree that the situation I mentioned is truly evil. If you do not agree, defend yourself in the comments.</p>

<p>There is a rise, however, of new age spirituality in a secular society:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.scienceonreligion.org/index.php/news-research/research-updates/561-the-rise-of-new-age-spirituality-in-secular-society">http://www.scienceonreligion.org/index.php/news-research/research-updates/561-the-rise-of-new-age-spirituality-in-secular-society</a></p>

<p>I have found that many ‘new agers’ buy into moral relativism, though I of course cannot generalize all who believe in new age religion. Some common aspects of the new age movement are &quot;all is love&quot; and &quot;all is good&quot; and &quot;everything in life is a part of God and not separate from God in any way.&quot;</p>

<p>I also know that religion itself is on the decline, and many views about morals come from religious texts and institutions. This decline in religion may have spurred the rise in moral relativism:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/phil-zuckerman/religion-declining-secula_b_9889398.html">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/phil-zuckerman/religion-declining-secula_b_9889398.html</a></p>

<p>In an age of rising secularism, what do we base our morals on? What is right or wrong? I believe we are living in an ‘anything goes’ society, and many people believe that ‘as long as it makes them happy’ argument!</p>

<p>I could probably think of thousands examples of this, but something that springs to mind is the person who intentionally blinded themselves:</p>

<p><a href="http://people.com/celebrity/jewel-shuping-blinds-herself-with-drain-cleaner/">http://people.com/celebrity/jewel-shuping-blinds-herself-with-drain-cleaner/</a></p>

<p>Was her decision right because it made her happy? I feel like this is where society is headed on many levels. </p>

<p>I can probably keep going on this topic, but there is so much more to explore.</p>

<p><strong>Satanism, The Occult, and Darkness</strong></p>

<p>What actually inspired me to write this post was a comment I posted on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> earlier. I will post it here if you have not read it yet:</p>

<p>“So I&#39;m going go write this even though it may not be well-received.</p>

<p>In my abusive relationship with my ex, I feel I witnessed demons of many levels.</p>

<p>1) He drank heavily. One summer he decided to quit drinking. We, together, poured mountains of alcohol into the drain. As we poured the last bottle, we both literally heard hard footsteps walking away. </p>

<p>Nobody was home. </p>

<p>2) That sobriety did not last very long. One night we were partying with friends. I did not drunk much (maybe a beer or two). I fell asleep, and I woke up randomly. Nobody has to believe this part.</p>

<p>I saw three dark beings looking over me. At first I thought it was my ex and his friends, but I looked on the floor and they were all passed out drunk. Suddenly the beings realized I saw them and started whispering frantically, as if they couldn&#39;t understand how I was seeing them. </p>

<p>They disappeared, and at the time, I thought maybe I was dreaming. Now I&#39;m not so sure.</p>

<p>3) In his rages, he would strangle and beat me. In this state, nothing. Nothing could connect with him on a human level. No matter how much I cried and begged for him to stop, he would not. To me, it was as if possessed by demons.</p>

<p>But even if NOT, he had no element of humanity at these points. He was not human (at least in those moments)
I have many more stories, and I have since escaped the relationship. I talk about this abuse a lot as it is my way with trying to cope and understand it.</p>

<p>When he was beating me to near death, though, there is really no way to understand or justify it. Again, I would say he had his very own set of demons.</p>

<p>You know how they call some alcohol spirits? I think that it is possible demons attach themselves to certain things.</p>

<p>4) His eyes. I have not seen him in a long time, but his eyes are empty. The bible does say eyes are the window to the soul, and maybe it is possible to lose your soul to demons or another force. His eyes are dark and empty now, and they weren&#39;t always that way.”</p>

<p>What I wanted to explore further was that many deny the existence of anything beyond their physical selves. Either there is something beyond this material world we see, or there is nothing. I lean on the side that there is something. Will physics and spirituality be the next grand unification?:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/%7Ebdj10/articles/physicsandspirituality.pdf">http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~bdj10/articles/physicsandspirituality.pdf</a></p>

<p>Now before I get into the interesting part about my experiences with demons, I wanted to talk about Satanism, the Occult, and other belief systems:</p>

<p>*Satanism – There is this belief that Satanism is just a friendly movement in response to anti-intellectualism and Christianity, as well as a rise of ‘science as the ultimate truth’ (aka scientism). While that may be true on some level, I believe that this is how they hide things in plain sight. By making Satanism seem harmless, we ignore that there are some really eerie things associated with Satanism and Satan himself. While there are those who may profess to be Satanists and not believe in Satan, there are certainly people who are Satanists and do believe in Satan.</p>

<p>There are thousands of articles about people sacrificing lives for Satan, and whether you think Satan is real or not is not really important because <strong>they do.</strong>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/most-feared-gang-mara-salvatrucha-ms13-america-satanic-ritual-sacrifice-teenage-girl-satan-alvarez-a7623826.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/most-feared-gang-mara-salvatrucha-ms13-america-satanic-ritual-sacrifice-teenage-girl-satan-alvarez-a7623826.html</a></p>

<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2016/03/13/officials-probe-satanic-animal-sacrifices-on-long-island/">https://nypost.com/2016/03/13/officials-probe-satanic-animal-sacrifices-on-long-island/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4417964/Newborn-Easter-lamb-DECAPITATED-Satanic-sacrifice.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4417964/Newborn-Easter-lamb-DECAPITATED-Satanic-sacrifice.html</a></p>

<p>I could just keep posting these and posting these. Just a side note, though, I always found it creepy that people willingly would subscribe to Satanism EVEN IF they were doing so in the name of secularism, science, or whatever. The reason is because even if they feel Satan is not real, Satan is still associated with evil to many! Sure, the after school Satan clubs are there just to educate our children and promote knowledge:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.snopes.com/after-school-satan-clubs/">https://www.snopes.com/after-school-satan-clubs/</a></p>

<p>Maybe, but I would call this ‘hidden in plain sight’ and I am NOT buying into it. </p>

<p>*Modern witchcraft and magic are on the rise:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/these-modern-witches-want-to-cast-a-spell-on-you">https://www.thedailybeast.com/these-modern-witches-want-to-cast-a-spell-on-you</a></p>

<p>Whatever you feel about magic, there are certainly people who do believe in magic, and as a teen, I dove into modern witchcraft and even participated in it on some level. I bought spell books, books on numerology, and so on.</p>

<p>There is this illusion that there is dark magic and white magic, but that is a lie, in my opinion. I do not think there is such thing as good magic, as you would have to have purely good intentions when participating in magic, and I do not think that is possible (I can talk more about this in the comments if anybody is interested). White magic is believed to be used for selfless purposes, but I think that is a complete contradiction in and of itself.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_magic">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_magic</a></p>

<p>‘They’ try to paint witchcraft a harmless, but I believe witchcraft is evil, no matter how it is painted in the media. And to make this clear, witchcraft is on the rise:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/americas/salem-witchcraft-scene-magic-tourism-feminism-hipster-modern-day-massachusetts-new-england-donald-a7877521.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/americas/salem-witchcraft-scene-magic-tourism-feminism-hipster-modern-day-massachusetts-new-england-donald-a7877521.html</a> </p>

<p>*Occultism - This is where I could probably write for a long time, but I find it fascinating that there are so many who post on conspiracy forums, but they never seem to think that occultism is associated with any conspiracy theory (no matter how much they hear about the elite Satanic pedophile rings and Satanic sexual abuse).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_satanic_ritual_abuse_allegations">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_satanic_ritual_abuse_allegations</a></p>

<p>While occultism can branch in many directions, let’s not forget the rise of modern occultism through Aleister Crowley, who seemed to bring it to the masses:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley</a></p>

<p>Aliester Crowley popularized the “Law of Thelema”, or “do what thou wilt”, and does that not go back to an increasingly “morally relativistic” society? </p>

<p>What people usually tend to miss here is that occultism is directly linked with Satanism and practices such as sacrifice and pedophilia. While not all occultists may participate in those things, some do.</p>

<p>I am honestly not going to link here as nothing I will say will be proof to people. No matter how many stories we hear about occultism in Hollywood, Pizzagate, elite pedophile rings, etc., people refuse to believe that they have any connection to occult practices. Whatever you really believe, I wanted to share some of my story with you.</p>

<p>The point of this section is that many are largely in denial that there are many that participate and believe in the Occult, magic, and dark Satanism, and many may not realize that the very people practicing these things may be our friends, family, and our leaders. </p>

<p>And, to me, this goes back to my original point – people are in denial of the true evil that exists in the world. </p>

<p>(Just a side note: modern witchcraft may have more harmless terminology like “dimensional jumping” or “white magic” and so on). </p>

<p><strong>Part of my story</strong></p>

<p>My post is going to be longer than usual (haha…sorry) because I wanted to include the path that led me to evil. While I cannot include everything, I want to include the most relevant parts without revealing everything about me in the process.</p>

<p>My family always believed in ghosts, and from an early age, I remember talking about ghosts with my dad. My dad would tell me ghost stories of his childhood, and I honestly had a few ghosts experiences growing up. My dad’s side of the family was always very interested in the occult, and I just considered this all normal – not seeing darkness in it at all. I felt there may be some good that could happen in communicating with ghosts and spirits. This point is important because there was a bit of normalization and desensitization of it all. Recently, I re-watched Beetlejuice (used to be one of my favorite movies), and I was completely shocked by what I now see as the glorification of demonic activity. Anyway…</p>

<p>In my teens, my dad got even deeper into ghost hunting. He regularly made me part of his adventures, and he often wanted me to be part of them because he said I was the best at communicating with spirits. Think what you will of that.</p>

<p>One day, my dad wanted to do an actual séance to communicate with some spirits in the house. I thought, why not? As my bedroom seemed to be the most haunted, we did the séance in there. </p>

<p>We sat in a circle and asked to communicate with presence(s) in the room. We used a tape recorder, and we asked questions, not hearing anything at the time.</p>

<p>We did this for about ten minutes, pausing after each question.
When we played back the audio, I was horrified. Not only was something responding to us, but it clearly told us that it wanted to kill us. It cursed at us – it was not a good spirit. There was also a voice of a little girl, and that saddened me (though I wonder if these evil spirits can disguise their voices).</p>

<p>For the next few years, we did these séances, though we did not always get good pictures or audio. Sometimes we did. Something always felt off about it to me, though, but having no real religious or spiritual convictions at the time, I never really thought much of it.</p>

<p>During the next few years though, my life became very difficult. To summarize, my mom had a complete mental breakdown, I fell into an abusive relationship (as noted earlier), and there were many other dark happenings in my life that I cannot note all here. The paranormal in my parents’ house was increasing exponentially at the time. </p>

<p>Throughout the next several years, I lived in the middle of nowhere with my ex, and I had many paranormal experiences. It is important to note that I almost NEVER felt a positive presence with these paranormal experiences. There was always something negative. </p>

<p>With my ex, though, as mentioned earlier, I began to see evil as real. No matter what we were doing, there was always something ‘dark’ following him, so it seemed. In his family, there was abuse, murder, and suicide on many levels. It was even said his aunt was a witch, but who can ever know the truth?</p>

<p>When he would drink, I would not, and that is when I saw the true demons come out. It wasn’t always through just physical abuse. Sometimes he would talk to somebody in the room when he was completely drunk, but I never saw anything.</p>

<p>Maybe he was mentally ill, and that is quite the possibility, but there are just too many experiences to dismiss that there was not some paranormal element involved.</p>

<p>When he would get so drunk, it was almost as something else would take over him. His eyes would darken, and no amount of pleading could make him stop. I came to accept the abuse I was experiencing. I remember one night after he painfully beat me, I could have sworn I saw a shadow lurking behind him with red eyes. Or maybe I was just so delirious after the beating that it was all in my head.</p>

<p>I want to tell you this, though, I should have died so many times. There were times he would drive drunk and we would be inches from death. There were times he punched me and strangled me until I was unconscious. How I ever lived through those things is still a mystery to me.</p>

<p>I did finally escape the relationship, but there were still dark forces in my life. When I finally began recognizing evil, I began searching for the root of evil. </p>

<p>As my mom sank into deeper mental illness, I couldn’t help and start question the occultism practices my dad was participating in. I began to become increasingly uncomfortable – as somebody who experienced demons, I just could not see the ‘good’ in it anymore.</p>

<p>And that’s the danger maybe. In some ways, it seems harmless, but I have finally come to a conclusion that when you open yourself up like that, you open yourself to a world of entities, no matter what ‘protections’ you take.</p>

<p>I remember one time, me and my ex invented our own card game where we communicated with some spirits. We asked some questions about the future, and we used a code to determine the answer based on whatever card was drawn. Harmless right?
Well, this happened in my older sister’s house, and she had no idea we did that. She told me that there was some type of strange activity occurring after we left, and it never went away. I did eventually admit to the card game, and I felt really guilty for opening her house up to that. </p>

<p>For the final part of this story, I remember one stormy night, I was relaxing and watching tv in the living room with my ex. All of the sudden, we heard a banging on the door. It was his cousins (who lived nearby). They were running from something, and we let them in. Seconds later, his meth-induced aunt came in about to beat them. I stood there and looked her right in the eyes. She was about to kill me (I’m not kidding).  I mean, this woman was 300 lbs., and now that I ook back, she regularly beat her children. But she stopped. I don’t know what stopped her. What I do know is that three of her husbands killed themselves.</p>

<p>Where I live(d) is an area of great poverty, and while I am not tying poverty to evil, I am saying it was not until I experienced these situations did I see the capacity for evil. In my great comfort before, I could not imagine the evil experiences I went through.</p>

<p>I could probably write the rest of the night on this, but I know that most will only read so many pages. I’m willing to share the thousands of other experiences I have had, but it would take a whole book. </p>

<p>I am also sharing this as a warning. Evil does exist, and while there are likely good spirits, I’m not sure any of them are worth the risk of communicating with. Also, even if you do not believe the paranormal parts of my posts, I want those reading, who may have no seen evil yet in their lives, to see that it really does exist. </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>It is so easy to ignore and deny evil when we have endless amounts of distractions and comforts.</p>

<p>To me, abuse is one of the greatest forms of evil. I am deeply fascinated in MK ultra, as abuse is used to fragment people’s minds and control them. Abuse is about control on a large level, and maybe, just maybe, there are some demons who feed off of abuse. </p>

<p>I did not have time to go through every story in my post, but I have been abused physically, emotionally, and sexually in other ways in my life, which as noted earlier, likely led me to the abusive relationship with my ex.</p>

<p>In other words, as a teen and child, I normalized the abuse I experienced, so it was not too crazy for me to end up in the relationship I did.</p>

<p>Now that I am older, I am seeing that we live in a society that normalizes evil in the world – from wars, to shootings, to corruption…you name it!</p>

<p>In these situations, somebody is being abused or overpowered, and maybe that is why I am so into conspiracies. </p>

<p>Ultimately, my search for understanding of evil brought me to understanding of light and good and truth. Though I may never be able to step inside the mind of a truly evil person, I can now see that it evil does exist, but good does exist, too.</p>

<p>To end on a more positive note:</p>

<p>““When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they can seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall. Think of it--always.” 
― Mahatma Gandhi”</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 13 4-8:</p>

<p>“4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 
5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 
6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 
7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. 
8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. “</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So only bad things occur because evil and the devil? Thats your logic? You probably also believe without a religious text how can humans possibly have morals. Also its clear that im stating these events are negative but to say evil is a whole another level. I drank alcohol last night. Didnt abuse my gf or anything else crazy. I passed out on my couch listening to classical music. If spirits inspired that then you have it wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe in duality surely. Night and day, cold and hot, good and bad. Within this however is the gray area, the in between where most of us lay. We tell white lies or do something bad to maybe protect the ones we love. There is no absolute in any human although i do think we imagine it where it doesn&#39;t exist. Beating anyone in my opinion is wrong because i just dont ascribe to physical violence. Words are enough in most cases unless you&#39;re defending yourself. But to say the action is EVIL completely negates the possibilities and situations where its completely necessary. Therefore to answer your question i believe humans created EVIL in search for an excuse for own pit falls. So in one sense evil does exist but in another is completely fabricated. Humans are the problem not anything else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a purely anthropological sense we most likely define it as light/day as safe and dark/night as unsafe. Meaning more dangers at night because of the predators that do their bidding under the cover of night. Thus leading to the attribution of this duality to human actions. Please be sure we had a sense of good and bad long, long before the bible or any other religious text. The bible isn&#39;t a paragon of what is absolute good or absolute bad either. It very much exists in the gray area depending on context. Moving on, you define good and bad based on what brings pain, what limits access to food and water and what outright kills you. Everything else is culturally/contextually relative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh ok. So nevermind Egyptians or the Sumerians. Everything started 4000 ys ago with the biblical god? And your argument is basically if you dont agree that the bible is the only moral compass then you&#39;re a relativist? I have a profound sense of what is good or bad without the bible and always have. Whats absurd is your sordid position towards people who dont believe the bible verbatim. You people are the real cancer on this earth and hide behind some illusionary moral high ground when in reality i bet your conversation with God wouldn&#39;t go over well. You confuse questioning with disbelief, inquiry with blasphemy, and you probably think Jesus agrees with everything you believe and want to see people like me burn for eternity. Is that good? Is wishing for the eternal damination of certain people &quot;Godly&quot;? Now its time for you to answer some questions. </p>

<p>Hit a nerve I see. I&#39;m just asking you to logically defend your position. Never put myself on any &#39;high ground&#39;. But, when I met God, He&#39;s going to have a standard He&#39;ll compare me against. In the end, it isn&#39;t about works, but if I match up to what His rules were, doesn&#39;t that put one in a better place than someone who just &quot;winged it&quot;</p>

<p>If you&#39;re just looking back to the Egyptians and Sumerians, you&#39;re not going back far enough. Fun exercise tho, look and see what those cultures (and others around the timeframe) have to say about a worldwide Flood. </p>

If there is some outside force acting on us then its not absolute but suggestive which means the decision still lays with us in the end. You also dont acknowledge how priests in your religion are rampant pedophiles. I dont understand how you could ever defend such actions but condemn others of new age philosophy as if they were all demons incarnate. Pls expound on this notion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not support the institutions and corruption of religion.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t rely on a church for salvation. I rely on Christ.</p>

<p>I was raised Catholic and I think Catholics are being totally misled. With that being said, only God would be able to judge them.</p>

<p>I think most religious institutions have been riddled with corruption.</p>

<p>But if you read the bible, it clearly explains how churches were started and how they should run. Most churches are not following the bible. They are not doing what is right.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t support organised religion. Nowhere in the bible does it say you have to go to church. It talks about worship and fellowship.</p>

<p>Now I do go to a non denominational church because I do enjoy the fellowship and worship. Am I bound to it? I do not feel I am. There have been times I have even disagreed with the pastor.</p>

<p>With that being said, they are doing the best they can.</p>

<p>Christianity has been tainted, and I can see that even when going on Christian subreddits. People are dogmatic and so set in their ways that I&#39;m not even sure what can be done.</p>

<p>It is possible to be a follower of Christ and not dependent on organised religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where do you stand on the Hebrew writings such as &quot;The Book of Jubilees&quot; which is a retelling of Genesis, to my comprehension?  </p>

<p>Fascinating how it gives parallax view on the same events, thereby increasing knowledge.  And seems to be authentically read in history too, and not so much a modern invention.  </p>

<p>Apparently there used to be 9 times more spirits on the earth than today.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Book of Jubilees [Chapter 10]</p>

<p>And in the third week of this jubilee the unclean demons began to lead astray the children of the sons of Noah, and to make to err and destroy them.</p>

<p>And he prayed before the Lord his God, and said:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>   &#39;God of the spirits of all flesh, who hast shown mercy unto me 

    And hast saved me and my sons from the waters of the flood,

    And hast not caused me to perish as Thou didst the sons of perdition;

    For Thy grace has been great towards me,

    And great has been Thy mercy to my soul;

    Let Thy grace be lift up upon my sons, 

    And let not wicked spirits rule over them

    Lest they should destroy them from the earth.
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>But do Thou bless me and my sons, that we may increase and Multiply and replenish the earth.</p>

<p>And Thou knowest how <strong>Thy Watchers, the fathers of these spirits,</strong> acted in my day: and <strong>as for these spirits which are living,</strong> imprison them and hold them fast in the place of condemnation, and let them not bring destruction on the sons of thy servant, my God; for these are malignant, and created in order to destroy.</p>

<p>And let them not rule over the spirits of the living; for Thou alone canst exercise dominion over them. And let them not have power over the sons of the righteous from henceforth and for evermore.&#39;</p>

<p>And the Lord our God bade us to bind all.</p>

<p>And the chief of the spirits, Mastêmâ, came and said: &#39;Lord, Creator, let some of them remain before me, and let them harken to my voice, and do all that I shall say unto them; for if some of them are not left to me, I shall not be able to execute the power of my will on the sons of men; for these are for corruption and leading astray before my judgment, for great is the wickedness of the sons of men.&#39;</p>

<p>And He said: <strong>Let the tenth part of them remain before him,</strong> and let nine parts descend into the place of condemnation.&#39;</p>

<p>And one of us He commanded that we should teach Noah all their medicines; for He knew that they would not walk in uprightness, nor strive in righteousness.</p>

<p>And we did according to all His words: all the malignant evil ones we bound in the place of condemnation and a tenth part of them we left that they might be subject before Satan on the earth.</p>

<p>And we explained to Noah all the medicines of their diseases, together with their seductions, how he might heal them with herbs of the earth.</p>

<p>And Noah wrote down all things in a book as we instructed him concerning every kind of medicine. Thus the evil spirits were precluded from (hurting) the sons of Noah.</p>

<p>And he gave all that he had written to Shem, his eldest son; for he loved him exceedingly above all his sons.</p>

<p>And Noah slept with his fathers, and was buried on Mount Lubar in the land of Ararat.</p>

<p>Nine hundred and fifty years he completed in his life, nineteen jubilees and two weeks and five years. [1659 A.M.]</p>

<p>And in his life on earth he excelled the children of men save Enoch because of the righteousness, wherein he was perfect. For Enoch&#39;s office was ordained for a testimony to the generations of the world, so that he should recount all the deeds of generation unto generation, till the day of judgment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same here.  1 Enoch and Jubilees, as well as Jasher, have a lot of important information in them.  I also like the &quot;Testament of the twelve patriarchs&quot;.</p>

<p>It seems like the DDS have proven that the copies we have available today are almost identical to what was available 2000+ years ago, and the bible itself tells us that the characters in the old testament probably read those books.  </p>

<p>Maybe I can invite you to our private chat room.  It&#39;s mostly scriptural study but we have been studying the books mentioned above as well.  You would be most welcome and fit in well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where do you get your copies of them from? I have several versions of Enoch, but I don&#39;t know how to judge the accuracy of any of them over each other. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always been interested in Jashar, particularly to see if there is any more details provided about the sun/moon standing still during the battle as it is &quot;recorded in the Book of Jashar&quot; from Joshua 10:13, as well as 2 Samuel 1:18. I believe this to be a real, tangible celestial phenomenon as described that was NOT a mere solar/lunar eclipse.</p>

<p>Jubilees i&#39;m interested in also, not so much for the extra-genesis aspect but more about the cycles of years. I firmly believe God has everything divided into equal parts with absolute perfect sovereign timing, and the 120 jubilees cycle of man (120 x 50 = 6000) fits perfectly with the book-ends of 6day (1day = 1000 years) creation parallel, plus the sabbath 1000yr millennial reign that&#39;s somewhere near around the corner.</p>

<p>Never heard of the 12 Patriarchs book. Does it talk about the nephilim and hybrids/chimera being the primary reason for the flood?</p>

<p>As long as it&#39;s not considered part of the Roman Catholic extra-canonical books, I don&#39;t care to have any association with anything they endorse =O)</p>

<p>The DDS being found in 1946/1947 is divinely timed, imo. I view it as something the Lord tucked away for ~2k years, saved to be revealed to our generation, knowing it would be needed. Partly due &quot;re-certify&quot; that the accuracy of our Tanakh we have today is indeed exceptionally accurate, in addition to the potential of some of those other books being hidden from the general populace (of course with the caveat that the Lord wished for them to stay that way, as all is revealed in time according to His will).</p>

<p>Both Enoch and Jashar can easily be supported by 2+ witnesses in the 66 book canonical Bible, in addition to the Book of War (songs for war time), and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there are more confirmed in there too i&#39;m not aware of. I know there is controversy around the separations of Enoch though..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Btw, me and Jacob are both in the room right now!  Want to join us, brother?  We&#39;re discussing Acts and a possible tribulation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure the Catholics hate the books we are reading, haha.  I think they were kept out of the Catholic bible to lead people away from the views popular in ancient Israel and more towards a &quot;seminary&quot; view.  The idea that the fallen angels mated with humans is not popular, but it seems to be what scripture says.</p>

<p>Regarding Joshua&#39;s long day, we just had a thread about how there is no possible way that was an eclipse!  </p>

<p>Jubilees is an amazing book, and both it and the &quot;12 Patriarchs&quot; does a wonderful job of communicating very clearly that the watchers falling and sleeping with human women was THE PRIMARY reason for the flood and maybe even the reason for a lot of the violence found in the old testament.  </p>

<p>I agree that the DDS make it very obvious the Tanakh has not changed much over the thousands of years.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, a little under half of the patriachs mention it.  it is interesting to see them all aged and repentant.  Even the ones who made serious errors when younger advise the youth to strongly repent and respect the Creator&#39;s Law.  A little under half of them caution the youth about the flood and the true cause for it and the far reaching problems from genetic and spiritual corruption.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/patriarchs-charles.html">http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/patriarchs-charles.html</a></p>

<p>Example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Paragraph 3: 1 Be ye, therefore, not eager to corrupt your doings through covetousness or with vain words to beguile your souls; because if ye keep silence in purity of heart, ye shall understand how to hold 2 fast the will of God, and to cast away the will of Beliar. Sun and moon and stars change not their 3 order; so do ye also change not the law of God in the disorderliness of your doings. The Gentiles went astray, and forsook the Lord, and changed their order, and obeyed stocks and stones, spirits of 4 deceit. But ye shall not be so, my children, recognizing in the firmament, in the earth, and in the sea, and in all created things, the Lord who made all things, that ye become not as Sodom, which 5 changed the order of nature. In like manner the Watchers also changed the order of their nature, whom the Lord cursed at the flood, on whose account He made the earth without inhabitants and fruitless.</p>

<p>I too come from a background of abuse and empathize with much of what you say in regards to seeing evil first hand. Trauma is traumatic and the price to deal with it is tangible. It&#39;s a scary thing when the spirit in the body isn&#39;t the person you expect and it wakes you up to the possibility that you never can be too sure who you are dealing with, let lone trust.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s the general distrust of the world that helps bring us to be more conspiracy minded? </p>

<p>I guess I can say it here as well. Good and evil can pretty much be boiled down to intent.   Harbouring malignant intent in your actions is evil, harbouring righteous intent is good.  </p>

<p>i&#39;m really in both camps. objective evil always exists, as a possibility, at least. but it&#39;s only extant (actually instantiated/created with reality) due to errors in our environment, ideaology, and society. there is nothing the says evil <em>inherently</em> walks the earth, as u/polkadotgirl says. anything we describe as &#39;evil&#39; is categorically preventable, we just haven&#39;t done so because we don&#39;t yet have the experiance to build an environment/ideaology/society conducive towards preventing &#39;evil&#39; from manifesting ... which is important for humanity to really get on top of it.</p>

<p>cause trying to fight &#39;evil&#39; in the incorrect (or perhaps i&#39;d even call &#39;evil&#39;) ways ... only leads to more evil.</p>

<p>... huh, would your definition of evil include slavery? because while slavery did hurt the slavers, the main intent was economic benefit, not hurt the slaves. so i&#39;m not sure i&#39;d agree with your distinction, as i do see there is a lot of unintentional evil caused ignoring others suffering in order to get ahead in society, even today. and i think such evil is <em>just</em> as essentially relevant as something more direct like rape. </p>

<p>and this kind of indirect evil is that humanity <em>really</em> needs to be addressing. because you&#39;re right, evil sort of has this negative influence on things around it, which if left unchecked, can lead to more evil manifesting. and as far as i can tell, <em>all</em> cases of more ostensible evil are caused by a buildup of unintentional, more subtle, but definitively extant evil ... and that&#39;s the kind of subtle evil humanity needs to get tuned into. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I think the &quot;we are all one&quot; saying is correct, but its also true for when we continually make each other suffer, it sticks around somehow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i would tend to agree with this. and see that humanity <em>more than ought to</em>, and is probably existentially required to, optimize society around <em>eliminating</em> evil if it wishes to survive. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basically the idea that I&#39;m you, you&#39;re me so we should be aware of our fellow mans suffering.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>here&#39;s another thought for you, just because:</p>

<p>i&#39;m not aware of the other man&#39;s suffering, should i be made to suffer until i become aware?</p>

<p>Homesxuality is a disease vector into normal culture.  It is a parasitic entity that sits inside a normal balanced masculine and feminine culture and preys upon little children and weak willed men to bring disease and conflict into normal society hindering the growth and development or progress of any group that becomes strong willed enough to resist the &#39;agenda&#39; or the &#39;program&#39; of the Old World Order.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take &#39;islam&#39; something that is purported by the MSM to be semitic in origin and anti-homosexual.  Few people realize that within the &#39;rewards of islam&#39; are cup-bearers (little slave boys who are subject to pederasty unwillingly AKA RAPED) as part of the &#39;proper muslims&#39; reward in heaven.  These &#39;little angels&#39; are not even allow to defecate and are &#39;always willing&#39; to receive some arab cock in their poop shoot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Koran singles out sex between men as a transgression, but uniquely in the Islamic holy book, proscribes no punishment. And there must be four independent witnesses to the act of anal intercourse (all other forms of gay sex seem to have escaped Allah’s attention). So it’s just a warning not to have sex in the middle of the street. Even then, for those caught, social rehabilitation is encouraged. Elsewhere, <strong>the Koran describes ‘cup bearers’ awaiting the faithful in heaven</strong>: beautiful, beardless, <strong>servile youths who never age or defecate</strong>. The implication is that they will be forever young, handsome, ready and willing. It’s almost enough to make a stubborn atheist contemplate deathbed conversion, just on the off-chance. </p>

<p>Come on, not a religion in the world is geared towards women.  They are all by men, for men (outside European Paganism which is on its last leg as the semitic horde floods into our nations to ruin them and ruin Indo-European culture)...the last gasp of the feminine (creative/generative force) on Earth...and you can&#39;t seem to believe that all male religions are a <a href="https://i.redd.it/h9dho0hsl99y.jpg">homosexual occult theocracy</a> or here the <a href="http://hiddentearsproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Logo-for-Bacha-Bazi.jpg">bacha bazi boys</a> or the pedo catholics or the tantic male sacrifices (rape of males at the peak of their power as the final stage in their innitiation) or the Mithras Cults (Male bride ceremonies; no women allowed) or the catholics who won&#39;t let women even speak in church or islamist men who can beat and kill their women?  Thing is Dart, I know WHY they do all these things...so believe me or not, it won&#39;t matter in the end, but it isn&#39;t &#39;going to go well&#39; if they get their way...the planet is hanging on by a thread already.</p>

<p>IYO there is no longstanding &#39;war against women&#39; or <a href="https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/document/194001010/fit_to_size/149x198/2000fe5008/1459873138">homosexual occult theocracy</a> yeah, right...the attempt of the homosexual male to destroy women and the feminine relgions and feminine principles is outrageously blatant and in your face...there really isn&#39;t a way to contradict it.</p>

<p>Women were the first slaves on this planet and they will be the last to be released.  </p>

<p>No Dart it is not fair for men to bring their disease that they catch being homosexual home to their wives.  It destroys the parents, destroys the trust/household and destroys society.  I am not &#39;obsessed with someone else&#39;s sexuality&#39; I don&#39;t want immoral parasitism (and that is all homosexuality is) OF ANY KIND to exist in my culture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, In a universe of positive + and Negative -, and spectrum in-between, I would have to agree Evil surely does exist. 
I mean, I believe in Love, in Light, in a greater good in myself as well as in the universe, but it would be hard to believe in the light if there was no dark. Without the evil, I would have to question even believing in the light. So for me, I know there is Evil out there, not only by experiencing it first hand, seeing it in media, and reading about it throughout history, but I know it is real because of how real I know the light to be. 
Ive always felt drawn to the positive and negative scale, and its resemblance found in a lot of our universe. From complete light all the way to absolute dark.

    <div class="md"><p>Couple thoughts.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What people usually tend to miss here is that occultism is directly linked with Satanism and practices such as sacrifice and pedophilia. While not all occultists may participate in those things, some do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Christianity and Catholicism are also directly linked to human sacrifice and pedophilia. Human sacrifice is a motif that pops up in the Bible every now and then.  I&#39;ve been learning about the occult recently so I just wanted to point this out. I think many people mistakenly identify occult with dark or negative. </p>

<p>This guy has a pretty in depth and impartial video series about occult science if you&#39;re interested. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is this illusion that there is dark magic and white magic, but that is a lie, in my opinion. I do not think there is such thing as good magic, as you would have to have purely good intentions when participating in magic, and I do not think that is possible (I can talk more about this in the comments if anybody is interested)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I remember correctly you&#39;re a Christian. So you have to allow that good magic does exist then. How else could Jesus walk on water, raise the dead, etc.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evil does exist, and while there are likely good spirits, I’m not sure any of them are worth the risk of communicating with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is the saddest part of the post. Evil wins here as it smothers the desire to seek out good spirits. </p>

<p>I believe all your dads problems with evil can be traced back to alcohol. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The source of the English word alcohol comes from the Arabic word al ghoul not from the current Arabic word al kuhool which is actually a semi modern introduction from the English alcohol which in turn was modified from the original Arabic word al ghoul</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word alcohol comes from the word ghoul. We even call liquor spirits. There are a few ways that evil can enter someone&#39;s body and in modern society alcohol is probably the most prevalent and celebrated. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a crazy world out there and you&#39;ve done very well considering all you&#39;ve been through. I hesitate to give advice because it&#39;s impossible to truly know someone&#39;s situation and experience, but maybe don&#39;t give up on the power of good spirits and magic. There are wonderful beings here to help those who need it. Be not afraid. Don&#39;t unintentionally turn your back on the good because you&#39;re afraid of the bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post. You lamented on a few ideas that I would love to expand on. </p>

<p>I inherently believe all humans have the capacity to radiate pure goodness, love and empathy. That is what I refer to as the higher self. It is our connection to all, and everything. It is the God within us. The ego, on the other, is what convinces us different. </p>

<p>Society is the means of how we become corrupted. Violent tv, movies, media etc all work towards corrupting us. Suffering that we cannot understand or comprehend, becomes buried in our subconscious. If we continue to feed it with more pain and suffering, it can manifest itself as a an alter ego. It’s becomes its own self, a self of pure hate, fear and lack of empathy.  Maybe alcohol is just the key to open the door for it to take control? </p>

<p>That evil self has only 1 goal. To make others feel the pain, and suffering it feels everyday. It would be foolish to deny the possibility of negative entities using that pain, hate and fear as a source of energy they can latch onto. Anything is possible, and the truth surprises me more and more everyday. </p>

<p>Wall Street is an excellent example. The only way to succeed in this world is to willingly crush all your competitors. Whether you discredit their reputation, family, career or life. Society stokes our egos that we are better than everyone else, and is creating a generation of sociopaths. It’s no coincidence CEO’s and entrepreneurs have a higher than normal chance of being a sociopath.  They had to crush everyone who got in their way to get to the top. </p>

<p>The ego will do everything in its power to grasp onto its control. I believe the term you are looking for is cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance is the discomfort faced by an individual when they hold contradicting beliefs. While I guess I still consider myself a Christian, I am overwhelming opposed to a organized hierarchy. The majority of so-called Christians and Catholics promote this warped and twisted idea of unconditional love promoted by their church, while their actions outside of the church  completely contradict themselves. The ego would much rather live in ignorance, because the truth will break its hold over the high self. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely.  It raises questions that people go in dark places to look for answers.</p>

<p>It also can take the analyst into a new level of understanding the enemy.  Emotions and objective reality isn&#39;t something to be afraid of. It&#39;s the fear that enables the loss of control.  </p>

<p>Our brainwashing makes us stumble into evil situations but it&#39;s our conditioning that keeps responding to the fear.  </p>

<p>Those that use fear don&#39;t fear it to get their way on this plane. </p>

<p>We can take it back the other way. </p>

<p>i&#39;m going to have to say i&#39;m not convinced you&#39;ve got any more grasp on reality than OP ... i don&#39;t even see that as a corruptible influence, we could use more gays, we have way too many people making babies at the moment. </p>

<p>that doesn&#39;t change the fact you are obsessed with someone else&#39;s sexuality.</p>

<p>and the fact you can&#39;t recognize that is indicative of a lack of grasp on rational situational analysis.</p>
