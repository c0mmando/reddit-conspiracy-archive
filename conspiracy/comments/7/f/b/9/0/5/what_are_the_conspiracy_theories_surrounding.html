       I for one, don't trust anything straight from the Government's mouth and the mainstream press.

      <p>
       Is there anything on North Korea contradictory to the official history and current situation of North Korea?

       I don't know about North Korea, but as far as South Korea, the current and last leaders of that country have been Roman Catholics and the last one who was involved in a politcal scandal was trained by Jesuits. If you have been following
       <a href="/r/RomeRules">

       or my post history, you will know that the Jesuit Vatican exercises great influence over nearly every nation on Earth.

       Is there competition between the Vatican, Israel and the house of Saud, or does the Jesuit Vatican have the greatest influence?

       Thanks for your question.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jesuit Vatican is the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Prince behind the Saudi 9/11 involvement who resigned 10 days before 9/11 and was the head of the Saudi Intelligence Agency was trained by Jesuits; his name is Turki bin Faisal Al Saud. The head of the CIA during 9/11 was George tenet who was trained by Jesuits at the same school as Al Faisal: Georgetown University. Also, the head JINSA which the neo-con Project for a New American Century was a front for, was trained by Jesuits at the same Georgetown University.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, the Pope owns the Temple Mount (which is the most Holy site for Jews ) and the Old City of Jerusalem thanks to the Jesuit-trained Shimon Perez, past president of Israel who serves Vatican interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, the Jews and Sunni Muslims including the Saudis serve Rome.

       What exactly do the jesuits "train" and how do they manage to gain so much power?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tried reading the spiritual exercises of Ignatius Loyola but its all very religious and out of my grasp.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any good sources/books to learn more about this society ?

       For example,
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/RomeRules/comments/7et9vn/ferdinand_ii_and_maximilian_i_were_trained_by/">
        "Holy Roman Emperor" Ferdinand II was trained in the genocidal papal counter-reformation to launch the Thirty Years War
       </a>
       which was championed and created by the Jesuits. The Jesuits have been responsible for various assassinations including that of Henry III to that of Abraham Lincoln.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also,
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/RomeRules/comments/7aglpc/georgetown_universitys_jesuit_edmund_walsh_school/">
        Jesuit Georgetown University is the highest ranking in the world for international diplomacy studies.
       </a>
       That alone reveals much.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a good brief overview of the Jesuit Order I would recommend the chapter in
       <em>
        A History Of Political And Religious Persecutions
       </em>
       By F. Garrido And C.b. Cayley published 1873 which deals with the Jesuits.

       Veritas is right. The Jews are a distraction, the scapegoat thrown out their as disinfo. The real meat and Potato's is the Jesuits. Who clearly have most of the world at their feet. Most of the leaders in Europe are Jesuit educated. Now theres a Jesuit Pope and Trump is Jesuit educated with his VP Mike Pence a Catholic. Trump has also put into positions many other jesuit educated servants.

       Even if they do own the Temple Mount, doesn’t mean they’re necessarily at the top of the pyramid. They could be 2nd or 3rd. Or 2 groups join together to  conspire against the 1, or even all 3 are on equal footing, 3 heads of the same dragon. Also what about the secret bloodline families of Venice? Aren’t they a 4th group pulling the string? In addition to the Chinese and Russians and US Deep S, all hold power

       I think that NK is a puppet country. An artificial boogeyman that is being used to set the world stage for “nuclear war”.

       At age 17, Kim il sung joined an underground Marxist group. 3 years later joins the Chinese Communist party (bankrolled by Rothschilds)Here Kim met the man who would become his mentor as a Communist, Wei Zhengmin, Kim's immediate superior officer, who served at the time as chairman of the Political Committee of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army. Wei reported directly to Kang Sheng, a high-ranking party member close to Mao Zedong (Also funded by Rothschilds!)
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1940, after being chased out of Korea by the Japanese, he escaped into Russia, and joined the Rothchilds Red Army throughout all of WW2!
      </p>
      <p>
       The Soviet Union declared war on Japan on 8 August 1945, and the Red Army entered Pyongyang on 24 August 1945. Stalin (Successor of Rothschilds man Lennon) had instructed Lavrentiy Beria to recommend a Communist leader for the Soviet-occupied territories and Beria met Kim several times before recommending him to Stalin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Originally, the Soviets preferred Cho Man-sik to lead a popular front government, but Cho refused to support a UN-backed trusteeship and clashed with Kim.

      <p>
       This has Rothchilds written all over it!

       His oldest son (you may have heard of him) Kim Jung-il is said to have received schooling at the university of Malta! Fucking Knights of Malta connection!
      </p>
      <p>
       Current leader Kim Jung Un also received schooling in Switzerland.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there is little to no doubt in my mind that the ruling party is deeply connected to the International bankers. Including the Rothschilds. The fact that Jung Il recieved schooling (supposedly) at the University of Malta could be a connection to the Jesuits as well, but I am not sure. u/Veritas__Aequitas could answer that.

       Here’s one:
NK is the direct beneficiary of the uranium 1 / Iran deal orchestrated by the Obama administration. As a result, the current nuclear escalation and emboldened attitude of KJU has been fueled by the surreptitious green light given by the Clowns In America puppet Obama, in order to undermine Trump’s administrations intentions to drain the swamp.
