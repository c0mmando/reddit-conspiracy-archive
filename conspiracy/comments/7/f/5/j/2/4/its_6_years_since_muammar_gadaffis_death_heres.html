        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><em>It’s exactly 6Years  since Muammar Gadaffi was Killed</em>    <em>Here are Muamar Gaddafi&#39;s Prophecies:</em>  I will not go into exile to any foreign country. I was born here in Libya, and I will die here. This country was a dessert, and I turned it into a forest, where everything can grow. No one Love this land more more than its citizens. If Europe and America tells you that they love you, be careful. They love the wealth of your land. The oil and not the people. They are helping you to fight against me but, it will be more wise for you to fight against them because they are fighting against your future and progress.  My message to you the people of Libya is, they are helping you to kill me but you will pay the price because you will suffer. And my message to you America and Europe is, you will kill me, but be ready to fight a never ending TERRORISM. Before you realise your ignorance, terrorists will be hitting you at your doorstep.&quot;  GADDAFI once told the Nigerian and British governments to divide Nigeria into two, so that the Hausa/Fulani (Moslems), Yoruba (Christians) and Biafrans/Igbo, can live as neighbouring countries.  It&#39;s good we look at these 16 REAL REASONS WHY COL. GADDAFI WAS KILLED: 1. There is no electricity bill in Libya, electricity is free for all its citizens. 2. There is no interest on loans, banks in Libya are state-owned and loans given to all its citizens are at a 0% interest by law. 3. Home is considered a human right in Libya. Gaddafi vowed that his parents would not get a house until everyone in Libya had a home. 4. All newlyweds in Libya receive $60,000 Dinars (US$50,000) from the government to buy their first apartment. 5. Education and medical treatments are free in Libya. Before Gaddafi, only 25% of Libyans were literates. Today, the figure stands at 83%. 6. Libyans taking up farming as a career, they received farm land, a farming house, equipment, seeds and livestock to kick- start their farms – all for free. 7. If Libyans cannot find the education or medical facilities they needed in Libya, the government funded them to go abroad for it. 8. In Gaddafi&#39;s Libya, if a Libyan buys a car, the government subsidized 50% of the price. 9. The price of petrol in Libya is $0. 14 per liter. 10. Libya has no external debt and its reserves amount to $150 billion – now frozen globally. 11. If a Libyan is unable to get employment after graduation, the state would pay the average salary of the profession as if he or she is employed until employment is found. 12. A portion of Libyan oil sale is credited directly to the bank accounts of all Libyan citizens. 13. A mother who gave birth to a child under Gaddafi, received US $5,000 as child benefit upfront. 14. 40 loaves of bread in Libya costs $ 0.15 15. 25% of Libyans have a university degree 16. Gaddafi carried out the world’s largest irrigation project, known as the Great Man- Made River Project, to make water readily available throughout the desert country. If this is called &quot;Dictatorship&quot;, I wonder what type of Leadership Democrats have!! Share this to remember Gaddafi```</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This tired, obama administration narrative falls apart when you realize that if china decided to invade us their president would be talking about all the human rights violations we commit against the blacks (police brutality) and then they&#39;d come in and arm the freedom fighters (local gangs). Btw congratulations on knowing that ghadafi was a bad guy. Now read up on the other 20 years. You show your bias so flagrantly. It&#39;s clear that the only info you&#39;ve ever consumed on this topic is the msm narrative of his reign from 1970-90. The other half (90-10) is such a 360 that it warrants the question; <em>why did we remove arguably the best leader of any muslim country?</em> </p>

<p>But it instantly failed as it is backed by a physical supply guarded by that one man. It is a bad idea and that is why it got no where and ended in disaster. You cannot keep a country together without oil and oil is both finite and can be extracted at a known pace. We balance our dollar off the oil and now our money backed by nothing seems pretty appetizing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I really don&#39;t buy the offical narrative on him. I agree that it was probably over the gold dinar.</p>

<p>He went from someone the US didn&#39;t give a shit about to someone we hated then someone we were <a href="https://www.americancrossroads.org/2015/11/video-hillary-was-for-libyas-murderous-tyrant-before-she-was-against-him/">becoming friends with (see H. Clinton)</a> and then suddenly someone we hated again. </p>

<p>Then there is the whole famous talk by NATO Surpreme Allied Commander General Wesley Clark about how he was privy to a memo that said that the US had a plan to take out certain countries and Libya was on the list. </p>

<p>When all the shit was going down I remember all the Western media was showing exactly the same stuff so I went and looked for things elsewhere to see if others were saying the same things. I very much remember a young woman who couldn&#39;t have been more than 20 screaming how the people of Libya wanted him to stay in power. Maybe she was full of shit and speaking on behalf of people she shouldn&#39;t have but it really stuck with me especially as I read facts like those listed in this post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>heh just the other day some user posted a claim that it was found that he stole more than $200 Billion.</p>

<p>Not allegedly not maybe - but he straigh up posted the claim as if it was fact.</p>

<p>I asked for source and he gave me this</p>

<p><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/21/world/la-fg-kadafi-money-20111022">LA Times article</a></p>

<p>so when you read it </p>

<p>LA Time&#39;s source for the estimate is &quot;according to senior Libyan officials.&quot;</p>

<p>basically the guys who were working with US government, so they can sitt in chairs after Gaddafi is gone and talk about how bad Gaddafi was and how good America and Europe is for &quot;New Libya&quot;</p>

<p>Not really the best source for &quot;estimate&quot; (?)</p>

<p><strong>BUT most importantly</strong> article says</p>

<p>*If the values prove accurate... *</p>

<p>so we really do not know.</p>

<p>That did not stop him to post this no-data as fact.</p>

<p>Also education in libya is free and if you for example become an electrician through the educational program even if you dont get a job you will still be payed by the government the same amount as you would have gotten if you were working. So in this way your income is quaranteed and becoming homeless is not as easy as in america where it can happen if you lose your job or get sick.</p>

<p>But also it had it&#39;s Gulag&#39;s and other Crimes committed on behalf of Stalin.</p>

<p>Also if Gaddafi was that fine and brave dictator as some of you see him, why so many of the libyan fought against him? Why there was the majority of the population defemdimg him or right now saying he was a good and great dictator for the libyans?</p>

<p>Not hard to say it&#39;s nowadays in a number of cases much more worse than it was with Gaddafi, but making him a saint is out of context.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gadaffi was framed just like Saddam Hussein and now the North Korean president. Hussein wanted to stop selling oil in USD so that he could switch to Euros; the devilish US government framed him knowing that his proposed policy would be against their interest, then they flooded Iraq, guess where the marines were sent to to protect first, Oil wells (same thing with Afghanistan). 
   Al hassad and Kim Jong of N.korea are being hunted, not because of whatever allegations the mainstream media puts out, but because of oil and the lack of a functional central bank. If they are eventually removed, we&#39;ll also hear stories of their good works that were suppressed by the media.
Libya had the best economy in Africa under Gadaffi, using the Gold Dinar; the US and other &quot;first world powers&quot; saw them as a threat and decided to take him out. What pains me is that people are gullible, swallowing anything they&#39;re told on the news, that&#39;s why more good and well-meaning leaders will keep on being killed and the gullible public will keep on rejoicing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree.  But most of those &#39;points&#39; in that list are totally fabricated, and so copypastaing them and then claiming you are trying to &#39;convey the truth&#39; is somewhat counterproductive.</p>

<p>Ultimately though, &#39;the west&#39; did not murder him.  He was murdered after being dragged out of a drainage pipe where he was hiding because Libyans were absolutely sick of him.</p>

<p>Claiming that he was killed &quot;by the west&quot; is really a very western-centric view which completely ignores the people he had been mis-treating for decades.  Obviously we played a part, but he wasn&#39;t brought down by the CIA or something, he was killed as a result of &#39;mob justice&#39; after stupidly ordering his army to fire on crowds of protesters in Bengazi, killing hundreds, triggering a revolt which had been long in the making, by himself.</p>

<p>Its Bill and Hillary...From the time Willy took office as Governor of Arkansas to the end of his presidency they have both left a wake of death, suffering, murder and scandal.....
Whatever either one touches turns to shit and those who think the Clinton death count is just coincidence has their head buried in the sand...</p>

<p>Not to mention Whitewater, the Clinton foundation mismanagement of 100&#39;s of millions of dollars in Haiti.... Benghazi...Vince Foster...the list could literally fill a 300 page book and then some.</p>

<p>The failed election was a testament to what people think of her as she truly believed she was a lock to win.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a Trump fan, however, if she had won I couldn&#39;t even fathom the damage she would have caused not only our country...but the world.</p>

<p>It&#39;s beyond me how many people adore but also look the other way concerning the scandal ridden duo.
The man could be mistaken for the devil but yet he is still more popular than ever and our wonderful Secretary of States <a href="http://hiddenamericans.com/politics/hillary-clintons-top-10-scandals/">list of accomplishments</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, he was so loved <em>half</em> the country rose in revolt and he ended up with a bayonet up his ass. Even more damning, a large chunk of his own government, his own appointees, turned against him.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve said it before in regards to the USSR collapsing, and the reason we&#39;re in the situation we are in now, and I&#39;ll say it again: People <strong>never</strong> <em>never</em> revolt and throw away a working (and the bar on working can be pretty low at times) system. No amount of CIA or KGB meddling will change that. They can pour billions into it. If the people aren&#39;t upset, they aren&#39;t going to revolt. I mean come on, if it were really that easy America would have no enemies because they all would&#39;ve been toppled. At best you&#39;re going to be able to get malcontent on board, but never a significant number of people.</p>

<p>Every single &#39;positive&#39; thing he did the Saudis did and twice as better -- that&#39;s how they&#39;ve held out for so long, they basically bribe the populace. Are you going to praise them too? Thought not. </p>

<p>Obama may have been a &quot;cool cat&quot; but he&#39;s a war criminal just like any other US president.  It&#39;s almost as if, war crimes are the United States&#39; foreign policy.... :3</p>

<p>Gaddafi was a piece of shit and if you lived in Libya during the years leading up to his death I bet you&#39;d be one of the millions revolting against him. </p>

<p>Libyans lived in terror of their government. I can&#39;t believe people think that just because the country&#39;s gone to shit after he was toppled that he was a good man worthy of praise. </p>

<p>Here’s some simple rules for you up and coming dictators:</p>

<p>Don’t take credit for blowing up airliners
Don’t kidnap and rape your own citizens 
Don’t try to undercut the currency of a super power 
Don’t dress like RuPaul let herself go</p>
