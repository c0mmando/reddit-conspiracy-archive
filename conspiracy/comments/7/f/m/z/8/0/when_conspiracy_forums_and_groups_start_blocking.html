       First of all, when you say "admins" I presume you are talking about the mods of this subreddit. Sub policy is that we don't censor content, unless a post contravenes reddit or
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       sidebar rules. This means that we don't remove flat earth posts, or anything else conspiracy related, without a good reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to "official mod comments" (where, like here, the username will be in green) mods of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       also contribute as subreddit members, and we express our own opinions. These comments are purely personal, and do not reflect an "official canon of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       " - because no such thing exists. We do have a wiki of "confirmed conspiracies" admitted by the perpetrators, but many of these are likely to limited hangouts (ie not the whole truth). This sub neither endorses nor rejects any specific conspiracy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally speaking, I don't think mods should be seen to denigrate or attack a conspiracy theory (eg flat earth), because it can be misconstrued. That doesn't mean that we can't make observations which we think the promulgators of a theory have not been adequately able to answer (eg how researchers in Antarctic weather stations experience 24hrs of daylight during the Southern Hemisphere summer, and/or why they are unable to see the Pole Star at any time of year.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that very fringe conspiracy theories don't get much love from the majority of users, and flat earth posts invariably get downvoted. The mods can't control that.

       Actually, not at all. It was an incident that happened in a Facebook group, and I told people here with the hopes that everyone was enough to prevent this type of behavior in thier own lives. How that flew past you is beyond me.

       The response OP gave makes me think this wasn't posted with honesty. He writes as if he's talking about moderators of this sub, and when called out by the mods, he retracts and claims he's not even referring to Reddit. Perhaps you should edit his response into your comment so more people will see it.

       Flat earth is a psy op. Anyone who believes it is either a shill or a useful idiot. It's the correct course of action to dismiss the brainwashed.

       You are falling into the trap of free and open discussion. The flat earth is meant to discredit this movement as a whole. We must identify these movements and purge them.

       So, uh, honest question here. It appears you believe Antarctica is a ~60mi high wall of ice. Lots of scientists and laypeople have (claimed to have, I suppose) lived on Antarctica, where were they?

       playing devils advocate here but i don't think the claim is that the wall is that high, it's an exageration, Antarctica scientist could have not gone inland enough to meet the much smaller wall... as for the poles magnetism, can't we only measure north and then derive south from it?

       You wouldn't be able to tell when the poles "stop" or reverse though. We know where this occurs, as you cross the pole, because people have physically gone to the poles before. Anyone can pick up a compass and hop on a boat and put on a warm coat and hike for a long time until they reach the poles themselves. Not easy due to the cold weather, but its been (allegedly) done before.

       I'm not sure why one would click on this one and not the other, it has all the same issues... finite distance of light, and different starscapes at different locations become something of a mystery, both of these could perhaps be reconciled by directional projection but i never see any of this in all the models presented, for a good reason, it would be quite the can of worms hahaha... then you got the tides, why do they like the moon more than the sun? And then shouldn't we see the wall from pretty much anywhere on earth in this model? i understand that it's exaggerated but surely if the that's accurate a good telescope pointed south (anywhere actually) would show a wall of ice?

       You didn't answer the question. If the Earth is flat, you could see the ice wall from any elevated point, with sufficient magnification. Why has this not been observed? Why can't you see the North Star from the southern hemisphere?

       Doesn't matter, if the Earth is flat you should be able to see it. No curvature to hide it.

       no, it is asymptotic towards convergence. parallel lines on a flat plane would converge at a distance of infinity.

       I think this community is in a place where allowing anyone to post anything in the name of freethink and anti-censorship creates an environment where anyone can post anything no matter how crazy, with little to no sources to back it up (which I consider trolling), and allows people with fiery rhetoric clickbait platforms to haul in the clicks and views for profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, I do think that mods and admins need to draw the line somewhere as these things have the potential to threaten the credibility of the community. The problem is no matter where you draw the line, SOMEONE is going to get pissed.

       I'm sorry but I see this posted everywhere here and I have to ask- what 'credibility' does this sub actually have? Anyone who investigates conspiracies instantly has no credibility to those who buy into official narratives, at least in my personal experience. It seems like a line that's thrown out there to write off conflicting ideas and stifle discussion (not accusing you of this, just something I've noticed all over this sub the last few months).

       Because it’s not a black and white “either you’re a conspiracy theorist who buys everything wholesale” or “you Support the official narrative” thing.
      </p>

       This sub is a spectrum of “hey here is something really well thought out, with evidence” to “ crazy clickbait bullshit so I can get views and clicks horseshit”.

       I’m an example of someone who came here interested in learning about conspiracy theories, but has been mostly turned off by people posting troll ass shit, people posting shit that’s been posted a hundred times (and debunked), and people who are willing to overlook evidence (or lack there of) if it goes against what they want to believe.

Hi.
If other male created words hurt your male culturally mind formed mind why not go to North Korea? or any country that doesn't allow free thought. Humans like you who think they can classify words as troll words or not are hypocrites. The man wars that protected your free speech would go in vain if your kind was in charge. You are too deep in the man story of life... run with your kind of mind and stop humans from thinking unless like your child mind.

Hi.
Typical man words of sarcasm to defect their fears of excepting how their minds were culturally mind formed and locked by the man story of life. Did you ever ask yourself why your mind formed thoughts are right and you defend them but another mind formed mind is wrong. Your wrong mind formed mind thoughts needs deprogramming .

Hi
Which humans a few of your friends that want control of all narrative?
What new humans to earth would agree with your mind formed thoughts? Don't judge another human's mind forming unless looking at your's. Lets see you know what words mean troll... you know which human man words are laughable. You have no idea who you are but sure if you look deep enough will find the males that formed your so called mind of others.

       My favorite is when they use Wikipedia as proof that a conspiracy is debunked. It's just as bad as using NASA as a source. Those of us that have researched conspiracy topics for years would never say "no that's not true because NASA said x,y, or z"

       How many people understand concepts like

        'primary source' vs 'secondary source'
       </a>
       or inductive vs deductive logic? Most schools today don't teach these things, which is why I am sympathetic to people who clearly have nfi how to arrive at logical opinions. It is not their fault, really.

       Only one? That's easy. Here's the main one: the author inaccurately describes the Cavendish Experiment and displays insufficient knowledge of the experiment. He included just enough to sucker in people to giving his website traffic. Either way, you're basing your ENTIRE argument off an opinion, one that is misinformed and spouted off as fact. Those are the most dangerous, and you're only fanning the flame.

       Cavendish Experiment is legit. It is not at all how your shitty article described it. Also, he found the density of the Earth, leading to the finding of the Gravitational Constant. Not the weight, like your article posited. You should learn how to tell a good source from a bad source before linking it.

       What evidence or logic? All I saw was derision. If you would explain to me the logic of why it is impossible to use a torsion pendulum oy obtain the gravitational constant(which can further be used to estimate the mass of the earth), I'd be happy to respond to you.

       I think if you want to post flat earth stuff here, go for it. But you know what I also think? If the majority of posters here comment "flat earth, so stupid" - then why not just create r/flatearth_conspiracy or something? I'm not saying go and build up walls - but don't let some random internet gatekeepers censor you blindly across the board.

       One of the greatest things about America is that it is built on dissent. So start up your own subreddit and dissent from the dissenters.
      </p>
      <p>
       But really - I don't think anyone should tell anyone else their idea is "stupid" - I think we should continue to ask
       <em>
        intelligent and engaging questions
       </em>
       * and see what questions simply can't be answered and which ones eventually lead to an "ah-ha" moment. Either for the believer or the doubter.

       Flat Earthers will be welcome once they stop posting over and over the same old fallacies they keep falling for, and bring something robust to the table.... surely at some point, one of them will grab a plane and fly south...? When they do, they can report their findings in, whatever they may be, but creating "yet another here is why i believe the earth is flat" thread is getting old, especially seeing as they don't survive basic scrutiny.

       But what is it that conspiracy forums claim to fight? Lies primarily, right? So I can see how suppression of certain opinions if perceived to b false can lead to suppression and on the other hand championing if seen as plausible, fruitful, insightful.

       I don't think they claim it. If they would, I thought lies is a top choice. Those who like to talk about Conspiracy like "exposing lies". Many content is titled "truth about. .." I'm sure there's much else we could say they claim to fight, if they were to claim to fight something. ..

       It's important to note: when OP talks about "conspiracy forums," he is not referring to Reddit. This is what he said in response to the mod above:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Wasn’t even referring to Reddit. The only reason I posted it here is because it’s human behavior people in all these types of communities have to deal with. Have a good day

       What's your point exactly?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe the Holocaust happened like they said it did, I believe Jews were killed sure, I believe Hitler was a bad racist guy, I don't believe the official narrative we've been fed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been proven that the number of people killed at Auschwitz.
      </p>
      <p>
       People can express whatever opinion they like, we can't be thought police and control what people can and can not think and say that's just wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even people with perverse, sick, twisted thoughts and opinions, I'd rather they come out and be public with those thoughts and opinions so they can be debated and reasoned with, rather than be underground.

       Basic math, there's no way that many Jews could have died, when you take into account the amount of crematoriums there were, the amount of survivors and the amount dead you'd easily see that that it was mathematically impossible for them to have killed that many Jews at Auschwitz.

       You prove to me otherwise and that the figure they gave was correct and not inflated.

       Use whatever camera you like, you'll still see the curvature of the Earth. I'm not even going to bother to reply to any more of your comments because flat earthers REFUSE point blank to believe even the hardest of evidence.

       I only speak for myself but I believe flat earth is a psy-op to make conspiracy theories look bad, and perhaps discredit hollow earth-theories specifically. Thus I believe people who spout that nonsense are paid CIA shills, and not someone genuine.

       Was just throwing out another idea on the theory.   Maybe its not caves and shit, maybe it's a tunneling civilization, a fantasy interpretation of real life.  Much more believable to me, especially when you consider all the underground work being done at the time of the origins of the hollow earth theory.

       Maybe we should market the idea as "Honeycomb Earth" or something like that to get people started in a more worthwhile use of their time. Humans are very much like moles. Tunnels....tunnels everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Underground tunnels are an excellent way to transport goods and people without detection, especially from satellite imagery. Underground fortresses may house clandestine military facilities.

       The ironic thing is that by shitting on flat earthers it actually made me reconsider it. Since I went to a university and grew up with the globe earth model, I of course immediately rejected the flat earth model due to preconceived biases. However, upon reflection I found that I could not verify myself that the Earth is in fact a globe. I have to rely on some theoretical things (a specific gradient of the atmosphere's index of refraction) or evidence that I haven't personally witnessed that could easily be faked (space imagery, star trails at  the equator, etc) in order to verify the globe earth model. The abundance of seemingly faked images from NASA only raises more suspicions. How hard is it to simply have a live feed from a geostationary satellite showing the earth in its entirety? To my knowledge, such evidence does not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't necessarily subscribe to the flat earth theory but to dismiss it without doing the math and looking at the evidence is not the way of a truly open minded investigator. Nothing is as it seems.

       Wouldn't it be way easier to prove that the Earth was flat? But no one seems to have done that.

       However, there is plentiful evidence that the Earth is spherical. Yet for some reason it's suspicious?

       I agree with you 100%. Round-earth has been drilled into our heads since childhood, as an immutable fact. And it probably is. But if you dismiss it without even the slightest consideration, you are conditioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Flat earth is a psy-op" is the real psy-op. The goal is to make you stop thinking, and silence anyone who objects. The organization behind this psy-op is surely using it as an experiment, to gather data, and will use it to counter more serious conspiracy theories when they arise.
      </p>
      <p>
       The existence of flat-earthers is healthy and necessary for our community.

Free speech mean I have to protect your right to say something I disagree with.  Plain and simple. People do not realize this every time they try to shut down or shout down someone they don't like.  They do not realize that once they do it to someone its ok to do it to them.

       You've got the right to say whatever you want. And, other users have the right to deconstruct what you have posted. If what is being posted is a psyop meant to discredit alternative hypothesizing in general, I believe that right becomes a responsibility.

       I agree with you 100%. Round-earth has been drilled into our heads since childhood, as an immutable fact. And it probably is. But if you dismiss it without even the slightest consideration, you are conditioned.

       "Flat earth is a psy-op" is the real psy-op. The goal is to make you stop thinking, and silence anyone who objects. The organization behind this psy-op is surely using it as an experiment, to gather data, and will use it to counter more serious conspiracy theories when they arise.

       The existence of flat-earthers is healthy and necessary for our community.
