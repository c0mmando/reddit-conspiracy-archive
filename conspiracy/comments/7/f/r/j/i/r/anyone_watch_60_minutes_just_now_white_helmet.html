    <div class="md"><p>Qatar is in competition with Saudi Arabia. They have no economic interest in funding ISIS. ISIS was forcefully projecting Saudi Arabia&#39;s oil and pipeline control dreams and playing a proxy to Israel&#39;s &quot;greater Israel&quot; doctrine while providing a steady demand for endless profits for US Military industrial complex and the petrodollar. </p>

<p>ISIS was formed and funded by USA, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. </p>

<p>Qatar is more sided with Iran and if they are funding any opposition force it would most likely be <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/29/middleeast/hezbollah-isis/index.html">Hezbollah which played a critical role in assisting Syrian and Lebanon forces in purging ISIS.</a></p>

<p>The White Helmets were part of a psyop to cover for US-Saudi-Israel aggression and false flags. </p>

<p>Would never bet there were no war crimes commited by his side of the war, but just using one&#39;s own brain should should tell everyone that using chemical weapons is an invitation to get even more hostile foreign interference. Noone in his right mind would do that especially if he is currently winning anyway. So far many claims were made and portrayed as facts but little to no proof of his guilt provided.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t the story about Qatar funding ISIS reported predominantly by Israel, who treat ISIS soldiers? To me the evidence points far closer to Saudi who are not friends with Qatar atm. </p>

<p>Notice how most of the time in the segment when they mentioned an airstrike or a bombing they simply stated it as such and didn&#39;t specify &quot;assad&#39;s airstrike&quot;. It&#39;s a subtle propaganda tactic where they want you to assume that all the airstrikes that happened in syria were done by assad, and more importantly it leaves them plausible deniability should they ever come under scrutiny. &quot;We never said who did the bombing! Just did everything we could to imply it!&quot;</p>
