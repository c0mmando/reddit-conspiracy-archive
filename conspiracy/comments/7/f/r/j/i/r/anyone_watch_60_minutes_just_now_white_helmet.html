       Qatar is in competition with Saudi Arabia. They have no economic interest in funding ISIS. ISIS was forcefully projecting Saudi Arabia's oil and pipeline control dreams and playing a proxy to Israel's "greater Israel" doctrine while providing a steady demand for endless profits for US Military industrial complex and the petrodollar.

       ISIS was formed and funded by USA, Israel, and Saudi Arabia.

       Qatar is more sided with Iran and if they are funding any opposition force it would most likely be

       Assad very likely is guilty of war crimes. I don't see how anyone could wage a 'clean' war against ISIS, though.

       Would never bet there were no war crimes commited by his side of the war, but just using one's own brain should should tell everyone that using chemical weapons is an invitation to get even more hostile foreign interference. Noone in his right mind would do that especially if he is currently winning anyway. So far many claims were made and portrayed as facts but little to no proof of his guilt provided.

       First part is obvious propaganda,

       Isn't the story about Qatar funding ISIS reported predominantly by Israel, who treat ISIS soldiers? To me the evidence points far closer to Saudi who are not friends with Qatar atm.

       Notice how most of the time in the segment when they mentioned an airstrike or a bombing they simply stated it as such and didn't specify "assad's airstrike". It's a subtle propaganda tactic where they want you to assume that all the airstrikes that happened in syria were done by assad, and more importantly it leaves them plausible deniability should they ever come under scrutiny. "We never said who did the bombing! Just did everything we could to imply it!"

       I watched it.  That is some of the sleaziest pretension of 'journalism' that I've seen in quite some time.  CBS billed this as 'Assad's War on Hospitals'.  No one should doubt the ongoing complicity of CBS in the conspiracy of the Government of the USA to overthrow the Government of Syria by Jihadist terrorists.
