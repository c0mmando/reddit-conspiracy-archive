    <div class="md"><p>his comment. Consumers paying high prices, to billionaires, makes it harder to argue players are paid too little.</p>

<p>Consumers are paying this money regardless of how it is distributed to the billionaire owners or millionaire players. </p>

<p>You can argue that the conspiracy is forcing consumers to spend their money on sports. However, it is incorrect to say &quot;they&quot; provide sports to us and pay the athletes a lot of money in order to further this &quot;circus&quot; as he says. These are market forces</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, what he&#39;s saying is that they pay the athletes well so they&#39;ll play. If the players play, then the audience is taken away from having the time to think about how they&#39;re getting fucked over. A distraction. By making it a big spectacle, they&#39;re capturing their audiences time and resources.</p>

<p>Also, like he alluded to, whats more important, some sweaty dudes chasing a ball, or the TPTB conspiring against us?  </p>

<p>bread, circus and barbarians at the gate is still active to this day as it was during roman/Egyptian times  </p>

<p>Agreed. The same can be said for TV and Movies. A distr from the banksters and oiligarchy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Always wondered what the big fuss was over pro sports, especially football. Why do athletes get paid more than highly skilled scientists, doctors, or engineers? The highest paid public employee is a college football coach. </p>

<p>Although the players are helping to advance research on various injuries, specifically brain ones...is that the only silver lining? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing I can think of is that alot of spectators watch the sports, so they bring in alot more revenue, but you&#39;re right, those other disciplines should be making more than them. </p>

<p>If you really think about it, people put these athletes up on a pedestal simply because they&#39;re good at chasing a ball. How does that progress us as a society? </p>

<p>I think sports should exist and people should be allowed to enjoy them, but idolizing these teams/players while we have our rights and freedoms slowly being taken away, how messed up is that.</p>

<p>Imagine if all these sports fanatics put as much energy into fixing this corrupt system for just 2 years, what a difference it&#39;d make. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They do it because people want it. It keeps the masses satisfied and happy. Gladiators where actually well paid, and hardly got executed. We as poeple want violence of some kind. Its in our nature. People will find somethimg to fill their time with no matter what. A football game dont take up but a hour and half a week for most people. Tv and the web on the other hand ,take up way more time. Plus you can actually control peoples thoughts with these two</p>
