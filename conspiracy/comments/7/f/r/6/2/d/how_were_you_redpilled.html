       Personally, this was around September of 2016, I was on a r/The_Donald post and there was a string of comments mentioning how r/pizzagate was banned and how they moved to voat. I decided to check it out because the comments were mentioning how they banned it since they were getting too close to the truth (keep in mind i had no idea what pizzagate was about at the time). So I went on voat and after looking at some posts, the red pill was officially swallowed.

       Red pill / blue pill is an over simplification. It's a heuristic, a mental shortcut. While there is truth to it there is also deception. The idea has been hijacked by the very ones you're woke to.

       I think that would reference a disproportionate social response orchestrated in an attempt to gain political leverage by exploiting tragedies of black men justly or unjustly killed by policemen under the impression they were doing their jobs.

       That it was a disaster for a town riddled with issues already. That msm played people like a fiddle? People stopped thinking for themselves. A town was destroyed. Poor children went without food for a week because School was closed for the disruption and destruction going on. Innocent business owners lost their livelihood because of punks bussed in to “protest”. Corruption ran thick within and without of the whole situation.

       Oh yes children with money for rifles and shotguns and fishing gear yet no money for food. So logical. It doesn’t take much to be a decent human or think actively about  the demographic nature of that area. And because of how the adults behave in that region the children are automatically put into the same category. It’s a damn shame.

       Voted Obama in 2012.  Worked with his administration on Fed funding at state levels and with ACA.  Total crock of shit dirt bag politics.  Couldn't believe this was the guy who I voted for.  Gave him several chances but each time I was let down.  He was a total puppet and his 2nd 3rd layers of leadership were total frauds.  Media would never ask the tough questions.  Realized it was all a big orchestrated mob taking advantage of the people.

       Things like reptiles, flat earth and jew hating are completely ridiculous. Holocaust denial is a monstrosity and it makes me sad when people believe it to be bullshit. A lady I know went to auswitz and her story of what she saw brought her to tears, then myself. Whole rooms of hair and spectacles is horrifying.

       they were both ones i never wanted to believe, but after enough investigation, it became apparent to me the truth of them. for the reptilians one i would say the celebrities eyes changing is pretty damning, as well as looking into the research david icke has done. for flat earth, one video that got me was zooming in on the toronto skyline from 30 miles away and seeing the base of every building, where curvature wouldnt let you see that.

       I have full memory of 9/11 including watching the smoke rising from the Pentagon from my office. I was working on the Pentagon Renovation (PENREN) program and installing networking gear into wedge 2, which is where the 'plane' hit. The wing was mostly empty of people but included a Navy intelligence wing and some critical data if I remember correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have full recollection of telling my wife that none of this made sense, Iraq literally didn't attack us. I was a rabid liberal anti-Bush sort of guy, and continue to at least be anti-Bush, but it's weird in hindsight to literally see the problem but lack the mental capacity to see the conspiracy.

       What is the redpill though? It's like asking "what is time"? Well, it's complicated and somewhat subjective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll offer one theory. People that consider themselves "redpilled" are basing their moral high-ground on survival. They try to rationally consider what it is they are seeing and it's especially notable since it's in direct conflict with what they are being told.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see how this can cover a lot of different "redpilled" folks, from the gangbanger in the ghetto that knows firsthand how the game works to the born and raised Minnesotan who is now trying to navigate the Muslim majority and foreign values being forced upon them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also involves a number of people on the internet with too much free fucking time on their hands, but then you have the alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those that base their moral high-ground on virtue. They spend their time trying to put everyone else into different categories based upon race, religion, gender, political beliefs, sexuality, feelings or mental illness so that they can label people as bigots that don't agree with them and exile them from employment and ultimately, living, because they disagree.

       10 year anniversary of 9/11. Starting watching news coverage of the event on YouTube as a way to pay my respects I suppose and it didn't take longer before I found myself asking questions. Building 7 was the big one for me. There was no way in hell I was buying the office fire bullshit. Turned my world upside down.

       The biggest issues I have with 9/11 are as follows
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Flying a plane into a building is VERY hard at those speeds
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The 'plane' that hit the pentagon was coming in at an unfathomable low altitude and surprisingly horizontal
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Buildings ONLY fall perfectly down when demolished. I highly doubt that the buildings would have both collapsed the way they did just from the plane impacts. Would they have collapsed or fallen over partially? Surely, but a complete and perfect collapse? Doubtful...
      </p>
      <p>
       4) The "P.A.T.R.I.O.T" act
      </p>
      <p>
       5) The war in Iraq
      </p>

       In 10th grade I looked into 9/11 after visiting the 9/11 memorial, museum, and freedom tower. Then I researched sandy hook. I realized the news is entirely fake. Through personal experience I learned the media and feminism in particular brainwash the youth into throwing away their lives about a year or two later. Being banned from feminist groups for asking questions and geting trolled by already red pilled people was the tipping point.

       I would argue the news isn't entirely fake. They throw in enough truth to string people asking.

       It was dad...somewhere back in the nineties. I remember him talking about JFK and how the official story was a cover up. His theory back then was that he was killed by the CIA for trying to abolish the Federal Reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually can't get him to have a meaningful conversation on anything conspiracy anymore, but in his defense, he's 77 and the forgetfulness has begun to creep in.

       After 9/11. When my boyfriend at the time came back from war he told me some things that confirmed what I was already pondering, and was too scared to talk about others. Let's just say I've known we've been spied on for a long time now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, weird sea creature monster stories that I've heard from people in the service dating back to my grandfather's tales. I thought they were all just pulling my chain but now not so much.

       Reading The Illuminatus! Trilogy by Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea, 20 years ago...
      </p>
      <p>
       It was written in the 70s so already a 'classic' at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Excellent fun and mind-boggling book, I have re-read it 3 times, 1100+ pages, time for another reading soon I think...

       It's about every conspiracy ever and then some all mingled and intertwined together and the authors were obviously doing a lot of LSD and weed while writing it.

       Grade 5. Right after 9/11. My teacher wouldn't teach us what was on the syllabus but about how the government was lying to us instead. My favorite teacher to this day.

       He basically just always had a TV and a map and would show us the news and call them out on lies and show us on the map about the war in Iraq it is hard to remember because of how young I was but I remember loving not having to do real school work but when I got older and became more involved in conspiracies truly started to appreciate him and his teaching method. He also made us do riddles everyday so I think that helped me learn to think outside the box. Such a great man. He truly is a hero.

       There comes a point where you need to ask yourself why there's a disproportionate number of jews telling you what you think, but that doesn't mean that you need to hate or gas anyone.

       I remember my mom in the early 90s telling me how horrible the Clintons were. It wasn't until Hillary tried to run for President that I came to understand. She was a wise woman and I wish she was around to see me now.
