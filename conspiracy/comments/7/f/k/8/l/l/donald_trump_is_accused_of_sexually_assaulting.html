<p><a href="https://postimg.org/image/eo50hgrnf/65dc7a5e/">https://postimg.org/image/eo50hgrnf/65dc7a5e/</a></p>

<p>Despite being #1 in rising, were at 0 upvotes. </p>

<p>it were anybody else (especially a democrat), the people from TD that support trump or whatever demographic seems to take refuge on our sub, would be accusing them of being guilty as sin.</p>

<p>Why does trump get a pass? </p>

<p>Then, when you add in his relationship to Jeffery Epstein (convicted pedophile billionaire), and you learn that they were great Friends and that trump flew on his underage sex plane, you can&#39;t HONESTLY just dismiss this stuff. I know a lot of users in this sub realize this, and the shills seems to try and prop up trumps Image on this sub. It&#39;s getting old.</p>

<p>All the legitimate conspiracy users here need to get this information to the forefront for the rest to see, because it is brigaded and and downvoted heavily.</p>

<p>TPTB don&#39;t wan their puppet president Inolved in a massive sex/pedophiilia scandal, it&#39;s bad for business. </p>

<li><p>He never says he grabbed a pussy.  He said &quot;when you are a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.  Grab them by the pussy.&quot;  This doesn&#39;t imply he DID anything. When people start accusing him of guilt because he said that, it automatically makes me think you are an idiot, because you lack simple reading comprehension, or just regurgitate what someone else is saying.</p></li>
<li><p>Let&#39;s say he has grabbed some pussy for arguments sake.  Have you seen the news lately with all the rape/harassment charges against politicians?  Is there anybody who we could vote for that is blameless?  And if there was, that person didn&#39;t run for president.  It was clinton vs. trump.</p></li>
<li><p>In investigations, you usually have someone who accepts immunity, to spill the beans.  This doesn&#39;t mean that person is blameless, but if that person can be used to take down some big fish, by all means, let&#39;s not pass on that opportunity.  People need to stop being so petty.  There are some proven big fish out there that need to be fried.  We are lucky to have a president that will take on the elite.  Let&#39;s let him take the system down. We haven&#39;t had a chance this good in my lifetime.  Don&#39;t blow it.</p></li>
