    <div class="md"><p>I work with a guy that worked in an Amazon warehouse for their first 3 years in business. He hated it. He constantly talked down on the company. Talked about how miserable everyone was. How he was so much more happy working at our warehousing operation.</p>

<p>But he&#39;s says if he could go back to 1997 and do it again, he would in a heartbeat. He opted to get a small portion of his pay in stock options. Around $1000 at the time. He bought the stock right before quitting. Today it is worth nearly $500,000. Seems like it was worth it to me too.</p>

<p>United States implemented a 90% tax on the super rich
a &quot;myth&quot; that the economy of the United States chugged along at least in part due to higher taxes on the wealthy in the past. First, this myth, like so many about creating prosperity, ignores that U.S. growth came after two world wars wiped out most of our competitors. Second, the implication is that &quot;the rich&quot; were actually paying 90 percent taxes at some point in history. That&#39;s never been the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had to think about this one. I work for myself and the main thing I lack is upfront funding. With 80k handed to me, I can buy at the very least 40,000 items to sell. Those items will sell ranging from $10-40 each. I&#39;ll lowball it and say that investment will yield me $600,000.</p>

<p>Based on my best business year (where I had a steady flow of product) I could make that 600k in about a year - much sooner if I hired a couple college kids (although that would cut into my profit).</p>

<p>I would take 200k and start over, putting the rest into savings. By year 2 the initial 80k would have yielded me over a million dollars.</p>

<p>Over a few years I&#39;d build a nice savings and continue investing in my business. Then I could have both security as far as money, and an off grid mansion on acreage I bought myself.</p>

<p>But again, I had to think about it. That&#39;s a lot of work and I don&#39;t really like money all that much anyways. So if you were to ask me on a day like today I might just take the land and kick my feet up. </p>

But you don&#39;t get to keep much money after that because your health care costs are high and you have to pay for your student loans that you decided to get but the problem is your job doesn&#39;t pay that well and the 1% are wealthy and not sharing enough.</p>

<p>Amazon benefits poor and rich people by offering a superior service to others. People like cheap shit with lots of reviews shipped quickly. The problem is amazon receives govt subsidies for each package making his service get an unfair advantage. Also the tax free stuff. Take those away and more services would pop up.</p>

<p>Take for example usps. It wasnt until fedex and ups came along that delivery confirmation became a thing. Competition improved old services for the consumer and brings down prices.</p>

<p>Was &quot;Competition improved old services for the consumer and brings down prices.&quot; supposed to sum up what you were trying to say? My problem is the economic power centralised in the hands of billionaires instead of spread out across the people, through things like credit unions, self-employment and worker co-ops. Self-employed people and workers co-ops all compete.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked through your link. Interesting stuff. Badly named both of them. Doesnt roll off the tongue.</p>

<p>Ill admit it sounded like rebranded marxism at first. I hold any ideology that even thinks about utopia highly suspect. They mention &quot;greater good&quot; in their first couple paragraphs.....greater good always leads to justified deaths at some point by some tin horn dictator..... us vs them. The group over the individuals freedoms and rights.</p>

<p>This cant work in America. Someone would have to decide who has too much and who has too little.</p>

<p>And like i mentioned earlier when Roark asks &quot;at the point of a gun?&quot; Will we enforce the seizure of property and production at the point of the gun and are we prepared for mass civl war and unrest?</p>

<p>Communism and socialism are flawed by failing sin their &quot;transition&quot; phase to TRUE communism. How will distributism avoid transitionary pitfalls? Is this theory practical? How do they account for looming AI and robot workers taking over most work in the near future?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a utopia. It&#39;s just pretty nice. People are always people.</p>

<p>It&#39;s happened. It&#39;s how economies usually are. Free people have usually worked for themselves, or as equals, or as apprentices alongside the highest authority in their workplace.</p>

<p>We can build a different economy. If a democratic &gt;50% of the population are determined to work as/at and buy from self-employed people and when necessary partnership and co-ops, and if we all support credit unions and friendly societies instead of banks and insurance agencies, and if we share childcare with people we know instead of relying on unstable government handouts, then whatever capitalists do will be unimportant.</p>

<p>If we can&#39;t do that, we can do a lot of it. All of these things already exist. We can do that a bit more.</p>

<p>For capitalism, I don&#39;t see how land and natural material can become private property without it being at the point of a gun. Saying the first person who improves it gets it seems like an attempt at justifying the way things happened to be.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also fine with lowering/eliminating taxes on owner operated businesses and financial unions while maintaining taxes on businesses with a large number of non-owner workers to give a competitive advantage to distributed ownership, though that depends on how financially libertarian you are, and I think even anarcho-capitalists should preference distributed ownership.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a great solution to mechinisation, but if the robots take all the jobs, and we all owned some robot, it would work out.</p>

<p>Libertarians take this view to an extreme but when I hear people whine because someone has earned more income, I think it&#39;s the proper perspective on taxation which I believe should be on <a href="http://fairtax.org">spending and not earned income.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism has brought tens of millions of people OUT of poverty in the last 3 decades since the fall of communism. It is kind of hard argue against this fact. No system has created more wealth for more people than Capitalism. That is not to say it is a perfect system.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Our government tends to invade other countries to steal their resources on behalf of corporate overlords. That is not capitalism. That is fascism. A free market does NOT come from the barrel of a gun. That is the complete opposite of Adam Smith&#39;s principles of mutual free exchange of goods and services.</p></li>
<li><p>Regulatory capture is increasing becoming a problem. Net Neutrality is the most recent example of this.</p></li>
<li><p>The banks are creating debt slavery among large segments of society. The Rothschild conspiracy has reached an advanced stage bring ruin to the positive aspects of the capitalist system. </p></li>
<li><p>Technological innovations such as the robots that run Amazon&#39;s warehouses could be the death blow to capitalism. All things eventually come to an end. In the past in order for a capitalist to make money they had to hire workers to accomplish a business plan. This is increasingly not the case as human employees are no longer required for a capitalist to make money. Robots are breaking the social contract between capitalists and labor.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Humanity has to come up with a solution quickly to create a new system where the majority of people do not work because robots took all the jobs. The &quot;free market&quot; solution is likely to be cryptocurrency or crypto-barter as I call it. I make so much money in crypto I no longer need to work or worry about employment. Other people could do the same. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/3kiVbhp.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/3kiVbhp.jpg</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect your perspective of robots taking all jobs and leaving the vast majority of humanity out in the cold. But I also disagree with it.  I think many people are overlooking the &quot;free to play&quot; model that the app store has created. The vast majority of apps in the app store are free but cost money to access their premium content. I can see Walmart giving away low profitable basic products and charging money for higher profitable popular items. For example bread is free and steak costs money. The catch is in order for Walmart to afford to give away basic products for free they have to drive down the cost to make, ship, and stock that product. Having humans perform anyone of those tasks will never lead to the model I think is going to take over. Humans cost way too much money to make this happen. Robots are the only way this outcome can happen I think. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>The US is based on a capitalist system.  Along with killing and affecting millions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Vietnam, there&#39;s the invasions and influenced coups that most don&#39;t know about.  Chile, Guatemala, El Salvador, Brazil, Nicaragua, Iran, Grenada, Phillipines, just to name a few.  Furthermore, these countries who were placed in debt due to extravagant dictators (and other various reasons) were forced to pay off debts, or else default.  The IMF/World Bank has agreed to give them stimulus, however, at a cost- structural adjustment policies.  This has led to the government reducing subsidies (like food, water, gas, healthcare) - killing many, reducing tariffs (this destroys employment as people cannot keep up with the prices of multinational corporations), as well as liberalizing markets (removing price fixing, etc.)  </p>

<p>You say no system has created more wealth for more people than capitalism, yet in the last 3 decades, the standard of living for billions of people has not gone up, in fact, studies show that it has in fact worsened.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s simply false that &quot;people flee Cuba regularly.&quot; I happen to know many people who have been to the wonderful, very fun, non-police state island of Cuba. It&#39;s economically rough- most people get very very little meat rationed- but it was always that way because it&#39;s an island with very few resources other than sugar. The government has done an amazing job of keeping everyone fed and homelessness at just about zero. The U.S. embargo is making things a lot worse.</p>

<p>Please stick to facts, man. You&#39;re clearly deeply uninformed about Cuba, and believing some over the top anti-red nonsense. This hysteria is only hurting what I think is an obvious solution, social democracy, a blend of the better aspects of the market and socialism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say there&#39;s a &quot;huge amount&quot; of luck involved.  Innovation isn&#39;t luck at all, if you come up with and offer a good product/service it will be successful, that simple. However it also takes someone with a strong educated business sense to see it through.  Hell even in restaurants, chefs have brilliant concepts, are extremely talented, but if they don&#39;t have a single clue how to actually run the numbers, operation, PNL&#39;s, cost analysis, etc they will certainly fail.  Which lo and behold, statistically over 60% of  restaurants completely fail within 1-2 years. And you think someone from the 3rd world can do better? With nowhere near the talent and education than said chef that still failed? MMmmmhmm</p>

<p>The point is boohooing about billions of people with nothing to offer other than manual labor, while acting like Jeff Bezos committed some crime for being successful is ridiculous.  You start to sound like some 20 year old altruistic socialist that is too wrapped up in emotions than to see their own flawed logic. By the way amazon&#39;s labor practices are 100x better than the labor practices in any 3rd world country, where they&#39;re given pennies a day for a bag of rice and a tin roof just so they can shit out more kids that will grow up to be no different.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comparing to third world sweatshops is ridiculous. Yes, those are more fucked up, but Bezos is getting away with what he can get away with in the U.S., treating workers like shit while he rakes in over $100 billion. How on Earth can you defend that? He&#39;s also connected to the CIA:
<a href="https://www.alternet.org/media/owner-washington-post-doing-business-cia-while-keeping-his-readers-dark">https://www.alternet.org/media/owner-washington-post-doing-business-cia-while-keeping-his-readers-dark</a></p>

<p>Of course he is. That&#39;s what the CIA is; it&#39;s about $$$. It&#39;s called &quot;The company.&quot;</p>

<p>Back to the very general- sure, all the power to the innovators, but if we had a reasonably fair economy, a lot more people would be able to be innovators. And it&#39;s ridiculous that in such a prosperous nation people are working sixty hours plus a week to feed their families, and some are homeless, often despite working. We&#39;ve lost our humanity. Everybody needs to eat some psychedelic mushrooms and find life meaning again, maybe we&#39;ll start caring    about each other.</p>

<p>The real problem is that the world runs on a system where so many people have so little. You could take all of that $100 B and give it away, it would only mean $50 each for those 2 billion poor folks.</p>

<p>So the real genius would be the person who figured out a way for everyone at the bottom end to have an extra $5 a day... instead of being the first one to make it to $200 billion.</p>

<p>you&#39;re branded a &quot;Marxist&quot; or some such by the right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the people who stand behind them... the people who have more than they could ever need, but who never stop wanting more.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Marxism or Communism really work. But I have serious doubts about Capitalism  as well. People like to debate the relative merits of various economic systems. But the real issue isn&#39;t the system, it&#39;s the people running the system. </p>

<p>There is no perfect economic system because a system can only ever be as good as the people who run it. As long as it&#39;s part of human nature to be greedy, selfish and dishonest... the economic system will reflect these qualities.</p>

<p>The best economic system would be one that is the opposite of this. That would be one that is generous, inclusive and honest. </p>

<p>One of the biggest problems with the current system is not inequality (though it is a problem). Imo the biggest problem is the ability of people with surplus wealth to pass it on to the next generation. So you get the establishment of a financial aristocracy based on inheritance of the previous generation&#39;s acquired wealth.</p>

<p>If it was up to me, I&#39;d introduce a system the disrupt this effect. Your kids could inherit stuff, but they would not inherit assets that are primarily financial (income generators) in nature.</p>

<p>So when you die, you kids get your house and your stuff. They could inherit the family business, but not millions of dollars or controlling interests in huge corporations. Non-inheritable assets would all go into a public trust that was publicly administered in the most transparent fashion possible. e.g would be something like Norway&#39;s trillion dollar Heritage Fund.</p>

<p>In this system, the economy would be run with the goal of creating maximum material prosperity for the average person, not max wealth for a small percentage so they can pass on to their kids.  </p>

<p>Sounds unthinkable? Guess what, that&#39;s how the majority of society does it. Each generation is a fresh start and has to make it largely on their own. Maybe we&#39;d be better of as a group if rich people had to do it the same way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that inheritance money is a big part of the social class picture, and it&#39;s an interesting idea. It just seems that all these sort of ideas could be worked around by rich people re-managing their stuff before they die. Maybe it could work somehow. But meanwhile, I like Bernie Sanders&#39; idea of taxing Wall St. to pay for tuition-free college, and generally raising taxes on the rich. Because, you know what, all lives matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha the shills have tried to brigade this thread. </p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s wrong with being rich?&quot;
&quot;He worked hard to get to where he is.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, good ole&#39; American ingenuity, gumption, and hard work got him to richest man alive. Nothing else to it, folks.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve been on this reddit for more than two weeks and honestly believe Jeff Bezos got to the position of richest man alive just by honest to goodness hard work, intelligence, and pulling up his bootstraps, please slap yourself or toss some water in your face. Wake up. You can&#39;t be that naive. </p>

<p>Chew on this:
If you&#39;re that absurdly rich you clearly are an incredibly selfish, egomaniacal person. You&#39;re not happy with $100 million, not happy with $1 billion, etc. Sorry, that&#39;s the reality. If you&#39;re religious, please tell me where Jesus said its good to keep trying to make more and more money.</p>

<p>Rich people tend to influence politics. So if you&#39;re very rich, you&#39;re probably going to influence government. You&#39;re inherently stepping out of your bounds. Is that a good thing?</p>

<p>Looking at it from another angle, do you really think anyone can become president? Anyone can just become a Senator? If so, I guess you should consider running for office. If not, what does it take to become a Senator, president, etc? Does it ever involve stuff which we&#39;d consider bad if an every day person did it? ex: selling a political position/product as one thing when it&#39;s really something else. Does it require a built-in social network and financiers that ordinary people don&#39;t have? Memberships in fraternities that not everyone gets in to?</p>

<p>TLDR; I don&#39;t hate Jeff Bezos--I don&#39;t know him lol--but to defend the idea of people becoming this rich without any skepticism is pretty damn naive. We all know a lot of shady stuff goes down behind closed doors that we&#39;ll never hear about it (sometimes we do ala Wikileaks, Panama Papers, gossip, FBI investigations) and to assume that&#39;s not the case for the richest man alive is just silly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why?</p>

<p>We use reddit right now and the creators of reddit sold reddit to conde nast. We will never meet the owners of reddit.</p>

<p>I get free information and discussion on any topic i want and they get to data mine and advertise.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t forced on this site neither were you.</p>

<p>Amazon benefits poor and rich people by offering a superior service to others. People like cheap shit with lots of reviews shipped quickly. The problem is amazon receives govt subsidies for each package making his service get an unfair advantage. Also the tax free stuff. Take those away and more services would pop up.</p>

<p>Take for example usps. It wasnt until fedex and ups came along that delivery confirmation became a thing. Competition improved old services for the consumer and brings down prices.</p>
