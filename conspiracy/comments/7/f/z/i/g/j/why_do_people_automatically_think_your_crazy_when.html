Trying to talk to people about the likes of False Flag attacks, Power Grabs and Governement Agendas seems to lead to people think that I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about and I make some of this stuff up even when they&#39;re presented with facts/evidence.
How do we change these people&#39;s minds?</p>

<p>To explain that someones world is not what it seems makes people uncomfortable and they want to defend it.</p>

<p>The best way is to ask them questions to make them research for themselves. IMHO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got through it by realizing the world is not a perfect place. I used to be an idealist, but now I see it through the eyes of a realist.</p>

<p>As for a controversial conspiracy, the world being owned by a few cooperative or competing families that orchestrate just about everything is probably near the top of my list, albeit mainstream nowadays.</p>

<p>Another one I enjoy is the possible evidence of giants being in North America, but our knowledge of them has been wiped away.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/FNo_dzgznNI">https://youtu.be/FNo_dzgznNI</a></p>

<p>Also, one I enjoy is the possible evidence of organized structures on mars that mimic the Pleiades constellation along with other celestial bodies 17,000 years ago.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/5V0U1ZuXIyw">https://youtu.be/5V0U1ZuXIyw</a></p>

<p>I will add I don’t believe in all conspiracy theories just like most conspiracy theorists. The majority of conspiracy theorists are free thinking individuals that research information themselves instead of blindly believing whatever information is thrown their way.</p>

<p>Another controversial theory I like is this whole Qanon phenomenon going on. Whether or not it’s a true story about factions within our government battling one another for control, it’s an awesome story to me. Especially since I’m a fan of spy thrillers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 6 million number. Plain and simple.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying millions didn&#39;t die. I&#39;m not saying denying a holocaust ever happened. I&#39;m simply saying, the fact that &quot;historians&quot; cling to this number so hard is half of the reason why there are &quot;revisionist historians&quot; in the first place.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen the number of times the 6 million figure was used before WW2, and it&#39;s religious implications? Check out <a href="http://balder.org/judea/Six-Million-140-Occurrences-Of-The-Word-Holocaust-And-The-Number-6,000,000-Before-The-Nuremberg-Trials-Began.php">this</a> for examples.</p>

<p>Even when they <a href="https://socioecohistory.wordpress.com/2011/03/02/jewish-estimate-sees-number-of-holocaust-dead-drop-to-2-8-million/">drastically changed</a> the official number of those who died in camps, the total 6 million number remained unchanged by attributing the difference to other categories.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m really trying to say is that there is MUCH more to the tragedies of WW2 than you&#39;ve most likely ever been told. Unfortunately, you&#39;re forbidden to ever question the narrative we&#39;ve all been given (after all, the victors write the history books, right?). It&#39;s even <em>illegal</em> in some countries to question the narrative.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not some anti-Semetic lunatic, nor am I trying to be disrespectful to anyone by asking either. But I feel that the amount of effort put into making sure that nobody challenges the official narrative with legitimate scrutiny, really just raises even more questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No way am I fully &quot;awoke&quot; but I felt betrayed after you see all the lies , deception and how the world actually works , I think subconsciously  we all have an idea of it because secret societies and men in suits are depicted in movies , but once you open the rabbit hole of how the world works you see a lot of things very differently . I don&#39;t think it helps that much on a personal level but it definitely made me feel more alive it opened my eyes but i think we have to try &quot;wake &quot; people , just so they are less fooled by propaganda and ultimately it means people will question things more , like questioning the Las Vegas shooting   </p>

<p>Yes, great &quot;&quot;sources&quot;.</p>

<p>Columbus did introduce the Americas to many Europeans, even though it had been discovered 500 years prior. He also was responsible for many peoples deaths. Its not like those two things are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>The official story for Building 7 was that it fell due to structural damage from fire.  Anyone with eyes can see that a 40+ story skyscraper a block away from the twin towers, not hit by a plane or by the falling buildings, also collapsed at free fall speed on the same day.  The problem is most people haven&#39;t even heard about Building 7 and don&#39;t want to look into any of the surrounding details.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cognitive dissonance. The best way is the plant seeds, and nurture those seeds.

<p>They have to be ready for the truth, and ready to change. No different than a person with an addiction. They have to be ready to sober up. As the saying goes: &quot;You can lead a horse to the water, but you cannot make them drink it&quot;.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s a true loved one, plant the seeds, but... if it just some friend or acquaintance, you have to know when to hold em&#39;, and know when to fold em&#39;. Some people just do not want to know the truth. <em>Ignorance is bliss</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, this used to be an issues with me personally years ago, and after getting ridiculed for so long, I stopped talking about conspiracy theories or alternative theories with friends and strangers. </p>

<p>Then something amazing happened, it seemed to be overnight, but my friends started to come around, &#39;hey, you were right about that, I shouldn&#39;t have misjudged you&#39;. Anytime I&#39;d go out and have a few drinks and start taking about this stuff with friends, strangers would pay attention and add to the conversation, not dismiss it or ridicule it.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s just my community (central Kentucky college town), but it seems like the more I get out and talk to people the more I find that people are more centered and open minded with their perceptions and ideologies.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed that if you&#39;re on target and talking about things that are verifiable/have facts/evidence, these people rarely <em>really</em> think you&#39;re crazy - even though I&#39;ve been called a &quot;whacko&quot; and the like before for such things. It&#39;s because they&#39;re lying to themselves. They can write you/what you&#39;re saying off as surface level &quot;crazy&quot; in their mind and return to fugazi land. The irony of people who disregard facts and call others &quot;crazy&quot; for being informed...</p>

<p>You know what I&#39;ve been seeing a lot lately instead of opposition/&quot;crazy&quot; labels to &quot;conspiracy&quot; type of talk -- blank stares, almost as if they&#39;ve seen a ghost. Maybe a slight realization that the world they&#39;ve been living in is a facade. </p>

<p>I think this rampant pedophilia/sex abuse/god knows what else in Hollywood getting exposed has opened a lot of eyes. I remember telling a woman I work with 2 years ago that I thought Kevin Spacey, having flown on Lolita Express with serial pedo Epstein and Billy C., was most likely a pedophile and that HoC was basically about the Clintons. She thought I was insane. FWIW she&#39;s super liberal and loved Hillary and shit. Saw her last week and asked her about it. She literally just stared into the abyss for a good minute. Didn&#39;t say a word. Probably a combination of &quot;shit, my favorite actor is a pedophile. He&#39;s liberal, I&#39;m liberal, he associates with the Clintons and serial pedos and is a pedo himself. Maybe the CCF ain&#39;t what they appear to be after all. Maybe this BWet00 fella is fucking on one. Maybe all the other shit he&#39;s been telling me is true, too. GAHHHHHHHHHH&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Partly because conspiracy theories is this pop-cultural phenomenon that is highlighted in media, internet, etc. and is ridiculed and has been ascribed this archetype of individuals that fall into the genre of kooks and paranoia by default. They&#39;re sometimes faulted for not thinking critically by other people who won&#39;t even give these subjects the time of day, which is quite ironic (and yeah, narrow minded conspiracy theorists are a thing as well, no doubt.) It&#39;s not one end of the aisle that are infallible, as opposed to the other.</p>

<p>Despite plenty of people that are not paranoid, nor terribly eccentric, but merely realise that all someone has to allow it and starts asking question themselves rather than letting others (i.e. news outlets, &quot;qualified experts&quot; that know better and what not scrutunize it for them where other fail to do so.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the feeling of taboo, I guessm of simply researching these things without feeling like they&#39;re entertaining kook ideas themselves now. After all you might be berated by someone if they found out.</p>

<p>You can take away the word Illuminati, Deep State and all these terms and just realise that man can be pretty fallible, especially a man with power. We have dynasties of people that have held power for centuries, but it&#39;s simply to far fetched to entertain this notion that they would work together to supress the man below for their own benefit, because Illuminati™ (+ countless other buzzwords) and what people associate with the these terms.</p>

<p>There was this thing called the Cosa Nostra, the good old fashioned mafia where people were trying to clandestinely operate and break laws for their own benefit, but it&#39;s simply too far fetched that a higher echelon of people with more power would be doing these same types of things, on a much larger scale.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s all the good points already submitted on this post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 6 million number. Plain and simple.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying millions didn&#39;t die. I&#39;m not saying denying a holocaust ever happened. I&#39;m simply saying, the fact that &quot;historians&quot; cling to this number so hard is half of the reason why there are &quot;revisionist historians&quot; in the first place.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen the number of times the 6 million figure was used before WW2, and it&#39;s religious implications? Check out <a href="http://balder.org/judea/Six-Million-140-Occurrences-Of-The-Word-Holocaust-And-The-Number-6,000,000-Before-The-Nuremberg-Trials-Began.php">this</a> for examples.</p>

<p>Even when they <a href="https://socioecohistory.wordpress.com/2011/03/02/jewish-estimate-sees-number-of-holocaust-dead-drop-to-2-8-million/">drastically changed</a> the official number of those who died in camps, the total 6 million number remained unchanged by attributing the difference to other categories.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m really trying to say is that there is MUCH more to the tragedies of WW2 than you&#39;ve most likely ever been told. Unfortunately, you&#39;re forbidden to ever question the narrative we&#39;ve all been given (after all, the victors write the history books, right?). It&#39;s even <em>illegal</em> in some countries to question the narrative.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not some anti-Semetic lunatic, nor am I trying to be disrespectful to anyone by asking either. But I feel that the amount of effort put into making sure that nobody challenges the official narrative with legitimate scrutiny, really just raises even more questions.</p>
