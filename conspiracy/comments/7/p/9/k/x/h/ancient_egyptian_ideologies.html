       Im no Egyptologist, but it seems evident that a lot of the fundamental assumptions about ancient egyptian society we were taught in school and shown on MSM are completely wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a clear distinction between the 'real ideology' and the later 'infiltrated ideology'. You can tell the real ideology from the infiltrated. the real ideology was more matriarchical, focused on cultivating different conscious states, had complex beliefs on the afterlife, and had a number of technologies that we may still not have figured out.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         the great pyramid and several other pyramids were not used as tombs, but rather structures that harnessed energy used for things like healing and other undiscovered functions. There is absolutely no evidence they were used as tombs
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Egyptians used a hallucinagenic substance to help enter altered states and placed a high value on insights gained through altered states.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Women were in a high position in real egyptian society. People believed in needing a balance between the male and female, with clearly defined ideas of the strengths and weaknesses of males and females.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The pharaoh Akhenaten was perhaps the last pharoh of the 'real ideology'. His son Tutankhamun assumed leadership hoping to further push the 'real ideology' but the regime was already too infiltrated and he was assasinated at a young age.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know Tutankhamun was assasinated because the forensic work done on his mummy shows he died of blunt force trauma to the back of the head when he was roughly 19 yrs old. This is interesting bc the egyptians probably didnt know he had been assasinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anybody has further info on the real ancient egyptian ideology, Im hoping to expand my understanfing, particularly regarding technologies and belief systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just one example in history of many in which the truth was hidden from us. This is particularly important right now given the discovery of the secret void found in the Great Pyramid. Nobody has been allowed to study the pyramids in detail for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       The void needs to be explored. This cannot stay hidden from us. There is no plausible reason for the void not to be explored by unobtrusive robots. They have no right to keep this from us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dont let these fuckers make this story disappear, because of some bullshit excuses or other smokescreens deployed. If we dont act soon, some secret society group will get in there and destroy any evidence, if they havent done so already.

       I'm no egyptologist either, but wasn't Akhenaten was famous for basically the opposite? He was a tearaway, broke from tradition, moved the capital, got all monotheistic and sun-worshippy. To the point where after he died there was an effort to erase him from history altogether, scratch his name of the lists, smash the faces off all his statues, that sort of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good post tho, I agree, it's crazy how much we still don't know.
Also, speaking of exploring, you can find all sorts of interesting stuff by starting with the keyword Kemet, or Khemet. I had a lecture I wanted to link, but I can't find it now. I'll edit it in, if it turns up.

       It looks like he had a dramatic shift to monotheism 5 years into his reign. Thats when the infiltration started, furthered by wiping out the lineage with the assassination of king tut.

       Interesting stuff, thanks. Makes me think of bicameral mind theory, the idea that ancient people originally experienced their own consciousness as hallucinations, then over time it developed its own identity, and eventually became 'I'. Akhenaten would've been a little ahead of the curve, perceiving his consciousness as singular, though still external. He tried to force the new way of thinking on people who weren't ready, and paid the price for it.

       It appeals to the ego.  By Jaynes' reasoning, if you say you have "a gut feeling," you are listening to your bicameral mind.  It's dumb shit.

       Yes, of course I have read the book.  I was really enamored with his dumb idea.  But that was years ago, and I kept learning.  That led me to realize how dumb his claims are.  Try reading Metaphors We Live By if you want to see Jaynes destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       On another note, Jaynes' concept that ancient humans weren't fully conscious would suggest that animals are not fully conscious.  This turns out to be false, also.

       What is the oldest book you have read with your own eyes?
      </p>
      <p>
       As in, its
       <em>
        actual, physical
       </em>
       age, not the claimed age of whatever it was supposed to be a 'copy' of, but the actual, physical age of the book?
      </p>
      <p>
       For most of us, the answer is somewhere from 50-100 years old. The oldest books we have read are just 50-100 years old. And yet somehow we are all so convinced that 'history' goes back thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't anybody else ever wonder what is going on here?

       just saying, i though the issue you were bringing up was that books are changed when they are recopied from older versions to better fit a nareative. this would be more difficult to do with stone carvings.

       Because there are thousands of people who do that for a living. Because when I have done it it matched to what was already said. Faking the provenance of every book ever and getting every academic  ever to go along with it is a conspiracy so vast it would be impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides books there are things written in stone and metal which have been dated back much further than that. Very easy to date those using scientific tools. Very clear timeline of when those stop being so popular and when books become more popular.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure why all the doubt or what's so hard to understand about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, most people read contemporary things, if they read at all, but there's plenty more to be read. We have poetry beginning in 2000 BCE, narrative art in 3500 BCE, trade documents before that all the way back to 20,000 BCE where we see bone scratchings documenting lunar cycles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The earlier stuff is actually much easier to prove its date.
      </p>
      <p>
       What more proof do you want or what point are you actually trying to make?

       In my opinion, monotheistic shifts seem to be a bad sign for cultures and empires, i.e. a sign of internal socio-political failings and infiltration/corruption. It's a complex subject, but suffice it to say, both the Roman Empire and Chinese Empire fell on hard times after the introduction of monotheism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually there's a great quote regarding polytheism from that second linked article:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The polytheism of the ancient Egyptians encouraged a world view where peace and balance were emphasized and religious tolerance was not considered an issue;
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This was similar to Hellenistic/polytheistic Rome.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you really want to get into conspiracies, monotheism is probably the result of the Gnostic demiurge fooling humans into believing it is the "one and only" god. Thus the adoption of monotheism will always result in the subversion and repression of the true power and harmony of Man.

       dunno the specifics, but ancient egyptian ideology dealt a lot with what we now call chakras. They believed that each chakra had a corresponding gland in the human body. The most famous is the pineal gland, aka the third eye. My opinion is that saving organs or glands had something to do with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       its even more interesting that the same concept of chakras is an important part of some religious belief systems today.

       1.3 Questioner: I’ve heard of the name “Ra” in connection with the Egyptians. Are you connected with that Ra in any way?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ra: I am Ra. Yes, the connection is congruency. May we elucidate?
      </p>
      <p>
       1.5 Questioner: Could you give me a little more detail about your role with the Egyptians?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ra: I am Ra. The identity of the vibration Ra is our identity. We as a group, or what you would call a social memory complex, made contact with a race of your planetary kind which you call Egyptians. Others from our density made contact at the same time in South America, and the so-called “lost cities” were their attempts to contribute to the Law of One.
      </p>
      <p>
       We spoke to one who heard and understood and was in a position to decree the Law of One. However, the priests and peoples of that era quickly distorted our message, robbing it of the, shall we say, compassion with which unity is informed by its very nature. Since it contains all, it cannot abhor any.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we were no longer able to have appropriate channels through which to enunciate the Law of One, we removed ourselves from the now hypocritical position which we had allowed ourselves to be placed in. And other myths, shall we say, other understandings having more to do with polarity and the things of your vibrational complex, again took over in that particular society complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does this form a sufficient amount of information, or could we speak further?
      </p>
      <p>
       2.2 Questioner: Could you tell us something of your historical background, your earlier times in the illusion and the time state[?] contact, possibly your incarnation on this planet that you spoke of before, and contact with earlier races on this planet? Then we would have something to start with in writing this book.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ra: I am Ra. We are aware that your mind/body is calculating the proper method of performing the task of creating a teach/learning instrument. We are aware that you find our incarnate, as you call it, state of interest. We waited for a second query so as to emphasize that the time/space of several thousand of your years creates a spurious type of interest. Thus in giving this information, we ask the proper lack of stress be placed upon our experiences in your local space/time. The teach/learning which is our responsibility is philosophical rather than historical. We shall now proceed with your request which is harmless if properly evaluated.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are those of the Confederation who eleven thousand of your years ago came to two of your planetary cultures which were at that time closely in touch with the creation of the One Creator. It was our naïve belief that we could teach/learn by direct contact and the free will distortions of individual feeling or personality were in no danger, we thought, of being disturbed as these cultures were already closely aligned with a[n] all-embracing belief in the live-ness or consciousness of all. We came and were welcomed by the peoples whom we wished to serve. We attempted to aid them in technical ways having to do with the healing of mind/body/spirit complex distortions through the use of the crystal, appropriate to the distortion, placed within a certain appropriate series of ratios of time/space material. Thus were the pyramids created.
      </p>
      <p>
       We found that the technology was reserved largely for those with the effectual mind/body distortion of power. This was not intended by the Law of One. We left your peoples. The group that was to work with those in the area of South America, as you call that portion of your sphere, gave up not so easily. They returned. We did not. However, we have never left your vibration due to our responsibility for the changes in consciousness we had first caused and then found distorted in ways not relegated to the Law of One. We attempted to contact the rulers of the land to which we had come, that land which you call Egypt, or in some areas, the Holy Land.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Eighteenth Dynasty, as it is known in your records of space/time distortions, we were able to contact a pharaoh, as you would call him. The man was small in life-experience on your plane and was a… what this instrument would call, Wanderer. Thus, this mind/body/spirit complex received our communication distortions and was able to blend his distortions with our own. This young entity had been given a vibratory complex of sound which vibrated in honor of a prosperous god, as this mind/body complex, which we call instrument for convenience, would call “Amun.” The entity decided that this name, being in honor of one among many gods, was not acceptable for inclusion in his vibratory sound complex. Thus, he changed his name to one which honored the sun disc. This distortion, called “Aten,” was a close distortion to our reality as we understand our own nature of mind/body/spirit complex distortion. However, it does not come totally into alignment with the intended teach/learning which was sent. This entity, Akhenaten, became convinced that the vibration of One was the true spiritual vibration and thus decreed the Law of One.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this entity’s beliefs were accepted by very few. His priests gave lip service only, without the spiritual distortion towards seeking. The peoples continued in their beliefs. When this entity was no longer in this density, again the polarized beliefs in the many gods came into their own and continued so until the one known as Muhammad delivered the peoples into a more intelligible distortion of mind/body/spirit relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have a more detailed interest at this time?
      </p>
      <p>
       14.4 Questioner: I understand [from] previous material that this occurred 75,000 years ago. Then it was our third-density process of evolution began. Can you tell me the history, hitting only the points of development, shall I say, that occurred within this 75,000 years, any particular times or points where the attempts were made to increase the development of this third density?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ra: I am Ra. The first attempt to aid your peoples was at the time seven five oh oh oh [75,000]. This attempt seventy-five thousand [75,000] of your years ago has been previously described by us. The next attempt was approximately five eight oh oh oh, fifty-eight thousand [58,000] of your years ago, continuing for a long period in your measurement, with those of Mu as you call this race or mind/body/spirit social complex. The next attempt was long in coming and occurred approximately thirteen thousand [13,000] of your years ago when some intelligent information was offered to those of Atlantis, this being of the same type of healing and crystal working of which we have spoken previously. The next attempt was one one oh oh oh, eleven thousand [11,000], of your years ago. These are approximations as we are not totally able to process your space/time continuum measurement system. This was in what you call Egypt and of this we have also spoken. The same beings which came with us returned approximately three five oh oh [3,500] years later in order to attempt to aid the South American mind/body/spirit social complex once again. However, the pyramids of those so-called cities were not to be used in the appropriate fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, this was not pursued further. There was a landing approximately three oh oh oh, three thousand [3,000], of your years ago also in your South America, as you call it. There were a few attempts to aid your peoples approximately two three oh oh [2,300] years ago, this in the area of Egypt. The remaining part of the cycle, we have never been gone from your fifth dimension and have been working in this last minor cycle to prepare for harvest.
      </p>
      <p>
       14.5 Questioner: Was the Egyptian visit of 11,000 years ago the only one where you actually walked the Earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ra: I am Ra. I understand your question distorted in the direction of selves rather than other-selves. We of the vibratory sound complex, Ra, have walked among you only at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       14.26 Questioner: When you contact the entities in their dreams and otherwise, these entities, I assume, have to be first seeking in the direction of the Law of One. Is this correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ra: I am Ra. This is correct. For example, the entities of the nation of Egypt were in a state of pantheism, as you may call the distortion towards separate worship of various portions of the Creator. We were able to contact one whose orientation was towards the One.
      </p>
      <p>
       22.21 Questioner: Then did the technological advancement of Atlantis come because of this call? I am assuming the call was answered to bring them the Law of One and the Law of Love as a distortion of the Law of One, but did they also then get technological information that caused them to grow into such a highly technological society?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ra: I am Ra. Not at first. At about the same time as we first appeared in the skies over Egypt and continuing thereafter, other entities of the Confederation appeared unto Atlanteans who had reached a level of philosophical understanding, shall we misuse this word, which was consonant with communication, to encourage and inspire studies in the mystery of unity.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, requests being made for healing and other understandings, information was passed having to do with crystals and the building of pyramids as well as temples, as you would call them, which were associated with training.
      </p>

     <div class="md">
      <p>
       i try to look at the designs of things and infer their nature from the manifestions of the design.  i find it's the only thing that works in terms of understanding the material from first principles rather than what i normally see which is a sort of competition between models that "best fit".  i think the latter approach is flawed and really misses the point.  i say this as a prelude.
      </p>
      <p>
       it seems that there are 2 basic models in this dualist world.  the model that divides and reassembles in an org tree fashion - i call this the fractally hierarchical approach.  and the model that divides and reassembles in layers, such that at every stage the wholeness (holiness?) of the complete known set of things is maintained at every step.  i call this the fractally phi approach.  nature seems to follow the latter model.  as well, this model is superior from the perspective of growing the model so that it can handle more complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
       the traditional gender divisions of male and female (not to be confused with the gender spectrum concept in our current vernacular) seem to correspond to the divisive and wholesome nature of the hierarchical and phi approaches respectfully.  and within the phi model itself, male and female are manifested in the trinity.  the trinity being a description of the elements of the process of change, that is synonymous with the hegelian dialectic or the fibonacci formula "old + now = new".  in the trinity there is an initial thing, the monad or the "old" whole in the fibonacci formula.  it is changed by an outwardly acting energy - the male energy.  and the result is the new thing, which is an inward perspective of the whole - the female energy.  because these elements of duality - male and female - exist in both the models.
      </p>
      <p>
       it seems our systems of governance and society have, in recent times, been focused on hierarchy, but track their own history phi-ly.  that is because family lines and lineage is a phi phenomenon.  the word "religion" seems to be a re-ledging of duality thru the perspective of hierarchy instead of phi.  perhaps this is where that word comes from.  it's a do-over of our social design.
      </p>
      <p>
       why would we need a do-over?  i reckon it's because any bias in this dualist system, over time, imparts the bias on the derivative systems and actors themselves.  on scale this would break the overall dualist design as these biases accumulate.  what do we know about this bias?  well we have the genetic record.  the genetic record shows that men have historically been 15 times less likely to reproduce than women.  in current times it's about 5-6 times.  that's an incredible bias.  what does that indicate?  that the bias was pro-female.  that women were the selectors.  this kind of sexual scarcity would lead to other phenomenon such as layering of female elite -&gt; male elite -&gt; female non-elite -&gt; male non-elite in social structure.  that's what i think that machine would produce.  so religion in recent times, being male-dominated, would seem to be both a recognition of this imbalance and an attempt to fix it.  and this would explain a lot of rome and islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       the other thing about this balance is that when one group gets a systemic benefit they will tend to monoculture and become brittle and weak.  the underclass will be forced to adapt due to selective pressures, and will begin to outperform the overclass.  we see this pattern all over the place.  we see it in race.  we see it in STEM.  we see it in the free market.
      </p>
      <p>
       so what i'm basically saying is that ANY gender bias manifests in this way.  it's like a pendulum.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'd also add that it would seem that the initial manifestations and realizations of humanity were matriarchal.  so there was an awareness, imo, of the "whole" as superior to individual heroics.  it's just that the deference of social design to being matriarchal, like all lopsided duality, quickly eroded this core notion and became corrupted by individual self interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       also it would seem that this dynamic is reflected in things like the existence of Free Masonry, a male organization that seems to have a lot of the ancient mystery school knowledge.  and in the tracking of lineage in Judaism along female lines.  why track along female lines?  to identify the "good ones", perhaps.  i reckon when the smoke clears we'll see the existence of a class of actors, let's call them witches, who have been at odds with those actors trying to rebalance things.  and much of what we're seeing in terms of political unrest and war is the conflict between these 2 groups.

       agriculturist and herder societies tend to be more masculine, with the argument that men controlled the means of production more in those societies.
You can see a pretty clear shift towards more masculine control when societies transition to becoming more sedentary and agricultural.
Correlation is not causation but it's an interesting connection.

       From light into darkness by Stephen Mehler is where I was introduced to Akhenaten. He claims to get his information from a guy who claims the information is passed down verbally through the generations. It was a great lead and painted Akhenaten as someone who was trying to fight organized religion. Control the knowledge, control the people.

       that is ultimately how history portrays Akhenaten, but what about how he started off? What made him change his mind and become the ideology destroyer? Was it just a consolidation of power and control or was their a group actively pushing him in that direction. If so, who was that group?

       I honestly can't remember. I'm sorry I can't give you more detail. It was about 5 yrs ago in college. I think I may buckle and finally buy it for myself. The book was about the evolution of religion.  If you search his name and "the land of Osiris" he has some lectures on YouTube that was from the book before the one I read.

       Moving way forward in history to Julius Caesar, I feel there is a connection between the fire in the library of Alexandria. What a loss of info that was!

        Women were in a high position in real egyptian society. People believed in needing a balance between the male and female, with clearly defined ideas of the strengths and weaknesses of males and females.

       Yes, but today we are told  "fuck gender roles, men should fall in line or become obsolete". Why is that?

       Egypt is a mess and they are VERY protective of their "verified" history and artifacts. This would be a tough one to investigate without extra terrestrials coming to earth with a compilation of our real history.

       there is an immense amount of knowledge understanding that can be gained from mapping out the beliefs and values of ancient cultures. This is knowledge that can be used in our daily lives today.

       Egypt has no right to keep this hidden from the world the same way the US has no right to keep backengineered UFO tech from the world.It must be shared openly and freely.

       I remember David Wilcock- before he went all secret space bird people with feathers on us, talked about energy pyramids and it was a great piece of info. His website is currently hacked and when you visit you get nailed with malicious advertising and redirects. Most likely there is something there concerning pyramids and energy.
