<blockquote>
<p>MR. FOSTER: So without getting into naming the sources or anything like that, what steps did you take to try to verify their credibility?</p>

<p>MR. SIMPSON: I&#39;m going to decline to answer that.</p>

<p>MR. FOSTER: Why?</p>

<p>MR. LEVY: It&#39;s a voluntary interview, and in addition to that <strong>he wants to be very careful to protect his sources. Somebody&#39;s already been killed as a result of the publication of this dossier</strong> and no harm should come to anybody related to this honest work.</p>

I personally have looked at the time stamps so I know your lying but honesty I hope you make more pee gaters that is hilarious stuff. What’s even funnier is how much they paid steel to make them look like idiots.

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t even know who this supposed person is who died.  We don&#39;t know any of the details surrounding his/her death.  This is very silly to equate to Seth Rich&#39;s death as if Seth Rich got killed then somehow it must also be true for every other suspicious death.  Every case is different and you can&#39;t really call people hypocrites for formulating different conclusions for very different scenarios with the ONLY similarity being a mysterious death.  And I say mysterious but I don&#39;t even know if this death is mysterious because I haven&#39;t seen any details published.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine a world in which people didn&#39;t believe anything unless it was accompanied by independently verifiable evidence.  Now imagine the total opposite, and you have the world we live in. </p>

<p>For those of you who have trouble discerning what to believe, here is a good rule of thumb.  Always be skeptical of everything.  Don&#39;t believe anything you can&#39;t verify yourself.  Anyone who says they have &quot;secret evidence&quot; of anything, but won&#39;t show you, is always lying, 100% of the time.  The more you want something to be true, the more skeptical you should consciously be (be aware of your cognitive bias).  That&#39;s how propaganda works.  People with an agenda know what you want to believe.  They create stories that advance their agenda, sprinkle in a few bits of truth into the invented story, and feed it to the people who so desperately wish it to be true.  </p>

<p>Just because Trump is a delusional, lying, corrupt scumbag doesn&#39;t mean he is a Russian spy - no matter how much you wish it wish it to be true.  Just because Hillary is an amoral, corrupt, war criminal doesn&#39;t mean she routinely has people who criticize her killed.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s absolutely no evidence that has been presented - none - that this Russian that was killed has anything to do with Trump, the dossier, or anything else related to Russiagate.  What people claim is not evidence.  It doesn&#39;t matter who they are.  Claims are not proof of anything.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;dossier&quot; was a compilation of unprovable and slanderous accusations and insinuations linking Trump to Russia with the claim that the Russian sources were legitimate but can&#39;t ever be identified or exposed due to what the Russian government i.e. Trump&#39;s pal Putin, would presumably do them. </p>

<p>Having failed in every other attempt to smear and malign Trump, his opponents behind the dossier needed a ball to run with that no one could or would look too closely at and that they could conceivable score with if they could make enough noise and do enough grandstanding about it that all the major mass media, with or without asking them, would be sure to go along with.</p>

<p>The temptation to throw-in the bit of salacious gossip someone happened to pick-up about a completely fake &quot;pissing incident&quot; involving Trump while he was in Russia without knowing or caring where it came from was simply par for the course and to &quot;sex it up a bit&quot;. </p>

<p>Nothing the public doesn&#39;t like better and doesn&#39;t need any coaxing to believe and even continue to believe even when it&#39;s been fully disproven. </p>

<p>Nothing in the dossier either was or needed to be real... only remotely plausible and when mixed with enough anti-Trump sentiment that was constantly being stoked to do the trick. </p>

<p>We know that Comey&#39;s FBI also wanted and latched onto that ball and threw their own weight and a good pile of their own money into it in order to justify getting the FISA warrants they needed but had previously failed to get to legitimately and officially spy on Trump&#39;s entourage before they got caught doing it illegally and to look for anything that could be dressed-up and publicly presented as colluding with the Russians. </p>

<p>The whole business of the FBI itself not confirming a single thing about the whole Russian narrative before putting their stamp of approval on it all stinks to high heaven. </p>

Unless you&#39;re suggesting trump had the guy killed, rather than putin. Trump being the only person who would want revenge for the piss story.</p>
