       Anyone who looked at that and didn't immediately understand that it obviously wasn't from 4chan is an idiot. The timing was off and it was right there. That simple. Yet, there's STILL people that believe it came from 4chan. In this thread. Right now.

       Please honesty spread this around more because I hope people believe you. I personally have looked at the time stamps so I know your lying but honesty I hope you make more pee gaters that is hilarious stuff. What’s even funnier is how much they paid steel to make them look like idiots. Steel was also the guy with intel about weapons of mass destruction so we obviously know we are in good hands with his dossier.

       We don't even know who this supposed person is who died.  We don't know any of the details surrounding his/her death.  This is very silly to equate to Seth Rich's death as if Seth Rich got killed then somehow it must also be true for every other suspicious death.  Every case is different and you can't really call people hypocrites for formulating different conclusions for very different scenarios with the ONLY similarity being a mysterious death.  And I say mysterious but I don't even know if this death is mysterious because I haven't seen any details published.

       There are a lot of people who can not tell the difference between speculation and fact particularly when their own emotions are involved.  These are the same people who railroad innocent people into being convicted of crimes.

       Seth Rich is unique because there is more circumstantial evidence for him being the leaker than there is for Russia "hacking" the election. And then for the entire DNC and media to perpetuate that russian hacking lie to the american ppl, without any talk of seeking the actual cause of the release of documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...not to mention that Assange has essentially said that Seth was his source.

       We now know they do exactly what Assange says they don't at the beginning of that video. They have sat on information intentionally for timing. And they were doing that exactly at the time of this video. And reaching out to people and attempting to coordinate to do it more. Pretty shitty, Assange.

       Imagine a world in which people didn't believe anything unless it was accompanied by independently verifiable evidence.  Now imagine the total opposite, and you have the world we live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those of you who have trouble discerning what to believe, here is a good rule of thumb.  Always be skeptical of everything.  Don't believe anything you can't verify yourself.  Anyone who says they have "secret evidence" of anything, but won't show you, is always lying, 100% of the time.  The more you want something to be true, the more skeptical you should consciously be (be aware of your cognitive bias).  That's how propaganda works.  People with an agenda know what you want to believe.  They create stories that advance their agenda, sprinkle in a few bits of truth into the invented story, and feed it to the people who so desperately wish it to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because Trump is a delusional, lying, corrupt scumbag doesn't mean he is a Russian spy - no matter how much you wish it wish it to be true.  Just because Hillary is an amoral, corrupt, war criminal doesn't mean she routinely has people who criticize her killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's absolutely no evidence that has been presented - none - that this Russian that was killed has anything to do with Trump, the dossier, or anything else related to Russiagate.  What people claim is not evidence.  It doesn't matter who they are.  Claims are not proof of anything.

       I don't understand why your comment is being downvoted so hard.  All you are really saying is we can't take something as absolute truth just because someone supposedly credible said it and we want to believe it.  We should demand evidence before succumbing to any narrative whether it confirms our biases or not.

       The "dossier" was a compilation of unprovable and slanderous accusations and insinuations linking Trump to Russia with the claim that the Russian sources were legitimate but can't ever be identified or exposed due to what the Russian government i.e. Trump's pal Putin, would presumably do them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having failed in every other attempt to smear and malign Trump, his opponents behind the dossier needed a ball to run with that no one could or would look too closely at and that they could conceivable score with if they could make enough noise and do enough grandstanding about it that all the major mass media, with or without asking them, would be sure to go along with.
      </p>
      <p>
       The temptation to throw-in the bit of salacious gossip someone happened to pick-up about a completely fake "pissing incident" involving Trump while he was in Russia without knowing or caring where it came from was simply par for the course and to "sex it up a bit".
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing the public doesn't like better and doesn't need any coaxing to believe and even continue to believe even when it's been fully disproven.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in the dossier either was or needed to be real... only remotely plausible and when mixed with enough anti-Trump sentiment that was constantly being stoked to do the trick.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that Comey's FBI also wanted and latched onto that ball and threw their own weight and a good pile of their own money into it in order to justify getting the FISA warrants they needed but had previously failed to get to legitimately and officially spy on Trump's entourage before they got caught doing it illegally and to look for anything that could be dressed-up and publicly presented as colluding with the Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole business of the FBI itself not confirming a single thing about the whole Russian narrative before putting their stamp of approval on it all stinks to high heaven.

       I don't think anyone was ever questioning that it was a 4-chan Larp. Rather, a document that was funded to make it seem worse than it was. Basically, "I'm going to pay X amount to dig up everything you can on Trump and feel free to throw in some embellishments in there".

       Because Scott Adams created a cult of "the truth doesn't matter only spin matters". The Donald users probably know that Trump is a pedophile along with Epstein and parts of the dossier are legit. They just repeat the "it was a 4chan larp" imagining they're some super intelligent persuasion wizards.

       The claim is that the piss story, one of many stories in the dossier, was the result of a 4chan larp. This may or not be true, leaning towards not myself, but either way doesn't relate to the death of Erovinkin, assuming that's who they're talking about. Unless you're suggesting trump had the guy killed, rather than putin. Trump being the only person who would want revenge for the piss story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, man, I just... you'd find so much more success if you only toned it down a little, that's all I'll say. This sort of stuff, it's like you're trying to pick a lock with a hammer. Yeah maybe you get the door open, but there's other considerations, you know what I mean? Like, noise. Mess. Neighbours.

       I was just talking about this post. I don't really understand what you're talking about with the caps. At no point does he state his opinion. The links don't back up the claim, as explained in my previous post. And as for the hammer - he who has ears, let him hear.

       Considering there was a 10 hour session on it and Republicans kept blocking every release of the transcripts, either Republicans are incompetent and like to waste everyone’s time and tax dollars or there’s some credibility there.

       This may be the dumbest logic I've seen in a while on Reddit. Congress is nothing if not blowhards. Congress also loves to waste money. Glenn Simpson and crew are nothing more than a shady propaganda outlet. Browder testified to the same effect. Idiots.

       Look at Browder's testimony. Imagine the many motives of Fusion GPS? There are countless reasons why these hacks have motive to lie and deceive. It's literally what they are PAID to do.

       We now know they do exactly what Assange says they don't at the beginning of that video. They have sat on information intentionally for timing. And they were doing that exactly at the time of this video. And reaching out to people and attempting to coordinate to do it more. Pretty shitty, Assange.
