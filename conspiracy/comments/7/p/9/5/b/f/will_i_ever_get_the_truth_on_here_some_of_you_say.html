       people died in vegas. it was a massacre. who, what , when , why and how, are all subjected to FBI review and disclosure.  everything else is speculation.  speculation is rampant bc the we don't have an official fib report, yet. We don't have the CCTV footage from the hotel.  We don't have closure bc the ink hasn't dried.

       OP, notice the assertion in this comment: "people died in Vegas." It is presented as an unassailable fact, though completely without evidence to accompany it. The thrust on this subreddit is to arouse any kind of discussion about the fabricated minutiae of Vegas -- multiple shooters, arms deals gone bad, Saudi involvement, and any other kind of speculation -- anything to get people to take for granted that it was a real shooting when this is not the case.

       The best way to conceal a truth is to wrap it in lies and make it sound so ludicrous no one would believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read everything, mainstream sources, alt-media sources, comments and leaks. Use your judgement to determine what is real and what is fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, your logic can tell you the truth based on the information available, but there will never be evidence and at the least, no evidence in your lifetime. They like to wait for a generation to die before they tell us what happened. For instance, the JFK files.

       We have several videos with audio from various sources, time synchronized, that provides irrefutable audio evidence of cracks, whips and booms (cracks are supersonic ammo, whips are ammo impacts, and booms are reports.)
      </p>
      <p>
       What we know is that one or more people fired onto the large crowd with semi- or full-auto weapons using supersonic ammo. We have nearly unassailable evidence to that end purely from the synchronized video.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have media evidence that dozens of people died and media evidence that many were injured. Presumably, there are coroner's reports (which may or may not be available) and death notices.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know the shooter(s) motive. We don't know how the shooter(s) moved the weapons into the hotel. We don't know for certain who the shooter(s) were, although we were provided early evidence that Paddock was dead inside the room, and considered by law enforcement that he was the only shooter.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is reasonable to believe that evidence is being withheld pending lawsuits and court hearings, but in this particular case, it seems like less information has been leaked or stated than in other big cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apart from what has been reported, any guess or statement is conjecture.
      </p>
      <p>
       In summary:
      </p>
      <p>
       We know live ammo was used, people died and were injured. Paddock is presumed by law enforcement to be the only shooter.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know pretty much anything else.

       We don't know live ammo was used or that anyone was injured though. All he did was talk about the
       <strong>
        sounds
       </strong>
       of gunshots and "media evidence." Media evidence? Is this a joke?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, notice the assertion: shots were fired and people died. That's what they tell you as a fact and want you to skip right past questioning it. There is no evidence to back this claim. In a real shooting there would be dozens of videos and images that could show shots hitting anything, medical activity, gunshot wounds, or bullet damage.
      </p>

       Take the time to listen to this discussion.

       I think it was a coverup, they were probably trying to assassinate someone on the top floors; plan got botched, then for some reason someone (besides Paddock) blasted through 50 people. Maybe to coverup what had happened on the roof? I dunno.

       It was def an FBI coverup though.

       It’s a trap! Focus your energy and time elsewhere. People still argue over 9/11. We are just now getting the JFK files! They want you to lose yourself down the rabbit hole while the endgame plays out.

       No, you will not get the truth. You will get a lot of peoples takes on what happened there including, no one died.

       You be the investigator.  No civilian has access to more information than you can gather yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand proof of all claims.  If someone claims, "I know someone who died blah blah blah.." then ask for evidence.  If they won't provide such evidence for privacy or whatever reason, then do as any real investigator would do and not accept the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bullets.  Where is the visual evidence of bullets?  Injuries.  Let's see them.  Compare them to Hollywood special effects, also used by the US Army for training, called moulage.  Deaths.  Where is the visual proof?  A list of names is not proof.  Facebook profiles are not proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be like a real police investigator and only accept verifiable facts.  Only the FBI know the real story.  Everyone else is just guessing.  Some guesses are better than others.

       Look at my post history. I've shown videos of people on the scene saying "fake gunshots."
 There's another video of people saying "it doesn't look like anyone's actually injured." There's a witness (who says there were multiple shooters by the way) who was an actress on Dr Phil. Most everyone has seen the video of girls laughing and smiling during the "shooting" and there are other videos where people don't even react to the sounds of gunshots.
      </p>

       I've had over 40 people tell me on this subreddit that they have a connection to a victim in some way. This was compiled into an

       at newnationalist.net.
      </p>
      <p>
       What else? There's no video of anything being shot. We don't have rows of bullet holes. We don't see anyone receiving real medical treatment on the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       I made a post asking for visual proof of shots being fired and the closest thing I got was a photo I call "girl with blood on leg."
      </p>
      <p>
       It was all fake.

       He's just an actor playing his part in a script that sounds like it was written by a 5th grader. Like Adam Lanza, he has the appearance of a fabricated rather than a genuine entity.

       That article is full of reddit posts from people with a little common sense. Time after time you have been asked for your evidence of not a shot fired and you can produce exactly none.

       I'm so fucking close to just giving up, stop giving a shit. Las Vegas shooting official story is a a bucket full of holes, or basically a bunch of holes with a tiny piece of bucket. I feel it's not even worth it anymore, fucking hell. Fuck this world and almost everything in it.

       That's exactly the reaction they want from anyone who questions official reality.

       What you have is this,   the presentation was a sham.    The presentation was managed to be a sham.    It was foisted on us.   As for the facts,   we know more about Oklahoma City today than we did the day the sham news covered it.
