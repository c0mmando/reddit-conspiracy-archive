       I've been really interested in the missing 411 type stuff, and have been searching for info but can't seem to find much on it. 
There's so many stories that seem somewhat believable yet far fetched at the same time. 
I've seen stories about everything from people vanishing, to foreboding staircases in the middle of nowhere, to faceless people and wendingos. 
What is causing these mysteries? Why in national parks? 
I've yet to find a decent documentary, or anything of the like. Any suggestions? 
It seems like it would be a pretty big deal if even some of the cases were actually true without any kind of media attention.

       Dave Paulides holds two degrees from the University of San Francisco, and has a professional background that includes twenty years in law enforcement and senior executive positions in the technology sector. David has retired twice and is now the director of the CanAm Missing Project. In 2004, he formed North America Bigfoot Search-NABS where his investigative and analytical experiences were invaluable in researching Bigfoot/Sasquatch sightings, encounters and behavior. He spent two years living among the Hoopa tribal members, listening to and recording their Bigfoot stories. The Hoopa Project is his first book, based upon his experiences in the Bluff Creek area of Northern California.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2009, David was conducting research on a topic in a national park and learned from off duty National Park Rangers that they had seen many people disappear in the parks, with significant efforts and press at the beginning. The searches usually stopped after a week with little or no follow-up and no additional press coverage. The ranger stated that people disappeared in areas that were unusual and many were never found. The information received from the ranger evolved into the formation of a research team headed by Mr. Paulides and the publication of six books about unusual disappearances that have matching associated profile points. David has been on countless radio and television shows. He is the executive producer for “Missing 411- The Movie”, a documentary about his books. This is set for release in early 2017.

       Thanks for the info, this is a topic I've been wondering about myself. When you say "places that are unusual" do you mean that they are in less traveled portions of the park? Or perhaps off trail?

       Thanks for the info, I love his work and have listened to most of the radio shows. I bought the missing 411 documentary and was really disappointed to be honest. I would lovery to read his books, and probably will one day, but I can't bring myself to pay 60+ dollars on it.

       As someone who loves reading all about ghosts and bigfoot etc etc etc, I can answer this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, people find staircases in the woods. A lot of them are likely the remainder of the home that once stood there, but some people also report bad things surrounding these staircases.
      </p>
      <p>
       IIRC there was an askreddit thread for park rangers etc, and this is something a few of them brought up. The fact that there were all these old staircases out there but the older veteren rangers would tell them to steer clear (and this could be nothing more than because the staircases are old and weak and someone could get hurt).
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah thats about the gist of it.

       That's not the story here though. The tale is that it is just a random flight of stairs plunked down in the middle of the woods.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're talking about stairs leading into the ground, that's a different thing. Real deal basements require for foundations. If it's just a hole in the ground somebody dug, that'll disappear in just a couple years due to rain, erosion, and seasonal changes.

       I specifically gave a pretty mundane reason for why to avoid them, so I thought it was pretty clear I thought they were just old dilapidated stair cases.

       I mention "paranormal" because I don't pretend to know everything about the universe and maybe, just maybe, something weird has happened around a few of them.

       OK well,  they don't exist. It's not a thing that has ever happened.  Stairs are made of wood,  and when the floors go and the walls go...so do the stairs.  Plus, old old houses out in the middle of nowhere aren't two stories. They'll have a root cellar, sure. Usually dirt 'stairs' maybe with a couple of wood planks going down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if I still believe you and am getting fooled here. I've got some land with 75 year old abandoned farm houses on it.  You know what's left? The rusted paper thin husks of a couple cars from the 1930's, shattered concrete, a pile of broken bricks that made up the chimney, and some random glass from windows,  Mason jars and liquor bottles.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no wood left, it was gone half a century ago.

       In houses far away from civilization,  yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody is building a goddamn concrete Lincoln Memorial style staircase in the middle of nowhere. They built one story houses. Their barns had hay lofts,  but it was all wood.  Look at how the Amish and Mennonite build today. They rarely have second stories on their homes and everything is made out of wood except for the foundation and chimney.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again,  if you're trolling here, bravo. Staircases are made of wood and fall down very shortly after the outer wall of the house is breached by nature.  Even brick houses have wood staircases. But nobody 75 years ago was building brick houses out in the middle of the woods.  They use the materials from the local area.  How you going to haul a house worth of brick into the wilderness? By horse? Do you realize how long that would take? 75 years ago it took an entire day to get to the town 50 miles away. And that's on horseback hauling nothing, because you ain't trying to kill the beast because if you are moving out into the wilderness to build a home you most likely have exactly one horse, or less.

       Dude, there's are over 100 threads on this subject, not just on reddit from park Rangers all around the u.s. so to say it originated on r/no sleep just shows you don't know or read everything, so in your own humility don't act like your an all knowing God and that you definitively know when and where something started.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end even if it started on r/nosleep, doesn't mean it's not true. Obviously your not a scientific individual, or you would know anything is actually possible, every 100 years we invent or explain what previous civilizations either thought were impossible or literally were unfathomable.

       Oh shit lol I guess you're right! Fun fact about that movie. I watched it (for some reason) on my laptop at 4am before my colonoscopy. Why was I watching anything at 4am? Because I was Pooing water to clear myself and decided the Blair witch project was the best movie to guide me through it.

       Gotta watch it again soon haha.

       I've looked into a couple times, but then stopped for some reason, and now I've spent the past two days looking for more and more info to back up what seems to be really well told campfore stories, which makes me wonder why there is no info on all the people that have been missing or found dead.

       I was at a talk given by a strangely open park ranger. She said matter-of-factly, she believed many of the missing people in the national parks are due to mountain lion attacks. They stalk people and wait for them to be isolated.

       Honestly, that could possibly explain a small fraction of the missing people cases at best, but isn't a viable explanation to the vast majority of the rest of them. A mountain lion isn't going to drown someone miles away from a water source and leave the body unscathed.

       I lived next to Glacier National Park. People often die drowning, falling, etc. in the most travelled and safest areas of the park. The area beyond those are vast. I think a lot of those people died in accidents in areas not so often travelled, and animals consumed their remains, and the bones have been scattered or buried underneath years of pine brush, foliage, and just aren't visible unless you walk right into them. It's not hard to die out there for numerous reasons, especially if you are alone. We had around 3 million people visit the park. Add that to all the other National Parks and it's easy to get hundreds of missing people from accidental death, animal attacks, and probably a few murders.

       Have you ever read any if the missing 411 cases? A lot of the cases simply can't be explained by falling, drowing, or animal attacks. One of the things that happens a lot in these cases are people of supposedly sound mind suddenly deciding to run away from their camp without bringing any equipment. They throw their phones, flashlights, and shoes into the woods and just disappear. And then after an extensive search, they can't be found. But then after weeks or months or even years, their body will turn up a half a mile from where they went missing in an area that had been searched multiple times, often with weird things like their clothes folded up in a neat pile next to them. Thats what makes these 411 cases so compelling. They're just so freaking weird.

       There is a post that has been up a few times about a certain forest in West Virginia where there is a place within the forest where you can hear kids screaming and crying. Speculation is there is a tunnel system that goes all the way to the Virginia/DC area where many kids come up missing and that they are being housed in an underground facility there. I am not too techy on linking stuff nor is Voat easy to navigate to look stuff up but maybe someone could find it and post here. Peace!

       We're getting there! This last week I feel like there's been far more fringe and old school conspiracy topics on the front page than there has been in previous months. It could be the introduction of the new rule + the current sticky post which has helped produce and encourage an atmosphere with far less political spam and news. There's a good few more genuinely thought-out theories. Seems positive.

       I 100 percent agree, I miss it too. It doesn't much feel like a conspiracy sub any more. There's a handful of good posts if you dig for them, but politics have saturated the sub, and then it becomes easier to dismiss and not pay attention to everything else.

       "Why in national parks" - they're huge masses of wilderness. of course they'd have myths, they do in any part of the world. and because they're huge masses of wilderness, people get lost, overestimate their survival skills, etc and go missing. that's not unique to national parks, it's just what happens sometimes when you go to any large expanse of nature.

      <p>
       and like others said, the staircases come from a creepypasta series.

       This is maybe an unpopular opinion, but as fascinated I am with missing 411, isn't it a case of him starting with a conclusion and trying to fit things into it? For example one of his criteria is the body being in or near water. If you look at cold reading and people claiming to be psychic detectives they often talk about bodies of water because it's an easy thing to make fit.
      </p>

       It's fascinating and really makes you think, but I'm not convinced it's anything unnatural.

       I live near the Smoky Mountains and have heard quite a few people vanish from there, but I can only think of a couple times I've ever heard anything on the news about missing people. Different events in and around GSMNP make my local news all the time because it's so close, so I should hear about lots of people disappearing, but no.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a couple theories:
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't surprise me even a little bit if there was a pretty significant number of people living off the grid in the area. There are lots of abandoned shelters and caves that would make good shelters.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few years ago, someone happened upon an entire town that had been abandoned no one knew about, so it's feasible that there could be a homeless population in those mountains we don't know exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some are almost certainly deceased and not yet located.
      </p>
      <p>
       Others have possibly just moved out of the area or found housing.

       Honestly in my opinion people disappear and are never found for a multitude of reasons, none with conspiracy. National parks are wide and vast. Many of these people who are lost are far from roads and trails. With hundreds of miles to search and sometimes very little clues people stay missing. They then die due to trauma, dehydration... then an animal scatters their remains over a few more miles.. Then the National Parks Service steps in and starts looking. They look over these miles and miles and find nothing. A week goes by with nothing. They call off the search. Why? Because to find this person it could literally takes three years of their operations budget. They can’t do that because next week some one will need rescued again.

       411 gave me all the information i needed, what i find strange is the Govt would give him no information, and they have no record of missing persons. Why?

       The earth is filled with hollow caverns that lead to underground breakaway civilizations, with exit nodes located in forests. There's a good reason why the government has national parks protected by specialized teams of people and it's got nothing with preserving the nature – disrupting the exit node for these civilizations would lead to an outright war that would cause internal societal rifts and probably wouldn't go well for us top-surface humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       For more on this, study ancient national myths about forest creatures/gnomes/fairies/dryads etc. found all over the world and pay close attention to spates of "mining accidents", especially in China.

       Bullshit. About once a month someone says the exact same thing and it's always meant to be lead back to that Paulides fraud, or whatever his name is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never bother remembering because it's
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       Paulides, and the first few comments are generally
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       similar, if not identical, and written so as two pique interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd bet money this post and others like it are just periodic marketing posts either on schedule or tied to sales of the quack's "I'm not saying Bigfoot, but Bigfoot" books.

       Nah, I literally just started looking into it, and was blown away by the claims, and even more suspicious when I couldnt find much about it other than the missing 411 stuff (I keep calling him David Pilates..lol). But seeing all the comments made me realize I probably hyped it up in my head without meaning to. 
Either way, it was fun digging while it lasted and it definitely kept me entertained.

       That's pretty much how I got into it, too.

      <p>
       It all seemed like there was something he might be on to, until I read actual SnR people's comments and about his "all roads lead to Bigfoot" approach.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom line is that there may be something there, but by trying to shoehorn everything into his crackpot theory, he's working
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       finding a legitimate conspiracy or criminal network.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, really, I'd believe in a criminal trafficking network first, if anything. IN fact, if I did believe in such a network, I'd also not find it hard to believe in them hiring Pilates/Paradies...whatever to basically write these books and build a kook mythology around select disappearances(as well as unrelated ones) so that more rational people would stop trying to connect them for fear of being lumped together with this clear raging bigfoot kook and his people.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       source on this "missing411" thing, which is a
       <em>
        huge
       </em>
       red flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, yeah, that red flag may hide a legitimate conspiracy and may in fact be a part of it. From what I've heard about his police history, it's not at all far fetched.

       Yeah.. I think it's sort of wanting to beleive in some it. Obviously not the faceless beings and clearly out there stuff, but it was the complicated and unusual missing persons cases that drew my attention. There are a few stories not related to the 411 stuff or the nosleep thread that I still find really interesting. There was a story I read a few years ago about a guy leaving a bar who left a voicemail with background noise of weird growls and unexplained sounds. he was later found dead miles away, cause of death i think was determined drowning. That was a real case covered by a smallblocal news statiom, ill try to find it and post links...and what also sucks is that its so difficult to even know what's real anymore when it comes to shit like this. Even plausible stuff can be easily faked...its crazy.. who knows any more.

       Doesn't matter. It's always him so as long as you're close, his marketing team/defenders will correct you. It's

       Honestly, that could possibly explain a small fraction of the missing people cases at best, but isn't a viable explanation to the vast majority of the rest of them. A mountain lion isn't going to drown someone miles away from a water source and leave the body unscathed.
