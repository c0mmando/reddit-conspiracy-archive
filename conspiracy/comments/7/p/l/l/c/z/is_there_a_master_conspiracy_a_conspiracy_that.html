       Given that major elements of the deep state and black budget were initiated surrounding the early UFO phenomenon, how can we understand the agendas of human groups without understanding the agenda of those Alien forces who may be present in our world? Does one influence the other? How?

       It's a giant pyramid structure, just like drug cartels and business's in general. The question that is always asked is: who guides this whole thing? Well, it's nice to think it's just Lord Rothschild, but in all probable reality it is a group of 3 to 5 VERY powerful families.

       The "Illuminati", "NWO", "Dark Cabal" paradigms can effectively serve powerful strands of the alien agenda i.e. denigration of our human institutions, to diminish confidence in human leadership and arouse suspicion and resentment even, thereof.   This 'stirs the pot' .. keeps us divided and distracted, looking elsewhere as the alien Intervention becomes stronger and more integrated.  These paradigms are being cited by individuals and groups in justification of their calls for alien governance/mentoring/saviour .  Humanity is effectively laying out the welcome mat .. ushering in its extraterrestrial 'controllers'.   If you're unsure of this, search for these ET emissaries/groups...you won't have to look far.

       Not sure, Reed, but to me it looks like different 'factions' are putting in place different measures. Within one strategic area we may find different 'formats' that probably belong to different groups. Like the one aimed at discrediting our institutions - for example the attacks against the scientific community. One tactic was quite clear in the free energy arena, quite some time ago I read something very interesting regarding the strategy of “sidelining” (I believe it may have been from Webre but I am not sure). Basically, people like Greer stir up big interest in Free Energy in order to overshadow the scientists that are truly doing something (with hard work and no fanfares), so that the real scientists are 'placed at the sidelines' because something better is allegedly being done. Sadly though, nothing is really being done except for building hope and discrediting the institutions.

       Counterpoint: The NWO has always existed and is a graphical symbol for a hierarchy through time that continues ever forward. Those in the highest ranks don't even know their influence and power, and though secret societies have existed throughout time to plan such things, these are secondary to the underlying flow and those that guide it, often not knowing they are "NWO/Illuminati"
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no more secret society than one where even it's members don't really know it exists, so that there could never be any proof, by its very nature, and yet somehow the membership figures it out.

       I personally feel that the alien agenda - the agenda of those ET forces present in our world - really is the conspiracy behind conspiracies. If this is what gave rise to the black budget and deep state in the US, how can we understand those realities without understanding the alien agenda that gave rise to them?

       Is this really a conspiracy, or the nature of our reality? Do you believe that there isn't some 'intelligence' that exists out of the thing we understand to be 'time' and has always been a part of who we are?

       Good thread Reed, I agree that the true conspiracy is not what is being shown to us. In my opinion ETs are exacerbating any situation where they can sort ‘wedge in’ through alternative media. Just as an example, look at what some the ‘conspiracy gurus’ have been doing with the NK situation some months ago, it seems to point to actions aimed at doing the following things:
- create a total 'no-negotiation' public opinion, thus, ultimately, a 'no-negotiation' scenario by fueling the 'provocation' and the 'threat' positions, in substitution of any encouragement to negotiate and mediate;
- depict a scenario where arming up with nukes is only justified;
- stimulate the need to use the nukes;
- misguide humanity towards a nuclear conflict so that we become 'ineligible' as stewards of Earth, so that the ET Intervention is authorised to displace us as a race.
I could be wrong, but, for example, a google search with keywords 'david icke on north korea' is literally a 'field trip' in that direction, here is an article posted on David Icke's site, it's by another author: "The question is: now that Russia and China understand that Washington is preparing for a preemptive nuclear strike against them in order to remove the two constraints on Washington’s unilateral behavior, will the two countries sit there and wait for the strike?"
This person is saying, 'nuke up everybody! Otherwise the USA will nuke you.'
He actually did receive some comments on this, but says they are from hired trolls:
"there were the trolls hired by the CIA, Mossad, National Endowment for Democracy, George Soros, NATO, US State Department, and others denouncing me for promoting nuclear war."
Right...he forgot to mention the Vatican, the Rothschilds, the Dark Cabal, the Illuminati...right...right.
Here is another post on David Icke's site: "The unstable regime in Pyongyang has concluded that its only hope of self-preservation, in the face of provocative threats from an unstable Trump administration, is to try and expand its nuclear arsenal as quickly as possible. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is acutely conscious of the brutal end of Iraq’s Saddam Hussein and Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi, after they abandoned their so-called weapons of mass destruction." So according to him the nukes just can't be abandoned - dodgy IMO. Seems like they want us to make the nuclear mess so that the ET Intervention can say: those irresponsible fools have to be displaced.
Maybe I am fetching a bit too far, but something is definitely fishy.

       The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.

       Ephesians 2:1-2
      </p>
      <p>
       As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient.

      <p>
       Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.

       Capitalism.  That's what's animated the CIA to kill JFK, overthrow a dozen or so elected foreign governments, and start the crack epidemic, that's what's caused them to fund climate denial and jihadism, and what allowed them to use the Saudis (who benefited majorly from the last two) to pull off 9/11.  That's also what allows them to launder their profits and buy of anyone who might have the power to stop them.

       There's not one single conspiracy controlling all below it. It's more like there are factions of conspiracies on a global level, some of which overlap and others which directly compete. There are business factions, there are religious factions, there are bank factions, there are political factions, there are royal factions. And these global conspiracies compete for power and influence conspiracies on a more local level. But not all local-level conspiracies can be attributed to the global-level conspiracies, and there is no singular power at the top either. There are some conspiracies with massive influence, especially within the countries they directly control, but they're not all powerful. AIPAC might have a tight grip around the USA's government, but Israel doesn't control China's government. Because they're in different factions vying for control of the world.

       Yes, first of all: your soul, or rather everyone's soul is immortal. 
Don't quit on me yet. 
Everyone is in this life to learn certain lessons from life (for example: to love deeper, to be able to let loved ones go free, to put other beings before things, etc.). So your soul enters your body upon birth like a driver entering a car. You yourself have chosen exactly this time to experience life in the third dimension under the given circumstances. When your earthly body dies your soul will go back to the astral plane to review experiences, recover and choose another point of incarnation to either learn new lessons, or if you failed to learn the lessons presented to you, repeat the same lessons. You forget everything about this at birth because it is important that understanding comes from within, so in order for you to learn your lessons you have to come up with the solutions without external influences. So usually when you see yourself constantly confronted with one kind of problem, this is most probably your lesson for this incarnation, and you will face this same kind of problem until you deal with it and then it will magically vanish and you will receive other problems. I hope you are still with me.
During your evolution and all actions you take, you can choose between two polarities: service to self(exploit other beings to raise your power/status/whatever) or service to others without expecting anything in return. Everything you do drives you towards one of the polarities. In certain timeframes there is a harvest for souls occurring where everyone gets evaluated in terms of their polarity, in order to advance to the next dimension. 
You have to be 95% negative, so really selfish and exploiting towards others, to advance into the next negative dimension, or 51% positive to enter the next positive dimension. If you are somewhere in-between you will stay in third dimension and have to continue lessons there. 
According to various messages this time is upon us somewhere from 100 to 700 years in time. Since the harvest is meant to be very fruitful, things start to escalate more, so as many people as possible get driven towards any polarity.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here comes the conspiracy: If you are negatively oriented and want to be more and more oriented in that direction you come up with ways to exploit other beings better, most importantly a system of money, government, you name it. Everything that enables power over others is a means to increase your negative polarity, and by promoting consumer mentality you drive people to head towards negative polarity themselves to gain more money / power. And all the other conspiracies you see all around you, are a direct result of this chase of polarity. And if you already made it to fourth or fifth dimension negative you might deem it worthwhile to enslave populations of other planets (for example earth) and promote the negative ways, so you can further increase your negative polarity.

       Yes there are tiers and there is a top tier. As far as I understood the theory correctly everything is about the experience, the experience of all possibilities of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       During third dimensions you are supposed to learn conscious behaviour, life does not just happen, you create your own reality. The realities of other beings might be disharmonic and chaotic, as long as you consciously choose to live a harmonic life you will most probably have one. You are supposed to not feel like there is nothing you can do and you are completely dependant upon external factors, you should realise that you make an impact. You impact everyone you meet and through your actions you influence what reality you live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fourth dimension you learn love in all possible facets. This is either love of self or love of others depending wether you qualified for positive or negative polarity. In positive the social memory complex will be formed here. Living as a social memory complex is described as everyone knows everyone and feels deeply attached to everyone like family.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fifth dimension is the one of wisdom. You just learn about the ways of the universe either alone (negative) or as a social memory complex(positive).
      </p>
      <p>
       In sixth dimension and onwards there is no polarity anymore.
As far as I understood seventh dimension is the top tier and then you rejoin the "light". 
But then nothing is finite and the "end" is most probably just a new beginning in the never ending cycle of the universe.

       so really there is no point.     I mean my divine creator wants me to experience everything possible in the universe but gives me the free will to create my own reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in a sense during life i create my reality.  I create what i want for my experiences.   If i am creating my own reality then i won't ever really experience everything in the universe.  Mainly because who wants to?  Who wants to be burned alive or whatever?

       This is just scratching the surface. It goes even deeper than this. Well first of all as you noted the universe is holographic everything is a manifestation of the absolute at infinity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how literally everything in this world is cyclical? That's because the entire universe is a simulation/a game. In the game there exists "levels" and an opponent right? The problem is there only really player. So the game is beautifully designed in such where both exist. The whole universe exists in cycles of darkness and light, ignorance and knowledge, life and death. The opponents are and the way the game is structured is that people who chose the negative polarity are not only teaching the people of the positive polarity but exist as the "opponent".

       Well said, the need to "piece everything together" and associate new information to prior information leads us out of reality and into delusion. The fact is that not everything connects, there are random events in the world and chaos is a parallel reality to any agenda to manipulate or control reality.

       I've come to this 'master conspiracy' during my research days that sums up and involves pretty much everything. I've realized this conclusion after, literally, thousands of hours researching everything, from metaphysics to religions, to science/math/biology - everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, since the dawn of Man, there was a small part of our population that is 'the elite' and they have been more or less in control of the world since the start, going back to ancient Egypt and beyond. In our recorded history there are these 13 families that rule the Earth for the last 6000 years. They can be traced back to the Sumerian civilization. They were the ruling elite of ancient Egypt and every other major nation since then. They can be looked at as 'the seed of the devil' or from their perspective as 'the seed of the God', meant to take care of this planet. They are the cause of the vast majority of calamities that happened in our history, including such things as creation of religious institutions, monetary system. The recent and more relative examples would be creation of both World Wars, the creation of democracy and communism as opposites, every global 'economic crisis', dumbing down of populations through education, power consolidation through corporations and information control through media and internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care to expand on any of this. All the information is out there to find. The rabbit hole is deep.. maybe endlessly so. I don't know if any of this is true and I don't care anymore. It is important to keep your mind open to all information though, to be able to make up your own damn mind about things that are happening around.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always kept this quote in my mind, not sure where it came from. "Look at all the information as possible, never as fact."

       Appreciate you describing your position on this. I myself don't agree that there is a ancient-to-present line of control that has determined just about all major events in human history. There is the chaos factor, there are random disconnected events, there are many minds competing for the same space. Yes there are agendas to control and direct that space, but no single group or set of families can control a world of 7 billion. I think its a fruitless attempt to tie everything together into a "theory of everything" and ultimately leads us to deny those parts of reality that don't fit into that theory, cherry picking reality to build a conceptual reality that really only exists in our head. That said, there is a force in the world that I do feel has been shifting the entire world sideways, chaos and all, in ways we are not seeing clearly. That is the presence of Alien forces in our world and the pervasive form of influence they are casting on leaders and citizens alike. The arrival of non-human intelligence in the world is the one thing that truly could affect the global order in a complete way. Humans vs humans wouldn't do so in the same way no matter how strong the agenda.

       It's an interesting thought to ponder, that aliens are invading our planet, through some kind of inter-dimensional methods. The problem with it is that there's absolutely not a single thread of evidence of any of it. The problem I see with aliens is simple. If I were an alien that has infinitely greater technological advancement, I would have absolutely no reason to 'take over' other planets or enslaving others. I mean.. what's the point? We are already on the verge of infinite power and abilities at our current technological level. We are about to create AI and VR, both of which combined, will allow us eventually to simulate universes, create life out of nothing, possibly live forever. I don't see how such unbelievably advanced intelligence would be in any way malevolent to other life and intelligence. I mean, what's the point? To enslave the human race? For what purpose?

       In short, no i don't feel there is a master human conspiracy that controls all others. There are conspiracies and always have been but they are imperfect and always limited in their impact by both the forces of nature and the random and chaotic nature of 7 billion people choosing, acting and reacting. However I do feel an ET force is in our world with an agenda to influence, shape and direct the future of humanity and, given their technological power and skill in the Mental Environment, they do have the capability to direct human life on a scale never achieved by any human group. Standing behind many of those human groups with an agenda to control others could be an ET force aiding and empowering them.

       There have been powerful individuals and groups of people conspiring to achieve power, wealth and influence throughout history, and I do believe this has evolved in complexity and scope, especially in this past century. But it also doesn’t seem as well organized or controlled as people tend to suspect and there isn’t some master narrative which puts everything in order.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ET intervention obfuscates things further. There is a foreign presence in the world which seems to have usurped certain institutions of power and individuals within them - in government, in commerce, in religious offices, not to mention average citizens. When we begin to discern this objectively, it becomes clear that there are overlaps between human and ET elements. Whether or not we can fully know or disclose the details of these things is relatively unimportant - but it is important to understand that there are now (as of WWII) alien powers in our world which are manipulating and directing human affairs for their own purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       One example I like to contemplate is 9/11. This was obviously a false flag attack - generally speaking, to enrich a few individuals and to justify the United States’ geopolitical goals in the Middle East, while ushering in a greater level of control and surveillance domestically. But at a higher vantage point, I see the influence of the ET intervention at work - to engage powerful nations in intractable conflicts, which bleed them of wealth and resources, fracturing them internally amongst their populaces and encouraging greater distrust for their leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       To maintain this perspective gives us the freedom to see through all the controversial headlines and the fog of human interpretation and speculation. The world is moving in a certain direction and their are many forces at play here, but unless this bigger picture becomes clear, all the other conspiracies are fundamentally incomplete and serve as a distraction.

       Is this really a conspiracy, or the nature of our reality? Do you believe that there isn't some 'intelligence' that exists out of the thing we understand to be 'time' and has always been a part of who we are?

       Good thread Reed, I agree that the true conspiracy is not what is being shown to us. In my opinion ETs are exacerbating any situation where they can sort ‘wedge in’ through alternative media. Just as an example, look at what some the ‘conspiracy gurus’ have been doing with the NK situation some months ago, it seems to point to actions aimed at doing the following things:
- create a total 'no-negotiation' public opinion, thus, ultimately, a 'no-negotiation' scenario by fueling the 'provocation' and the 'threat' positions, in substitution of any encouragement to negotiate and mediate;
- depict a scenario where arming up with nukes is only justified;
- stimulate the need to use the nukes;
- misguide humanity towards a nuclear conflict so that we become 'ineligible' as stewards of Earth, so that the ET Intervention is authorised to displace us as a race.
I could be wrong, but, for example, a google search with keywords 'david icke on north korea' is literally a 'field trip' in that direction, here is an article posted on David Icke's site, it's by another author: "The question is: now that Russia and China understand that Washington is preparing for a preemptive nuclear strike against them in order to remove the two constraints on Washington’s unilateral behavior, will the two countries sit there and wait for the strike?"
This person is saying, 'nuke up everybody! Otherwise the USA will nuke you.'
He actually did receive some comments on this, but says they are from hired trolls:
"there were the trolls hired by the CIA, Mossad, National Endowment for Democracy, George Soros, NATO, US State Department, and others denouncing me for promoting nuclear war."
Right...he forgot to mention the Vatican, the Rothschilds, the Dark Cabal, the Illuminati...right...right.
Here is another post on David Icke's site: "The unstable regime in Pyongyang has concluded that its only hope of self-preservation, in the face of provocative threats from an unstable Trump administration, is to try and expand its nuclear arsenal as quickly as possible. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is acutely conscious of the brutal end of Iraq’s Saddam Hussein and Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi, after they abandoned their so-called weapons of mass destruction." So according to him the nukes just can't be abandoned - dodgy IMO. Seems like they want us to make the nuclear mess so that the ET Intervention can say: those irresponsible fools have to be displaced.
Maybe I am fetching a bit too far, but something is definitely fishy.
