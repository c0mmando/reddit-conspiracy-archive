      <p>
       All in one day, an anonymous patriot within the FBI used the official FBIRecordsVault Twitter to make a series of tweets that could only be described as highly unusual. The FBIRecordsVault rarely Tweets at all, and for 17 tweets to come through just after midnight all at once perked many peoples' attention. Why did he do it? Why were the initial tweets linked to Donald Trump's father and uncle? Why all of the operation manuals? What follows is the message hidden within those tweets...
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a fucking timeline of events
      </p>
      <p>
       ────────
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Trump's dad vetted by FBI Director in the 1960's
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Trump's uncle was old-school FBI (Tesla)
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The FBI became compromised/infiltrated via wet criminality - get people involved in your crimes so they can't expose you (Ethics Code)
      </p>
      <p>
       4) What an investigation should look like (Manual)
      </p>
      <p>
       5) What the Clinton investigation looked like (4 pages!?)
      </p>
      <p>
       6) What the Petraus investigation looked like (bazillion pages)
      </p>
      <p>
       The above 3 prove corruption within FBI, and Federal Government as a Whole, has been 100% accomplished by ~2014
      </p>
      <p>
       7) May 2015 Baltimore - Beginning of Soros funded attempted FEDERALIZATION of police. This is an attempt to usurp States rights by the Federal Govt./Soros. Basically, this is the LAST ELECTION, LAST CHANCE - Trump has been pushing this for a long time now.
      </p>
      <p>
       8) Donald J. Trump made honoraria FBI asset - he was RECRUITED by patriots within the FBI to do what he's doing. His uncle was well respected. They knew his dad. He's clean. They needed him. That's from the FBI Honoraria tweet. Here's some Alex Jones insider info. Trump has been many steps ahead of the game this entire time, like a prophet. Connect the dots. Dr. Steve Pieczenik is the direct link from Intelligence Agencies to Trump, he has been advising Trump for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       9 ) How operations run by FBI but outside of FBI look (Trump campaign - Trump has been getting insider info all along - the Tweeted document shows it's legal to give him classified info in this case) -
       <a href="https://twitter.com/FBIRecordsVault/status/792637205134970880">
        https://twitter.com/FBIRecordsVault/status/792637205134970880
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       10) Stay-Behind Agents - activation of patriots embedded in enemy occupied territory within other agencies of Federal Govt. to help. Secret Service. NSA. Etc.
       <a href="https://twitter.com/FBIRecordsVault/status/792637207601225729">
        https://twitter.com/FBIRecordsVault/status/792637207601225729
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       11) Social Networking - /pol/ , r/the_donald conscripted to help BY FBI ANON, confirmed by EXACT 11AM TIME OF TWEET - Social Networking and Viral news is the only reason any of this has even been possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       12) Physical fitness program - this was the Hillary health leaks, accomplished by above FBI operation/conscripted parties
      </p>
      <p>
       13) FOIA - this was the Wikileaks, same as above (I previously proved Wikileaks was leaked by US AGENTS because NO CLASSIFIED MATERIALS were leaked - our boys are by the fucking BOOK)
      </p>
      <p>
       14) FBI Seal - this is the FBI coming into the open about all of the above, via this tweeting and Dr. Pieczenik - We are part of a legitimate FBI by-the-book Operation against DOMESTIC enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       15) FBI now conscripting all of us (students) to help with the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       16) Find AND EXPOSE the smoking gun...
      </p>
      <p>
       17) ...In the Clinton Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
       ────────
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone says 'smoking gun' so much. Let me be as clear as I can: A smoking gun is something NOBODY can argue or deny, and will take down the WHOLE CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION
      </p>
      <p>
       So far, NOTHING meets that criteria. NOT Foreign contributions. Pay to play. Corruption. Collusion. Above the law. All proven. None of it matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       ────────
      </p>
      <p>
       Only ONE THING will take them down for sure: Connect the PEDOPHILE RING to the CLINTON FOUNDATION.
      </p>
      <p>
       THAT IS THE SMOKING GUN.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Steve P also steering my fellow autists in this direction:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12zVlaZyX3Q">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12zVlaZyX3Q
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       NOBODY In power will INVESTIGATE THIS because THEY'RE ALL Implicated because THAT'S HOW THEY COMPROMISE THEM SO EFFECTIVELY - THEY put people IN CHARGE who PARTAKE - REMEMBER DENNY HASTERT - JEFFREY ESPSTEIN - If CAUGHT they do VERY LITTLE TIME
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a world-wide Pedo-Ring connected to the CLINTON FOUNDATION, that just so happens to also be taking over the USA for good.
      </p>
      <p>
       FIND IT AND YOU FOUND A SMOKING GUN.
      </p>
      <p>
       WHAT WE CAN DO
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason why #DraftOurDaughters was working so well was because it was based in truth and it plucked heart strings. But the fact is, it is a future truth. Children are at this very moment being abused by the people who run our country, and most of the rest of the nations of the world. It is so very hard to expose this because people don't want to believe it, and don't want to believe it's possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF WE EXPOSE THE RING TO A CRITICAL MASS OF PEOPLE THEY WILL FALL
      </p>
      <p>
       STEP 1: Find Simple To Present Evidence, Accompanied by STRONG VISUALS (Not necessarily directly related)
      </p>
      <p>
       STEP 2: MEME Warfare it to FRONT PAGE of ALL THE INTERNET
      </p>
      <p>
       ────────
      </p>
      <p>
       Centipedes: It is clear that there are brave men and women within our intelligence and law enforcement agencies who want to expose this. So why aren't they?
      </p>
      <p>
       They are not allowed to do so. Their hands are tied. If they try, they will be burned.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have the info, they have the leads, they have the means to DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
      </p>
      <p>
       So WHAT DO THEY NEED?
      </p>
      <p>
       They need smoke cover
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it. They couldn't even be doing what they're doing right now if it weren't for Donald J. Trump and his campaign exposing even the lighter issues, such as pay-to-play and other corruption. When something is brought to light, forced into the mainstream, that enables our PATRIOT ACTORS to ACT, because in darkness their bosses have power over them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pedophile ring is the HARDEST thing to bring to light because people DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT.
      </p>
      <p>
       But THAT IS OUR JOB.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meme Magic can #SAVEOURCHILDREN by exposing it to millions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meme Magic can #BRINGDOWNTHERING by bringing this thing into the public light.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once it's public, THEN our boys can act.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an honor to serve with you. It's time to save our children. It's time to save the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weaponized Meme Magic is the Key.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
       If you are in the party that can MAKE KILLSHOT MEMES WITH THE INFO, Post them in THIS THREAD
      </p>
      <p>
       As soon as I see anyone producing memes that will be effective enough to #BRINGDOWNTHERING and #SAVEOURCHILDREN, I will update this final section with links to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is enough out there to start bringing it to the public now, it's all about presentation. The Franklin Coverup implicates the Bush family as well as Barney Frank - Here are the Court Files. Denny Hastert is well known. Jeffery Epstein is out there
      </p>
      <p>
       This is very much about presentation and making it viral so that FBI and others can ACT
      </p>
      <p>

       Memes - As We Speak #BringDownTheRing is happening on Twitter.

       TLDR; Operation Smoke Screen
      </p>
      <p>
       Our sole modis operandi right now is to make sure that millions of people become aware that there is a pedo-ring running our government and most of the world - that way our badass patriots within intelligence / law enforcement will have smoke-cover to take care of business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedes, the FBI and other heros HAVE the evidence, they need an excuse to GET IT OUT without getting fucking killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       When did the Podesta leaks come?
      </p>
      <p>
       AFTER WE PUT THE SPOTLIGHT ON CORRUPTION. SPOTLIGHT FIRST, THEN IT'S SAFE TO LEAK.

       I also think Snowden was in no way a traitor but the insider patriots vetted, informed and supplied him with all the data needed to wake the public. If you watch the movie "Snowden", you'll see that he supposedly snuck a USB drive through a Rubik's cube but that's fucking fantasy, he was probably supplied with everything in a neat package by the patriots.
