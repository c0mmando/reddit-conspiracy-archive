        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There have been some threads about the massacre today, with one person in a top thread even saying the investigating has gone kaput.  It hasn&#39;t!  I am working on an article on the subject currently, and summarizing some of my own findings.  And plenty of other more serious people are doing shit too.  But I will post a quick update just because people in that other thread seem so miserable!</p>

<p>The search for truth and justice is no where near dead... read on.</p>

<p>There are open lawsuits trying to compel the FBI to release information, and some people are still continuing their independent research work!  This month I think the case is supposed to go to court, if I recall.</p>

<p>The FBI is still &#39;investigating&#39;, too.  According to my findings, they are pretty much running a cover up operation under the guise of an investigation that for some reason, people can know nothing about (even though they say the man who perpetrated the attacks by himself is dead).  This is contradictory -- they are lying.  They are running a cover up unfortunately.  They have promised to issue an update in OCTOBER of 2018.  By then mecha weinstein should be ready to dominate the air waves, of course, so lets hope the law suits make progress -- we should look for ways to get involved in that.</p>

<p>For the people asking, &quot;where is the footage?&quot;  The FBI has it -- they even admit to it.  They say there is too much to go through and it will take forever.  They won&#39;t let us see though, even though they&#39;ll just fuck up the job anyway.  They have much more evidence too.  For the people wondering if there is any conspiracy here... here it is:</p>

<p>Paddock was closely tied to the defense and intelligence community in the 70s and 80s -- this is recorded fact (you can look it up in the NYTimes, for example).  Paddock&#39;s work at the IRS auditing defense contracts and his job at an unknown lockheed predecessor company privileged him with access to sensitive information -- a fact confirmed by Lockheed Martin&#39;s statement that the details of Paddock&#39;s work at the company (which they will not even mention what company) cannot be made public due to the sensitivity of the information.  The IRS has not been forthcoming with information either to my knowledge.  Can you imagine?  Families have no idea why this has happened -- its too sensitve according to a Lockheed Martin CEO.   Shit, I forget to check if anyone even asked the IRS.</p>

<p>Paddock&#39;s role at the IRS was likely connected to the work he would go on to do for Lockheed&#39;s unnamed predecessor company, and his time there proved lucrative -- after only a few years Paddock left the company with the liquid assets necessary to found a real estate empire with his brother that would ultimately make him a multi millionaire.  His brother said the money came from what Paddock was earning at the Lockheed predecessor.  That money would become the fortune that financed the attack.  <strong>FACT: US government money from the intelligence community financed the vegas attack more or less directly.  Furthermore the attack was carried out by a man with rock solid ties to US clandestine services.</strong></p>

<p>I am still working on Paddock&#39;s work when he was a self employed intelligence contractor -- there is good reason to believe he was still an intelligence asset up to the day he committed the massacre (not that that will suprise anyone here).  <strong>If anyone knows about accounting or real estate business practices or the foreign exchange student / host family industry, contact me.</strong>  Don&#39;t even get me started on the girlfriend....</p>

<p>Anyway, we all know what he did after he &#39;retired&#39; according to his brother...</p>

<p>After the attack police found more weapons and explosives in one of his houses in vegas.  They also removed some nondescript electronic devices which the FBI is currently &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;investigating&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; no doubt.  <strong>Evidently they forgot something though, since the house was burglarized right under the nose of the police not long after.</strong>  Don&#39;t worry, they checked a second time and nothing seemed amiss.</p>

<p>There is so much more to say about this ridiculous bullshit, too.  Anyway, don&#39;t lose hope, and certainly don&#39;t anyone start talking like the Vegas investigation is a think of the past.  The FBI would love that.</p>

<p>Paddock didn&#39;t exist in a vacuum.  There is a reason this happened.  The FBI will tell you this guy was a real enigma and loner... the fucking CEO of Lockheed Martin knows the guy, apparently.  Dont forget it!</p>

<p>I bet the government gave MGM a list of possible people they could use from the Government database and their previous employees, and let MGM decide who the patsy would be. &quot;Paddock&quot; was tantalized with a comp room at Mandalay for free, I bet. They shot his ass up, planted the evidence and carried out the attack. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A spokesperson for the Office of Personnel Management confirmed to ABC News that Paddock was employed by the federal government from 1975 to 1985, first as a letter carrier for the U.S. Postal Service, then as an agent for the Internal Revenue Service and finally as an auditor for the Defense Contract Audit Agency.</p>

<p>He also worked for a company that later become Lockheed Martin, one of the world’s largest defense contractors.</p>

<p>“Stephen Paddock worked for a predecessor company of Lockheed Martin from 1985 until 1988,” the company told ABC in a statement. “We’re cooperating with authorities to answer questions they may have about Mr. Paddock and his time with the company.” </p>

<p>My detailed notes on the matter are not on this computer.  This is what I can remember of the things I was able to confirm (hopefully I remember right too.)  There was a lot of open questions about her.</p>

<p>She began life in the philipines, I think?  Or Taiwan?  I forget.  Anyway, she ends up in  Australia, married to an australian boxer.  She gets australian citizenship.  He dies, and she goes to LA. and marries another guy.  At this point I assume she has american citizenship too.  Between australia and LA, I think she has a kid.  She ends up leaving that guy, and getting with another. who is somewhere in the south or midwest if I recall.  </p>

<p>She stays with him until she meets paddock while working as like, some kind of weird comfort girl or something for the casino.  She is like assigned to him, and they are start to like each other supposedly and she leaves the husband and is paling around with Paddock as he is doing his globetrotting.  <strong>All in all I think she has citizenship in 3 different countries, and has had 3 different names</strong>  Not bad for a comfort girl at a casino?  Maybe that is normal for them and I&#39;m just sheltered who knows.  Watch out for that.  </p>

<p>Her role at the casino is suspect as shit to me.   She was like a prostitue or something?  I have no idea.  There&#39;s no way to know 100%, but she almost certainly knew about the arsenal he was building.  She is spooky as fuck in my opnion.  I remember hearing a rumor months and months ago, that someone got a hold of her immigration papers.  Thats the grail for me.  Supposedly (and this was just a rumor to me) there was some state department or intelligence official that signed her papers to give her american citizenship.  She hasn&#39;t been forthcoming about the guy at all, thats for sure.    I wonder what she is doing now?  Kicking back with all that paper he wired to her maybe.  Anyway, nothing solid on her.  But she was another globe hopper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this is a bit of a fringe theory as it pertains to this subject, and I haven&#39;t heard it discussed here much, but I&#39;d like to hear some takes on it...</p>

<p>Blood at the scene. I&#39;ve tried googling and searching through cell phone videos of the incident and I have <em>yet</em> to find blood at the scene of the concert. Besides <em>perfectly taken</em> picture with blood coming down the back of some girl&#39;s leg as she lies on the ground there is no pictures or accounts of any blood at the scene. I&#39;m sorry but I just don&#39;t want to link to stuff that&#39;s potentially NSFL. Also in plenty of cell phone videos of the incident there are people screaming &quot;those aren&#39;t real gun shots!&quot; and the sources are all different.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t my theory but I stumbled across it and found it interesting. Are all of the bloody photos and videos removed from the internet? Does anyone here have any insight on this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something interesting about Paddock... </p>

<p>My Mom and Stepdad vacation in Florida for the winter... Their neighbours down there (another retired couple) were in Thailand on a cruise last year. They met Paddock and his girlfriend at a bar or restaurant. Not sure who suggested it, but the couples got together again the following day, on Paddocks cruise ship, where they had luxury quarters with a private chef.... My Mom&#39;s friend said Paddock was quiet and not the friendliest guy in the world but that he definitely seemed &quot;normal&quot; and didn&#39;t voice any extreme opinions during their interactions.</p>

<p>They were obviously shocked upon seeing his photo on the news and realizing it was the same man they had dined with.</p>

<p>My question is.... What was his motive? If you are living a life of luxury like that, you would have to have a pretty good reason to want to shoot up a crowd and know that you aren&#39;t likely making it out alive.</p>

<p>I definitely agree with the theory that he was still an intelligence asset &amp; was likely set up as a fall guy.</p>

<p>(if anyone is interested, I can ask my Mom to forward me her friends photo of them on the cruise ship with Paddock...) </p>

<p>B)  You can then check their sources and decide whether they&#39;re legit for yourself</p>

<p>C)  If you want someone to research something why not  provide the sources that you used to come to the conclusions you did?  If not why should anyone believe anything you&#39;re saying?  Oftentimes on here someone will make a claim and I can&#39;t find anything that backs that claim up.  So it&#39;s nice to know where they came up with said claim so we can be on the same page.</p>

<p>It&#39;s honestly weird that people get so offended when asked to provide a source.  It&#39;s a bare minimum when making a claim that isn&#39;t already consensus (and often not a bad idea for things that are generally agreed upon anyway). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This site which anyone could make, and appears to be unrelated to the shooting in Vegas, proves nothing.  It woudln&#39;t be enough for mere hundreds of them to be actors... it would require the participation of thousands or perhaps millions to perpetrate the this lie, and fake the carnage.  You think the personel at what like 4 different hospitals in las vegas were in on it?  All the people who transported the wounded and dead were in on it?  500 people with  injuries all in on it?  All the doctors who continue to see these people in other parts of the country?  Like what is the scope of this in your mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were no wounded, dead, or injured. It&#39;s really simple that if no shots were fired no one can have gotten shot. No one can show that shots were fired in any meaningful way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so thousands upon thousands of people in the LV metro area, and the medical establishment all over the country were in on it?  Thousands more who lie and pretend their families were killed were in on it all over the country?  Thousands of LV emergency personnel and police?  How many coroners and so on all in on it?</p>

<p>If shots werent fired, explain the injured 500 people and ~55 killed ?  You really allege a conspiracy of this scope?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It baffles my mind how one could come to the conclusion of it being a hoax. Just imagine what type of planning would have to go into fabricating an event like this. Also just ONE person would need to blow the whistle for this thing to go up in smoke. </p>

<p>It just seems so implausible, anybody that thinks this is a hoax has to be some type of disinfo agent (or retarded).</p>

<p>Also it&#39;s amusing that you apparently never post on this subreddit and yet feel strongly enough about this one talking point to appear and call me a shill.</p>

What&#39;s your point?Look, I&#39;ve been out of the conspiracy circles for a decade now, have kids and fell for too many &quot;the economy is about to collapse build a shelter shit&quot; too many times. And I know there&#39;s no hope of pulling your head out of your ass because you seem hopeless af..But I live in Vegas and know obviously a shit ton more about this than you so it&#39;s reignited my tin foil spirit and here I am, scanning this sub everyday hoping something will break.</p>

<p>Are they covering some shit up? Yeah, no doubt.</p>

<p>Was it staged? Haha If you truly think that then you should probably get your head checked, otherwise you&#39;re most likely a shill trying to discredit the legitimate questions people have about this event and the handling of the aftermath by MGM/LVMPD.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So impressed with your karma. No matter what you say, you owe this community a modicum of proof of your claims. Or you should keep your mouth shut. In other threads you spout off the same things. </p>

<p>I’m beginning to think the shill claims are correct, as you never make your point with evidence. So following your line of proof, it’s up to you to prove you aren’t a shill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve made posts anyone can go look at right now in my history about people on the scene saying &quot;fake gunshots,&quot; someone saying &quot;it doesn&#39;t look like anyone is actually injured,&quot; a video that confirms one of the witnesses was an actress from Dr Phil, and my threads where I challenged people for visual evidence of shots being fired and came up basically empty. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also documented the over 30 times (now over 40) that people on this sub told me they knew a victim, which was also made into an article on newnationalist.net. </p>

<p>So if this doesn&#39;t count as a &quot;modicum&quot; of proof to you, that&#39;s just because it goes against the official narrative. But either way, the burden of proof is on the claim that people were shot. I hear people say &quot;extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence&quot; but there is no extraordinary evidence of shots being fired, though there should be an abundance. Even more so now that we are 3 months removed from the event. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>what would you consider proof, that you wouldnt just call fake when I show it to you?</p>

<p>cause there is plenty of proof people got shot.
How do you explain the police officers who died for example?
Would you imply the police department is lying as a whole that one of their own officers died?</p>

<p>This is ridiculous.  Flawed logic.</p>
