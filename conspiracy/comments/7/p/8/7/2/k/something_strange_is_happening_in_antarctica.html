    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t much, but my uncle is a research scientist (botanist) and went to Antartica in the 1970s.  He said there were little Nazi flags in the ice, scattered in big open areas.  The Nazi planes dropped them, kind of like claiming the territory.  They were there 30+ years later and no one had touched them.  That&#39;s all he mentioned.  Told me when I was a teenager.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting they were never touched however that might have something to do with the international agreements down there that are taken very seriously not to upset the land.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Search for Operation Iceworm. It was supposedly a US Army project on Greenland that looked into drilling tunnels through which to fire nuclear missiles at USSR (yeah, right). They had <em>portable nuclear reactors in 1956</em> and I believe they drilled into something they shouldn&#39;t have found and hastily abandoned the entire base. Think &quot;The Thing&quot;.</p>

<p>Read a lot about this but never heard anything about &quot;The Thing&quot; thing, from all accounts the Danish workers cleaning up the mess afterwards were poisoned by radiation. The US soldiers doing the digging had to give up because of the ever shifting ice, it made it difficult to create the tunnels.</p>

<p>Not that I&#39;m disputing this stuff it seems interesting. However in what fucking leap of logic do you obtain the idea that it is easier to build a fucking underground base than it is to just build some god damn warehouses above ground and use a basic mother fucking dirt / asphalt road between them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and it is the only pyramid in Antarctica I&#39;m aware of. There are plenty of pictures online. <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2232032/mysterious-pyramid-is-buried-in-the-icy-wastes-of-antarctica/">This</a> is where I took the one I linked.

    <div class="md"><p>It shouldn&#39;t give you the creeps IMO, mysteries are fascinating, should elicit feelings of wonder and awe.</p>

<p>Imagine being ignorant enough (à la TMoR for example) to think you (and mankind) have figured everything out ... it must be quite depressing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am wiser than this man, for neither of us appears to know anything great and good; but he fancies he knows something, although he knows nothing; whereas I, as I do not know anything, so I do not fancy I do. In this trifling particular, then, I appear to be wiser than he, because I do not fancy I know what I do not know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love that quote! So releavent in today&#39;s world it is amazing. Its funny because the ignorant are usually the most expressive. I guess it&#39;s cause they are ignorant to how they are precived when they try to flaunt a huge ego and no absolutely nothing about the topic.</p>

<p>I&#39;m definitely facinated by things that are mysterious. Actually, complete mystery has become my favorite hobby. Seeing little layer&#39;s pealed of subjects thought to be completely out there is exciting and validating as all hell.</p>

<p>But, it all seems very nefarious in regards to this subject. And that is what I mean by creeps me out. The amount of nefarious activities in such a isolated location that could be going on is quite a subject. I feel it needs more light shed on the subject, as I, have been completely ignorant to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your first paragraph. Another way to put it is that ignorance is strongly correlated with arrogance.</p>

<p>About the rest - after a while down the rabbit hole, one generally starts to grasp <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5tdzyh/if_you_realize_all_your_sensory_experiences/">the nature of the world</a> we live in. Once that <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/6niafw/the_five_levels_of_truth/">level</a> is achieved, it becomes easy to experience; thereafter any and all fear or disgust disappear.</p>

<p>At least that&#39;s my take on it. Cheers mate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your take is something I agree with 100%. Great posts thanks for linking them. I always stay curious, life is too interesting not too. Their is never enough to explore. </p>

<p>Plus, it keeps you honest with yourself. Being able to retract a statement and stay humble is something many people can&#39;t do for some reason. Even if they know they are wrong, they will not admit it. To me it shows character in a person to admit they don&#39;t know everything and allow themselves to gain knowledge from others that are initiating discussion.  Anyway good stuff.</p>

<p>I have never looked into this before, but is it possible the Earth previous had a different tilt and this area was a nutrient rich rain forest or plain? It is probably jumping too far, but maybe there is an ancient civilization frozen like an Ice Pompeii. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily. Antarctica could very likely had a warm climate before the last pole shift which some have theorised was ~26,000 years ago (roughly), which is well within the time span for modern homo sapiens (who&#39;ve been dated back to emerging at least 200,000 years ago). It&#39;s possible that advanced human civilisations have come and gone in that time, and that over the last glacial period, topped off with the cataclysmic younger dryas period from ~12,900-11,200 years ago, much of the man-made architectural and technological progress and advancements were naturally destroyed, along with a good portion of the human population (namely other human species with whom we&#39;d previously coexisted on earth with) leaving only homo sapiens alive and little of the old civilizations, save for particular megalithic structures around the world. </p>

<p>How? Even if the magnetic pole wasn&#39;t over antactica, the axis of rotation would still be and the continent would jave much less sunlight than others</p>

<p>Continental drift is very slow and while antarctica is in the geographic pole it will be an ice desert</p>

<p>That&#39;s not how it works, if there was an ancient civilization there would be a lot of clues, from bodies to ruins to less iron and bronze on the surface levels, also the Ice age was well knows for preserving things for the future, not destroying evidence</p>

<p>Hint: No, for both of those questions.     </p>

<p>As for my &quot;credentials&quot;, I don&#39;t have to prove myself to you what-so-ever.

    <div class="md"><p>OMG Mast, I had no idea.  I saw you mention something about letting the homeless couple pick through your wife&#39;s things - and I thought it was a joke that you were letting someone mess with the wife&#39;s stuff while she was at work.  Now I feel like an awful idiot for not delving into it and finding out more.  Now I understand why you reached out to them.</p>

<p>You are one of my favorite Redditors and I am so sad for you that you lost her.  You&#39;ve always talked about her fondly, she sounded like a good match for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I talked about her so much TMOR regularly posted about it when I did haha. And honestly after they started doing that it just made it wayy more fun to bring up my wife. They have been surprisingly silent. I&#39;m shocked!</p>

<p>She was my best and only friend irl. Maybe that is sad? I dunno, but she was such a huge person. Everyone who met her LOVED her. She was just one of those people, ya know?</p>

<p>And ya I took in that homeless couple because we were just like them, and I had to do something or go mad. They are doing really well too! </p>

<p>I miss her so much though man. I&#39;m just a boring empty thing without her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Naw dude I&#39;m pretty fuckin boring. I mean, unless you are into conspiracies lol?</p>

<p>Do not take tylenol. During WW2 there was an initiative to develop an asprin analog, because Bayer owned the patent, and we were at war with Germany. The result of that was acetaminophen. It totally fucks up your liver and sucks as anything except a fever reducer. And they seem to put it in like <em>everything</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Came across this don&#39;t mean to get involved in a personal conversation but I just wanted to say I am extremely sorry buddy, wish I could say more than that.</p>

<p>Absolutely no words for that amount of loss and pain. Try and let yourself grieve, if you need to yell and be whatever you need to then do it. You deserve every amount of being about you, if you can get what I mean. Loss that close can be unbelievable, I just want you to know I&#39;ve been through something similar and didn&#39;t let myself grieve untill much later and it came out in such dramatic fashion I didn&#39;t know what was going on with me.</p>

<p>Anyway I know it doesn&#39;t help or mean much. But this stranger is giving you every amount of care and love I can send to you. No one should every have to go through that I&#39;m SO sorry. Hope you have a good support system. If you ever need someone completely neutral and needa vent to someone who understands always feel free to shoot me a PM. I  never interject, the best thing, in my opinion, is to be as selfish (for lack of a better word) as you can/need. That is pain that&#39;s inconcvble for anyone that hasnt been through it. All my respect and love brother. Stay strong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is completely normal and okay. The amount of emotions you must be going through is intense I&#39;m sure. The whirlwind from it being so soon it&#39;s almost impossible to get a grasp right now.. sorry for speculateing though. What helped me the most when I sat and tried to come to terms with life was relating to people outside my immediate circle because they tried to hard to figure out a solution when their was none. All I needed was to have people listen. Don&#39;t act until you need too, and never pressure yourself to act on anything until you are ready. Right now it IS about you. You sound like an amazing husband and very selfless so I&#39;m sure it&#39;s foreign to have that thought process. But you deserve it and if you can&#39;t then others hopefully make you sure it is okay and good to be that way for however long you need too.</p>

<p>Be as good as you can too yourself as you can. And I&#39;m sure that seems impossible right now, but don&#39;t force anything. Just be whatever you need to be. Don&#39;t thank me, thank you for being a great person in a world where we need more great people. </p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m sorry I just reread and missed the last sentence. I can only speak from personal experience, so I&#39;m sorry if it seems like im understanding that amount of pain you are feeling. But feeling like you will do something terrible is another feeling that is completely normal. Like I said, the amount of emotions right now with it being so recent is a huge burden on your psyche. No one and I mean no one is immune to that line of thought. </p>

<p>And I mean it when I say this stranger is sending as much positivity as I can. At the end of the day nothing else matters then what you are experiencing, as it should be. Try and be good to yourself bud. I, and I&#39;m sure many others are here to extend a hand if or when you need it. Online or elsewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know in regards to my last sentence...I agree wanting to kill yourself is a perfectly normal response to this kind of situattion. And you see in that comment I&#39;m afraid to say that. </p>

<p>We have this new society that is supposed to be so accepting of everything? And here I am feeling perfectly normal things, and unable to talk about it because I think someone will notify the authorities, and totally change my life, legally. I&#39;m afraid to say I want to die because my best friend is gone. What has been really accompished? </p>

<p>Am i just being nuts? Totally ok to say so</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hell fucking no you aren&#39;t being nuts! Dude the people who are nuts are the ones that wouldn&#39;t feel what you are feeling. Anyone who would pass judgement on what you are saying I&#39;d wanna reach though their screen and slap <em>the sociopathic personality they annonmously portray just because they are so disconnected from actual reality</em> shit out of them. </p>

<p>People throw around the word crazy like it&#39;s nothing. Crazy doesn&#39;t apply to ANYTHING moral and awesome people think or do. People who have the personality and thought process of a 2x4 and stick to some public narrative just to feel apart of the status quo society are fucking crazy imo. But that&#39;s all besides the point and I&#39;m rambling like an idiot. You definitely need to think what you need to think. It&#39;s such a confusing awful time for you right now. BUT, because I thought about ending myself so many times I can&#39;t count. What kept me going was I knew my best friend also, would have been wanting slap the shit out of <em>me</em> knowing that would be the last thing in the world they would have wanted. So I stay kicking to keep their spirit, personality and memory in my heart everyday. And since your wife seems like an amazing person I know she&#39;d want the same for you.</p>

<p>Also the world right now needs real people like yourself when their are a shit ton of absolute degenerate thought processes that express their huge internet egos 1000x a day :). Internet strangers that act moral and I feel like I could be good friends with IRL make me feel good.

The act of them meeting, Kirill and Pope, was something that hasn&#39;t happened in 1000 years based on something I read.  I am unsure where that quote came from so it may very well be wrong.  It was a small detail as compared to all the other Antarctica news that was coming out at the same time.</p>

<p>Has any of these people came out with a public statement as to why they took the trip in the first place? It&#39;s so random I feel like they would at least need to say something about the trip (even if it is a complete lie) if these trips were public.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just really not a coincidence as to why prolific people all made trips there without some type of statement they would need to make... Thanks for bringing up the topic. I&#39;m definitely grabbing that book.</p>

<p>It says that the Echo II was flying over the vicinity at that time. However, the fact that celestial bodies and antartica are mentioned so casually implies a familiarity with the subject and inquiry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s too late to join this party, but I found it typing &quot;ark of Gabriel Mecca&quot; into search. I was browsing through Q anon threads, getting more and more exasperated that I couldn&#39;t find any mention of the whole Jerusalem is the capital of Israel thing, (Q calling out the Rothschilds, but not Zionists and Israel just seems like a huge plothole to me and I can&#39;t fathom why so many who are apparently anti-globalist don&#39;t raise an eyebrow at their god emperor Trump&#39;s ties/coziness with Israel) when an anons post caught my eye, about Antarctica.</p>

<p>The post mentioned something about someone who claimed to be a kid of an elite, and had all these wild stories about what&#39;s been going on in Antarctica. I managed to find a screencap of the actual post on 4chan. Boy did this lead me down a much deeper rabbit hole than I was expecting! I&#39;ll post a link to the screencap... But after reading it myself, a bunch of movies and books came to mind, and the parallels just seemed to be too coinkidinky not to be slightly perturbing! </p>

<p>First thing that came to mind of course was the Nazi New Swabia, and the account of Admiral Bryd. Next I was reminded of the first X-FILES movie, Mulder goes to find Scully, in Antarctica, underground. Of course in this case, it was a huge UFO underground. Also noteworthy, the black goo virus, and then the separate end-of-world viral outbreak in the last TV series. Also reminded me of that terrible Dan Brown novel about the population control virus - Inferno?</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s &quot;The Thing&quot;, about an ancient alien disturbed by scientists in Antarctica. Googling &quot;The Thing&quot; to refresh details in my mind, I realized it was a part of a series - Apocalypse Trilogy. Funnily enough, &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; is about a strange vial of liquid that unleashes the anti-christ, and &quot;In the Mouth of Madness&quot; a guy writes a book that drives anyone that reads it mad and and frees an ancient race of monstrous beings which reclaim the earth. This of course was inspired by H P Lovecraft&#39;s At the Mountains of Madness! Then I remembered that in Watchmen, Veidt, the blond haired blue eyed German obsessed with everything Egyptian, his lair is in Antarctica. He unleashes a Chthulu type creature to unite humanity against a common enemy, and avoid nuclear war with Russia. Which reminded me of the myth of Kronos and the Titans. Thor and the Frost Giants. The White Walkers in Game of Thrones, and the cave paintings Jon Snow and Daenerys find (inspired by the alleged inscriptions/symbols in the Antarctica labyrinth?!)</p>

<p>Then I recalled the movie Cabin in the Woods (elites sacrificing people to appease sleeping ancient monstrous gods underground), which reminded me of the rumors about golf and human sacrifice and it&#39;s origins in the Mayans practice of sacrificing people to appease their gods of the underworld. And was it the Anasazi who claimed the gods saved them from a major extinction event by taking them underground? </p>

<p>Which all brought me right back to the Q anon posts because what do the followers keep calling their so-called movement? The Great Awakening! Hmm, who or what is really awakening?! Sort of like that writer in the Mouth of Madness using the collective consciousness to bring about the awakening of the ancient race of monsters to bring about the apocalypse... </p>

<p>Also reminds me of the creepy ass sculpture in the Vatican of the so-called &quot;Resurrection&quot; which &quot;depicts Jesus rising from a nuclear crater in the Garden of Gethsemane&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily. Antarctica could very likely had a warm climate before the last pole shift which some have theorised was ~26,000 years ago (roughly), which is well within the time span for modern homo sapiens (who&#39;ve been dated back to emerging at least 200,000 years ago). It&#39;s possible that advanced human civilisations have come and gone in that time, and that over the last glacial period, topped off with the cataclysmic younger dryas period from ~12,900-11,200 years ago, much of the man-made architectural and technological progress and advancements were naturally destroyed, along with a good portion of the human population (namely other human species with whom we&#39;d previously coexisted on earth with) leaving only homo sapiens alive and little of the old civilizations, save for particular megalithic structures around the world. </p>
