       Thanks OP, very useful list!
      </p>
      <p>
       Truecrypt is also great for encrypted archives/partitions, even if the core project has been discontinued. It was forked and of course remains open source. Find it on truecrypt.ch
      </p>
      <p>
       It is great as it has a “gun-to-your-head” secondary password feature - i.e. it is possible to set a secondary password, that will indeed decrypt a second repository (where you’ll have put unimportant files), while making it formally impossible for anyone to tell whether an archive has 1 or 2 passwords.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus if some LE (or other organized crime syndicate) threatens you into giving up your password, you can do so at no risk, while maintaining full plausible deniability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Addendum: OP is right to recommend protonmail, as in addition to being in Switzerland (where the State is typically less powerful), it relies on
       <em>
        zero-knowledge encryption
       </em>
       - i.e. the decryption happens on the client (your browser), so even if the server is seized, or an admin is corrupt, they cannot read your email (provided the implementation is sound and nobody hacked your endpoint).
      </p>
      <p>
       Addendum 2: missing from the list is
       <a href="https://tails.boum.org">
        tails
       </a>
       , although it does more than encrypt your files/communications. Look into it.

       "gun-to-your-head" is known as "Rubberhose Encryption."
      </p>
      <p>
       TrueCrypt implemented it and the government said it was one of the larger challenges it faced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the last version ever of TrueCrypt came out. It stripped itself of the ability to encrypt anything and could only decrypt thing. The anonymous author of one of this program instead suggested people use Windows BitLocker (known to be compromised by the people who made it, Microsoft.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Shortly there after, variants of TrueCrypt came out, one is the VeraCrypt that OP mentions. They claim to have tested things and mathematically proven it's still great.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now TrueCrupt was once great, but if you can't read behind the lines of what happened there, you don't belong on
       <a href="/r/consiracy">
        /r/consiracy
       </a>
       and if you use it or any of it's descendants, you shouldn't value the secrets you just gave up.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was good once, but it went down.

       Clearly when the founders discontinued the project by saying "Use Microsoft or Apple encryption" it was tongue-in-cheek, a way of saying "we've received a natural security letter and gag order, we can't tell you anything". I think that is a pretty consensual/unanimous interpretation, and there was precedent (Lavabit among others).
      </p>
      <p>
       The real last version is 7.1b of the original core project. It is still available. It is extremely sound. More so given the violence the founders endured. The code is still open source, and is regularly audited. We have yet to observe its security being archived.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if they can crack it (say they compromised it, or have a quantum computer, or whatever), unless you're Snowden
       <sup>
        1000,
       </sup>
       they're very unlikely to use whatever they found against you in court, as that would mean admitting to their ability, and would thus render it void as people would stop using it.

       Then you should not be doing anything that relies on something being logless or leakless. Just realize that even if you were at the top of the game with cyber shit, there is still a risk being taken. You're at the bottom of the game, and using any of these paints a target on your back. Maybe you're too small and they won't take you out out of fear of revealing their methods.

       There are 7 billion people in the world, and they probably have most of them in a database. There are a lot fewer people attempting to obfuscate and encrypt their internet traffic, and they are aware of all of them. You might be "John Doe #743423," but it's all being saved and you're making them ask "Why is he encrypting?"

       Ignore this guy. He's using fear to intimidate/dissuade you and others. There are tens of millions of people who use encryption worldwide. You have plausible deniability as there are very mundane reasons to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Install tails on a usb key, and rely thus on tor. There are firewall (iptables) rules meant for you to avoid mistakes. Just don't do anything online that is tied to your real identity (e.g. log into gmail or facebook ;) ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Forget about VPNs if you really want to stay anonymous. Realize that even if a VPN provider doesn't log your IP ("logless"), his own ISP (and every peer along the way) does. Also if the client prevents packets from leaking outside of the VPN ("leakless"), your OS/endpoint may still be compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember your ISP knows to which VPN provider you connect, and can thus guess what IP (range) you'll end-up having for the outside world. Not so with tor. Using a VPN provider merely means using a second ISP.
      </p>
      <p>
       The weakness of tor is when you're up against a truly global adversary. That is a pretty remote risk if you aren't doing something a superpower would consider an existential threat. But even then, there are ways to mitigate that risk.

       I'm not trying to stop people from using encryption. I'm trying to tell people that using encryption without proper knowledge is more dangerous than not using encryption. Intelligence agencies find it's easier to circumvent encryption than to break it (meaning you fucked up and/or they had a side-channel attack.) Encrypted traffic is infinitely more interesting to intelligence agencies than non-encrypted traffic. By using encryption, you've put more eyes on yourself. You need to be sure that you're skilled enough to take those eyes and more off yourself, otherwise what was the point?

       I understand what you mean. Regardless, if I have nothing to hide, then I'm not so much worried about that. I would like to learn more though if you have any recommended reading on it? Only reason I use it is because I prefer to not have a "profile" so I can be marketed to. I know how marketing works and the more info they have on you, the more they can trick you into buying something you don't need.

       For me the two best people writing about and/or creating security technology are Bruce Schneier and Moxie Marlinspike. Check out their sites and what they're doing, and expand based on who they trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Schneier is more of an academic while Marlinspike is a dredlock'd anarchist hacker (and funny to boot).

       Or, if you use Linux (and seriously, if you're uber paranoid about security, you should not be using a non air-gapped Windows machine to view sensitive  data) you could use LUKS which is baked in to most if not all distributions and has not been cracked (as far as anyone outside of the NSA knows, anyway, like all encryption software).  Supports full disk and partition encryption.  For file encryption, there's "gpg" which is a free and open source clone of "pgp"

       I recommend people download any encryption tool they find online from any site that has them. Encryption is not difficult to use correctly, nor is it one of the most active targets for multiple nation states.

       At least one of the things that this poster recommended will leave you totally fucked. If you don't know if my statement is true, the poster's statement is true, or how to evaluate which would be true then which ones will you trust?

       Intelligence agencies make back doored security software.
      </p>
      <p>
       Intelligence agencies have found it's easier to circumvent encryption than to break it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speak of FBI, here's an example: BitCoin case. The FBI agent who staged the fake murders, stole bitcoins, got arrested, and is now in prison fucked up. How? He use GPG wrong and it leaked his name.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was an FBI guy trained to do this, trying to be shady and he fucked up. Just downloading a random program and thinking you're safe is more dangerous than just being safe. If you need these programs, do your research.

       "gun-to-your-head" is known as "Rubberhose Encryption."
      </p>
      <p>
       TrueCrypt implemented it and the government said it was one of the larger challenges it faced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the last version ever of TrueCrypt came out. It stripped itself of the ability to encrypt anything and could only decrypt thing. The anonymous author of one of this program instead suggested people use Windows BitLocker (known to be compromised by the people who made it, Microsoft.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Shortly there after, variants of TrueCrypt came out, one is the VeraCrypt that OP mentions. They claim to have tested things and mathematically proven it's still great.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now TrueCrupt was once great, but if you can't read behind the lines of what happened there, you don't belong on

       and if you use it or any of it's descendants, you shouldn't value the secrets you just gave up.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was good once, but it went down.
