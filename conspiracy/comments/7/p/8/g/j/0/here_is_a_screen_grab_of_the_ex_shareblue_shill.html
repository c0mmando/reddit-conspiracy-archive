       Let's not overlook a detail that art is used for money laundering. We should start digging especially if this scares the shit out of them. We could find some really good shit. Maybe drug/human/weapon trafficking connections

       Every time I hear about art being bought, its by someone anonymous. But that's a very very good question. Great post by the way. I'll certainly be digging into this

       Read the comments on this and other message boards regarding this anonymous source we should all believe. No one has provided me with any proof that anything this guy or as I believe, guys, say that can be confirmed. I ask for it and they tell me to find it. That’s not how it works. When people make a grandiose claim, they should be the ones to prove it. I shouldn’t have to disprove it.

       But are you advocating for people not to consider this as legit?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a slam dunk for you right?  Bullshit?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so, are you telling others to also consider it that way?  Is that the purpose here in conspiracy?  To tell others what to think?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is subjective.  You can think what you like, others can do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could tackle this issue if you saw a post claiming this was real/confirmed. That's where you should be.  Instead, you "know" this is bullshit and are telling others to consider it as such as well.  Later on down the road, we may find out it IS legit!
      </p>

       How you keep commenting as if you know for a fact this is bullshit.......is pretty funny.

       I think Q is mossad and communicates directly with Trump, and this is all just a major intelligence operation to convince the only group of people that would normally freak out about martial law, that martial law is a great idea. But that is my pet theory. So, I don't share everyone else's enthusiasm for Q. But I'm not going to begrudge my fellows around here their hope and excitement. I think Q has really created a fascinating subculture in the CT community. And he doesn't really leak stuff, or make a bunch of claims, he just mostly asks questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       That leads me to the other thing i don't get. The contrarians just want to yell LARP at everything, deriding Q for not being "right" with their moronic Iamverysmart comments. This displays complete ignorance of what Q has actually been doing.

       What leads you to believe that Q is mossad? Again, I’ll ask for some examples, but It honestly seems plausible which brings up my main beef: people who haven’t accepted the government for years are acting like it’s their friend because their team one. I for one never voted for obama or a democrat. Always third party and once for a republican. Never again ok that red shit.

       There are no examples, and that is what makes me think this, let me explain. Regardless of how anyone feels about Israel, their power in the geopolitical arena is indisputable. Whether you think they are the good guys or the bad guys doesn't matter, I think everyone can agree, in a situation like this, that Israel is
       <em>
        involved
       </em>
       , right? So it would stand to reason Israel, or some of the other zionist groups, would be a part of any conversations related to a deep state war, or a shakeup in the middle east.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we don't see that. Q has not mentioned anything related to Israeli influenced organizations
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       . Zip. I consider this impossible.

       You should do that. You wouldn’t want to force people to think a certain way. And cut the Share blue shit, it’s unbecoming to accuse everyone who doesn’t agree with you of being a shill.

       its not because i disagree with you, its that you act like they dont exist. the hypocrisy in saying its unbecoming when that is exactly what you are doing is pretty hilarious.
      </p>
      <p>
       you disagree with the Q stuff so you throw around shill or larp accusations to try and keep people from looking at the info which is exactly what shareblue does.

       if you dont want to be accused of being one of them, dont use their tactics.

       The way reporting works is that you have to verify sources before believing them. For some reason, that has been thrown out the door lately around here with Q and any other thing we have a bias toward.

       If this has to do with the Bible conspiracy guy yesterday, I was trying to use the socratic method to get him to actually see the answers he should be seeing. He wasn't going to play the game though and just thought I should believe him because he knows so much more than me when I doubt he does on that subject.

       Ah, I didn't equate "troll" with "low effort" or "irrelevant questions." I guess you did. Anyway, I just don't like "Q". If that makes us virtual enemies, then I guess that is what it is. But I'm not going to change my view on "Q" because you are trying to bully me too. And I think I add to the conversations around here in not just some trolly way. Except when it comes to "Q" because I think he is trolling us.

       It's six years of karma. It probably isn't all that high. But anyway, you can tag me as the great karma whore shill. I am not, I assure you. But like an AI with evil motives would also tell you that they are well intentioned, I don't know how/why you should trust me. But I bet if you were really felt motivated, you could go through my comments and see that I have a consistent worldview for nearly the whole time I've been on Reddit. Heck, I'm middle aged and don't change my mind on things as much as I once did. I'm ashamed of that though. Not being middle aged - the stubborn part. Maybe we could even be virtual friends rather than virtual enemies.

       Never said you were a shill. You can believe that if you need to.

       In this thread, I was accused of that. But if you look back, it all started because I just stated that some guy on 4chan who may be larping can't be considered reliable. I stand by that.

       If the NYT gets caught fabricating anonymous sources there will be a huge outcry. Trump, Fox, and talk radio will rail on the subject for months. It will hugely damage the reputation of the organization and the reporter fabricating sources will get fired.

      <p>
       That logic is too circular.  How would they know the sources were fake if the sources are anonymous?  NYT is an established pub, they have carte blanche, and the moral majority in press and people in numbers are actually lib.  Did you forget HRC actually won the pop vote?  NYT has been running pro SJW agenda items for the past two years.  They have no credibility with moderates just as 4 chan may not.  Print media is obsolete and they are slicker than you give them credit for.  It's print propaganda that shovels the rhetorical coal in the furnace of our political fire.  NYT reaches employed bleeding heart liberals.

       There is no onus of proof needed on a conspiracy forum, only evidence of theory.

       No, these types of posts are (see how that works). The president has created a fervor where people scream fake news instead of engaging in constructive discourse. They will believe in anonymous sources because they confirm their bias, but refuse to when a journalist does. And I get that. I just think it’s hypocritical

       I have no bias. I feel it’s my duty to wake up people who think that trump is some kind of savior and democrats are worse than republicans. But that’s impossible since the president has pushed propaganda into over drive.

       Trump really did brag about how his celebrity allows him to "grab em by the pussy". That's literally what he was saying. He was exclaiming about how he can do things others cannot just because he's famous.
