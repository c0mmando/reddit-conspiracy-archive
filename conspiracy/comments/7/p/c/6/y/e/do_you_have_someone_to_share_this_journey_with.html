       We are 560k people here but in my personal life I don't know anybody that wants to find the truth.
I don't have anyone to discuss with and I'm telling you it is so hard not to lose yourself and become a zombie. 
Because at the end of the day most of what we talk about are just theories meaning that most of us have not experienced things first hand so for the brain,sometimes, it is too much to get attached to these theories and see it all as a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand most people and I can see what they go through.
You have to be very strong to pursue this way of living life, risking to be left alone.
Cause it's not just about saying I am for the truth,it is about going against the grain even when the odds are against you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to thank all of you for making this forum possible I read all that you guys right here and it makes me feel less alone.
I hope you never lose faith and always remember that God is in our side. 
That is the only reason we all need to keep going.

       How's it going with you? You seem a bit early in your coping stages.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me tell you that people who are well seasoned in the realm of conspiracy have some thick skin, which can make it hard to discern out in the public eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of us have (commonly through trial and error) determined that we can't exactly live our lives soap-boxing from the street corners, so we know how to blend in and play along.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also not good for the soul to feel doom-and-gloom, in your public life I'd say to go with the flow and act like everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extend what I call an "olive branch" to someone you think might be in tune with what's
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       going on and see how they respond.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't have to be anything prolific like "Israel did 9/11", something basic like the dems and reps being two sides of the same coin can open conversation in people you'd least expect.

       I'm 22 now and it's been since I was 18 that I feel this way.
For the most part I do blend in with the rest and act accordingly but sometimes it gets to my nerves when I hear people discuss so passionately about things that make no sense. It's like they push the propaganda even further and even though I resist the temptation to argue it takes my energy away and I just want to go home or somewhere quiet. 
Thanks for the tip on how to start this kind of conversation I really wish I had a like minded friend.

       Is this really true? Whenever I ask for evidence on this sub, I tend to get downvoted and attacked.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, recently I asked somebody for evidence that tap water is too poisonous to drink, and got attacked for asking for evidence. That was all I did: ask for evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there are the 'taboo topics', which people will attack you for raising. See

       It's difficult to learn that your government, the people we supposedly put in charge, are deceiving us on a massive scale.  It makes you question everything.  All that you've been told.

       Just as it was difficult for many of us to learn that our parents had deceived us. Not just about Santa, but about so many things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, most of us move on, we get over it. Some of us even understand that the deception may have been for our own good. No, sipping some of daddy's beer would not really kill us, but maybe by telling us these stories, our parents were trying to help us, until we could think for ourselves.

       Yeah, it did for me. But I don't think most people on this sub REALLY want to question all that they have been told. Take
       <a href="https://www.johnlebon.com/articles/37-things-normies-believe/">
        this list

       for example, and tell me how many of the 37 items listed are things that you are truly prepared to challenge.

       My husband is partially awake. Before that, I went through what you are going through. Hang in there!
      </p>
      <p>
       I found that by "playing dumb" a little bit helps with people. Example, I act troubled and confused and ask a person for their opinion. I tell them that I've been thinking about Building 7 on September 11th. I ask them to help me understand what happened. Asking them to look at the evidence with me and tell me their thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found if I do it that way, then they are more open to really looking at it. (or whatever subject/conspiracy I present to them).

       I find that I have to pick the topics carefully with my husband. An have the right timing. Usually I go head first into stuff once I hear him complain about something an I use that to say " Well did you know......". An for the most part as Iong as I don't go to far he stays with the convo an doesn't call me crazy( lovingly of course) we have been together a long time so he is use to having a conspiracy nut for a wife. But then there are days when I just can't get thru to him at all. I mean there is no changing his mind. SO I TRICK HIM!!! Not really but I do say things like hey let's watch xfiles, or dollhouse, or ect..... Any of the shows I know he likes to get him thinking about things...

       Glad to know I'm not alone. My husband is the same way. He is partially awake, but doesn't seem to want to go the extra distance with it. When I ask him about it, he says, "Sometimes I would rather not know. It makes me feel helpless."

       I know what you mean dude... I have been trying to link up with people in my area or just discuss this stuff with someone else but can't really find groups and all my friends don't seem to care. They just seem caught up in the daily routine and oblivious to everything. I got a friend who I have spent (wasted) hours of my life listening to him bitch about his divorce, but when I try to bring up any of the weird shit going on (gov't, geo space, Q, art, ect.),  he just brushes it off as conspiracy or "everybody knows that, plus it doesn't effect me anyways"... and then calls me crazy lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       That pissed me off, I'm not usually into conspiracies... I don't think I've ever said the word "chemtrails" before last year. I don't think he even bothered to spend more then a min watching the video links I sent him. Seems like people just wanna tune out, or have heard this type of stuff so much that they are numb to it. Corruption, symbols, and sex rings might not sound like something new or different until you read the details and see the proof, and who is involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone know of a good summary video that is like around 10 min? Need something that will go over the major points and people involved, with few gory details and solid proof to make it easy for people to take serious and look into shit more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also... how to meet people? I've tried that meetup app but no groups specifically for this stuff. I have gone to meditation or gamer events hoping there would be like minded people but no luck. I've tried craigslist a bit but nothing stands out, seems like its mostly jobs or hookups on there. Is there an organization or group that does stuff all over the nation? Or a site like "meetup" that is better, or mebbe forum/chat groups or something?

       I'm pretty sure my GF is a government plant. She shoots down everything i bring up, no matter how much evidence supports a theory she just does not want to know or worse says "who gives a fuck, it's not like it affects anybody"

       Talking to friends about a conspiracy is usually met with groans and sighs, i gave up on those guys, one of them does get into some stuff but he's only scratching the surface.
My spouse listens and agrees to most my rants, she's good at asking the right questions as any bystander would, it makes me get additional clarity on some subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have thought about this issue. I'm pretty deep in the hole of truth, i know there isn't anyone within my circle that would even sit and listen, much less have any open discussion on certain subjects. You tend to understand eventually that you are holding a candle within a great darkness, it's nearly impossible to spot anothers light unless it's via forums such as this.

       the reason i jumped into the rabbit hole is because of weed. we were conditioned starting a young age to believe it would ruin our lives. When i 1st tried it and realized that it was really very far from reality. tried to uncover why it was illegal in the 1st place. I was and wasn't disappointed, it made me realize that if the can literally decide from one day to another that a plant is illegal, imagine what they can do when there is money to make off of it. i also realized that people just say what they are told, because ''everybody'' knows weed is the least damaging natural drug but they will still say shit like ''don't you worry about your bran cells?!?'' etc. They know that it's almost 100% safe to consume, but they still believe shit they learned in primary school in 1974.
