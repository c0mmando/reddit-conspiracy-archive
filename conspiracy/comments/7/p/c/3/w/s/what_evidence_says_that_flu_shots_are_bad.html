       When your best bet is to flip a coin, I prefer betting on your natural immune system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you have reason to believe your immune system is compromised (i.e. those actually
       <em>
        at risk
       </em>
       of dying from influenza), it seems the better choice to not to inject an untested cocktail of heavy metals and virus proteins into your bloodstream.

       Thanks for the link. So average effective rate is about say 40%. That means that out of 20 people, say normally 10 of them would get the flu without shots, then with shots , only 6 of them would get the flu, so it still helps 4 people. So there does seem to be some benefit out of it. Basically you reduce your chances of getting the flu by about 40%.

       That is an easy answer for me. A little research will help you with your answer - the only way you will make the right decision for your son is doing your research and go with your heart based on what you learned. There is no right answer but there is a clear risk/reward.

       The hypothesis behind vaccination of any kind has never been proven to be true. There's no evidence showing that injecting damaged/dead virus or bacteria directly into the bloodstream produces any level of immunity to the wild version. Vaccines produce an immune response because of the foreign material introduced. They've become a very handy weapon to keep a population sick, wounded or dead.

       No you're wrong wrong wrong! The charming people on the television told me that a cocktail of formaldehyde, heavy metals, virus particles, diseased monkey kidneys and the occasional human fetus tissue injected directly into my bloodstream is a health tonic, just like wheat grass. They also told me people that don't believe in taking them should be executed on the spot because they are science hating, fart sniffing, Satan worshipping mass murderers. You should really get back in line with the rest of the herd because our leaders really love us and only want to see you happy and healthy. /S

       Personally, I don’t get the flu shot anymore. One time I got sick after receiving it. Also it’s only ~10-20% effective because there are many strains of the flu. I believe the science of it though.

       I really hope this isn’t the logic you go by haha. I should start off by saying vaccines, in the purest sense, do work. I don’t know how old you are and don’t care to know, but the time period you received vaccinations (including flu shots) is an important factor. Because you got vaccines when you were a kid and a flu shot every year is flawed logic at best. Yes, there are people who believe the sole cause of autism is due to vaccines and/or the adjuvants contained within. However, there are far more factors at play making it much harder to say vaccines are safe. Factors include the vaccine itself, the particular adjuvants administered in a single ‘session’ and/or overtime, the time of life at which the vaccines entered the body, diet-related factors etc.. Unfortunately, it is not as easy as saying parts of the vaccinated population (or in your case, a sample size of 1) don’t have autism, therefore they aren’t bad. Bottom line, no reasonable person (or scientist/doctor) can conclude vaccines do not contribute to autism. In fact, if you believe in science, you would only be led to conclude the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a reason why you should reconsider your position. Hep B is generally administered immediately after birth regardless of circumstance/test results - consider you and your partner have been throughly screened for Hep B, haven’t used dirty needles and aren’t sleeping with the entire town - there is no medically necessary reason to administer the vaccine so soon in life. Yes, there are higher risk demographics but families are entitled to informed consent but unfortunately, “informed” often is not a factor in the decision. This should make anyone at least think about this issue deeply.

       I should reconsider because I got vaccinated against something that I could possibly get in the future and didn’t give consent?
      </p>
      <p>
       It in no way harmed me. And now I can freely go about not worrying.

       Because a single doctor says a vaccine causes harm that wasn’t previously know does not make that one doctor a genius. Sometimes adverse reactions happens other times it’s an issue the patient already has but hasn’t shown and then is linked to them getting a vaccine.

       You can’t unchange what’s already done but this is quite a myopic perspective. Because a single doctor says a vaccine is safe bc he wasn’t aware of the potential consequences doesn’t make that one doctor a genius. See, I can do that too but it’s not productive. My point is not suggesting vaccines aren’t important, it’s the fact that well educated medical professionals and scientists ignore blatant evidence of risks that often aren’t conveyed to the patient, data is manipulated (money is a great motive) and generally refuse to accept that the CDC guidelines are significantly flawed. Yes, underlying circumstances could be to blame - another variable for deeply considering the variables at play beyond the vaccine itself. The governing bodies aren’t even consistent and often contradict one another. Do you know anyone who has gotten a tetanus shot recently? I bet you don’t because it is hardly ever administered on its own any longer in the US. In fact, I don’t think it’s even an option anymore. Most doctors will not disclose this - try it. It’s an easy way to see if have a gem of a doctor or not.

       You are supposed to get boosters. Better hop to it. Go get your new round.
      </p>

       By the way, there is a lot of evidence that flu shots cause miscarriage, so quit with running around acting informed about things you know nothing about. No one was even talking about autism.

       The article that is linked from the university of Minnesota says that the previous study on this did not point to more miscarriages and further study is needed. They also recommend that you still get your seasonal flu shot. It’s not a definitive answer and mostly points to it not being an issue.

       They never gave them out when I was a kid, I came down with the mumps-chicken pox-german measles, but still had my fair share of shots growing up. In the late 60's got my smallpox scratch several times, it never took, that was my mothers lunatic moment!
