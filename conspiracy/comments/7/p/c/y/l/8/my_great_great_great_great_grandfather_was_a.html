        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Wouldn’t post to r/history for some reason. Figure you guys might appreciate a cool story though.</p>

<p>His name was Wiley </p>

<p>He was 18 years old and had just joined the 1st South Carolina in 1863. His parents forced him to join because they were so dirt poor. They were Irish immigrants. He fought at Gettysburg after receiving little to no training and was captured by a Union unit on July 2nd.</p>

<p>According to his story, in the wee hours of the night, on July 3rd some Confederate soldiers were being executed. A single Union officer who pitied him came into the makeshift prison they had built, and to avoid killing such a young man, secretly released my ancestor. He took him out to a field, claiming he was going to kill and then bury him, but then suddenly cut him loose.</p>

<p>My great x4 grandfather was shocked. He hesitated. But when the officer insisted, he ran.</p>

<p>He swam across the Potomac River to safety and fled to Tennessee, revoking his service. He became a farmer. His son moved to Texas, where my family has lived ever since.</p>

<p>It’s crazy how one man’s kindness allowed 6-7 future generations to be born and thrive.</p>

<p>We hold a lot of power.</p>

<p>Side note: I’ve heard a lot of stories about the carnage at Gettysburg. If anyone has any reporting about the shadowy things that went down there, I’d love your opinions/information. I’m about to start a project on the Civil War with my class in February. I’d like to hint to them that the Civil War was much more interesting (for conspiracy reasons) than they think.</p>

<p>He has a lot more to say on the subject because I&#39;ve stared at these photos and they don&#39;t add up. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read other places where they speculate that the civil war was just a clean up team to restore order or whatever. And the reenactment the year later was put forth as the real deal. So yea probably a lot more people died than we are told. Specifically look at some of the images of burned stone buildings huge Tennessee marble buildings obliterated by fires? Just side by side them with a real burned out street and it begs a lot of questions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suggest with this sub r/culturallayer that something huge happened around 1800ish and it was like a restart button. Before then any large city in east Asia was indistinguishable from any large city in brazil r/historicalstreetview . We&#39;re told at this time Violently opposed nations around the globe all utilized one single fort design. Known to us as a star fort? It might be just that the event or events killed a shit ton of people and the so called napoleonic wars were a means of laundering some of the dead. Perhaps the global civilization described by some made up guy named Plato wasn&#39;t so long ago. Som bad happened and history&#39;s just been a shoddy hodgepodge of lies ever since? Maybe maybe not but it&#39;s worth pulling the string without going all in, you may find a nugget of truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The American Civil War was different in that the Republic actually managed to somehow bandage itself back together afterwards, although in a completely different form than before the war. I think the real legacy of the Civil War was Reconstruction, which saw thousands die in a basically undeclared guerrilla war raged throughout the South until 1876, and then ushered in Jim Crow which would eventually necessitate the Civil Rights movement and set up modern race relations in the US. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever fully healed the scars of that conflict, and it honestly amazes me that the US has only had one Civil War in its 240 year history.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the story, and it truly is interesting how the universe works, in such mysterious ways :) ! It&#39;s beautiful, and tragic, at the same time. </p>

<p>That said, the Civil War is by far the most propagandized and rewritten event in US history, second only to the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>It was a completely illegal war and only served to benefit the bankers and old world Royalty (via the continuation of the Virginia Company - District of Columbia). Lincoln was an absolute tyrant, and shat on the Constitution, not that that even matters, because that whole thing is complete bullshit in the first place (look into Lysander Spooner), hence what I said above about the Revolutionary War. </p>

<p>The truth is coming out about this stuff, though, and people are waking up (ie. The Great Awakening/Unveiling). Damn near everything we&#39;ve ever been taught was a lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I’m a world history teacher. I’ve always been into ancient history more, because something about American history always <em>stunk</em> to me, even when I was a kid. </p>

<p>It feels like propaganda. Maybe all history is propaganda, but <em>I know for sure</em> our history is. </p>

<p>As I got older, and was able to look at all sides, I realized how interesting our history is. It’s like a conspiracy, on top of a conspiracy, on top of a shadow war, on top of a conspiracy lol </p>

<p>Shit. You&#39;re already on that subject of your required curriculum two quarters into the school year?

    <div class="md"><p>Correct. </p>

<p>I’m not sure if you’ve ever been to a small, conservative town in Texas, to a small conservative school, but they don’t give a shit about regulations. If it was up to me, we’d spend a full six weeks on Rome and a full six weeks on Greece, but I have the whole school/town breathing down my neck “when are you gonna get to American history, when are you gonna get to American history?”</p>

<p>Also, as I said, we probably won’t touch this subject till February. We’re stuck in the Renaissance. </p>

<p>Also, that’s kind of rude what you’re saying about black magick. If you know that, than you’ve read through my posts, knowing that it’s a sensitive subject for me, something I’m ashamed of, and something I no longer practice. </p>

<p>So, thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look you want the truth? You think I’m an imposter? Here’s the truth. I moved to a small town, because it’s my second year teaching and they offered me way more money out here then teaching in the ghetto neighborhood in the city. I have no friends here. It’s old ladies and teenagers. On my lunch breaks (which are quite long) I like to talk to my friends; Snapchat them, and post on reddit. It’s a sad life lol, but it has its perks. </p>

<p>And I don’t communicate with demons anymore, so that is a welcome change. </p>

<p>And I think I’m inspiring some kids to cultivate a real love for history, which I think is valuable.</p>

<p>Also (again, if true), its a shame that people have ruined something as cool as a world history class with their “but muh patriotism!” mindset.</p>

<p>I may have been caught in a moment of hero worship, but what I said was definitely accurate, the parts that weren’t opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I frequently quarrel with PLC (if you wanna call it that, it usually ends with him posting memes and derailing conversation), and I&#39;ve torn him to shreds before. I appreciate your need to end disagreements. I have a need as well, in that I need to defend myself when I feel I&#39;m wronged. In this case, I don&#39;t like his shit talk about me. He accuses me of being a shill and having many alts (he says he knows my alts! Spooky! But he won&#39;t out them even when I beg). Here is a comment in which I detail his dark history here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/72oxqs/shills_here_suck_a_big_fat_fucking_cock/dnk7idn/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/72oxqs/shills_here_suck_a_big_fat_fucking_cock/dnk7idn/</a></p>

<p>I keep receipts :)</p>

<p>He typically resorts to the stupid shit talk that he sent you. </p>

<p>Like any true historian should, study the sources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems to me that the amendments to the constitution had very little to do with actual slavery, but more to do with expanding Federal Government&#39;s powers over the states, and making us all &quot;Citizens of the United States™&quot; basically, we ALL became equal government property. </p>

<p>The wording of the Declaration of Independence is &quot;We hold these Truths to be self evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.&quot;</p>

<p>So why does everyone fight for &quot;Constitutional rights&quot; which were &quot;given&quot; to us by the Government,when we should be fighting for  unalienable rights?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that only came into play once the legality of the war came into question. Then it became the moral reason, just like &quot;wars&quot; today. Always a &quot;moral reason&quot;, which is usually a cover up. The Emancipation Proclamation only applied in the South, and years after the war, there were still slaves in the North and Border States. Like I said: &quot;Damn near everything we&#39;ve ever been taught was a lie.&quot;.</p>

<p>The Civil War was not about slavery, it was about not allowing the Southern States to secede (their contractual right), and created a central Federal &quot;Government&quot;, which was and is, a quasi Corporation-Government entity. The US is a Corporation, and the civil war lead to it&#39;s fruition, by design.</p>

<p>The people of Georgia having dissolved their political connection with the Government of the United States of America, present to their confederates and the world the causes which have led to the separation.

    <div class="md"><p>It is true, that the South wanted to keep slavery, and I&#39;m not denying that. The reasons were, they needed it in order to grow <em>for the time being</em>.  I&#39;m not supporting slavery, it&#39;s completely against what I believe in (<em>as it should be for everyone)</em>. </p>

<p>However, it was more about economics, and at that time, slavery and economics were linked (but slavery was on it&#39;s way out to technological advances). The South was far richer than the North, and were making deals with Europe for cash crop exports. The North was threatened by this, and waged economic warfare on them. Not to mention, the Federalist traitors wanted to eliminate the original Compact and create a central Federal Government.</p>

<p>We were never supposed to be &quot;one country - UNITED STATES OF AMERICA&quot;, we were always supposed to be a Confederacy of Sovereign States, in a union with one another, and that was supposed to be voluntary (ie. right to secede under law of the compact/contract). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very much enjoyed that story.</p>

<p>While you&#39;re doing your research, here&#39;s a thing to think about. The Mason-Dixon line wasn&#39;t (and I dare say still isn&#39;t, but that&#39;s a separate issue) as straight as it looks on a map. Geographically and culturally, the Shenandoah Valley was a unifying feature. The northern reach of that valley is known locally as the Susquehanna Valley. It exists north of the Mason-Dixon line, but support for the South was prevalent. People who lived there but didn&#39;t support the Union were known as &quot;Copperheads.&quot; Union troops, for instance, were charged for food and water as they marched through Carlisle PA on their way to Harrisburg just before the battle of Gettysburg. If you&#39;re looking for Civil War conspiracy angles, this might be of interest. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Confederate-Approach-Harrisburg-Gettysburg-Northernmost/dp/1609498585">The Confederate Approach on Harrisburg</a> describes Copperheads and the days leading up to the battle of Gettysburg.</p>
