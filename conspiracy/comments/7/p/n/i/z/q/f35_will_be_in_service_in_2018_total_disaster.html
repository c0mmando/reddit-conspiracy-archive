       Boy they are really on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you waste huge amounts of money to invest in something and everyone including the MSM is telling you that this thing does not work at all and you STILL attempt to use it anyway, i don't know if it qualifies as insanity or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's basically like the king's clothes all along.
      </p>
      <p>
       All i see is not a pinnacle of technology, but a plane that cannot fly at rain, gets outmaneuvered by very outdated Russian or Chinese fighters, has Fraud Stealth that costs more money than being effective, can only fly for a few hours and cannot dogfight. In other words, the US and many other "Good" countries will be using this as their primary airforce and will be destroyed in world war iii.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soon this aircraft will be put into the test and we will see what kind of disaster it is, This is the biggest millitary fiasco ever and more proof that the US government is filled with traitors that serve anyone but the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm expecting that they will use this to attack some middle eastern country like Iran or a place like the South China Sea and turned out to be the biggest disasters ever known to American History ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will soon see this millitary betrayal in action and i feel sorry for any armymen who has to fly this terrifying flying lemon.

       Of the people making those claims very few have any military aviation experience, with 99% of those people parroting the claims of a handful of individuals. Google "F-35 problem" or something along those lines and I bet that nearly every article will reference either:

       It's not designed to be the best dogfighter (being manoeuvrable is about as relevant to modern air combat as bayonet fighting is to modern infantry combat), but it still turns just fine:

      <p>
       I think it's funny that you're willing to believe that thousands of pilots and the people in charge of 12 allied air forces are wrong, and that Russia and China are copying these US designs for no reason, but that some bloggers that have no experience in these matters are correct.

       It's been described as stealthier than the F-22 and I doubt there's any secret fighters in service (fighters are something you want in sufficiently large quantities, which is counter-productive to keeping projects in the dark; stealth helicopters for special forces, stealthy recon drones, etc are much more compatible with keeping secret.

       The only thing I didn't really like about the f35 program was it gave the air Force this stupid idea to retire the a10. The most bad ass tank destroyer ever designed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also laughable he says it can't dogfight. It's not designed as a dog fighting plane. We have other plans that do that. You don't need to do fight when your pilot an look over his shoulder and lock a missile on a plane behind him and fire it and destroy said plane

       The newest Russian plane has air frame problems. They get literal dents from flying

       The A-10 is still going to be in service for quite some time. It's pretty useful against insurgents, but against a modern military it would be woefully outdated. It's honestly more of a morale shock nowadays against infantry and soviet-era tanks. It wouldn't do shit to a modern tank (which is unfortunate, cuz I love me some brrrrrrrrt).

       Nobody's passed out or became incapacitated in an F-35; you're likely thinking of the F-22 (which had a pilot pass out and crash due to hypoxia, but has since had its oxygen issues fixed several years ago) or possibly the T-45 which had its pilots refuse to fly it last year until an investigation took place.
      </p>
      <p>
       F-35s at one of twelve airbases did cease operations for a day last year, due to an increase in reported physiological events (oxygen issues), but while investigations are still ongoing, many of the reported PEs were either false alarms or due to training error:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        F-35 pilots have reported 27 “physiological episodes” since 2011 – 22 of them in the air and five on the ground – with a recent rash of six incidents at Luke Air Force Base. Painstaking investigations are still underway, looking at the state of the aircraft, pilot, and environmental conditions in every incident, but there seem to be two causes, both solvable.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, the cockpit warning light for the On-Board Oxygen Generation System (OBOGS) goes off too often, making pilots think they had a problem with their air supply when there really wasn’t one, Winter said at the DefenseNews conference here yesterday. Since the warning signs of hypoxia are the same as the signs of getting anxious about hypoxia – you have trouble breathing and concentrating – a false alarm can easily send a pilot into psychosomatic symptoms. The program has tweaked the warning light to reduce false positives, Winter said. It’s also improving filtration and pressure.
       </p>
       <p>
        Second, in this summer’s incidents at Luke in particular, the problem was a combination of brutal temperatures and inexperienced pilots. While pilots who know an aircraft well can jump in the cockpit, run through their checklists, and get in the air ASAP, the F-35 is a new plane and most of its pilots are still mastering it. The result was pilots spending half an hour on the runway in the baking Arizona sun and 100-plus degree heat, all the while sitting in the carbon monoxide from their own jet exhaust. That’s enough to make anyone woozy. Fixing this problem requires new training and procedures rather than modifications to the aircraft.
       </p>

       It's worth noting too that the F/A-18 family (Hornet, Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler) has had serious oxygen / ECS issues over the past couple of years with about 300 PEs between 2010 and 2015 and with Super Hornets and Growlers being grounded around this time last year when a Growler's cockpit overpressurised (because a valve either failed or wasn't de-iced properly) and exploded its canopy, putting both its crew into critical condition.
      </p>
      <p>
       A-10s at an airbase were also grounded late last year after pilots suffered a few PEs in quick succession.

       The F22 was going to have a ground attack role.  They used to call it the F/A-22.  However, Congress nixed that idea specifically so it wouldn't compete against the F35.

       The F-22 does have a ground attack role; they stopped calling it the F/A-22 because it's messy and defies logic when the USAF doesn't call the F-16 the F/A-16 or F-15E the F/A-15E, etc. The notion to try and call it the F/A-22 was born out of attempts to emphasise to Congress, etc that the F-22 wasn't just an air-superiority fighter while politicians were in the process of cutting order quantities.

       The biggest Army in the world is the US Army.  The second biggest Army in the world is the US Navy.  We are so far ahead of every other country its insane.  The flow of money to "US defense" can be cut in half and it would still be more than sufficient.  This will never happen because the ones getting these military contracts are the same people that pull the strings in Washington.

       Imean this as no detriment to the hard-working and dedicated men and women of the american armed forces BUT, i have first hand experience that can tell you that, while you may have the largest armed forces in the world, your tactics and strategies are very very poor.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not your fault, it really isn't. Your country is only a few hundred years old and your theatres for training have been...the end of ww2 where the job was done anyway, vietname where...well, what the fuck could you do in jungle? Nobody was going to win that war. Afghanistan and the middle-east, which has been a set up from the start.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, i've worked first hand with the American armed forces and while you guys/gals can sure be trigger happy as fuck (thanks for the blue on blue) you are very decent people. But your military strategy is unfortunately garbage. You (the guys in charge) seem to just use the Russian WW2 tactic of 'throw enough people at it and you win'

       That was not a war lost due to tactics or military prowess, but to public opinion back home. Conservative estimates have death rates at 2:1 favoring America, more liberal estimates have the rates at 6:1 or 7:1 favoring America.

      <p>
       ~7,000 U.S military personnel have been killed over there, where as estimates put anywhere from 65,000 to 100,000+ insurgents killed. The Taliban and Al Qaeda have been dismantled, ISIS holds ~1-5% of it's initial territory today, etc. Not sure how you can call this one a loss. While I don't agree with the war (especially the Iraqi war), our military did its job well. The issues largely arose due to dumb politics at home.
      </p>
      <p>
       The U.S Military also has unparalleled logistical prowess, which is the most important part of running a Military. Is the U.S military perfect? No. Is it the most powerful fighting force on the planet? I don't see how you could argue otherwise.

       Anyway, for those who do not know, the first, second and i believe third trials of this jet ended in fatalities. The JSF (joint strike fighter) has the ability to 'autoland'. When the 'auto-land' button was pressed, the jet flipped upside down and smashed itself' into the ground.

       P.S. these are rusty details from a few years ago that i may be mis-remembering. If anybody has solid accurate evidence of this please bring it forward. I'm 90% certain of the facts, but this is the internet. Don't believe anybody!

        It was meant to have Boeing parts inside it so we could stand on our own two feet when it comes to parts/servicings. But nope, it still has lockheed shite inside.

         No it wasn't; Boeing and Lockheed competed in a competition for whose design would win the JSF competition (

         Boeing is as American as Lockheed; you're probably thinking of BAE (British Aerospace), which does produce a large chunk of the F-35.

       What you're probably overall thinking of is news that the UK will have to send the engines of its F-35s to Turkey for deep-level maintenance (Turkey will do deep level engine maintenance for all F-35 engines in Europe). The UK however will do the deep level maintenance of all electrical and electronic, fuel, mechanical and hydraulic systems for F-35s in Europe, while Italy handles all deep level airframe (skin and structural) maintenance, as well as system overhauls.

        Anyway, for those who do not know, the first, second and i believe third trials of this jet ended in fatalities. The JSF (joint strike fighter) has the ability to 'autoland'. When the 'auto-land' button was pressed, the jet flipped upside down and smashed itself' into the ground.

       You're 100% misremembering:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         There were no "first, second and third" trials of the F-35, the F-35 has been in continuous testing since 2006 with thousands of tests and trials.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         No F-35 has ever flipped upside down or had issues with an auto-land functionality. Only one F-35 has ever been written off, and that was when an F-35 (being used for training, not for any testing or trials) had an engine blade fail as it was throttling up to take-off from a runway. The plane caught fire, the pilot jumped out of the cockpit because he didn't think an ejection was necessary and in the end half the jet was still fine and used for spare parts.

       The A-10 is still going to be in service for quite some time. It's pretty useful against insurgents, but against a modern military it would be woefully outdated. It's honestly more of a morale shock nowadays against infantry and soviet-era tanks. It wouldn't do shit to a modern tank (which is unfortunate, cuz I love me some brrrrrrrrt).

        Are these the same pliots who have threatened to refused to fly the F-35 because they pass out or become incapacitated during flight?

      <p>
       Nobody's passed out or became incapacitated in an F-35; you're likely thinking of the F-22 (which had a pilot pass out and crash due to hypoxia, but has since had its oxygen issues fixed several years ago) or possibly the T-45 which had its pilots refuse to fly it last year until an investigation took place.
      </p>
      <p>
       F-35s at one of twelve airbases did cease operations for a day last year, due to an increase in reported physiological events (oxygen issues), but while investigations are still ongoing, many of the reported PEs were either false alarms or due to training error:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        F-35 pilots have reported 27 “physiological episodes” since 2011 – 22 of them in the air and five on the ground – with a recent rash of six incidents at Luke Air Force Base. Painstaking investigations are still underway, looking at the state of the aircraft, pilot, and environmental conditions in every incident, but there seem to be two causes, both solvable.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, the cockpit warning light for the On-Board Oxygen Generation System (OBOGS) goes off too often, making pilots think they had a problem with their air supply when there really wasn’t one, Winter said at the DefenseNews conference here yesterday. Since the warning signs of hypoxia are the same as the signs of getting anxious about hypoxia – you have trouble breathing and concentrating – a false alarm can easily send a pilot into psychosomatic symptoms. The program has tweaked the warning light to reduce false positives, Winter said. It’s also improving filtration and pressure.
       </p>
       <p>
        Second, in this summer’s incidents at Luke in particular, the problem was a combination of brutal temperatures and inexperienced pilots. While pilots who know an aircraft well can jump in the cockpit, run through their checklists, and get in the air ASAP, the F-35 is a new plane and most of its pilots are still mastering it. The result was pilots spending half an hour on the runway in the baking Arizona sun and 100-plus degree heat, all the while sitting in the carbon monoxide from their own jet exhaust. That’s enough to make anyone woozy. Fixing this problem requires new training and procedures rather than modifications to the aircraft.

       It's worth noting too that the F/A-18 family (Hornet, Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler) has had serious oxygen / ECS issues over the past couple of years with about 300 PEs between 2010 and 2015 and with Super Hornets and Growlers being grounded around this time last year when a Growler's cockpit overpressurised (because a valve either failed or wasn't de-iced properly) and exploded its canopy, putting both its crew into critical condition.
      </p>
      <p>
       A-10s at an airbase were also grounded late last year after pilots suffered a few PEs in quick succession.
