    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never been a Q believer but I would hold off on saying nothing is happening with Assange yet. Ecuador is now looking for 3rd party arbitration and <em>finally</em> granted Assange a passport and access to the country, which they have refused for years. His final hurdle is actually getting out of the Embassy and out of the UK...which is why Ecuador wants a 3rd part to intervene. </p>

<p>There is definitely something going on with Assange, whether or not it has anything to do with Q. So I wouldn&#39;t use that as an excuse to dismiss Q, even though I am a skeptic myself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did someone confirm he was issued a passport &amp; not just a Ecuadorian ID card, one attribute being it’s required  to obtain a passport?
Regardless of the validity of the Q posts, I’m quite interested to see how the whole JA &amp; WL situation plays out. (Assuming it’s not all theater &amp; he is indeed still in the embassy &amp; wasn’t renditioned using the Guantanamo express reported to have been sited in London last year iirc when [Kerry or Biden?] were also in London at the time as well as JA having a high profile visitor [Pamela?]. )
If I’m mistaken on the details someone feel free to correct me, it’s appreciated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ve always been stale.  The only bits ever validated have all been random details that never amounted to any larger picture.  You might as well be blind random guessing.</p>

<p>Look, anyone with 2 braincells can tell that Q is a LARP.  He doesn&#39;t know shit which is why 80% of his so-called leaks are in the form of questions - he&#39;s inviting gullible audiences to use their imagination to fill in the details that he doesn&#39;t have, to personalize these speculations in a way that will foster a feeling of attachment and community - to make the speculators defend their speculations even more vociferously.  It&#39;s a cheap psychological trick in active participation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course we can. Just try asking someone who believes in him why they do. Inevitably they’ll start listing his “leaks”. Then ask if he’s ever leaked anything early or first or otherwise unknown to the public, and suddenly they’ll claim that’s not what he does. And that is they last question they’ll answer. </p>

<p>I’m starting to believe the Q LARP extends all the way into this sub and that his “Q faithfuls” (because at this point it might as well be a religion) are in on the con.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does that Q picture look like it was taken around noon(on a mostly sunny day)?</p>

<p>The direct route from where trump was starting and going doesn&#39;t go anywhere near where the picture was taken, so people decided it must be the secret AF1 flightpath that went 200 miles out of the way, and they still made good time with that detour. In reality that picture is as much of proof that qanon wasnt on AF1, because it is of the wrong flight path. </p>

<p>And on another note, everything q does is cryptic plausible deniability, but that picture has &quot;af1&quot; in the title? TPTB would be able to find/stop Q a lot faster based on a picture taken inside AF1 than they would from someone predicting an event with any amount of actual clarity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you draw a line from where trump left to where he was going, where the picture was taken was more than 200 miles out of the way(and required a path further east to be taken at that angle), trump made good time on the flight, which makes it less believable they went so far out of the way.</p>

<p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/8szebt2z79s">This is the airports trump was leaving and arriving at</a></p>

<p>He made the trip in 4.5 hours, but the picture taken was to the south east of hong kong (po toi island is in view in the picture) so a very different route, traveling over the south china sea for no reason. And like  I said, does that picture look like it was taken around noon? We have no evidence that was the presidents actual flight path, and the time table doesnt really support it, all we have is a picture someone took while flying past hong kong.</p>
