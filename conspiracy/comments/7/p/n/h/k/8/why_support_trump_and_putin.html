<p>In my perspective, I think that Trump is not a good president. Trump seems to be anti-LGBT and also is okay with companies paying lower tax. He also seems to be not trying to support more freedom on the internet , supporting Net Neutrality and getting the NSA to reduce surveillance. </p>

<p>Putin also seems to have suppot here, but I don&#39;t know why he is supported here other then the fact that Putin wants Russia outside of Rothschild control. In my perspective, Putin is not a good president since he has a lot of power in Russia (like a dictatorship), he isn&#39;t supportive for a progressive society , he seems to not support LGBT and he censors and conducts a lot of surveillance in Russia.</p>

<p>I may have been misinformed or understood it wrongly or perhaps I&#39;m wrong, but I&#39;d like to know now.</p>

<p>Trump seems to be anti-LGBT
no, he&#39;s not. he just doesn&#39;t want the government telling people they have to do shit they don&#39;t want to like baking cakes for gay people. it&#39;s about weakening the role of the government in people&#39;s lives.
and also is okay with companies paying lower tax. 
yes, because our economy isn&#39;t growing as much as it should. the only way to sustainably get higher wages and better benefits for workers is to give companies the ability to pay for those things to keep their workers happy, and that requires a lower tax burden. redistribution doesn&#39;t work. it&#39;s inefficient and the money ends up in the hands of those politically connected to those in power in the government.
He also seems to be not trying to support more freedom on the internet , supporting Net Neutrality
net neutrality isn&#39;t about freedom on the internet. companies that created and manage the telecom infrastructure of the internet did so without having massive regulations put on them, and all of the shit you love about the internet was created in that environment. obama 3 years ago decided to fuck everything up and heavily regulate the internet.
and getting the NSA to reduce surveillance.
obama used the nsa to spy on political enemies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He saved Syria from the US,  Israel and Saudi.    He exposed that the US was using ISIS.    He put a road block in the US illegal wars.   For that alone,   Putin did the world a favor.    It may be the only reason Iran has not been invaded yet.</p>

<p>Putin and Russia are not perfect,   but I am tired of the US acting like they are morally superior or more free.</p>

<p>Sometimes standing up for Putin isn&#39;t so much standing up for Putin but standing up for truth,  and also being anti elite who have hijacked America.    Why stand by and be ruled by and illegal global elite.   The rulers here are not &quot;our&quot; guys,   they are war criminals working for someone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a pro trump lesbian I can confirm he’s absolutely not anti-LGBT. He’s the first republican President to enter office pro LGBT. I’m also an Air Force veteran, and I oppose transgenders in the military as well. It has nothing to do with their sexuality, its for the safety of the other service members. Example, youre transitioning and get deployed and you’re stuck in a foxhole for 90 days with no access to any medication or hormones you need. Our military excels at combat readiness and not being able to have medication you need would interfere with that. Also, hes not a politician. He cant be baught which is why other politicians and the elite hate him, they have no leverage over him. He loves our police and our military which is something they haven’t felt in a very long time. He loves money, and he knows everyone else loves money and he’s tired of the American people being robbed. If you go watch any of his interviews from the 80s/90s/00s, his stance on anything has never changed, unlike politicians who will say anything for a vote. If you ignore the MSM and research anything he’s said in the past 30 years you’ll see that he loves the American people. </p>

<p>As for Putin I’m no expert on him but would it be the worst thing for us to have a good relationship with the other superpower of the world??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t support the former, and the latter is complicated.  In fact a my friend and I have a not-exactly kosher play on Putin that we always use when we talk amongst outselves (you can probably figure it out).</p>

<p>Putin is a mass of contradictions because his role is that of a moderator balancing the various factions and oligarchs threatening to pull that country apart.  He matters only in the sense that he is a stabilizing force that prevents Russia from slipping into the mayhem of the 1990s.  You have to remember this in context how bad Yeltsin was - a man who ordered the military attacked and murder his own government and who let Chechnya and terrorism spiral out of control.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that stable governments are a necessary condition for global stability, and I see a leader who wound down the Chechnya conflict and is now helping to pull Syria back from the brink as a generally positive force in the world, even as I don&#39;t agree with his on-again-off-again exploitation of the situation in the Donbass, Ukraine, ie supporting the rebels only to pull the rug out from under them to gain leverage on the Kiev government.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/world/europe/ukraine-russia-mikhail-tolstykh-dead.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/world/europe/ukraine-russia-mikhail-tolstykh-dead.html</a></p>

<p>As an ally, he&#39;s been a bit flaky, and this is something that&#39;s not well understood in the west, as they want to portray him as a kind of master strategist. He&#39;s constrained by the various factions that he has to balance constantly within his own government, and Russia will never have truly coherent policy.  But what the US can realize is that large countries have their own spheres of influence and regional interests.  They don&#39;t have to be fought and denied at every turn, as that will only exacerbate conflict and make things worse for everyone.</p>
