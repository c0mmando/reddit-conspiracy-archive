        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Made this as a comment on another thread. But with all the shit coming out by the day from Crazy Days &amp; Nights--they called Weinstein, Spacey, Lauer, Gary Goddard, Bryan Singer and many others weeks and months (and even years in some cases) before the news went public--I figured it&#39;s worth a post of its own.</p>

<p>Seeing how Steven Spielberg&#39;s &quot;The Post&quot; got totally shut out at the Golden Globes, it seems possible the fuse is burning closer and closer to the massive cultural bomb that&#39;s going to go off when SS is revealed as a psycho child rapist, all the way back to Drew Barrymore and Heather O&#39;Rourke.</p>

<p>The circumstantial evidence that&#39;s been piling up is persuasive. Here are a bunch of links I suggest you read, and hold on to them to share with your friends and family when the rumors really start to break the surface and we need to push it past the bullshit corporate media that is going to try to blame the Russians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is great OP, thanks. </p>

<p>Slightly off-topic, but I’d like to point 2 things out, about language.</p>

<p>First, the term <em>pedophile</em> is etymologically wrong. These people do not love children. They are child rapists, child molesters, child killers, pedocidal maniacs, etc. Or pedophobes. I do not propose to rehabilitate the word pedophile, as it’s infected forever. Just pointing out that the pedophobes in power invented that word in the 20th century, and that it’s fake, it means the opposite of what it’s supposed to describe (there are so many other examples but I won’t get into that).</p>

<p>Second, <em>child porn</em>. Pictures or videos of children getting raped are not “porn”. They are pictures or videos of children getting raped. Similarly people selling children for sex are not involved in <em>child prostitution</em>; rather, in child slavery and sex trafficking. The children thus sold are not “prostitutes” they are <em>(sex) slaves</em>.</p>

<p>I don’t need anyone to agree with my obtuseness about language; I just think it’s important, and wanted to state it for the record.</p>

He was well dressed and looked pretty afluent (gold watch etc)</p>

Most of these references are extremely vague and do not even mention Spielberg. Considering the timing of his new movie, which is politically controversial, its important to also ask if a smear attempt is being made. </p>

<p>Having said that, I hope it isn&#39;t true. Jimmy SaVILE exuded a creepy filthiness that was obvious on its surface. Mr. Spielberg appears to be a very decent, even good man. Obviously not all perverts are so plainly visible by their appearance. It would break my heart if it were true. </p>

<p>Same with George Lucas. I believe he is a good person (regardless of his artistic decisions). His comments about Marion/Indy do look bad in retrospect. Although that also was left very vague. Did Marion simply have an emotional crush on him? No explicit details were ever given. Spielberg was clearly trying to push the story away from that. Still, it looks bad in retrospect. I get it.</p>

<p>We&#39;re a LONG way from saying Steven Spielberg is &quot;our Jimmy Saville.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The articles written by Adam Parfrey and Crispin Glover are from the 1990s. They are not new. People have been making warning noises about Spielberg for many years. </p>

<p>No one is mentioned by name in the CDN pieces because they don&#39;t want to get sued. If you read the comments, you&#39;ll see even more dots connected. </p>

<p>Many children in movies made and produced by Spielberg. He became the biggest director in Hollywood in the 1980s, the same period when pedophilia was maximized and turned into a business model, it appears.</p>

<p>Many of the children who worked with Spielberg have gone on to troubled lives. Or are dead. </p>

<p>The guy&#39;s still among the most connected and powerful people in Hollywood. All those movies he made are now riddled with victims, rumors, bad mojo. Do you really think he was naive to all that was going on? Wouldn&#39;t he have been powerful enough to do something about it, if he wanted?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not gossip or any kind of Hollywood secret that Spielberg originally wanted Michael Jackson to play Peter Pan, which is about as male kid rape-y as it gets. </p>

<p>Also worth saying that Francis Ford Coppola directed MJ in that horrid &quot;Captain EO&quot; 3D movie. For Disney. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a long way from saying SS &quot;is our Jimmy Savile.&quot; In fact, I&#39;m just about there. Hopefully without the necrophilia. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read all the latest from CDAN. And they 2 seem to be at the top but somehow they seem to never get caught out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One wonders about Jeff Katzenberg, too. If Dreamworks SKG was Spielberg, Katzenberg, Geffen, then....well....he had to at least <em>know</em> what was going on. </p>

<p>And then what about George Clooney and Nicole Kidman, who starred in the first-ever Dreamworks film, &quot;The Peacemaker&quot;? Kidman&#39;s dad was a pedophile, let&#39;s recall, who fled Australia for Singapore while under investigation, only to die mysteriously soon after. </p>

<p>In a cage match, I&#39;d pick Geffen. Geffen seems more ruthlessly cutthroat, but who knows? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;m sure that a few blinds Geffen made people disappear, well just look at Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington, I don&#39;t think Spielberg has went that far (as far as I know).He just seems to manage to keep everyone quite and swept under the rug.</p>
