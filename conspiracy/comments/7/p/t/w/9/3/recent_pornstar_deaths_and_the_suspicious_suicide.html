        recent deaths
       </a>
       of three porn stars almost literally within a month is it not perhaps time to take a quick glance at the death of the most famous of the three? Early reports mention only that she was found dead, then that she died from asphyxiation. Only later do we find out that she was found hanging, wait for it, in a public park. Now women do attempt suicide at a respectable rate compared to men, but the fact that they generally use methods that aren´t immediately lethal leads to them being saved quite frequently. Now men, on the other hand, use more immediately lethal methods like guns and hanging. Women generally use more discreet methods like drugs and leave much less of a mess. And personally I have almost never heard of a woman committing suicide in a public place. Again, Ames was found in a park, the supposed suicide note in her car. First, we have to remember that a very large percentage of pornstars escort. And its a much larger percentage than you think. And guys who could afford Ames, a top pornstar would definitely tend to include very powerful/scary types. Lots of opportunities to see and hear things she shouldn´t have. Now, I know youŕe going to say, hey wait, she was married. Yeah, but she was a porn star too. And the recent widower is a director of porno flicks. So even if she wasn´t that kind of working girl, that lifestyle still puts you into the orbit of the rich and powerful and dangerous. People who could professionally silence a troublesome young lady. Also there is a potential occult angle. But all you hear about from the media was the bullying. The horrible bullying. To a woman accustomed to not only having sex on film, but being the marquee face of pornography, I´m thinking that social media teasing, even from peers, wouldn´t drive her to so much as binge eating, much less such an unusually extreme suicide.  Even the r/conspiracy "community" could only come up with some weak antifa bashing nonsense. Tell me I´m not the only one who thinks this one stinks.

       <strong>
        <em>
         EDIT
        </em>
       </strong>
       It should also be noted that the cause of death for the most recent victim is considered ¨mysterious¨ and the third victim died of an apparent overdose with no witnesses to corroborate this. Nowhere is it printed even the suggestion that these women where acting particularly erratic right before their deaths. And when combined with the tight time-frame of the deaths around the Winter Solstice, one could easily be led to believe that sacrifice is a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, very interesting to see such a spirited and creative defence of the MSM status quo explanation here in r/conspiracy. Interesting times.

       I’ve personally known two women who have hung themselves. One in her garage the other from the railing on the front of her apartment building, it’s not unheard of for women to hang themselves. Suicide by hanging is an act of self-hatred. It’s entirely possible she did it in the park, in public because she lived her life publicly and wanted the public to see what they had done to her.

       Never said it was unheard of, just not as frequent. And all because of social media bullying? I would imagine Ames to have been considerably more thick skinned than that. Porn is a much rougher business than probably you or I are in and I´d bet money she´s walked or limped away from experiences in her life that would leave most normal people catatonic. So again I would say that I have doubts that social media teasing would drive her to this.

       Using your points, yes you are right: she did things normal people wouldn't do.  Is it too far fetched to now also apply that idea to her commiting suicide?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your imagination that Ames was "more thick skinned" because she did open is just that- imagination.  Like doing open made her a stronger person? Higher level of understanding?

       They're proven to be more likely mentally skewed than the rest of us.  Hence why they do porn.

       I don´t think that I´m putting porn stars on a pedestal when I suggest that internet harassment probably wasn´t enough enough to push this young woman to do something so extreme. And I´m also not saying these women are all rock solid emotionally due to the hardships they have endured. In fact I´d probably say that the vast majority of them probably suffer from some form of PTSD. The road that brings one to porn stardom is often quite harrowing and begins quite early. What I am saying though, is that a girl like that probably started experiencing the sharp end of popular opinion at an early age. Not only the constant and often inappropriate attention of males, but also the cutting and often viscous verbal and emotional attacks of females. And we all know that women do psychological torture better. Add to this the fact that she basically grew up in the social media era and I´ll bet you anything that she´s been dealing with vicious trolls since Myspace. Nah, I just don´t think this little batch of LGBT flavoured harassment would have packed enough of a punch to finish her off.

       Absolutely. And according to what I've read, so do a surprising number of models and actresses.

       The same goes for high end model/actress escorts.

       The only difference between Hollywood and the porn industry is that in Hollywood, the fuck scenes are all in real life.

       I believe there is validity in what you stated.  As someone who at one point in my life was on a death spiral of self loathing and burying pain I can tell you hanging - especially in public is the final act of acceptance of your worthlessness.  Thankfully I was able to drag my way out of that hole.

       My only question is how many porn stars die each yr?  I would think that 3 in a very short amount of time is an anomaly.

       Once one person in a circle of people that know one another, or certainly know of one another it makes it a more acceptable option for the others. I’ve known a lot of people who have killed themselves, it usually happens in threes.

       I knew a dude who hung himself in his garage.  I wasn't close friends with him.  He had a wife, a business, and a garage.  He was a good dude but I didn't know him well.  Sometimes people kill themselves.

       Ah but sweatshops are destroying people in other societies, while porn is destroying people in our own. It's an industry that didn't exist (to this magnitude) pre internet, and it's certainly one that we've gone centuries without and were fine without. The bad heavily outweighs the good here, and it seems to be another sick propaganda tactic to desensitize our society to the extreme.

       That's your thoughts. Porn is no different from fast food. Quick, relatively effort-free; to the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast food has its place and welcomed. It's a detriment when self-control is exiled. But that can be said for anything and everything in life.

       This has existed in various forms from the subtle (a painting of nudes with hints of post-coitus) to tawdry literature and forbidden songs. Rock was at one time believed to be sex music;

       That´s a bit simplistic and no one has yet to provide a clear chronology from her being a bit upset with the harassment to her being distraught enough to kill herself in such an uncharacteristic (for women) manner. And the gruesome public display is definitely making me think that there could be an occult element involved. And since all of us are speculating here, if she was involved in some group activity of whatever kind, wouldn´t such a public display of her corpse send everyone else involved a crystal clear message. And as admittedly outlandish as my speculations may sound, they do have actual precedent in real life, whereas before 1 month ago I´d never heard of a hardened alpha pornstar committing suicide because the gays teased her.

       Your non dot connecting is overwhelming......assuming she’s too hardened because she works in porn is basically the basis of your whole argument and that’s a little ridiculous. If anything to end up in that industry damaged and closer on the suicidal spectrum is probably way more likely then being so above emotion to the point where she couldn’t have been depressed and it’s a conspiracy because she escorted so she surely fucked someone while they read classified info to her accidentally as they came......

       I think we all need to get past the illusion of on-screen sexual fantasies and be aware of the dark and stark reality of what actually goes-on and into the making of them and stop fantasizing about what that is, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or with the greater acceptance and normalization of it, not see that it has simply become another and fabulously lucrative side of the same entertainment industry that simultaneously creates what appears to be more normal or wholesome on-screen fantasies in the name of entertainment, be it adult or otherwise, that the very same kind of situation already and has always existed in between those with all the money and power and those for whom the rewards they can personally get for helping them to make and have even more of that lured them into a form of personal bondage and slavery to their every desire, on screen or off, no matter how degrading, disgusting, or loathsome they were.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply look at the list of actors and actresses, particularly all the child and adolescent ones in television and films that have all come to very bad end far too soon in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Far too many for us to not assume that there isn't something else far more sick, sinister and soul-destroying about it that they were easy prey for. Too naïve and innocent and too abruptly parted from that naivety and innocence in ways they could never accept or reconcile with themselves.

       If you're looking to learn a bit more about the "behind the scenes" of the industry, the "hot girls wanted" documentary and docuseries on Netflix are both pretty eye opening. It doesn't delve into the deepest darkest corners, but I've done a lot of research on the topic, and sadly there's also a lot of sex trafficking and kidnapping involved as well. It's a really sick industry and society would be much better off without it.

       Porn is full of people with mental and substance abuse problems,rapists and enablers.I think there is nothing suspicious about Pornstars offing themselves if you take all this into the equation.

       The phrase "almost literally" is basically an oxymoron.

       I don't understand this line of thought, "almost literally" and "pretty much always" are both valid descriptors to me. Say there's a spectrum measuring the frequency of the occurrence and one end of the spectrum is all the time, we're just talking about a degree of frequency a little bit less than that. You could say something happens "a lot," this is not a very meaningful description. You could say it happens "most of the time," this only narrows it down to occurring more than half of the time. Or you can say it happens "the vast majority of the time," but again, this isn't very precise, it still leaves a lot of wiggle room. Saying "pretty much always" serves a purpose, in that it measures with a degree of precision that is not effectively captured by other descriptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       for example I'm pretty much always sober. I'm almost literally drug free. What this means in real world terms is I smoke weed like once a year or less and I haven't sipped a drink in probably three years. This isn't something you can effectively capture with less precise descriptions in my opinion. Saying I'm sober the vast majority of the time, what does that mean, I get high twice a month? And so on and so on. Just my two cents

       I see what you are saying and you provide two very good examples that i agree with in hindsight, i was thinking more how
       <em>
        always/all
       </em>
       is used as a universal affirmative to mean a thing is absolute, whereas universal negation would be to say it is
       <em>
        never/no/none
       </em>
       and like you point out there is also times when there are
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        at least one case for which
       </em>
       , i was thinking (maybe kinda sloppily) about how in predicate logic you want to have one of those quantifiers, so
       <em>
        pretty much always
       </em>
       seemed bonkers to me at the time, mightv done a shit job explaining this

       Damn, I've been watching Yurizan since I was a kid. OP makes some valid points especially reguarding the escort angle.I too was taken back by why Ames would kill herself, put me off more realizing she's around my age too. It could have been harassment but the other comments are not wrong about the drugs. I've read Ames was on coke in another obituary article. The drug angle should not be taken lightly, it's getting like the 80s when cocaine hit the scene all over again, but this time is heroin. I think that's why there's a disambiguation with the term "millenial" as well. the older "millenials" whom by definition fit the 80s-90s year range that are pre 2000 are dwindling in numbers. If they didnt die in the 80s and 90s from coke, they're dying now because of the heroin. Its almost systematic, like if the older gens dont want us around, or at least the ones that remember pre surveillance world. Porn non the less is entertainment for some, cripple the vicarious feelings and looseness enjoyed by said age group by killing their favorites. I encounter much less people my age on average, and some the ones i did know are dead from drugs. What's worse is the toxicology reports often show the drug didnt kill them but whatever reactants or agents were used to cut them. I've known someone who OD but their autopsy showed death due to elephant tranqs, not heroin despite that present in their system.
