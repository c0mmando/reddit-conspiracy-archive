       As a very long time subscriber of this sub, I've got to say I'm thoroughly dismayed at the results of the submission statement rule that has been placed on all submissions to this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       The content has almost entirely dried up. I used to be able to come here and browse the new section, and see 20+ posts every hour here. Granted a lot of them were shit posts, but almost always there was a decently good post every hour or so. The community usually did a fantastic job at weeding out the shit posts, and up-voting the good ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since this submission statement rule has been in place, the content here has almost completely dried up.  I can come here now every hour or so, and see on average only 5-10 posts each hour, especially after 3 in the afternoon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've recently been lurking on
       <a href="/r/CBTS_Stream">
        /r/CBTS_Stream
       </a>
       , and a sub that only has 10,000+ subscribers, it has 32 posts in the last hour, compared to this sub which has over 560,000 subscribers that has only 22 posts in the last hour. I don't even subscribe to Q-Anon LARP, and don't care for most of the posts at
       <a href="/r/CBTS_Stream">
        /r/CBTS_Stream
       </a>
       , but it's not even close how much content is being submitted there, compared to here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The community was doing just fine at weeding out the shit posts before this submission statement, why the need to place this restriction on new posts here? This restriction is almost an insult to the intelligence of the subscribers here. Supposedly we as a community can't decipher shit posts from spam, so the mods had to place restrictions on the flow of information here?
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods here said a week or so ago that it was the holidays and to give it a chance, well the holidays are over now, and this new rule has significantly slowed  the flow of information here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just curious how everyone else feels about the effects this new submission statement on this sub. If anyone else noticing the same thing I am?

       There's just as many shit post text submissions as there was link submissions before.  I absolutely disagree with you over quality &gt; quantity.  It would be different if the majority of the front page was previously shit posts, but this sub always did a good job at weeding out the bad ones and giving the good ones visibility.

       Yeah there are a lot of shit post text submissions I agree, it's still helped with the link spam quite a bit.

       And I mean shit posts have been on the front of this sub plenty of times, definitely seems to have reduced since the new rule.

       webofslime is suspended, meaning the admins suspended that account from reddit for breaching one of their sitewide rules.  So that one is a bad example.
      </p>
      <p>
       comeyistitor had like 5 comments total to the sub and was banned for
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7mynnf/what_is_this_from_anthony_weiners_laptop/">
        this post

       You understand it's for link posts only, so obviously it wouldn't cut down on self post spam, right? Like you get that?

       Who cares? Just downvote it and be on your way to the next good post. At least there was the ability to discern good from bad, now the content has completely dried up.  I'm going to do an experiment tomorrow, and get an average of the number of posts here before the new rule, and after the new rule. I can almost guarantee there's been a drop of at least 35% of content here since the new rule.

       You clearly care because you're violating one of the subs rules and complaining publicly about less spam while your post gets an inflated amount of upvotes compared to surrounding threads. I question your intentions as I question the "resistance" you claim to be. What resistance complains because there's not enough propaganda?

       You're not understanding my post at all.  I'm saying that the community in large was perfectly capable of discerning spam, from good posts before the submission statement was enforced.  Since it has been enforced the amount of content being submitted has dropped dramatically. What you consider spam, other users here may consider relevant and worth their time.  Your concept of spam is entirely arbitrary compared to the collective of this sub.

       I'm not disagreeing with you that it's simple enough to submit a submission statement. It literally takes me an extra 5 minutes max to do, I'm just saying that the amount of content being submitted here has been drastically reduced because of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps it was bots or David Brock that was previously submitting links here, I don't know who it was too be honest.  I just trusted this sub to be able to weed out the shit posts, and up-vote the good posts that it didn't matter to me who was submitting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing with CBTS_Stream, I definitely agree with you about that sub, I was looking at the exact same thing last night, the majority of the posters there had accounts created since November or December, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's a dynamic sub. I think that sub has nowhere near the discernment that this sub does, and shit posts get to the front page quite frequently there. This sub however isn't like that. The users here know a shit post when they see it.

       I was referring to the other sub.

       I think it’s fishy because most of the young accounts over there provide nothing of substance to the sub apart from comments that jerk off their “movement.”

       I noticed the tone of discussion has rapidly changed - haven’t been on here in a few weeks (new acct, old one linked to Imgur breach), and it seems like everyone is pro-anarchy, anti-everything.

       I would’ve thought this sub would be happy to hear of Korean talks resuming, but instead it’s full of DRUMPF EXTENDED A WAIVER TO A BANK HE OWES MONEY TOO.

       Well, unless they fucking forgave his debt (which lmao they won’t, they’re a bank!) I fail to see the issue.

       Eh, it is what it is, I suppose. I'm 50/50 about it, personally (I can see the pros and cons of it), but it has limited the spamming (not completely, obviously - ie. certain accounts circumvent it, I've noticed).

       Also, I've noticed the "users here now" number has dropped pretty significantly since it's (rule 13) establishment. Time will tell, and it's technically just in "trial mode", so, it's not necessarily permanent. We shall see.

       Yes, it's been pretty quite around here since, and I'm not sure exactly how I feel about it, tbh. To be honest, it feels more like it did ~2 years ago, traffic wise, but... obviously during that time, the numbers were drastically lower (like in the &lt;= 1,800 tops) range. Makes you think about all the bots and shit accounts "idling" by... Just waiting. Ultimately, IMHO, I think all numbers are cooked. Reddit is trying to go public... I think cutting both numbers in half, is a more legit/honest stat.

       You are comparing posts needing a submission  statement...on an internet forum...to Nazi Germany burning books?  Can you explain the reasoning there a bit?  Because they aren't blocking content (burning), you just have to add a submission statement (sign the cover) so that bots can't spam the same things over and over.

       It's the exact opposite. Instead of removing content for stating an opinion, we are removing content for
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       stating an opinion. We want people to explain the purpose of their post. This deters spammers and initiates a conversation. No post will be removed with a submission statement unless that submission statement breaks the rules that apply to all comments.

       If that is what you define as censorship then I really don't think you understand what censorship is.  Censorship has two parts to it.  Suppression and then some sort of consensus via government or community that an item is harmful or offensive.  The second part we have, bots spamming links is harmful to the community for example.  The suppression part is what is missing here.  There is no content not allowed.

       Although I have noticed some good conversations spinning off the submission statement, you make an extremely valid point that should not be overlooked. We have made a small step away from user-driven moderation. It's debatable what effect that will have, and you're correct that we need to have that debate before accepting this change.

       No, I don't disagree with you, I'm only saying that this sub was very good at burying the shit out of said videos with cryptic titles beforehand, and since this rule has been in place the community hasn't even had the opportunity to vote on said YouTube submissions.

       For every 5 YouTube submissions with cryptic titles, there was one good one that I enjoyed watching, which have disappeared.

       Why hasn’t the community had the opportunity to vote? Anyone who posts has had the opportunity to write a submission statement and not have their submission removed.

       Clearly these submissions were enough of a problem for people to complain about them to the point where the rule was created.

       You don’t have to read the submission statement, so you don’t have to do anything. Users need to post a submission statement to show that they aren’t a bot, and because other users might not want to have to watch a whole video to know why they should care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you honestly defending bots right now? Because what real user making a real post that they actually care about making was ever hindered by this rule? The criteria for submission statements is very lax.

       Not your words.  The words in the submission statement where it says something like 'tell us why the sub should care'.  I want to hear why others care, I don't want to be told why I should care.  Like I said, I think I took that the wrong way.
      </p>

       That said, I do think it could be worded better.  To me it reads like it was written in anger or frustration.

       Isn’t the submission statement telling you why OP cares? Don’t you want to know why they care?

      <p>
       That’s all good dude. I don’t think you’ll find any genuinely suppressed info as a result of the submission statement. T_D shills are certainly working hard to try to portray it that way, but the mod logs are public for everyone to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s funny, I often apparently come across as anti-T_D, but I’d say I am equally critical of all stupidity. I’d happily call a liberal out just as much as a conservative. But I’ll be damned if the conservatives here are quite a bit stupider than the liberals. I suppose T_D isn’t exactly sending us their best and brightest here in

       Not sure where I stand politically anymore and it sort of bothers me.  Anyways, I don't think anything less of people because of politics.  I prefer trying to get to know someone more before I have any type of opinion about them.  Our differences are, to me, what makes us great as long as respect and reason guide us.  It turns me off when people make blanket statements about groups of people.  I am human, so I sometimes fall victim to this way of thinking.  I try hard to live this way and always have.  Try to surround myself with people like this.

       I feel the same way, and to be clear I’m making blanket statements about a group of trolls from a self-described troll sub who have intentionally set out to overwhelm this sub with politicized spam. Nothing against conservatives or republicans in general, just the subset of those groups who seem to have ended up here from T_D (and I’m beginning to suspect,
       <a href="/r/incels">

       Yeah, I know what you were saying.  This was why I specifically tried to use language which would not make it seem like I was accusing you.  I think you gathered that.  I think there are trolls on either side and think our collective, and dare I say voluntary  partisanship is harmful.

       Reducing the amount of "content" was one of the main purposes of the rule.  Quality over quantity.  Before, bots were posting dozens of links per day to Donald Trump/Hillary tweets and other stupid political propaganda and spam.  Spammers were posting links to random unsourced blogs.  Now they need to explain to the sub why those posts are relevant and why we should care.

       I guess my thoughts are what you are calling spam and propaganda, others may find meaningful and worthwhile, myself included.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of the reason I've hung around this sub for the last 4 years or so, was the fact that it was always frequently updated with new information, which the overwhelming majority of users here discerned, and up-voted articles and links I found interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess my biggest concern is that when you added this rule, and the flow of information has slowed down to a trickle, you've taken the ability of this sub to collectively determine what is spam, and what is propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally feel confident that I'm capable of discerning this myself, and if I feel it's spam or propaganda, I simply down vote and move on to a post I do find interesting and worthwhile.  I don't exert any more time or energy on it.

       What is meaningful about a random tweet by Donald Trump or Hillary about some partisan issue?  What is meaningful about a random youtube video with poor editing and no coherent message?

       A better question: what "meaningful" posts do you think rule 13 is preventing?  Anyone can still post whatever they want as long as they take 30 seconds to explain to us why it's relevant and why we should care.

       Well that's good, I hope that everyone has that ability and if they don't I hope that they will at some point.  The issue was quality/shit ratio.  There was way too much spam and white noise being posted.  As just one example: why should we allow spam bots to continually game the system for their own benefit?  R13 has stopped them from posting almost completely.

       Why would you be willing to bet that?  The overwhelming response to R13 has been positive, so clearly lots of users here feel like it's an improvement on the "downvote and move on" strategy that wasn't working at all.

       top comment: "As OP is well aware, Byrd turned his life around, denounced the KKK, and fought for civil rights. The NAACP mourned his death when he died. Get this the_donald bullshit outta here. Such a desperate reach."

       You say that but this comment is hardly trolling, both in general and especially compared to some of my other comments. Do you disagree that there were thousands of videos being posted with cryptic titles and no descriptions before the rule was added?

       It's the exact opposite. Instead of removing content for stating an opinion, we are removing content for
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       stating an opinion. We want people to explain the purpose of their post. This deters spammers and initiates a conversation. No post will be removed with a submission statement unless that submission statement breaks the rules that apply to all comments.

       If that is what you define as censorship then I really don't think you understand what censorship is.  Censorship has two parts to it.  Suppression and then some sort of consensus via government or community that an item is harmful or offensive.  The second part we have, bots spamming links is harmful to the community for example.  The suppression part is what is missing here.  There is no content not allowed.

       I don't have any way of determining that, we would need to ask the admins why they suspended it and they don't typically make that info public in my experience.
