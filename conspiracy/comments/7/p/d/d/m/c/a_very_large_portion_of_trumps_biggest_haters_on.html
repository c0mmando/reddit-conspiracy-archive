<p>Some of the most vocal Anti-Trump people on this website don&#39;t actually seem to be from the US. Lots of British and Canadian people in particular, which is interesting. Seems like a total waste of time, but that&#39;s reddit.</p>

<p>A large portion of President Trump&#39;s biggest haters don&#39;t actually seem to be from the US. Very interesting how these people, who seem to by far be from first world countries focus so much time and effort going against a president of another country.</p>

<p>Lots of Canadians and British in particular. Curious as to why these people have so much interest to go against a President they can&#39;t actually do vote against.</p>

<p>They can&#39;t vote against him. So they voice their opinion in hopes of influencing those who can.</p>

<p>Not that it matters. Individual votes for president don&#39;t even count. Because electoral college. They can&#39;t vote against Trump, and when I try to, the electoral college gives all my states votes to Trump anyway, effectively erasing my vote&#39;s effect altogether. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Canadian here who used to live in the US and has lots of American friends. This makes perfect sense to me, since Canadians dislike Trump at a much greater rate than Americans. Trump is fairly unpopular in the US, but he&#39;s even <em>more</em> unpopular in Canada. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s similar in the UK. </p>

<p>Your average Canadian views Americans as different from Canadians in being less polite, less tolerant of people of other cultures, more aggressive, and more egotistical. In that sense, Trump sort of personifies everything Canadians view as more &quot;American&quot;, and not in a good way. </p>

<p>As for it being a waste of time -- I think Americans really underestimate how much US politics reverberates around the world, especially for your close allies. But we don&#39;t get to vote, donate, volunteer on campaigns, etc -- all we can really do is complain to Americans on the internet. Sorry. :P</p>
