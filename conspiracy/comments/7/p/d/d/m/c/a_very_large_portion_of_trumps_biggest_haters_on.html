       Just something I've been noticing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the most vocal Anti-Trump people on this website don't actually seem to be from the US. Lots of British and Canadian people in particular, which is interesting. Seems like a total waste of time, but that's reddit.

      <p>
       A large portion of President Trump's biggest haters don't actually seem to be from the US. Very interesting how these people, who seem to by far be from first world countries focus so much time and effort going against a president of another country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of Canadians and British in particular. Curious as to why these people have so much interest to go against a President they can't actually do vote against.

       I feel like this is mostly some sort of confirmation bias.

       They can't vote against him. So they voice their opinion in hopes of influencing those who can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that it matters. Individual votes for president don't even count. Because electoral college. They can't vote against Trump, and when I try to, the electoral college gives all my states votes to Trump anyway, effectively erasing my vote's effect altogether.

       Do you remember that time an American president went to war and dragged other countries (Britain, Canada and Australia for example) along. Believe it or not the discissions made by a US president have consequences for people outside the US.

       Bill Clinton met with Putin in person while striking that juicy Uranium One deal for the Russians. The DNC got the supposed dossier from Russians too and what do you know, the Dems are about as close to communism as you can get, which was a Russian invention.

       he was.  but he wasn't the only guy with the idea.  before him there were a bunch of dudes in europe, including england, espousing the same thing.  the term was coined by a frenchman.  the financing of the russian revolution, to my understanding came out of london and new york.  and the subsequent cold war spies came out of cambridge.  it's a mix.

       British Conservatives are similar to US Democrats so someone as far right and classless as Trump is gonna piss most of them off. Also the same people that pushed Brexit got behind Trump so thats another reason to hate him.

       Canadian here who used to live in the US and has lots of American friends. This makes perfect sense to me, since Canadians dislike Trump at a much greater rate than Americans. Trump is fairly unpopular in the US, but he's even
       <em>

       unpopular in Canada. I wouldn't be surprised if it's similar in the UK.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your average Canadian views Americans as different from Canadians in being less polite, less tolerant of people of other cultures, more aggressive, and more egotistical. In that sense, Trump sort of personifies everything Canadians view as more "American", and not in a good way.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for it being a waste of time -- I think Americans really underestimate how much US politics reverberates around the world, especially for your close allies. But we don't get to vote, donate, volunteer on campaigns, etc -- all we can really do is complain to Americans on the internet. Sorry. :P

       German here, Trump‘s election proved the prejudice „Americans are stupid“ to a lot of people. Trump would have never gotten anywhere near the parliament here.

       Good actually. She's not my party choice but compared to Trump she's a godsend. But compared to Trump any community organizer would be more qualified.

       Trump getting elected isn't really the thing that proved "Americans are stupid", it was having to choose between Trump and Hillary that showed the world what a shit-show American politics is.

       That too. But comparing Trump's qualifications versus Hillary's qualifications would be a no-brainer for germans.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is because not many germans know of the dirty laundry Hillary is hiding. And even considering this issue most germans would still vote Clinton over Trump due to the difference in qualification in my experience.

       well, i am from brazil, and i do not like him, but i do not gave support to hillary and i was very disappointed when the democrats stole the nomination from Sanders, which, i believe, would have be your president.
