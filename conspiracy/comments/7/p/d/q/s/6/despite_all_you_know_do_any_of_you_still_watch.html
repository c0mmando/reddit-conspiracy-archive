       If so, how do you approach them? I think it's an interesting form of propaganda to be aware of, to see how the CIA steers the shaping of its public image, how that image evolves. So I sometimes watch them, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy them on many levels, if nothing else than for the multinational aspect of it, bit of a multi-country travel-related entertainment. Part of the seductive appeal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you find them to fall under different types, and are there those that are particularly interesting to examine, Hollywood or otherwise? Thoughts on "based on true stories" or not? Good arguments for avoiding entirely? Depends entirely on which film? In many, the stories don't directly paint the CIA in a good light (e.g. Bourne series) but I still feel steered into various impressions of what they do and how they work.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am genuinely conflicted about these kinds of films, basically embarrassed to find myself sometimes enjoying propaganda (that hurt to write) and could use some perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked a lot of questions, not to expect them to all be answered, but to give an idea of where I'm at with it all and see if anyone can relate.

       Guilty pleasure is the Bourne franchise.

       The last one was great because I got to red pill my partner on how the CIA seed's social networks / IT companies for backdoor access.

       Speaking of revisionist history, just FYI if you don't know, the first few Bourne books were fantastic. Very different than the movies. I know it's never easy to translate a novel into a movie and maintain the same depth, but the books are really quite a bit better.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also this mini-series if you are really into it:

        http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0094791/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember it being cool when it first aired on network tv but I was just a wee lad then, I'm sure it's cheesy in retrospect.

       Entertainment and an interest in cinema. I'm not interested in narratives that may or may not be there based on the people involved and what those artists are trying to do either in the film, or how it fits/changes/expands on their work.

       Mostly just the Bonds. Bourne series is pretty good. Dude wakes up and goes rogue, yup.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mission Impossible I haven't been able to bring myself to even think about watching since the first one. Maybe it's a Tom Cruise thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Swordfish was good. XXX, the very first one, good. Fast and Furious, the first one, good, and maybe 5 when they actually tried to try making a decent movie again with the gun running and what have you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most films of the genre have similar underlying plots that don't stay outside the realm of the CIA or MI6, its the groups they dont include that I think about. Or even in those films, what firm/group is the protagonist actually fighting? They have a shit ton of dead men...

       It had some intrigue for sure. At the beginning when Pitt's character was being ostracized by his own guys is cool to see because it's historically accurate, especially to the earlier days in Vietnam. That doesn't get shown much today, now it's all hero worship, American Sniper bullshit. I also found the scene where he was helping the defector very interesting along with the way Redford had Pitt's character put on boring pog duty to get him bored and craving adventure.

       I recently watched The lives of others, great movie. I enjoy the genre as long as I don't catch a lot of propaganda. Zero dark thirty for example. That movie really upsets me. Bukowski should be behind bars not being portrayed as a hero.

       So, I know nothing more than what's on the big screen and msm about this mission. What's up with this lady? All I know is she is an analyst who did the tracking. Im gonna check her wiki right now, but if you have a link or synopsis as to why you think she should be in prison I'd appreciate it.

       Ok cool, thanks. Maybe edit your post though. I thought that first link would be for the movie you recommended, "The Lives of Others," so not having seen it, I skipped the first link to read about it on imdb first and then figured if I was interested I'd catch it on Netflix before trying to find it on YouTube. Might never have clicked on that link or seen the video on Bikowsky if you hadn't mentioned it. I'm more interested in the YouTube doc then the imdb link for sure.

       right out of the Airport on 9/11. You know the security film that has no time stamp? I swear that she and a couple other

       Know what I find telling? John Kiriakou in all the interviews I have seen refuses to say her name. She is brought up and spoken about but not once does he or the persons interviewing him ever just say her name.  Huge red flag for me on him.

       I don't trust him. Really all there is to it. The question then becomes why would they use a "whistleblower" with the whole water boarding/torture thing. Did some think tank come up with a bright idea to come out with it but in a way that made us all feel better about it? IDK. I just think it weird he never says her name, though she is at the center of the whole mess. Bad smell.

       Ken Follett and then Tom Clancy got me started in the nudge that these books would come off like scripts brought to life. Michner, Wouk, Uris and a few others too.

       Good disinformation is seeded with grains of truth to give it power.
