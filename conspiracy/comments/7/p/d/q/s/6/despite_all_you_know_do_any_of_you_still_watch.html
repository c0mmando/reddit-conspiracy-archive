        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If so, how do you approach them? I think it&#39;s an interesting form of propaganda to be aware of, to see how the CIA steers the shaping of its public image, how that image evolves. So I sometimes watch them, and I&#39;d be lying if I said I didn&#39;t enjoy them on many levels, if nothing else than for the multinational aspect of it, bit of a multi-country travel-related entertainment. Part of the seductive appeal.</p>

<p>Do you find them to fall under different types, and are there those that are particularly interesting to examine, Hollywood or otherwise? Thoughts on &quot;based on true stories&quot; or not? Good arguments for avoiding entirely? Depends entirely on which film? In many, the stories don&#39;t directly paint the CIA in a good light (e.g. Bourne series) but I still feel steered into various impressions of what they do and how they work.</p>

<p>I am genuinely conflicted about these kinds of films, basically embarrassed to find myself sometimes enjoying propaganda (that hurt to write) and could use some perspective.</p>

<p>I asked a lot of questions, not to expect them to all be answered, but to give an idea of where I&#39;m at with it all and see if anyone can relate.</p>

<p>The last one was great because I got to red pill my partner on how the CIA seed&#39;s social networks / IT companies for backdoor access.</p>

<p>....but some stuff makes me wince with the revisionist history and programming where I have to switch off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking of revisionist history, just FYI if you don&#39;t know, the first few Bourne books were fantastic. Very different than the movies. I know it&#39;s never easy to translate a novel into a movie and maintain the same depth, but the books are really quite a bit better.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also this mini-series if you are really into it:</p>

<p><a href="http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0094791/">http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0094791/</a></p>

<p>I remember it being cool when it first aired on network tv but I was just a wee lad then, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s cheesy in retrospect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mostly just the Bonds. Bourne series is pretty good. Dude wakes up and goes rogue, yup.</p>

<p>Mission Impossible I haven&#39;t been able to bring myself to even think about watching since the first one. Maybe it&#39;s a Tom Cruise thing.</p>

<p>Swordfish was good. XXX, the very first one, good. Fast and Furious, the first one, good, and maybe 5 when they actually tried to try making a decent movie again with the gun running and what have you.</p>

<p>Most films of the genre have similar underlying plots that don&#39;t stay outside the realm of the CIA or MI6, its the groups they dont include that I think about. Or even in those films, what firm/group is the protagonist actually fighting? They have a shit ton of dead men...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It had some intrigue for sure. At the beginning when Pitt&#39;s character was being ostracized by his own guys is cool to see because it&#39;s historically accurate, especially to the earlier days in Vietnam. That doesn&#39;t get shown much today, now it&#39;s all hero worship, American Sniper bullshit. I also found the scene where he was helping the defector very interesting along with the way Redford had Pitt&#39;s character put on boring pog duty to get him bored and craving adventure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok cool, thanks. Maybe edit your post though. I thought that first link would be for the movie you recommended, &quot;The Lives of Others,&quot; so not having seen it, I skipped the first link to read about it on imdb first and then figured if I was interested I&#39;d catch it on Netflix before trying to find it on YouTube. Might never have clicked on that link or seen the video on Bikowsky if you hadn&#39;t mentioned it. I&#39;m more interested in the YouTube doc then the imdb link for sure.</p>
