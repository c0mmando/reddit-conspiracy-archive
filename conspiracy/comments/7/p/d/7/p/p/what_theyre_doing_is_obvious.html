       They couldn't pin him as a sexist, so they tried making him a Russian badguy. That didn't work, so now he's a racist. He got too much minority support, so now he's got to be crazy, right?

       gathering by the attempt to initiate war with russia i don't think he's a russian badguy.  more concerned with the narrative to make him look heroic by propping up strawmen around him.  this is the path to a police state.

       i'm grateful that in his election the voice of public discontent of the status quo was loudly heard.  but he's a divisive figure who is continuing the same mistakes the last guys did - and doing it in a way that can fracture america.  for that i am not grateful but hopeful that americans of all political stripe can see it.

       btw, i'm not a never trumper.  i supported a lot of the things he spoke up about and i've kept an open mind about the things i wasn't so sure about.  now it's much clearer what the agenda is, and i hope americans realize their leadership doesn't change who or what america and americans are.  it has nothing to do with their leaders, and it's more a function of the world they create in their own lives and the lives of their fellow citizens.

       In what way is the voting system being manipulated?  There's nothing weird about the voting.  You stated an unpopular opinion.  An opinion that's even more unpopular outside of r/conspiracy.  When your unpopular opinion hit r/all, you got a lot of downvotes.  Rather than accept the fact that your downvotes are just the result of people disagreeing with what you said, you played the "I'm being brigaded because people want to bury the truth" card.  Quit being such a special snowflake and accept the fact that a lot of people just disagree.

       4 criminal indictments so far in an investigation that just continues to heat up. It's fuckin hilarious that people continue to pretend all of this is fake. And Trump got 8% of the black vote and 28% of the Hispanic vote. That's too much support?

       Instead of Trump being the one with mental issues, you mean?

       His being mentally competent would be

       Is it so hard to believe that a seventy-one year old man with the family history of Alzheimer’s, who does not eat well, who does not exercise, who is under a tremendous amount of stress... is it so hard to believe he would be exhibiting the signs of Alzheimer’s himself? He is the definition of a high-risk cohort.
