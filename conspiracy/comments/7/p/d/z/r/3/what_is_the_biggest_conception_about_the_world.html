How could Rome restructure itself into three entities that didn&#39;t exist for centuries after its demise?</p>

<p>What alternative do you suggest (seeing as this is a historical lie) to the body of work we have on this topic? (from Zosimus through Edward Gibbon to Adrian Goldsworthy) Where can one read on this alternative interpretation?</p>

<p>Also, since both Sumer and Babylon (cities/kingdoms) were in Mesopotamia (geographical region), that last sentence was a bit redundant..just sayin&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.</p>

<p>I&#39;m fine with us spinning 1,000 mph around our own axis (at equator), I&#39;m also fine with all the movements through the solarsystem/galaxy/universe which always happen to have speeds of 666xxxxx mph that our human bodies can&#39;t feel; I&#39;ll accept the &quot;we don&#39;t feel it cuz of relativity, we&#39;re moving <em>with</em> the Earth, so we don&#39;t feel a thing.</p>

<p>The problem is that according to scientific theory, scientific instruments <em>should</em> be able to detect this motion, any of the various motions we go through, but we don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Other than the flawed Foucault Pendulum <em>experiment</em>, where U have to go to freemason/illuminati churches or universities to see one live in action, there&#39;s not a shred of, scientific, evidence for a single motion the Earth makes.</p>

<p>Bleh, I haven&#39;t found conclusive proof to believe the Earth is either flat or concave, but the <em>ball Earth spinning in space</em> is probably <em>their</em> (Lucifer&#39;s?) greatest &quot;conception&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. We supposedly travel billions of miles through space every day, yet you look up and the orientation of everything in the sky hasn&#39;t changed, ancient sundials still work, the North Star is still the North Star, and as you said the motion is not detectable nor measurable at all. Yet when I&#39;m in a car that just begins moving forward, I can feel that relative motion. </p>

<p>And during all this spinning and violent motion -- we have an elliptical orbit which means a net acceleration would be experienced by earth -- water on earth manages to form into peaceful untroubled pools rather than flying off like from a wet tennis ball spun in the air. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not imaginary. Stars exist, so do planets, the Moon and the Sun. Asteroids/meteorites/etc.. exist aswell.</p>

<p>Have U ever asked your friend to look through the telescope yourself?</p>

<p><a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZcIPL8Uw3NE/hqdefault.jpg">This</a> is what U see when u point it at Mars, when visible.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jdecDSzLYnE/maxresdefault.jpg">This</a> one is similar to what I saw myself, where Mars <strong>appeared</strong> to be a bit transparant.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oF1hLLCmd7g/maxresdefault.jpg">This</a> and 
<a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sOMPuD1n7nw/maxresdefault.jpg">this</a> is what Mars looks like through a P900.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9GtDG3YETQY/hqdefault.jpg">This</a> is the star Vega through a telescope.

<a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_VpweQGDthc/maxresdefault.jpg">Yup</a></p>

<p>I have first hand experience of watching some planets and stars through a telescope, and the images I posted look <strong>exactly</strong> like what I saw.</p>

<p>There&#39;s thousands of people with P900 who take pictures of the planets and stars, and they look like what I showed you, I&#39;m not making this shit up...</p>

<p>So to conclusively say the Earth <strong>has to be a ball</strong> based on the <strong>real</strong> pictures I just showed you, and to then call me cancer/dumb/...</p>

<p>Ok buddy.</p>

<p>You&#39;re shooting yourself in the foot.</p>

<p>You can see the sun and moon without a telescope, we both can agree on that.</p>

<p>They look pretty circular to me, and we live in a 3 dimensional world, would you also agree with that? Its not like I am impossibly flat human that has no depth just width and height, I hope you agree with that.</p>

<p>We can say with 100% certainty the Sun and Moon are, at the very least, discs.</p>

<p>The Sun doesn&#39;t appear spherical, how could it, it&#39;s way to bright to look at, it appears like a disc. It could be a sphere, but for semantics sake again it looks like a disc.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.es-static.us/upl/2015/12/moon-phases-Fred-Espenak-lg-e1464203296249.jpg">The Moon</a> does appear spherical as a result of it&#39;s phases, yet a <a href="https://c.tadst.com/gfx/1200x630/full-moon.png?1">full Moon</a> appears like a disc, light isn&#39;t dropping off around the edges. To be clear, the latter picture looks like a disk. Even if your brain is telling you the Moon is a big ball in the sky, and you have all these nice NASA images in your head, when we&#39;re talking purely about the image we see, it appears like a (nearly) flat disc.</p>

<p>But you&#39;re not interested in reconcidering your view I suppose. Have fun in capslock mode.</p>

<p>The moment that asshat started taking the time to present his case and link images as if he was going to refute the truth based on circumstantial what ifs is the moment I said the  quote that seems to have your panties in a bunch.

<p>You give these assholes a voice and at that moment you discredit everything I have been fighting for my whole life. And you pussies wont stand up to it, you actually defend it while turning this sub into a circle jerk of bullshit where we are all mocked. </p>

Any organism is going to be checked when it is that out of touch with basic anti survival behaviors.    Going to be painful.
