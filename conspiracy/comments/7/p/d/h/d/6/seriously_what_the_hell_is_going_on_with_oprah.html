        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After watching her speech someone told me to watch from that award show, I wondered if Oprah has been cloned or something? Has she been turned or was she always THAT turned? She looked great and renewed and spouted vague notions of change but never mentioned #metoo, as though her final non words on the subject decreed it thusly over. We would try to be better. Never mind that actual accusers like Rose MacGowan were not invited at all. The Winestain was never mentioned by name, and it was tacitly implied there would be no more witch hunt. No need to dig deeper for the pedos, the satanists, the scum, we had endured enough, now that men know what women go through, it&#39;s okay… the camera panned over teary eyed female celebs, showing our &#39;idols&#39; agreeing with Oprah. The high priestess of fast food spirituality has spoken on the matter… And then her undying support of media, a rallying call to respect our media. I wondered how anyone got future president out of that speech either. And if that were even possible, what the hell crazy timeline are we living in… Just curious what others think is going on with her these days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oprah being Oprah, Corporate sell out that she is. Now putting trial balloons out for President, she would be the perfectly controlled ignoramus to take the Presidency and allow the fuckers who have just about driven this Republic into the ground to finish the fucking job.</p>

<p>That said, the Awards were a fucking disaster, that prove once and for all that Hollywood can <em>not</em> police their own. They had the chance to do so with the Weinstein, Spacey, and CK revelations, and they&#39;ve shown they have no fucking plans to do so. I think that&#39;s part of the reason Enty on CD&amp;N seems so angry and emboldened now...calling out Feldman and the rest of these hacks. If you don&#39;t already read CD&amp;N I highly recommend it.</p>

<p>Yes, I am an avid Crazy Days reader. Can you fucking imagine if someone started talking about Heather O&#39;Rourke at the awards?! Spacey is the tip of the god damn creep iceberg. The Titanic that is Hollywood will be giving said iceberg a very wide berth. With a foot in both worlds, Enty must be going crazy. </p>

People really really might have full-on brain aneurysms, their heads would explode if they could read and listen and absorb.

<p>Weinstein has used his stable of stars and hollywood power to raise huge money for the Clinton&#39;s, lived next door to them, used former Mossad to spy on and stalk any detractors... the man is like a prince in his own fiefdom, and people don&#39;t care.

<p>Whoever Himmmmm is, it&#39;s gotta be an actor. Did you get a chance to read the Golden Globes blinds? Full access to multiple after parties. Gotta be an actor, and someone with access. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t read Crazy Days, but if this is regarding the Weinstein leaks; there is a rumor circulating that it&#39;s RDJ and I think there are legs for it.  From what I heard, when RDJ had his drug fall out in the 90s, it was Weinstein that tried to blacklist RDJ, but it then it was Mel Gibson who risked his own career to get him back in.  And now that RDJ is virtually invincible because of his clout at Marvel, he&#39;s finally exacting revenge.</p>

<p>Obviously, it&#39;s a LOT of baseless rumors, but I think it has legs.  If I were in his shoes, that&#39;s how I would&#39;ve done it.</p>

<p>That is an absurd assumption. That&#39;s like saying because I am good at math that means I&#39;m good at public speaking. NDT is not even the top in his field. By your logic, we should find the best scientist ever and make him president. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is how I know you&#39;re still sleeping. You assume I would pick one over the other. I wouldn&#39;t pick anyone who makes it far enough along in our current system, as I know they&#39;re being propped up and puppetted by the PTB.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, what&#39;s wrong with society is that they can&#39;t see the corruption within the system that is giving us our only options. Regardless of who wins the presidency, the same bad actors will be pulling the strings from behind the scenes.</p>

<p>If you think NDT would be some sort of saviour if he became president, you are sadly misguided. </p>

<p>I also really liked your position in saying it wouldn&#39;t matter due to the puppeteers. I agree with that as well.

<p>This is what Oprah is really good at. My wife has always thought so highly of her. And I always used to challenge her by asking &quot;What does Oprah actually stand for anyways?&quot;</p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t even think about this. Oprah just seems to continually give off this vibe of generalized positivity. But, before Obama, she was completely neutral when it came to politics.</p>

<p>Now it looks like she&#39;s doing the exact same thing. &quot;I&#39;m with you guys... all of you... on both sides&quot; That way, whichever way the wind is blowing, she keeps getting carried along.</p>

<p>To me, this absolutely rules out a political career. Why? Because in politics, you always have to pick a side. There&#39;s no way to chart that neutral course. </p>

<p>Too much irony for this to ever happen. How so?</p>

<p>How could the left ever support a candidate that has no political experience, who is mainly known as a television celebrity... after the election of Trump?</p>

<p>As for Oprah? What office would she run for? Congress, Senate or Governor? She&#39;s a Billionaire who runs numerous business enterprises including her own network (OWN). So it seems unlikely she&#39;s bother with anything less prominent.</p>

<p>That leaves the most likely possibility as her doing the same thing she did with Obama. Namely, to throw her public support behind whatever candidates she likes.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;ve got nothing against Oprah. Her success is admirable and I can&#39;t honestly say I know much about her besides her career as a TV host and supporter of various worthy causes.</p>

<p>Because nobody learns from past mistakes ever ever ever ever ever. If I said that many times, its because it happens every fucking time. Every 4 years Americans completely lose their minds and go right back to falling for the same bullshit as before. Just change the color of the team. It&#39;s the same thing every time. Nobody learns anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just what <strong>has</strong> Winfrey ever challenged about the <em>status quo</em>?</p>

<p>(courtesy of a CFN commentor):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People see in Oprah what they want to see.</p>

<p>Does anyone see a powerful woman in the broadcasting industry who had a show for 25 years and <strong><em>never exposed</em></strong> the Harvey Weinsteins of her business, <strong><em>never questioned</em></strong> the titans of financial fraud on Wall Street, <strong><em>never challenged</em></strong> the Orwellian deep state surveillance agencies? She kept America in a hypnogogic state with fake news and Jerry Springer style circus bullshit.</p>

<p>I would never expect her to denounce the divisive identity politics of cultural Marxism – since it’s the water in which she swims. Oprah for President? Please!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She&#39;s black, she&#39;s liberal and has a huge standing with many of the same drooling TV watchers who elected Trump, and probably even better standing with women than Hillary.  Plus she&#39;s got a ton of media influence.  I wouldn&#39;t discount her as a spoiler or enabler.</p>

<p>That being said, she&#39;d be a terrible candidate and the right would maul her.  She&#39;s used to a pretty sycophantic group of supporters (either followers of her as celebrity, as celebrity tastemaker or as people who saw her as a business opportunity) and she doesn&#39;t really have any experience with having her worst decisions and sensibilities being exposed to the public.</p>
