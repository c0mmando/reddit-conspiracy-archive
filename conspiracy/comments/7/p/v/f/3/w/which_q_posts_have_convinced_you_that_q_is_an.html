        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If Q is an insider, he(/she/they) will presumably have said something in a post that only an insider would know, or posted a picture that only an insider could post. It seems people have varying reasons for believing Q is an insider, what was it that convinced you?</p>

<p>Some people believe Q is not an insider, and is actually anything from a larp to a psyop. If this is the case, and Q is indeed sharing no insider knowledge, then effectively all he’s doing is commenting on issues already in the media and telling people how to feel about them by framing them in a specific way with his commentary.</p>

<p>If Q is a psyop, then the people behind the op are using him to influence public opinion on certain issues. If Q is a larp, then maybe he’s doing this to bring attention to issues and is doing humanity a service, but he doesn’t necessarily need to be an insider to do this.</p>

<p>However, Q is almost universally referred to as an insider both here and on virtually every other site that promotes his content.</p>

<p>Is Q really an insider?</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em></p>

<p>Apparently not, sorry folks. It’s been four hours of heated debate, and still not a single piece of evidence that Q is an insider or for that matter anything but a LARP. Sorry, I was hoping it was real too.</p>

<p>My issue in believing in either of these things is that I haven’t actually seen any evidence that it’s happening. If some exists, it’s certainly been well hidden. It seems odd to me as well that the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community counts so many among their ranks who “choose to believe” in an anon from the chans and the President of the United States when in most respects this group tends to be skeptical and demand evidence. Hell, there are folks here saying the earth is flat because they haven’t personally see curvature of the horizon with their own eyes. There are people who believe the holocaust was a hoax because of a lack of evidence.</p>

<p>But Q being an insider and President Trump being “our savior” (as Q himself said), no evidence required?</p>

<p>Been following the CBTS stuff since it started. And imho i think &quot;they&quot; are doing just that. Threads get derailed. Massspammed with porn, a few bits of gold here and there and then more derailment &quot;fake larp&quot; stuff.</p>

<p>I dont think TPTB can do much else then try and derail it. I have a feeling they, aswell as us (if Q actually is an inside that is)  have no real idea who he is. And thats fustrating them. Q could be anyone and noone. Every damn Q thread on reddit gets derailed so fast. This thread is 50 minutes old as of now, it has 17 comments sitting at 57% upvotes.</p>

<p>Either the &quot;reddit shills&quot; are here. Or Flatearth lizard people hollow earth theories are more &#39;conspiracy&#39; than a suspected White house insider sending out bits of info on things that are quite... interesting. To say the least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s understandable, and maybe they are doing that. But to me at least, that wouldn’t make me believe Q is an insider. I would base that judgement on whether Q actually shared insider knowledge, otherwise I feel like anyone could do exactly what he’s doing. If there’s no actual insider knowledge, then it literally is just stories already known to the public with some spin put on them.</p>

<p>Why is he a suspected White House insider? What has he actually done to make you suspect this?</p>

<p>Why i follow it (except for the reason i have this thing about internet drama,) is due to the timing stuff and pictures.</p>

<p>Sure, Q speaks in riddles. Most of them dont make sense.  &quot;Auth<em>[2]- Good/win&quot; as a demonstration, (cant be arsed to find the actual post right now) was connected to a trump tweet that happened 2 minutes (Auth</em><strong>[2]</strong>- Good/win) after the Q post. The Trump tweet contained the words &quot;A good win&quot; (Auth_[2]- <strong>Good/win</strong>).  There are SEVERAL of these, not just one or two. Where a Q &quot;riddle&quot; is posted. and numbers/words corresponds with a trump tweet. Just to &quot;prove&quot; himself.</p>

<p>Sure, it could all be luck of the draw. it could all be BS. But its quite interesting. Take it with a grain of salt and enjoy the weaponized autism thats happening. thats my take on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it seems to be the timing stuff and pictures for most people, I guess because that’s about as strong as it gets with regard to evidence of Q being an insider.</p>

<p>Any specifics though for you? Was it the picture of the islands outside the airplane window from this post (excuse the link it was just one of the first results on google. Would very much prefer a direct link to the archive of the post if you have it):</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Thats one of them. Also one which i cant really find right now for some reason. But was connected to a childtrafficing EO trump signed and a <em>supposed</em> picture of the logo on the EO that Q supposedly dropped. A few hours before the president declared it. (Sigil and a WH pen was visable in the Q drop)</p>

<p>This is why i want to believe. I HOPE he&#39;s real. Because if so then my opinions are correct (which usually is, anything thats talked about by the mainsteam is up for interpretation.) and Trump might actually be one of the good guys (And thats the reason the Media is attacking him so viciously) If i am wrong, its been a good read and REALLY well done making so many people fall for it, and id totally want to paypal that guy/gal beer money.</p>

<p>Thats my take on it :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m just saying so far there’s a grand total of two posts supposedly proving he’s actually an insider. One of which you can’t find and the other which I had to find myself. Is this really enough?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, yes and no. Theres a sumtotal of 2 that we&#39;re discussing, theres over 600 threads with well over 300 posts in them, i could try and find the one i was talking about if you really want to see it but could take some time. (<a href="https://qcodefag.github.io/data/images/80138eb15a2f3a57ee1997264f5c10ca3d3e7b3b8c52afad602918b6782b487f.png">p.s, found the one.</a> it was posted dec 12th. and correcting the record that it was about <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-blocking-property-persons-involved-serious-human-rights-abuse-corruption/">corruption</a> and seizing assets, but that happened on dec 21st, so my mind might be tricking me, gotta check) Once agian, tiny picture, could mean nothing could mean insider</p>

<p>The other &quot;proof&quot; kinda links into current research. Which is &quot;no link, no talk&quot; right now. But It has to do with the forementioned timing drop. Which is both scary timing wise. You can find it if you try and venture out of reddit, but as i for one want to avoid poisoning the well by linking to it (Shits interesting! dont want people ruining my weekned soapoperas!) you have to take my word for it i presume (which isn&#39;t much, im just a stranger on the internet). But for every doubt theres some proof.</p>

<p>Its all for the eye of the beholder, One could argue <em>why</em> they would post information bits on the internet, and not a journalist instead, one could argue that it would be considered a national security risk as it could be abused by foreign powers, one could argue that its because of the efficency the darker side of the internet has to influence society (The &quot;OK&quot; sign, &quot;milk&quot;, &quot;He will not divide us&quot;).</p>

<p>Its all just speculation at this point until we know the final truth. It could all be a psyops to push the weaponized autism away from the actual problem to, sending us on wild goose chases.</p>

<p>We wont know everything until the truth comes out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh absolutely. It should be scrutinized. Even more so with the claims.</p>

<p>But look at it this way, if its a larp, its a damn good one. If you ever find the links to the stuff, think of it more like an episode of 24 or Jason bourne (brainfart and couldn&#39;t think of any other movies/series with the theme). Its a nice read with some really interesting reveals. Wait a few weeks and &#39;poop&#39; the stuff you just read is starting to fragment onto news articles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct.</p>

<p>A plausible scenario might be that there were some truly authentic posters (10/28 - 10/31) that unironically didn&#39;t even called themselves &quot;Q&quot; , then another poster(s) appeared on 11/1, labeled &quot;Q Clearance&quot; (probably some disinfo mixed in), then a &quot;tripcode Q&quot; showed up 9 days later, on 11/9, in CBTS #191.</p>

<p>The way I see it, MegaAnon first kinda fell for their tricks too, but then she detected some disinfo, too much disinfo actually, and she started commented on that. She openly called them out on <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/uid/YbwqecQl/order/asc/">Nov 25th</a>, and several times later, such as <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/151224729/#q151232059">on Nov 28th</a>.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you see how easy it is to use this bit of psychology against you, though? If I were trying to pull Q off as a LARP, I&#39;d certainly also want to push the narrative that it is just a LARP, just to convince people with your line of thought that it was legit. If the only reason you have to believe Q is legit is that there are many people saying he isn&#39;t, you don&#39;t really have a reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this! Am I correct in that this is the alleged proof that Q is really an insider?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you know he&#39;s real?</p>

<p>He has posted irrefutable evidence that he is who he says he is.</p>

<p>he predicted President Trump&#39;s Twitter being shutdown</p>

<p>he predicted the upheaval in Saudi Arabia</p>

<p>he predicted an incident with a helicopter at a Rothschild estate in the UK two days before it happened</p>

<p>He predicted a terrorist attack by a Bangladeshi national involving fireworks the day before it happened</p>

<p>he has posted original photographs taken from Air Force One. The timestamps and flight paths match the President&#39;s recent trip to Asia. One was actually taken while flying over North Korea.</p>

<p>He has posted key phrases that the President has used later on Twitter.</p>

<p>some of his phrases and terminology have been independently confirmed as belonging to military intelligence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m sorry to say but you are almost certainly being mislead, and I’m sorry to have to say that.</p>

<p>It’s a cold read, plain and simple. Q reacted because Trump tweeted, and then he said something that literally anyone who saw the tweet could have said. He didn’t make his post before Trump’s tweet, he didn’t even say it was North Korea. He just saw the tweet and said, “what’s out the window in this picture anons?”</p>

<p>That’s it, right? Am I misunderstanding something here? Did Q immediately post saying hey that’s North Korea? Did he post it before Trump’s tweet? Did he do anything that any random LARPer couldn’t have done?</p>

<p>I know you don’t want to link to the post here and that’s fine. How about a transcript though?</p>

<p>Although I will say it’s highly suspect that linking the posts is “prohibited”. Sounds like a great way to stave off criticism. How can someone cross-examine his claims if they aren’t allowed to see them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is NK not random? First of all, POTUS was presumably in SK for some kind of visit (honestly I don’t know but I’ll bet that’s the case), so the terrain outside the window is unsurprising.</p>

<p>Q didn’t say anything about NK in his post. He just asked what was outside the window. It was anons who discovered it was NK, and (presumably) only then did Q say anything about NK.</p>

<p>Or am I mistaken here? Judging by your persistence I feel like I must be. Why would you continue this if it is exactly as I say? Surely you’ve seen something that leads you to believe Q knew it was North Korea before anons told him where it was.</p>

 Mueller is literally running the most Corrupt FBI Bureau ever...and Jeff Sessions pathetic display at AG makes Eric Holder ( Fast and the Furious) and Loretta lynch look competent. Which is impossible as they were both corrupt as hell! </p>
