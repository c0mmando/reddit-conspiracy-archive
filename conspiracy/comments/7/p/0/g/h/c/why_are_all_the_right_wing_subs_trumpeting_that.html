       Antifa is a threat in the same way the alt-right and The_donald are a threat. Except antifa don't have members that have murdered innocents. Who are you people?

       Come on man, TD is a forum that encompasses all Reddit trump supporters, whereas antifa is literally formed with the goal to FIGHT against their "enemies."
      </p>
      <p>
       Just saying that there isn't really a right wing comparison to antifa. When Obama was in office, there weren't militant right wing groups "reeeeesistinng" in the streets

       I am calling bullshit on your source. SPLC is quite possibly the worst fucking source you could use as they mark literally anything Right Wing as a "terrorist group." So take your "surge" and fuck off. And the reason for the tag is to make sure I ignore any post you make in future. It's for me, not you. And I could give two shits about a counter-argument, you already lost said argument linking that garbage in the first place.

       "terrorist group"? Moving the goalposts are we?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not refute the actual counter? There's no right wing comparison to Antifa, that there's no groups on the right designated to fighting "their enemies"? Let's pick a few.
      </p>
      <p>
       States with several groups include: Texas (52 groups including American Patriots for Freedom Foundation, Central Texas Militia, Texas Well Regulated Militia); Michigan (47 including Northern Michigan Backyard Protection Militia); California (22 including State of California Unorganized Militia, Northern California State Militia, American Armenian Militia, Freedom Force International); Indiana (21 including Indiana Sedentary Militia, Indiana Citizens Volunteer Militia, 3rd Brigade); New York (17 including Empire State Militia); Oregon (14 including Oregon Militia Corps) and Kentucky (13 including Kentucky State Militia – Ohio Valley Command).
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you throwing your toys out of the stroller because you're failing to poison the well? Are you so angry because you feel silly about what you said and don't know how to counter like an adult?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, it's not like I'm pulling at threads here. There's
       <strong>
        literally
       </strong>
       over 500 examples of how you're wrong. How you lied. Why not pick a few and look at their manifestos. That
       <strong>
        they
       </strong>
       write, not the SPLC. Would you like me to pick a few for you or is that rubbing your nose in it?
      </p>
      <p>
       But sure, "fuck off", "you're a bullshitter" "garbage" and "you already lost" is a pretty cool way to admit that you're wrong too. You're a pretty stable genius and you really showed me.

And to back up your comparison you list a fucking source from SPLC, one of the most bias fucking advocacy groups in the country. And then you state this fucking gem -

       Jesus christ. I get it now. Your argument is that you're playing dumb and that you can't read. I'll admit, I can't debate someone who literally can't read what he's debating.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like me saying "Antifa is not a fucking subreddit and Reddit is not owned by the SPLC you dumb retard!". See? I can put random words that you typed into a sentence and argue against that too. It's fucking infuriating how you don't see how completely asinine this looks to everyone else. But that's probably the point right?
      </p>
      <p>
       So you're either that dumb or you're doing it deliberately. If its the former, do yourself a favour. Go back to the top, spend an hour going through each word. Then put them together into sentences. Then form your argument. Because I'm mortified for you. It's literally like arguing with a 2 year old. You'll come out a better man for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, take the last word. You might as well put a star atop this stunning display of your inability to read by doubling down. I'm done. I don't have the patience to literally teach some clown on Reddit how to read. Full blown anosognosia.

       weird how a left wing outlet prints fake news and the right wing is to blame for it. While the left wind outlet everyone is fine with.

       Everyone on the left is fine because they understand it wasn't literal... Let's make this simple. A left leaning outlet makes a remark in jest and it's audience understands. The right leaning outlets misinterpret it as literal.

       This is actually comedy. Stop tying to make this some kind of fake statement they did.It was a tweet from an NBC third party for goodness sake and it was apparent it wasn't some deep knowledge.

       I think I mostly agree, but I'm really not sure who the Dems could put up that would actually stand a chance against Trump. I genuinely believe that Trump will be favored against anyone the Dems could bring, and I think they are probably going to focus most of their efforts on winning in 2024.

       Uh, anyone? Trump won against the most hated candidate in the modern history of the Democratic Party. The GOP had spent the past 30 years assailing her and making her a scapegoat, exemplified in 2012 with Benghazi and 2015 with the email controversy. Trump was not some super candidate. Nobody in the Democratic Party even comes close to her unfavorability except some lower level person like Debbie Wassermann Schultz.

       Out of the serious prospects right now? Biden leads the pack. He has a strong economic message and is well liked. And no matter how many times the right brings up "creepy Joe touching women," between him and the POTUS, only Trump has been accused of sexual assault. He's old though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's Sanders who remains the most popular Senator in America based on both left and right pollsters. He performed better with Independents than Democrats in polling last year, so I'm not worried about him being painted as some Venezuelan socialist. He has a perception of honesty and conviction. I would be worried about turning out minorities though, and he's old.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally hope Jason Kander runs. He's young, politically active, and was an army vet. He ran well ahead of Clinton in Missouri last year. I'm not sure if he's ready to run yet though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't mentioned other candidates like Amy Klobuchar (not the most charismatic), Sherrod Brown, Joe Kennedy III, and Cory Booker (annoyed progressives last year for not voting for Sanders' bill).
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC didn't "run" Clinton, she was picked by Democratic voters. I'm sure there was bias for her, but she would have won regardless with strong support of African Americans and Hispanics. The problem is that Independents did not share the same love of her, which us primary Bernie Sanders supporters argued until we were blue in the face. :)

       Biden probably has the best shot, but Trump would still be favored as the incumbent, especially if his next 3 years are anything like his first. But I don't expect people who thought Hillary would easily beat Trump to agree with me on this.

       You said facts aren't opinions, very similar language was being used to say that Trump had no serious chance of winning.  So like you said, facts aren't opinions.  Fact, Trump won and fact, polls aren't facts.

       This conversation is about his approval polls. The fact is he has very low approval ratings. If you care to show me that he has high approval ratings, I’ll be waiting. This isn’t that hard of a concept to grasp.

       So why don't Trump supporters respond to these polls?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it be that they are sick and tired of the media and pollsters and scoopsters all taking polls with stupid loaded questions to get the answers they set out to get?  Or how about those tricky polls where they turn positive answers into a negative sentiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have all seen how shady these fucking people are, but then again it takes a certain level of intellect to understand that the only way to win is not to fucking play.

       This is a DNC talking point. Both Bill and Hillary have been making corrupt political deals for personal gain since they were still living in Arkansas. Putting Trump aside, you would have to be wildly partisan to not understand that Hillary Clinton has committed many serious crimes. I agree, she's wildly unpopular, but I disagree that this makes her some kind of victim. She earned her loss.

       I work with a bunch of ego-fed "leftists" at a company VERY similar in scope to Google.  Today, they can't stop talking about Winfrey-Johnson 2020, and are EXCITED ABOUT IT.  This is not a joke.  If this year has proven anything, it's that they will believe what they are told, and if they're told to vote for an Oprah-Rock ticket, they will, and shame anyone who doesn't.

       The people would be better served with a parliamentary republic where a ceremonial president signs pieces of paper and travels around the country doing ceremonial shit while a prime minister is physically in the capital and government departments all the time getting stuff done.

       Alternately the Swiss system with no president and rather a rotating chairperson in the federal cabinet is quite interesting.

       End of the day in a another system a dotard like Donald would be less dangerous and more manageable. Here we're left waiting for something 25th amendment weird to happen and bring events to a head.

       nice strawman, reddit shouldnt be used for any type of serious history discussions. You go to an actual library or wikipedia sources. The internet is so morally corrupt that you don't know if they will suddenly decide to call Franco a fascist one day and a liberal conservative the next.

       Wouldn't that literally be the "other side" the pro-nazi side?

       How the fuck can you try to view something from the other side while freaking out if anything is published that isn't lock step with the same old domestic propaganda?

       It's pretty obvious to anyone that watches that doc that it's over the top Nazi propaganda.  It's still interesting to view knowing that.

       It's fucking shameful.  And the obsession with Nazis coming from these graduates while preaching communist manifestos is hilarious.  A lot of it in my opinion is to blame on our society's failure to dissipate wartime propaganda and replace it with factual history.

       Yes, I have, as I was in a doctoral program. And I still read history books.
Nobody, no serious historian of WWII, would ever boil WWII down like that. It's completely stupid, and that's not the content of the body of work on the matter.  I don't believe you've ever read a serious WWII history book. Try

       I firmly believe that you're an arrogant piece of shit who is trying to force your opinion on people by first trying to shame them into not posting things, and second by your subtly mocking them with statements like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad you read books man, that doesn't mean that the books you read are anything but distilled nonsense based upon decades of propaganda.  If you're truly a student of history, especially the history of war then you know that for as long as men have been fighting with other men, it has been necessary to make those men hate each other by telling lies and exaggerating any actual instances of misdeeds.  To sit here and pretend like our society and our leader are any different is absurdly ridiculous.

       Any war time "history" should be examined and reexamined, it should be taken with a grain of salt because of the nature of man himself.  Its actually hilarious to look at how similar to our own, the anti-allies propaganda produced from Germany is.  Any sane person can see the writing on the wall there.
      </p>
      <p>
       regardless, the stupid "over the top" documentary about "Hitler did nothing wrong" is useful only as a tool to wake up retarded people to the fact that propaganda is REAL, not that Nazis were good.  You've missed the entire point of the exercise.
      </p>

       Unfortunately because of mini censors like yourself we have failed to learn this lesson as a society and because of that we continue to fall for the bullshit.  Like we did with weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, Unstable Ghadaffi, and hilariously now "Trump is literally Hitler" a psychopathic dictator hell bent on deporting all non-whites and starting a nuclear war.

       Oh yes, it was clearly recommended to recruit a fresh round of Nazis into the Hitler youth program.  As matter of fact, the Jewish run Stormfront website even had a Jewish author claiming to be a Nazi write an article demonstrating how
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       was a ripe recruiting grounds for the Hitler youth movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality, you have no idea why it was posted or why its recommended.
      </p>
      <p>
       People here just want a different take on such subjects.  They aren't looking to join Hitler youth.  In case you haven't heard, the 2nd world war is over, the Nazis were defeated and Hitler is dead.  There is literally zero risk of the 3rd Reich having a resurgence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the 4th Reich, that's a different story.  And the people writing the propaganda for the 4th Reich won't be calling themselves Nazis.  They will sneak up on you with a clever new cause and like the Germans who joined the Nazi party before WW2, You'll likely think its for the best and join yourself.

       she made a mildly political speech and the rapid right wingers needed a new nonexistent issue to be outraged about. it distracts them from the reality of their lame duck messiah. no one on the left expects or even wants Oprah to run for president. although even if they did it's the ultimate irony that the right wing movement would be up in arms about it considering they literally just put a celebrity in the white house and defend him like he's the second coming.

       Or even someone that’s not a celebrity. Like. At all. 
I’d like to see some academics find their way out of the ivory tower and implement some of the ideas and theories. Your research doesn’t mean jack if it’s buried in bureaucratic paper. Go make that six figure education mean something.

       Because the more sensational elements of the right media have jumped on the spite train for Hollywood elite (you know, because they spout left wing talking points). Is it not obvious? It's evidence that idiocracy was the most accurate depiction of the human race's future.

       Because the RNC doesn't want her and neither does the DNC. The question is: why doesn't the DNC.

       If both corporate owned parties don't want Oprah (who, let's be real, could possibly be a contender), who
       <em>

       doesn't want Oprah?

       The noise surrounding her non-candidacy is insane. Someone is trying-- hard--  to abort the idea.

       Disclaimer: I am not an Oprah fan and
       <em>
        if

       she chooses to announce a candidacy for something, it should be for local government where she can prove herself (or fail) before running for anything else.

       I'm not really religious.  I suppose I oscillate between atheist and deist, regardless I don't believe in revelation or organized religion.  I just don't see why you would be so rude about it.  I have an insanely hard time understanding how some very smart and rational people I know can seemingly spurn reason when it comes to their religion.  But I also notice that these religious people, for the most part, are disproportionately kinder, more moral, more charitable, and just overall better people than the non-religious.  Whether it's real or not, religion seems to have some very positive impacts on people.

       Sure but I know atheists who are racist too.  Religion doesn't seem to me to be an indicator of racism at all.  I grew up Catholic, our church had several different races and we had an African Priest for a while, which was pretty cool.  I could give you that the religious are more prone to homophobia, but definitely not racism.

       I work with a bunch of ego-fed "leftists" at a company VERY similar in scope to Google.  Today, they can't stop talking about Winfrey-Johnson 2020, and are EXCITED ABOUT IT.  This is not a joke.  If this year has proven anything, it's that they will believe what they are told, and if they're told to vote for an Oprah-Rock ticket, they will, and shame anyone who doesn't.

       Out of the serious prospects right now? Biden leads the pack. He has a strong economic message and is well liked. And no matter how many times the right brings up "creepy Joe touching women," between him and the POTUS, only Trump has been accused of sexual assault. He's old though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's Sanders who remains the most popular Senator in America based on both left and right pollsters. He performed better with Independents than Democrats in polling last year, so I'm not worried about him being painted as some Venezuelan socialist. He has a perception of honesty and conviction. I would be worried about turning out minorities though, and he's old.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally hope Jason Kander runs. He's young, politically active, and was an army vet. He ran well ahead of Clinton in Missouri last year. I'm not sure if he's ready to run yet though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't mentioned other candidates like Amy Klobuchar (not the most charismatic), Sherrod Brown, Joe Kennedy III, and Cory Booker (annoyed progressives last year for not voting for Sanders' bill).
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC didn't "run" Clinton, she was picked by Democratic voters. I'm sure there was bias for her, but she would have won regardless with strong support of African Americans and Hispanics. The problem is that Independents did not share the same love of her, which us primary Bernie Sanders supporters argued until we were blue in the face. :)
