    <div class="md"><p>Of course not.</p>

<p>This site loves freedom and rebellion but was almost universally opposed to the whole Bundy situation because they see it as just some gun nut rednecks vs the government. They only promote freedom and rebellion when it fits their narratives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of me hates to see this, because I think Bundy is guilty of hell (and of things he won&#39;t ever be tried for, like cruelty to the cattle he neglected and mistreated). </p>

<p>Ultimately, though, it&#39;s more important to hold prosecutors accountable. I hope there&#39;s a written opinion that clearly articulates what the prosecution withheld, and that this discourages future <em>Brady</em> violations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d argue it&#39;s equally important for a man guilty of neglecting and mistreating living beings (which honestly is what cattle ranching is in the first place. They are treated as commodities) to be found guilty and tried and punished for that as it is for prosecutors to have to do so while upholding justice and fairness for all.</p>

<p>Both are impacting lives and welfare of living, thinking, feeling beings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bundy is much crueler to his animals than a normal cattle rancher; his strategy of misusing public land let him run cattle on land that&#39;s too dry for that kind of use (at least, without investing money he didn&#39;t care to put into his animals). He basically let them run feral, unvaccinated and untreated for disease, and had to <em>trap</em> them when he wanted to gather them in. And I suppose he&#39;ll go right back to those practices--while in theory the court order seizing the cattle is unaffected by these developments, I doubt the government will try to enforce it now.</p>

<p>Having said that, <em>Brady</em> violations are much too common today. Letting one bad actor off the hook is definitely a problem--especially someone like Bundy, who will almost certainly reoffend and inspire other offenders--but it may be necessary for something like this to shock the system into taking <em>Brady</em> obligations seriously.</p>

<p>tl;dr: Damned if they do, damned if they don&#39;t. No good outcomes here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the institution of justice collapses, we are all dead.  I agree with you that the mistreatment of animals deserves equal punishment.  However, out of pure self-interest and in the hope that we can even HAVE a discussion about humane treatment of animals, the justice system must be held to the highest standard, and the greatest sanctions possible if they fail in their sacred duty.</p>

<p>And their duty is sacred, make no mistake.  The institution of justice is precious, and trust is easily lost.</p>

<p>But watching the whole Bundy vs. Ranchers thing just seemed silly to me, even though I know that is a very important topic right now for ranchers out West.  It literally felt like something you&#39;d see on South Park, where a large group of armed militia men demand the release of sacred cow&#39;s for Porterhouse and Del Monico prime beef.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m glad the courts recognized the coordinated gov play and rejected it.  i think, on the whole, that people don&#39;t engage the courts on subjects that really matter, and that if they did this we&#39;d see that the broken actors are much fewer than those ones who act with good faith.  the courts represent one of those systems that we just don&#39;t use as much as we should.  and we don&#39;t coordinate our support for those cases that could really make a difference.  so we&#39;re often enabling david vs goliath plays where we should be supporting the davids but instead we sit idly on the sidelines hoping that the underdog with few resources will prevail over those who have many resources.  this is, of course, bound to fail more than it succeeds.  but the fact that it does succeed on occasion gives us hope that the whole thing isn&#39;t broken.  this case exemplifies that dynamic.   </p>

<p>being passive and just complaining about when our heroes fail us doesn&#39;t work the system in the ways it was designed to work.  it&#39;s there for our benefit.  we need to force the issues on that platform as it&#39;s the ratchet of improvement that we have.  but we don&#39;t do this.  we let the brokenness overwhelm our collective action - and if we worked together the good side would win or at the very least show where we truly are broken.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope every one realized from the start this was a planned stupid operation put on with conservative money.  The hilarity comes from understanding that the billionaire backers of the Bundys actually hoped to kick off a violent series of acts against the U.S.Government.  </p>

<p>Based on their own view of, &#39;muricans,&quot; and the lies they promote about what being &#39;murican is. </p>

<p>It never had even a big toe based in reality, all myth and false beliefs and meant to manipulate the targets of decades of lies. </p>

<p>That comes from ideology driven blind insanity and their own believe in lies they tell. </p>
