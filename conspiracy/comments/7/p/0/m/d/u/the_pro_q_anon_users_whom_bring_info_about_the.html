    <div class="md"><p>I think a decent amount of people are tired of some giant Trump supporter on 4chan predicting the downfall of Clinton, Debbie, Huma Abedin, Obama, and Anderson Cooper every week and having people post about him every single day. He&#39;s been predicting the downfall of democrats for the past few months and the only things that have happened are 4 criminal indictments for Trumps team. </p>

<p>Somehow Q missed those predictions. But we get multiple people posting about him every single day as if he&#39;s some fuckin Yoda like psychic sitting in the clouds and handing out prophecies. It&#39;s annoying as hell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I can say is it takes a structured effort and time to take down any of the people you just mentioned.  I hope we agree that all said people (aside from Anderson) are connected in more ways than just the Democratic Party, and may still be indicted on some charge.  More alarming was Donna Brazile coming out with her accusations in her book dedicating it to Seth Rich.  It looked like her conscience caught up with her for a minute before she backed down (possibly threatened more like it).  So Clinton, Deb, Hum, BO, and other elites (Saudi Princes) are not people you can just arrest overnight, but will take time in bringing down.</p>

<p>With any perceived news coming from this hidden war being backed up with time stamped posts / tweets I&#39;d rather follow it than MSM.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been nearly three months of hype-nothing-hype cycles, again and again, day after day, and people are sick of it now.</p>

<p>So, <em>yes</em>, if you venture outside of the <a href="/r/CBTS_Stream">/r/CBTS_Stream</a> safe space, and you&#39;re pushing the Q or CBTS garbage, you&#39;re likely going to run into quite a headwind of people who have memories longer than a goldfish&#39;s, who recall how long we&#39;ve been dealing with this IMMINENT thing now.</p>

<p>I mean, back on December 26th CBTS_Stream found a few random planes allegedly flying somewhere toward Cuba, paired that up with a hoaxed flight-tracking &quot;map&quot; of Toronto&#39;s airport showing an &quot;SOS&quot; drawn by ground traffic signals, and some vague-as-ever Q koans...and determined that PM Justin Trudeau among others were imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay...somehow. Here&#39;s a <em>moderator</em> of that subreddit, for goodness sake:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/JyhjJim.png">https://i.imgur.com/JyhjJim.png</a></p>

<p>I know some people don&#39;t like the &quot;LARP&quot; accusation. But that is exactly what fits the method and means of the &quot;leaders&quot; of the CBTS narrative. </p>

<p>They make claims, get people hyped to spread those claims around, then they pretend they didn&#39;t make the claims. They promise things, get people hyped about the IMMINENT RESULTS, and then instead of a few days it becomes a few weeks, if they bother dealing with the fruitless promise at all. </p>

<p>In the end they&#39;re going to just play the &quot;well, of COURSE we were trolling, who thought differently?!&quot; card, but it&#39;s clear a LOT of people don&#39;t get the joke right now. They are leading a role-playing game that goes hour-by-hour in terms of its basis, its &quot;evidence&quot;, and its &quot;truth&quot;...and they want to recruit other &quot;players&quot; and keep it going because they think it&#39;s funny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, patriots in full control and the like; just listen to Q, play with Q&#39;s code, spread Q&#39;s message, don&#39;t burden your little mind with anything more than that.</p>

<p>Moreover it&#39;s a way to focus people the same way, so if/when it gets to crunchtime they&#39;ve got a backdoor into the minds of trump&#39;s supporters. If things get really crazy, like upside down cars on fire crazy, having a bunch of trump fans on the hook could make all the difference. &#39;New Q-blast, all true patriots open fire on the police&#39;, as a facile example.</p>

A few times I&#39;ve even seen reminders to the board to be careful not to fall to Q worship.

    <div class="md"><p>But Q is a source. Q is <em>the</em> source, and if you take them at face value it becomes an all-or-nothing thing, it&#39;s irreducible. Either you believe they are who they say they are or you don&#39;t, that&#39;s the whole issue.</p>

<p>What you have to remember is how much of Q&#39;s narrative exists without Q. The foundation was already there when he arrived, laid out by various other anons also claiming to be insiders. The saudi connection, the indictments, the booby-traped russia probe, U1 and Fusion etc. All already there. All Q added to the mix was the retarded &#39;[G]old Eagle 5_ReD follow the mapkey&#39; crypto bullshit and all the tedious e-drama like e.g. this very thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean all or nothing in the sense that the only difference between &#39;pro Q&#39; and &#39;anti Q&#39; is whether or not you believe Q is legit, ie to be taken at face value. People who think it&#39;s a marketing campaign, people who think it&#39;s a psyop, people who think it&#39;s a larp - people who think it&#39;s <em>anything other than what it professes itself to be</em> - all get put in one camp, the anti-q camp.</p>

<p>Of the things Q says about what&#39;s going on, the plots and deals and ankle monitors and the rest, sure I keep my mind open. But I can safely eject Q and still do that, because as I said, the only parts of the story that are exclusive to Q are the retarded ones, with the movie references and the h[ID]den messag[E] [S]hi[T] and the &#39;engage ghost circuits&#39; hackerman nonsense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My issue with Q is the &quot;Well this confirms everything&quot; posts that don&#39;t actually confirm anything. Yesterday it was Q posting about a couple of Trump tweets after the fact that &quot;confirmed&quot; he was real, a Trump typo &quot;confirming&quot; he was real, and Wikileaks adding a couple of Qs to a pdf &quot;confirming&quot; he was real. </p>

<p>Cui Bono? Trump has shown no reservations about throwing around accusations, so why would he support a vague release of information that would benefit him when he could just toss it out? How does any of this support his efforts?</p>

<p>Also, Q has changed significantly since the original posts, but people ignore that. It started as predictions (most of which were pretty basic), but when none of the specific ones came true it shifted to these weird open ended questions. </p>

<p>Before, users would post the latest Q Anon posts here in r/conspiracy with discussion for the most part being open.

<p>The term you&#39;re looking for is alternate reality game. Check it: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game</a></p>

<p>I think that&#39;s a reasonable assessment. There could be a lot more interactive game elements though. They could be putting stuff out in the real world and encouraging anons to go find it. Then those anons would become unwitting agents for the &quot;game&quot; they don&#39;t even know is being played. </p>

<p>Also, I think it&#39;s kind of funny that certain people keep yelling &quot;larp&quot; when that word makes no sense at all whatsoever, and they could instead be comparing Q anon to ARGs and actually have a chance of being right. </p>

<p>When individuals are flooding the subreddit on Q, in this manner, It&#39;s a psyop. 4chan and r/conspiracy have become so good at identifying smoke and mirrors that they are setting false trails. There is no reason for Q to be so ambiguous. Majority of his predictions are false.</p>

<p>The coordinated trolls might not know any more about this than you and I. They might have been given vague instructions to disrupt communities like this one, and one way of doing that is to be directly contrarian to things the community is interested in. They might not give a shit one way or the other about some anonymous on 8chan, but if the community appears to, then they&#39;re going to troll anyone who does just to be disruptive. Not necessarily because they know he&#39;s an insider and are trying to censor good information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has been rampant ever since the primaries of the election, and it&#39;s slowly getting worse. Basically, this thread is not for discussing conspiracies anymore and supporting each other in our research. It&#39;s now a sub for propaganda, shilling, and division.</p>

<p>I&#39;m politically a moderate. I accept theories from any angle, even if it goes against my political leanings. If this sub were true to it&#39;s intended purpose, there would be no such thing as downvotes, there should only be upvotes or no votes ( The only downvotes should be for posts that are obviously shilling, attacking a group of people personally, or a post that has nothing to do with conspiracies)</p>

<p>Conspiracy theories/theorists are just people that question things. We think outside of the box. Downvotes in this sub are extremely contradictory. I say this because people who subscribe to this sub should be people who are skeptics. They question the official narrative and always try to read deeper into things. The fact that there are downvote brigades against a post with a legitimate theory questioning something shows that many of us are not true conspiracy theorists. </p>

<p>Many people in here now are just shills or they refuse to accept any theory that goes against their beliefs (which itself is a contradiction, because true conspiracy theorists actually believe very few things, they rarely accept anything as true).</p>

<p>I believe that there are possible conspiracies on all sides of the political spectrum despite the fact that I might support one side or the other,or even a little of both.</p>

In this sub where open discussion is <em>usually</em> welcomed, when the topic is over Q Anon, some non-believers lose their minds over it.

    <div class="md"><p>All I can say is it takes a structured effort and time to take down any of the people you just mentioned.  I hope we agree that all said people (aside from Anderson) are connected in more ways than just the Democratic Party, and may still be indicted on some charge.  More alarming was Donna Brazile coming out with her accusations in her book dedicating it to Seth Rich.  It looked like her conscience caught up with her for a minute before she backed down (possibly threatened more like it).  So Clinton, Deb, Hum, BO, and other elites (Saudi Princes) are not people you can just arrest overnight, but will take time in bringing down.</p>

<p>With any perceived news coming from this hidden war being backed up with time stamped posts / tweets I&#39;d rather follow it than MSM.</p>
