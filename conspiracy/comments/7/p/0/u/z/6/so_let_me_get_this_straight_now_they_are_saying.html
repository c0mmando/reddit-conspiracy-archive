    <div class="md"><p>I realize the link is from Quora but the article is written by Gil Troy, American Historian who wrote &quot;The Age of Clinton: America in the 1990s&quot;</p>

<p>In addition to stealing things, the Clinton Admin caused over $13,000 in damages as well.</p>

<p>Politifact calls all of this &quot;Mostly false&quot; but their post is from when Hillary was running for office so they were working to cover up all of her past criminal actions and there is a bunch of these scandals that Snopes and Politifact straight up lied about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In damage control mode, the Clintons would write checks totaling $85,966 to purchase the gifts, while returning $28,000 worth of furniture to the White House. Still, the last-minute pardons, the gift-grabbing, and word that George W. Bush’s people moved into White House offices with obscene messages and computer keyboards missing the “W” key, fed one final moral panic. </p>

<p>After they were criticized for taking $190,000 worth of china, flatware, rugs, televisions, sofas and other gifts with them when they left, the Clintons announced last week that they would pay for $86,000 worth of gifts, or nearly half the amount.</p>

<p>Their latest decision to send back $28,000 in gifts brings to $114,000 the value of items the Clintons have either decided to pay for or return.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a HUGE difference between a hearing and an investigation but... what did we learn from the hearing?</p>

<p>We learned that Hillary Clinton has ZERO problem lying to the American people, while telling the truth to foreign leaders and her own family members.</p>

<p>What else? We learned that she was completely negligent in her duties as Secretary of State.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>yet conveniently ignored the fact that when they asked for more funding for more security that request went ignored/denied</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No lol. Just no. More security was requested by the people on the ground. This went unheeded by the Secretary of State not congress. As SoS she had the authority to increase security at a diplomatic outpost without consultation with anyone else. She DID NOT request more security. Why would you even suggest that? Are you able to link to any proof of this at all? No you aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>People like you keep citing Benghazi as the litmus test for her fuckery. There are far more grievous acts this woman has committed.</p>

<p>Again though... you don&#39;t think she is an innocent lamb but she is still the victim of a smear campaign for the last 25 years?</p>

<p>Make up your mind.</p>

<p>Her use of a private fucking server (in her own personal dwelling no less) for government use is insanity.</p>

<p>Her unilateral decision to withhold emails of a &quot;personal nature&quot; is also criminal. Destruction of said emails and destruction of DoD property that was under subpoena is also a criminal offence.</p>

<p>This woman is a fucking criminal.</p>

<p>When she is truly investigated and held to account for her crimes the USA will have a chance to move forward. Not until then.</p>

<p>Based on the reactions to the last presidential vote,  the night of,  the day and weeks after,  it seems to me that Hillary was so unpopular that she under estimated by how much she would have to rig it,   and Trump was more popular than realized,  and so his team had not needed to rig it as far as they had been able to.</p>

How can 65 million refugees and 20 trillion in debt for wasteful junk be a good idea?    Wouldn&#39;t it be better just to suck it up that the petro dollar is going to end?</p>

<p>The DNC fucked over half of their base. Stole over $200 million dollars from Bernie supporters who had no idea that he was NEVER going to win and then told them to shut up and stop being ridiculous. That isn&#39;t just going to go away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you&#39;re cherry picking a piece of what Reagan did to agree with.</p>

<p>Reagan was President in the 1980&#39;s. He did what he had to and got the economy out from under the weight of a loser named Carter. (And another one named Ford.)   </p>

<p>This President had a different situation - which was to end the job killing policies of a different loser President and re-ignite investment in American industry.  </p>

<p>To do that requires bringing money that was outside the country back in and provide the money holders with incentive enough to invest. so that we can fire back up manufacturing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said as much in another comment here. This is tied to the &quot;conspiracy&quot; that the MSM is now trying to float that Trump is insane. Mentally incompetent. He has his finger on the trigger and if we don&#39;t commit him, he&#39;s going to kill us all.</p>

<p>There is zero evidence for this but IF it is the case that he&#39;s mentally ill then that means he still managed to beat all of the other Republicans and then beat &quot;the most qualified candidate to ever run for President ~ Obama&quot; to become President.</p>

<p>side note: Remember when the rumor was that Hillary Clinton was suffering from Parkinson&#39;s or worse and it was absolutely taboo to report on it. Dr. Drew lost his show when he reported that she may be ill. Yet, here we have every single channel that refused to report her sickness, blasting that Trump is mentally ill and should be deposed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It came down to Wikileaks vs a failed Insurance Policy that the DNC had hired from the goons at Fusion GPS.   </p>

<p>There were stories of Trumps pee party in a Russian hotel,  that if true, would have ended him.    Along with innuendo of course that he was a Manchurian candidate backed by nefarious Putin.   Unfortunately for Hillary and the DNC,  they couldn&#39;t get this Insurance Policy to stick enough that it could have any effect before the election.    In the meantime,   Comey was trying to save his own butt,  and the Wikileaks material on Hillary and her fatally compromised campaign,  and probably her assurances of rigging the vote,  failed her,  to the most amazing election night in memory!!!    Not even Trump thought he could win,   and Obama and Hillary were absolutely positive their criminal regime would continue and they would be able to deliver on all the pay to play promises they had delivered to their owners.     Owners like Saudi Arabia and Qatar,   who were banking on new oil and gas sales to Europe that are now going to Putin.   Oh the irony!    And of course,  now we know,   it caused not only a deep state war here in the US,   but mayhem in Qatar and Saudi,   total upheaval.    Also,  Turkey,  part of NATO in name only now,   surrounded by Lebanon,  Syria,  Iraq, Iran,  they have been in the center of a neighborhood where the US has been totally exposed as buffoons who set up their own radical Islamist armies and had to escort them off to Libya to save them from extinction.   Yeah,   Hillary,  the ultimate embarrassment.    No wonder Trump has to be shown by the media eating cheeseburgers in bed in his underwear.   Diversion has never been more necessary.</p>

<p>And Americans need that diversion desperately.    Lest we be reminded that we have funded the greatest genocide,  war crimes,  and refugee crisis since WWII with our own inheritance,  and are about to be flushed down the toilet of history as a failed empire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly the definition above disagrees with you,  but hey,  it doesn&#39;t really matter what we call it.    Most people call it collateral damage.    Lots of people call it justifiable.    We are still very tribal,  but our weapons result in mass casualties,   and more innocent die than others.    Tracking the dead from military conflicts over time shows that its impossible to distinguish between ethnic cleansing or racial or religious purges and the economic and territorial factors.    Remember when people said the wars in the Middle east were because of religion?    So,  what&#39;s your real point,  purely semantic,  or do you have a view of history that clarifies what is going on?    Might makes right?

    <div class="md"><p>She was probably not as good as everybody thought, didn&#39;t campaign in places she took for granted. On the other hand, her campaign was much better organized than Trummp&#39;s. Everyone who knew anything, both Republican and Democrat- including Trump and his people, expected her to win. She did get 3 million more votes than he did, just not in the right places. Trump&#39;s win was a fluke of the Electoral College, a few thousand extra votes here and there where it counted. Maybe it was genius on somebody&#39;s part, but there was no one who wasn&#39;t stunned and incredulous that night. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I don&#39;t get is this: </p>

<p>The MSM claims DT is incompetent, delusional, a nim-wit and someone who can&#39;t handle the office of presidency. </p>

<p>One of the (larger) claims is that he doesn&#39;t go the oval office until 11am, and from 8-11am he watches TV (the news...aka the MSM).  This to them (MSM) shows the lack of ability to hold the office if presidency. </p>

<p>So the MSM is telling us that Trump is unworthy because of how much time he spends watching the news, and how obsessed he is with it. Are we to believe that watching the news is a waste of time?  Are they saying that what the produce is not worthy of the Presidents time? </p>

<p>Interesting times  </p>

<p>Reagan was President in the 1980&#39;s. He did what he had to and got the economy out from under the weight of a loser named Carter. (And another one named Ford.)   </p>

<p>This President had a different situation - which was to end the job killing policies of a different loser President and re-ignite investment in American industry.  </p>

<p>To do that requires bringing money that was outside the country back in and provide the money holders with incentive enough to invest. so that we can fire back up manufacturing.  </p>
