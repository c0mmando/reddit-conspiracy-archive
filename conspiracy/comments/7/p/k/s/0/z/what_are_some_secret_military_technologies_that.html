<p>Depends what you mean by figured out. I have a friend who works in fusion research, and from what he&#39;s said a long-running fusion reaction is easy, relatively speaking, but being able to extract useful power from it is probably decades away at best. The military being ahead I can buy, but being that far ahead seems like a bit of a stretch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A 1987 patented invention called &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US4686605">Method and apparatus for altering a region in the earth&#39;s atmosphere, ionosphere, and/or magnetosphere</a>&quot; proves that <strong>certain powers-that-be have the ability to wipe out or scramble all of the world&#39;s communication systems while maintaining their own communication network</strong>, as well as the <strong>ability to modify the weather by altering wind patterns and by focusing sunlight on targeted parts of the Earth</strong>, using &quot;plumes of atmospheric particles&quot; acting &quot;as a lens or focusing device&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;...<strong>a plume of altered plasma can be established at selected locations for communication modification or other purposes</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The plasma of the typical example might be employed to modify or disrupt microwave transmissions of satellites. </p>

<p>&quot;If less than <em>total black-out of transmission</em> is desired (e.g., scrambling by phase shifting digital signals), the density of the plasma (Ne) need only be at least about 106 per cubic centimeter for a plasma orginating [sic] at an altitude of from about 250 to about 400 km and accordingly less energy (i.e., <em>electromagnetic radiation</em>), e.g., 108 joules need be provided. </p>

<p>&quot;Likewise, if the density Ne is on the order of 108, <strong>a properly positioned plume</strong> will provide a reflecting surface for VHF [very high frequency] waves and <strong>can be used to enhance, interfere with, or otherwise modify communication transmissions</strong>. </p>

<p>&quot;It can be seen from the foregoing that by appropriate application of various aspects of this invention at strategic locations and with adequate power sources, a means and method is provided to <strong>cause interference with or even total disruption of communications over a very large portion of the earth</strong>.</p>

<p>&quot;This invention could be employed to disrupt not only <strong>land</strong> based communications, both <strong>civilian</strong> and <strong>military</strong>, but also <strong>airborne</strong> communications and <strong>sea</strong> communications (both <strong>surface</strong> and <strong>subsurface</strong>). This would have <strong>significant military implications</strong>, particularly as a barrier to or confusing factor for hostile missiles or airplanes. </p>

<p>&quot;The <strong>belt or belts of enhanced ionization</strong> produced by the method and apparatus of this invention, <em>particularly if set up over Northern Alaska and Canada</em> [HAARP, anyone?], could be employed as an early warning device, as well as a <strong>communications disruption medium</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;... in Alaska, the right type of fuel (natural gas) is naturally present in large amounts and at just the right magnetic latitudes for the most efficient practice of this invention, a truly unique combination of circumstances.&quot;</p>

<p>[This is why HAARP (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program), established in 1993, is located in Gakona, Alaska...]</p>

<p>&quot;...this invention provides the ability to put <em>unprecedented</em> amounts of power in the earth&#39;s atmosphere at strategic locations and to <em>maintain</em> the power injection level, particularly if random pulsing is employed, in a manner <em>far more precise and better controlled than heretofore accomplished by the prior art</em>, particularly by the <strong>detonation of nuclear devices</strong> of various yeilds [sic] at various altitudes. </p>

<p>&quot;Where the prior art approaches yielded merely transitory effects, the unique combination of fuel and desirable field lines at the point where the fuel occurs allows the establishment of, compared to prior art approaches, <strong>precisely controlled</strong> and <strong>long-lasting effects</strong> which <strong>cannot</strong>, practically speaking, <strong>simply be waited out</strong>. </p>

<p>&quot;Further, by knowing the frequencies of the various electromagnetic beams employed in the practice of this invention, <strong>it is possible</strong> not only <strong>to interfere with third party communications</strong> but to take advantage of one or more such beams <strong>to carry out a communications network even though <em>the rest of the world&#39;s</em> communications are disrupted</strong>. Put another way, <strong>what is used to disrupt another&#39;s communications can be employed by one knowledgeable of this invention as a communications network at the same time.</strong> </p>

<p>&quot;In addition, once one&#39;s own communication network is established, the <em>far-reaching extent of the effects of this invention</em> could be employed to pick up communication signals of other [sic] for intelligence purposes. Thus, it can be seen that the disrupting effects achievable by this invention can be employed to benefit by the party who is practicing this invention since knowledge of the various electromagnetic waves being employed and how they will vary in frequency and magnitude can be used to an advantage for positive communication and <em>eavesdropping</em> purposes at the same time. </p>

<p>&quot;However, this invention is not limited to locations where the fuel source naturally exists or where desirable field lines naturally intersect the earth&#39;s surface. For example, fuel, particularly hydrocarbon fuel, can be transported <strong>by pipeline</strong> and the like to the location where the invention is to be practiced.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This invention has a phenomenal variety of possible ramifications and potential future developments.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>Weather modification</strong> is possible by, for example, <strong>altering upper atmosphere wind patterns</strong> or <strong>altering solar absorption patterns</strong> by constructing one or more <strong>plumes of atmospheric particles which will act as a lens or focusing device</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A moving plume could also serve as a means for supplying a space station or <strong>for focusing vast amount of sunlight on selected portions of the earth.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Face of Allah Weapon Returns&quot;, Wired, <strong>May 2008</strong>: <a href="http://archive.is/ftWXN">http://archive.is/ftWXN</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[...] projecting the image of something frightening ‚Äì like a deity ‚Äì is not a new idea and follows in the footsteps of the <strong>Voice of God weapon</strong>, a device that some have suggested could be used to transmit messages into people&#39;s head, as if God were speaking to them.</p>

<p>&quot;Nor is the <strong>God hologram</strong> really a new idea, though it&#39;s interesting to see it&#39;s still bandied about; military analyst Bill Akin wrote about this concept back in 1999, which described it as holographic image of Allah.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;When Seeing and Hearing Isn&#39;t Believing&quot;, Washington Post, <strong>Feb. 1999</strong>: <a href="http://archive.is/ALqxP">http://archive.is/ALqxP</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;For Hollywood, it is special effects. For covert operators in the U.S. military and intelligence agencies, it is a weapon of the future.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pentagon planners started to discuss <strong>digital morphing</strong> after Iraq&#39;s invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Covert operators kicked around the idea of creating a <strong>computer-faked videotape</strong> of Saddam Hussein crying or showing other such manly weaknesses, or in some sexually compromising situation. The nascent plan was for the tapes to be flooded into Iraq and the Arab world.</p>

<p>&quot;The tape war never proceeded, killed, participants say, by bureaucratic fights over jurisdiction, skepticism over the technology, and concerns raised by Arab coalition partners.</p>

<p>&quot;But the &#39;strategic&#39; PSYOPS scheming didn&#39;t die. <strong>What if the U.S. projected a holographic image of Allah floating over Baghdad urging the Iraqi people and Army to rise up against Saddam</strong>, a senior Air Force officer asked in 1990?</p>

<p>&quot;According to a military physicist given the task of looking into the hologram idea, <strong>the feasibility had been established of projecting large, three-dimensional objects that appeared to float in the air.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;But doing so over the skies of Iraq? To project such a hologram over Baghdad on the order of several hundred feet, they calculated, <strong>would take a mirror</strong> more than a mile square in space, as well as huge projectors and power sources.</p>

<p>&quot;And besides, investigators came back, what does Allah look like?</p>

<p>&quot;The Gulf War hologram story might be dismissed were it not the case that washingtonpost.com has learned that a super secret program was established in 1994 to pursue the very technology for PSYOPS application. <strong>The &#39;Holographic Projector&#39; is described in a classified Air Force document as a system to &#39;project information power from space ... for special operations deception missions.&#39;</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>It would take a massive mirror in space to do this? </p>

<p>&quot;In much the way a schoolchild playing with a hand mirror learns to reflect a spot of light from a bright window into the crannies of his room, <strong>some scientists believe they can put large, orbiting mirrors above Earth that could illuminate darkened areas below with spots of reflected sunlight that measure tens of miles across.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fighting global warming by <strong>reflecting sunlight back into space</strong> risks &#39;terrifying&#39; consequences including droughts and conflicts, according to three major new analyses of the promise and perils of geoengineering.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Is It O.K. to Tinker With the Environment to Fight Climate Change?&quot;, The New York Times, <strong>April 2017</strong>: <a href="http://archive.is/I89Lr">http://archive.is/I89Lr</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A planet cooled by an umbrella of <strong>aerosol particles</strong> ‚Äî an umbrella that works by <strong>reflecting back into space</strong>, say, 1 percent of <strong>the sun‚Äôs incoming energy</strong> ‚Äî might give societies less incentive to adopt greener technologies and radically cut carbon emissions.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As already explained in my original comment, the technology <em>already exists</em> to create a &quot;lens&quot; in the upper atmosphere using plumes of particles.</p>

<p>&quot;Method and apparatus for altering a region in the earth&#39;s atmosphere, ionosphere, and/or magnetosphere&quot;, Google Patents, published <strong>Aug. 1987</strong>: <a href="http://archive.is/HiB01">http://archive.is/HiB01</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Weather modification is possible by, for example, altering upper atmosphere wind patterns or altering solar absorption patterns by constructing one or more <strong>plumes of atmospheric particles</strong> which will <strong>act as a lens</strong> or focusing device.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;[...] <strong>a properly positioned plume will provide a reflecting surface</strong> for VHF [very high frequency] waves and can be used to enhance, interfere with, or otherwise modify communication transmissions.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In summary</strong>, whether using actual mirrors, aluminum-coated plastic film, or particles in the upper atmosphere, it is possible that <strong>three-dimensional, holographic images could be displayed on Earth using these reflective devices.</strong> The fact of the matter is that the means to carry out such an operation are being explored, and considering the time that has passed since these ideas were first discussed in newspapers, it seems likely that such technology is already completed or being refined and tested to be used to deceive the masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a physics teacher in high school that used to work for DARPA. Said he was part of a weapons project that could shoot charged particles up into the air and force a lightning strike anywhere in the world , without clouds. It was discontinued however because the area of the lightning strike was one square mile, and they couldn‚Äôt narrow it down further. It was envisioned as an assassination tool but its useless if the strike area was a square mile.</p>

<p>That project was 40+ years ago. I can‚Äôt imagine what they have now </p>
