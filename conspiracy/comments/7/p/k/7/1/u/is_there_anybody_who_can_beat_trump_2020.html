       How is that a conspiracy? It seems obvious that in a sub about Donald Trump, negative posts about him wouldn't be tolerated. Hardly constitutes being a conspiracy.

       Bernie Sanders. Would bring out the base who stayed home in 2016. And he would get more independents.  Even a lot of republicans like Bernie Sanders.

       I do, at least personally. I know 3 people who voted for Trump and have voted Rep all their lives who said if it was Trump and Bernie they go Bernie based on honesty and personality alone. Americans really aren't as "set" in their political ways as the MSM would have you believe.

       No need to be a smart butt about it. I'm don't care if you agree with me or not. Bernie did not earn a steady paycheck until the age of 40. And everyone knows he holds socialist views, that is not a secret.

       People love the appearance of honesty, its why they voted for Trump. People are desperate for anyone who doesnt have the same perfect grooming and political cadence most politicians speak with. They like the idea of a radical, whether or not they agree with the direction they would take the country.

       People care a lot about honesty. Even my father, a die hard Conservative who would never vote for Bernie, admits he is an honest and good man. He just hates his politics. This country is in so much trouble that people are looking for radical change...that's why Trump won in the first place.

       He was editor/contributor of political journals in the state of Vermont, practiced Carpentry to provide for himself, and was active politically from a very young age. He was literally arrested by the Chicago Police back in '63 for trying to desegregate the University of Chicago student housing. He's not a bum- he's been active in politics his whole life. And his career as Mayor of Burlington was stellar- creating public spaces in parks and on the waterfront that are still maintained today, while fighting against a Dem and Rep alliance
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       him. He founded his own City-wide political party still active in Burlington to this day, that campaigned against the D/R City Council blocking his initiatives,
       <em>
        won
       </em>
       and allowed him to actually
       <em>
        govern
       </em>
       the city. The man aint a bum lol.

       What happened to the capitalist ideal of a man who has held many jobs in varied professions? A varied skillset. I’ve had probably six jobs. It isn’t unusual in the slightest.

       Yes, it did seem a bit harsh. But all the articles I found were like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you have to look at his age and the time period. I'm 49 and had my first steady job at age 18. He is older than I am and just seemed to be "wandering aimlessly" for a while.

       If you couldn’t find any positive articles about Sanders you probably weren’t looking too hard...
      </p>
      <p>
       What’s your definition of a “steady job”? A year? Two? Three? I can’t find actual years that he held any of those jobs. But, considering his involvement in so many political organizations and publications the conceit that he was wandering aimlessly or being a bum is bunk.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was working on things that mattered to him, always; trying to find a vector for his beliefs to be made reality. That’s the American dream, isn’t it?

       It's a different social contract than here. If you don't like it you can leave. Kind of like most countries. You also pay taxes here. That enrages you? If you don't like it, you should probably learn to grow some crops and go live in the woods somewhere.

       Ah, the mythical "social contract". Did that person ever agree to the contract, or where they forced upon by being born there? I never voluntarily signed a contract with the government.

       In most (if not all) cases,
       <em>
        you are taxed to leave

       (ie. you have to pay to leave). So, if the person cannot afford to leave, but wants to, that means they are being held against their will, no?

       In mid-November you'll see that basically ANYONE could beat Trump in 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I have no great predictions on the Democrats taking the House or the Senate. Virginia's results were, perhaps, and outlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the large-scale races conducted so far (New Jersey and Virginia), and even in the "unsuccessful" special elections, the swings toward the Dems we've seen have been enough to tell me that Trump is the great GOTV golem for the Democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       He lost the popular vote, and won the electoral college with 78,000 votes (
       <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/the-election-came-down-to-77744-votes-in-pennsylvania-wisconsin-and-michigan-updated/article/2005323">
        source
       </a>
       ). He doesn't have those votes today, his polling has gone drastically down since November 2016 in these demographics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question really is: who among the Democrats COULDN'T beat Trump in 2020? It's a small group. This is just something that will be proven mid-November 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump really had two terms sewn up. But then he went with an anti-populist corporate Paul Ryan platform, sold his voters out, and did so in a way that all the tweets in the world can't disguise. I don't know if it was planned, or just laziness. But he had SUCH a huge window to change things...and then instead of great healthcare, nothing. Instead of a tax reform for the working class, we got whatever complicated mess for the rich that we were served.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump could still turn it around. But he's wedded to Paul Ryan's platform, and he won't let go.

       I actually wouldn't be surprised if in the future after Trump is blamed for a massive influx of Democrats into Congress and a sweeping White House victory for a democrat in 2020, that Trump turns around and says that was his plan all along and reverts back to being a democrat. That way, he'd get to save face with all of the elite people he previously hobnobbed with, and the media would quickly reframe him as a lovable buffoon. He'd be remembered that way instead of as a sad, insecure man who destroyed the party who elected him to office while simultaneously ostracizing everyone from the party he previously supported.

       Biden is the early favorite the way every early favorite is...that is to say: doomed to failure. He's simply not going to be able to speak to voters in any sense worth bothering with. He is compromised, and is buoyed only by name recognition and a speaking style that wears thin really quick.
      </p>

       I hope Sherrod Brown or Ron Wyden can mount a good campaign, myself. Maybe they won't win, but they'd be a good voice in the conversation on the Left side, at long last. Sanders has the best shot, of course, and that would be interesting. But that's pending his health and his wife's issues at the moment.

       Sherrod Brown is a Corporate sell out who refuses to back Medicare For All. He won't do a goddamn thing. We need a real Progressive Populist like Bernie or Trump still wins, and even if he loses nothing changes and the Republic continues its careening path towards destruction in the hands of the Corporatists.

       Sanders would still be my choice for a game-changer...he just needs to prove himself more interested in the results (electoral or policy) than the process, or I'll continue to think that he's not running to win and lead...that it's still just a protest run.

       Lol Bernie is all about results. Do you know about Our Revolution? Founded in the wake of his campaign it has taken 8 State Parties from the Corporatists, organizing at the grassroots level. He's helping purge the party of the DINO's and return it to its New Deal roots.

       I don't give a fuck who the nominee is, if they refuse to support Medicare For All or at least a Medicare buy-in Public Option, as well as Universal College funding, they
       <em>
        wont
       </em>
       have my vote. Because they aren't interested in change at the moment when the Republic needs it the most. The difference between a Corporate Dem and Trump is one of process. The Corporate Dems will loot this country under the table, at least Trumps bullshit is blatant.

       My belief is that ANY Democrat who wins the 2020 nomination process will commit 100% to Medicare-for-all. It's not only the right thing to do, given our current fucked up system, it will be an electoral necessity. The vague promises of "great healthcare" are over. Voters will need an actual plan.

       They may commit, but I'm going to be looking at their past votes and speeches, and their donors, before I decide if they're being honest. Just claiming something isn't enough anymore. Obama said Public Option was his plan, and traded it away in Committee. Enough is enough- whoever wins better have the voting record to back it up, and better not have massive donations from the Pharmaceutical and Insurance industry.

       (This is why I trust Ron Paul, even though I don't agree with him politically, more than most any politician. He's not bullshitting me, I know where he stands, he's taken a lot of crap for it and still stood up for it, and so I know what he'd actually do. That's a better option than most options...Sanders is the same deal. It's unfortunate that we were never given a Paul vs. Sanders race -- or a Sanders/Paul or Paul/Sanders ticket, haha -- we might have actually figured some things out as a country.)

       If you couldn’t find any positive articles about Sanders you probably weren’t looking too hard...

       What’s your definition of a “steady job”? A year? Two? Three? I can’t find actual years that he held any of those jobs. But, considering his involvement in so many political organizations and publications the conceit that he was wandering aimlessly or being a bum is bunk.

       He was working on things that mattered to him, always; trying to find a vector for his beliefs to be made reality. That’s the American dream, isn’t it?
