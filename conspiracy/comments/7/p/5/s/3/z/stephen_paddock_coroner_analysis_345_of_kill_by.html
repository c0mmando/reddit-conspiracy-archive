    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re out of your mind if you think getting close to 50% accuracy from 475 yards (almost 5 football fields) away with that rate of fire, using a bump stock isn&#39;t unusual... Especially for an out of shape 60 year old with little to no training.  Maybe if he used a mounted/bi-pod gun or even shot in bursts, but the official narrative hasn&#39;t indicated that or have they shown the &quot;shooters nests&quot; they&#39;ve referred too initially.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was probably around 400 people shot with either 1100 or 900 bullets shot (I haven&#39;t seen whether they include the 200 bullets down the hallway as part of the 1100 or not). I came to the 400 shot victim number base off of the numbers reported by 2 hospitals that took in 300 injuries and 200 of them were gun shot vitims:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many of the most critically wounded patients arrived at the 541-bed University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, the state&#39;s only Level One trauma center. Over about four hours, it received 104 patients. More than 80 percent were gunshot victims.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Wednesday, Sunrise Hospital revised the total number of patients it had treated down — from 214 to 200, of whom 16 died and 29 were still in critical condition. Of those, the hospital estimates about 120 had gunshot wounds, but did not release an exact figure. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lets say the 1,100 bullets fired were all on the crowd, that still a 36% accuracy rate at 475 yards with a bump stock.  To give you an idea of how hard it would have been for a 60 year old out of shape gambler with little gun training, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWVtWRkAh8s">here is a bump stock from 30 yards</a>.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well consider the angle he was shooting from</p>

<p>if you&#39;re shooting from a higher angle into a crowded area, there&#39;s more surface area on the head/upper torso (dependent on specific angle) that would lead to this result.</p>

<p>hitting someone in the feet or legs would be, essentially, threading the needle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did any of you watch the video?</p>

<p>Yes from elevated position will achieve more headshots, but did anyone pay attention to the fact that nearly twice as many woman were killed than men, and the only people to be shot twice were all woman...</p>

<p>Coincidence or was Paddock targeting woman?  I hope your also all aware that the FBI stated that they ZERO video evidence of Paddock bringing guns into Mandalay Bay..  I repeat, the FBI has no video footage showing how Paddock got his guns up to his room.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s it called? I agree the results aren&#39;t suspicious. I simulated the shooting in Arma 3 which has the most accurate ballistic simulation model available to the public and the engine is used by various military to simulate combat. I was easily able to achieve the amount of kills (for lack of better term) that Paddock did using both 5.56 and 6.5mm rounds and following the same full-auto fire patterns as he did from the same height and firing to the same distance.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually surprised more people didn&#39;t die.. it seems it should be twice as many. Lucky the shooting ended when it did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hm, I don&#39;t know if it has a specific name as other fallacies. I mean, I am sure statisticians call it something, but I am not aware of a distinctive name.</p>

<p>It is based on the work of Abraham Wald and the Statistical Research Group in the United States. They were trying to figure out how to better protect bombers by adding armour on the damage-ridden areas. Wald was the first to &quot;understand&quot; that they were bias as they examined damage patterns only on aircraft that safely returned. He hypothesised that, since those damaged aircraft managed to return home, they were sufficiently protected in the damaged areas, and the armour should be applied to the undamaged areas of the frames: Planes who were hit there didn&#39;t make back home to examine the pattern.</p>

<p>It is basically the reverse of what OP is doing.</p>

<p>Regarding Arma3, while excellent game (I grew up with Operation Flashpoint and the like), keep in mind that its still a game and that we don&#39;t know alot of things about the Las Vegas incident. I would take any simulations with a grain of salt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still real curious why the shooting stopped when he reportedly had so many rounds left in his room as well as extra guns skills they jam/overheat etc. Plus the Las Vegas metro pd said they thought he intended to leave alive but a security guard scared him so bad he decided to kill himself? I don&#39;t buy it.</p>

    <div class="md"><ol>
<li><p>It takes stamina to fire that many rounds, especially in pseudo-automatic. It&#39;s like getting hit in the chest over and over and over. Paddock wasn&#39;t exactly young. </p></li>
<li><p>Response time was quicker than they want you to think. If they say it took 20 minutes to respond and it only took 7, future criminals will plan to have 20 minutes to commit their crime (casino heist/mass shooting) and will get surprised by a drastically quicker response.</p></li>
<li><p>If his ultimate goal was suicide and he didn&#39;t want to be captured alive under any circumstance, he was ensuring he was dead and had chance to bleed out before police arrived.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I don&#39;t know if any of those reasons are correct, but I think they&#39;re all reasonable answers as to why he&#39;d stop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that game engine well and the reason more real people survived is because the simulation only simulates so much. </p>

<p>Game characters are slow to react and don&#39;t have the dynamic range of movent humans do. In game they just slowly drop to the ground. Then they get up and start running. In real life people were able to get under and next to cover</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it doesn&#39;t properly simulate crowd dynamics but it&#39;s close enough. If you watch the videos you will see after the first volley most (although not all) of the people just dropped straight to prone/crouch position and stayed there until the end of the 2nd volley, so in that sense it&#39;s not too different from how the AI acts in Arma. I should mention I tried it with multiple AI behavior settings ie calm, alert, combat, even going as far as to split the crowd into different groups all having different behavior patterns, until I got the result that most matched how the crowd reacted in the video. The spray from his fire would have been contained entirely within the concert grounds, therefore almost every bullet is hitting somebody in the first couple of minutes, even the ones that miss and hit the concrete since they will ricochet. Also most of the hits would have been during these first two volleys.</p>
