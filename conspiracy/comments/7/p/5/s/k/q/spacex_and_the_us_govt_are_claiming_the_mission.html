       Probably misdirection? Like they are making a huge deal out of this lost satellite. Other countries might mobilize telescopes to monitor OR satellites to intercept, and if this launch is a bluff than it enables us to see their hand.

       Agreed. I immediately thought when I heard this, they're lying.  It doesn't make sense. Remember a few weeks ago when they fired that rocket off without any advanced notice, which scared a shit ton of people?  Then for this launch, with a super secret classified satellite payload, they give all this advanced notice, with live streams, the whole nine yards.

       What rocket did they fire off without notice? You mean the spaceX Iridium 4 mission which people knew about and many people were watching on a live stream?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Zuma mission was on short notice and top secret but got scrubbed after a "fairing issue"... who knows if it was a fairing issue or what the actual reason was.. and then launched sunday.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, you can't hide launches because the FAA requires notification.
      </p>
      <p>
       And once you know the type of orbit they are not terribly hard to find unless this is one of those supposed stealth satellites they might be developing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case who knows what actually happened or where these rumors came from.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole Zuma launch thing has been a bit odd from the beginning... but the Iridium 4 mission was just a routine mission...

       That's not true at all. Just because people didn't know they had a launch coming doesn't mean it was a secret.

       couldn't have said it better myself.
I was looking forward to looking out for it so I could capture some photos but for some reason THIS rocket didn't cause mass panic like the other and apparently didn't give off the same aura when it left out atmosphere, or is it stratosphere? idk

       They laughed at different times of day. Zuma was a straight up night launch, while the one from VAFB was at sunset so the over-the- horizon sun illumined the rocket exhaust. You can see the same effect with jet contrails occasionally.

       I can only speculate of course, but it is doubtful in my mind that such a weapon would be deployed so quickly from the beginning of this trouble with NK.  I doubt they would rely on spacex to deploy such a weapon systems if it was needed urgently, too, but it might be possible that our space capabilities have literally degraded to this point thanks to Musk's attack on the public space program.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I don't see why an EMP would be the weapon of choice against NK, either.

      </p>
      <p>
       Right?? They have nothing to EMP. In fact, any EMP against NK would hurt us more than them because the vast majority of what passes for consumer tech in that country is shitty DVD and MP3 players and it is mostly there in the first place because it was smuggled in to bring the regular people news of the outside world in the hopes of bringing some kind of balance to their fanaticism that has been literally nurtured since birth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Military and government tech in NK will be hardened as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what OP said can be read another way... "an EMP device for NK". Meaning an EMP device on behalf of NK, to be used against us. With all the talk in the media of an EMP attack being really North Korea's only viable weapon against us, it could be we put a device up there to false flag ourselves and call it a NK EMP attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I highly doubt anybody would use SpaceX to do that. There's no point. Both the US and NK governments have rockets already.

       Ha! Now you're talking.  And a novel weapons systems like that, that we never saw on TV being deployed against an enemy... people will attribute that to the work of an 'other' very easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree spacex would not do that, just because they are so shit.  I also think an EMP weapon could be so devastating it might not be viable as a false flag weapon.  Perhaps a chemical weapon or a nuke smuggle to the west coast?

       "I also think an EMP weapon could be so devastating it might not be viable as a false flag weapon."
      </p>
      <p>
       Very true. Supposedly it only takes 1-2 EMPs to disable the entire US. With a false flag there has to be victims, sure, but there also has to be lots of proxy victims in order to get upset on behalf of the victims. And the proxy victims have to be able to 'go to war' whatever that means, but it probably at least means having a viable infrastructure.
      </p>

       Im too confused by all these comments so sorry if I said this right above your comment or anything.  Its been like a century since all these different nation states really got into the shit working on chemical and germ warfare, and people have barely used it.  Between climate change, mass immigration, the antibiotic resistant plague scares...  Ive got my money on chemical / germ warfare false flag!!!

       The federal government hasn't been willing to pay to have our grid shielded from EMPs.  An EMP would destroy our entire nation and destabilize the entire planet for decades.  I don't see who would come out on top in that scenario, there would be nothing left of us to fight NK.  We would be flattened by their 1970s military.

       What if the EMP is meant for the US? We forget about this top secret payload that burned up in space upon re-entry in a few weeks without media support (see Vegas shooting), and then they EMP us back into the stone age so they can finally use all those FEMA camps they've been building.

       I hate to be the guy shitting on a conspiracy theory across a bunch of threads, but Ill play devils advocate I suppose.  Unless there is some kind of incredibly novel stealth technology on board this satelite, there is no way to hide it from anyone who would want to verify that it is up there.  I do not think it is possible to hide the satelite.  It would have to absorb arbitrary types of energy that our telescopes could shoot up when we look through the sky for things.  For example, it would literally have to be invisible to hide it from a huge number of people with access to powerful telescopes who have no reason to lie and say it isnt there.

       Certainly none of this is impossible, but we are getting to 'fantastic' levels, in my mind.

       Keep in mind not all telescopes are scanning the visual spectrum (perhaps most of them aren't).  And remember there are other objects that this satelite would block out periodically perhaps.  There are tons and tons of ways of detecting objects in space.  Also keep in mind that the satelite is likely only useful unless they can contact and control it, which would betray its position.

       You can probably hide the functions of a satellite though.  Shrouding it in radar and infrared stealth material could hide whether its imaging, radar, etc.  But you can't hide that there is an object there at all.

       Yes.  Its tough for me to speculate just how much you can conceal satellite function based off the type of energy it is absorbing at different points and the type of transmissions it is sending and receiving.  You could also begin to correlate information about the satellite purpose based off its positioning through time, seeing if how the enemy changes the satellites operations in reaction to things you do.  And of course whatever other intelligence assets you can get on the ground.     Likely their analysits are looking at shit we can't even think of, such as the rocket payload which put it in orbit, who they think built it and for how much, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, I think there have been instances where otherwise unknown spacecraft have passed by US satellites at close range, perhaps foreign space programs trying to figure out what we're up to?

       Not as vast as you may think.  On the best and clearest night sky you can only see stars less than 300 light years away.  Or about 2000 total.  With telescopes you can see much much more.  And you can also see when something passes in between you and a star.

       Have to remember infrared though. I guess it could work if you radiated all your heat away from earth and actively cooled the side of your satellite facing earth.

       I think you need somebody to tell you the trajectory and orbit of a particular satellite before being able to zoom in on it with a telescope.  If they don't disclose Zuma's orbit, there is no way of knowing where it is in the sky.

       I imagine you could track it down even without knowing the actual orbit right off the bat, the same way astronomers normally look for new objects.  But probably any intelligence agency that was concerned with the satellite, probably had some sensor with a good track on it since before it even left the atmosphere keep in mind.

       I'm assuming our government does know where it is.  I'm talking about people not "in the know" about this payload.  So as an individual observer with a telescope, when you find a satellite, how would you know that it's Zuma you're looking at and not one of the many thousands of other satellites in the sky?  It's a bit like finding a needle in a hay stack.  Or more like a needle in a haystack the size of Texas.

       To continue your hypothesis, wouldn't hostile actors need to be on this side of the earth in order to track it, assuming they would need to see it from launch to be able to follow it into the sky?
      </p>
      <p>
       I say this as it seems Russia, China, Iran, or North Korea would be the most likely to want to track the technology. Bear in mind that I really don't know what I'm talking about here, this is just conjecture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, how large is this satellite? If it's the size of a minivan, does this make it difficult to see with a telescope, in the same manner that we often don't see asteroids until they are right on us?

       I think the really large states which would be interested, like China and Russia, have sufficient resources to put sensor energy on any point in the upper atmosphere in the world, if they really want.  Don't forget they have things like arborn ELINT, AWR, plenty of naval assets that would have no trouble tracking a rocket, etc.  I think there are certain extremely powerful large land based over the horizon radar arrays which could be used, too.  I think they use some kind of crazy effect where they propagate energy through the upper atmosphere to go like, way over the horizon?  Im not so famliar with these systems Im just assuming they must work this way for them to be worth it compared to other options.  Of course, these actors have satellites of their own too.  In this sense they dont even have to worry about tracking a visual signature.  Though Im sure they take a good look when they can.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea how large it is.  I think its classified so probably no one can tell you.   My understanding is that even civilian astronomers (not just like everyday people but like scientists and shit) have powerful enough telescopes that we can take pretty good looks at even really small objects in earth orbit, even correcting for certain amounts of that blurring effect that makes shit... blurry.  Forget what its called.  Maybe not though.
      </p>

       Im not sure if its true we only see satellites until they are right on us.  Usually we see asteroids which will pass by earth way before they reach any sort of distance which is as close as an artificial satellite, right?

       You are correct, I was just referencing the times that we don't see them,

      <p>
       That's not to say it's impossible, just that even if we're looking we can still miss things. As such, I wonder how difficult or easy it would be to spot one. I do know that you can see the ISS without using a telescope, but that's when light is reflecting off of it. I would be curious to know how hard/easy it is to make an object hard to see (black would blend with the night sky but would stick out during the day, unless you were high enough up to "hide" behind the blue reflection of the sky...

       Another thing to keep in mind is that I think usually nations are pretty good aobut warning  each other about rocket launches and their intended purpose, because people are afraid of inadvertent nuclear confrontations.

       I think there was a sort of "unknown / lost satellite" awhile back, I think the explanation was it was some kind of like chinese ASAT weapon that must have broken off from a mothership?

       Ah but that's the thing, the idea that not everything is as it should be, or as its told. The idea or thought or conspiracy.  When in reality..... people are that dumb. People are that evil "in the case of mass shootings or terrible events etc" I've seen people on this sub say that.. well example.. the people in Vegas they didn't die! They were actors right? Hahaha
      </p>
      <p>
       Ya know now that I think about it I get it. I do kinda. The idea that everything is some ridic conspiracy. No one ever actually dies. Everyone's a crisis actor right? Nothing ACTUALLY horrible ever happens right? It's all just one big, giant conspiracy. And we all in some peeps minds, get to live in a nice, safe world. Where everything is run by a big shadowy one world government. Everything happens for a super secret insidious reason. And everything is going to plan. A plan we can fight, or hide from, or talk about etc. Cause none of us want to live in a world where no one has control. Where things just happen.

       Let's use the Las Vegas Massacre as an example of a potential conspiracy. Even if you follow the official narrative then it's obvious that Mandalay Bay is withholding evidence in order to avoid lawsuits. The key witness was withheld from questioning and was only revealed on a tv show hosted by Ellen Degeneres, who own's slot machines in Mandalay Bay.

       Drink the koolaid. A reference to drinking a poisoned drink. Why use that term? Is it so hard to believe a guy could get Whitman fever and, for the sake of the analogy, climb a clock tower? I understand people are scary, we're all so.... unpredictable. It's scary and you want to find meaning I get it. But sometimes. Sometimes people do bad things just cause ya know?

       Drink the kool-aid in this context means to accept the official narrative. Whitman had a brain tumor, Paddock didn't. People don't slaughter others "just cause".

       Same. Northwoods is the deepest glimpse into the ethical desert that is state intelligence. I try not to mention it to noobs as it's just so bombastic. People need priming before that history or they typically just reject it outright. It's an INSANE document.

       First - none of us, including you, know that we already know about
       <em>
        "most"
       </em>
       of the big conspiracies. We might only know about the tip of the iceberg.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for incompetence - even though some of these
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       confirmed conspiracies were suspected far before they became "confirmed", many are only ever confirmed after said conspirators admit to it, or release documents many years after the fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theorists are ridiculed for years before any of these kind of conspiracies are actually confirmed. It's not usually incompetence that confirms these conspiracies; it's the government/intel agencies just not giving a shit if people know about it after so many years.
      </p>
      <p>
       They only "confirm" it when they know no one will give a shit and/or do nothing about it. They know the majority of people will say "Oh just because they lied to our faces 100 times before doesn't mean they'll do it again!" If they even bother remembering the previous 99 times at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also know a lot of those people will act like
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       knew about it all along (as in the Edward Snowden revelations) and keep acting like conspiracy theorists are insane and never right about anything.

       Crisis actors inftrate the rare real incidents to steerthe narrative.  Start thinking about the various possibilities instead of Pretending.  Gate keepers take an extreme (no one died) and run with it in order to produce knuckleheaded thinking like what you are saying above.

      <p>
       See.. that's an awful lot of "everything"s.

      <p>
       Pretty much no one here believes that
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       is one big conspiracy, that
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       happens for an insidious reason or that
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       is run by a one world government.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I think you know that. But we don't sound nearly as crazy if you paint things in a more accurate light and say that instead, most of us think
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       things are a conspiracy, that
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       things do have an insidious agenda behind them, or that
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       things could be and probably are controlled by an international group of elites.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you view this sub as one person's beliefs then of course it's going to look like we all think
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       is a conspiracy. But we all obviously have our own beliefs, opinions and thoughts, so stop talking about this sub and conspiracy theorists in general as if we're all one person because it's bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Cause none of us want to live in a world where no one has control
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That has nothing to do with it. All we have to do is look back to the hundreds or thousands of points in history to see that various different people and groups of people try and
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       control other people and events.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not even
       <em>
        kind of
       </em>
       a reach to believe it is happening currently and will happen again in the future. It's human nature, especially for those with power, to manipulate things and people around them for their own agendas.

       I watched the launch live and they confirmed faring separation on stream. After that the satellite shiuld have undocked, they cut the stream before they confirmed separation but they also mentioned everything was progressing optimally with regards to the main mission..

       Also pretty convenient that they didn't use onboard cameras for this launch...The one launch that fails doesn't have the footage to prove it.. lol

       Yeah that's fine but they often have cameras on the 2nd stage facing away from the payload as well. There is no reason they couldn't do that. At least then we'd know for sure if the 2nd stage did in fact re enter the atmosphere.

       There's also not really a reason to do that. SpaceX gets their publicity from the actual launch and the landing. After that they like to show the deployment for the manufacturers benefit but in this case the manufacturer obviously doesn't want anything shown.

       A problem with the satelite may have cropped up after fairing separation, or the satelite itself may have failed.  It would not be the first time.  If this is the case, here is what we can expect.  Depending on the state of the satellite, it may be kept in orbit with some kind of limited functionality available.  If the satellite's orbit is decaying or if we want to ensure no one will be able to recover it, we may try and have the satelite crash itself back to earth.  Failing all of this, it is likely we will use one of our anti satellite weapon systems -- either the f-15 ASAT missile, or a specially modified SAM,  fired from a guided missile cruiser.  This could all take months to sort out and every possibility is a difficult engineering challenge.

       They are pretty transparent when something goes wrong.  I'm sure there are lots of satellites watching all sorts of things we will never know about.  I actually do believe them when they say it was a total loss.  If it was a success you would hear nothing about it.  Besides, what is the average citizen going to do about a satellite? Wear a bigger tin foil hat?

       I ready an article this morning and they mentioned that this wouldn't be the first time that the government claimed a satellite failed and was destroyed, when in reality they were just saying that to fool both the media and the Soviet Union. I'll look for it, but I think there's a good chance they're just lying to divert attention. I doubt any major government would just fall for that though, they could easily just monitor the payload.

       Nah. This was something more sinister that simple surveillance, nobody even knows which government agency wanted to put it in space. If I was to make a guess I’d say it was something related to Blue Beam.

       The sources for Bloomberg and Wall Street Journal say that the upper stage of the Falcon 9 rocket failed and that the spacecraft did not separate.

      <p>
       SpaceX has gone on record saying that the Falcon 9 "performed nominally" and that it "did everything correctly on Sunday night".

       Another thing to keep in mind is that I think usually nations are pretty good aobut warning  each other about rocket launches and their intended purpose, because people are afraid of inadvertent nuclear confrontations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there was a sort of "unknown / lost satellite" awhile back, I think the explanation was it was some kind of like chinese ASAT weapon that must have broken off from a mothership?
