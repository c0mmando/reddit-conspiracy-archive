       So, about a year ago I came across a discussion talking about how sports are scripted theater coded with a language called Gematria. I thought it was crazy but I found someone who has been predicting outcomes of all major sports leagues as well as college sports at the highest level meaning championships...They called last years basketball tournament champion the day the bracket was announced with this code. I have been learning about it and was just watching the College football championship and paying attention to the score and the numbers that are brought up over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the big highlights of the game was the Black Panther trailer debut at halftime with has a numerical connection to Alabama through this language. The theme song of this years playoff was "Walk on Water" by 30 Seconds to Mars. That title in this language has a connection to "Georgia".
      </p>
      <p>
       So tonight, Nick Saban (Age 66) won his 6th championship (666) when #6 Devonta Smith caught a touchdown pass...I can go into further detail than this. These games are staged at the highest levels. There's a reason you don't and wont see underdog teams from the smaller confrences playing in the College Football Playoffs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was pointing these things out in r/CFB on the game threads but they actually banned me. I messaged asking why and they told me I was harassing people... I replied asking how I was doing that and they said I broke the rules and am no longer welcome...I replied to them "thanks for solidifying my insight on these scripted games."
      </p>
      <p>
       Look into this information. The world around you is coded and those with money and power are in control. They script your news media, they script your sports league, and they laugh at the fact that most people are too dumb to notice it. Do yourself a favor and learn about this, wake up, and stop supporting their fake bullshit. It's a waste of time.

       I'm a fan of college football and would hate for this to be the case but it just seems so obvious at the highest levels anymore...
      </p>
      <p>
       These players all have contracts and there are non-disclosure agreements they have to sign.You are going to keep a secret if you get to do what you love and maybe get a few perks. I don't think this takes place at all colleges. Mainly the big ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think a team like UCF (Undefeated conference champion) got snubbed from playing in the playoff? Because they aren't in the right conference and don't have the money.  They only let teams in from big conferences. So far, only teams from (SEC, ACC, Big Ten, Pac-12, and Big 12) have played in the playoffs.
      </p>
      <p>
       2016: Western Michigan 13-1 finished 15th behind a bunch of 2 and 3 loss teams.
      </p>
      <p>
       2015: Houston 13-1 finished 9th behind a bunch of 2 loss teams
      </p>
      <p>
       2014: Boise State 12-2 finished 9th with several 3 loss teams in front of them. Marshall 13-1 finished 22nd...
      </p>
      <p>
       2013: UCF 12-1 finished 10th behind 7 2 loss teams...
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you see a trend here? Those teams I mentioned don't belong to the big money conferences. Those teams wont ever be put in the playoff because they are outsiders. If you follow the money trail to these big confrences, this is where a majority of your NFL players are bred. They are learning how it works and are most likely getting some pretty nice perks on the side.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one of those "outsiders" gets in, then I will change my stance. How an 11-1 team that didn't even make it's confrence championship got in over an undefeated team that won its confrence makes absolutely no sense. how they kept two other confrence champions with the same record from filling that spot as well just adds to the speculation.

       I played D1 soccer at one of the top 20 schools in the country.  I played professionally in europe for a lower tier team.  I lived with 5 different MLS players over the course of 10 years.  These sports are in no way shape or form scripted.  Maybe like the other guy said there are certain choke points that can be utilized.

       How much money, television contracts with ESPN, partnerships with Fox, ABC, etc. does college soccer have? Soccer is a sport that experiences more rigging on the world stage. You don’t hear much about Vegas odds on college soccer games. Have you watched the World Cup before? Don’t tell me that’s not shady as hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I am talking about big time football teams in the major conferences. That’s why you see undefeated conference champions from outside of those conferences not get a shot in the playoff...because they are not part of the upper echelon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have friends who played football in college as well...

       There is big money in fixing these games for insiders, and I have no doubt games are routinely fixed.   Its not clear why you think this encoding is so important, when there would be far simpler ways of fixing the games.  I imagine the mechanism is basically the same as insider trading - privileged individuals are just given tips.  They collect money on the tip, and basically its impossible to prove anything untoward happened -- it was just a good bet!
      </p>
      <p>
       There are certain games which lend themselves well to fixing because there are 'choke points' that can be compromised by small numbers of individuals  to have a large impact on the game.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        NBA referees have a huge impact on the game, make lots of 'judgment' calls, and get covered for by the league routinely -- players can be fined for complaining about calls
       </li>
       <li>
        NFL offensive coordinators and coaches.  Quarter backs.  This could be so obviously fixed it couldnt even be detected, since practically nothing creative happens on the field and its usually impossible to prove what is willful action or just random chance of the game
       </li>
       <li>
        Baseball umpires, of course.  Pitchers.  Worth mentioning is the black sox scandal, when a whole team was compromised and took a dive.
       </li>
       <li>
        Business or league related decisions, such as player drafting.  The NBA is famous for scandals related to fixed drafts.
       </li>
       <li>
        These are just a few, there are so many obvious possiblities
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It is routine for controversy related to these avenues to have huge, game or season deciding impacts on these sports.  Money transfers due to betting are completely opaque to the public, could basically involved uncapped, massive sums, and are controlled by organizations (mostly in vegas / atlantic city) which are openly tied to organized crime (and therefore clandestine agencies and intelligence services).  Who is responsible for monitoring these institutions?  Those very same intelligence services.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only do most people NOT bleieve that sports are fixed, many DONT WANT TO (think about it).  With such resistence to the very notioin that the games are rigged, no one would even begin to suspect that sports fixing and betting could be a power brokering system or money laundering system.  There is so much easy money and power to be made, and the methods of fixing are completely opaque and unprovable.  Furthermore, There are countless controversies, and many proven examples of fixing.  What a powerful illusion, that people somehow cant see this for what it is.  Thats a secondary topic though.

       I totally agree, people do not want to realize that sports are "fixed" or "scipted". I think the main reason for the use of this coded language is for Masonic reasons. They are ritualistic and the language is an ancient  Jewish, numerical language that people don't understand and aren't taught about in school. It is the source of how our language is made up. Language is mathematical and this is how they code things.

       In this language championship=131....who finished with a 13-1 record?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know how many times Alabama and Georgia have played each other throughout college football history? Last night was the 68th matchup. In this language championship=68.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tua Tagovailoa (13 letters in his name) a player most people didn’t even see play all year is subbed in when Alabama is down 13-0...
      </p>
      <p>
       Both teams finished the season with 13 wins...

       Why do you think the commentators are always saying “it’s like a Disney movie you couldn’t script it any better!” Because they are throwing it in your face and know most people are to stupid to see it.

       You're aware how many people would have to be involved and keep their mouth shut right? Trainers, players, coaches (apparently announcers too) etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the scenario you're suggesting is taking place, do you think it's plausible that you wouldn't have any individuals speak out about it? We are talking thousands and thousands of people.

        Probability theory is a great tool for modeling random variation within language, such as whether you say it isn’t or it’s not. They mean the same thing, but you have to mentally flip a coin to decide which to say.

       This just isn't how language works -- its a creative endeavor.  Flipping a mental coin?  Is he nuts?  People aren't statistical models

       Sports are 100% rigged when money is involved. Gullible fools only believe otherwise. I can't watch most all sports anymore, because of this. The masses are so dumbed down they will never get what you are saying though.

       Exactly. When you finally see through the veil, you can never see it as competition again because you know it isn't. The College level is where they bread future "athlete actors" for the professional leagues. I don't think smaller conferences do this though. I think it's mainly in the big ones. But, I could be wrong.

       If you really think about it most sports only need a handful of players, and coaches to control the outcome of the game. Football -pay off the quarterback, and coach, and you pretty much have it in control, and throw the field goal kicker a little something too.

       Are you talking about the one where Marchon Lynch is running over every defender and they get the ball near the goal line and decide to throw a pick? Yeah why in the world would you not run the ball there?

       People realize that’s not backyard football that’s playing for a national championship on the highest level. No one in their right mind would attempt that play in that situation... but you know why they did it? Because it’s what they’re paid to do. And I personally despise the Seattle Seahawks so you would think I would be one to just sit and laugh at them.

       That was absolutely ridiculous not to run on 1st down with 1 yard to go when you have Marshawn Lynch but I believe he was referring to last year and how the Falcons managed to "blow" the largest lead ever in the 4th quarter. Numerous instances stood out like calling multiple drop back passing plays which lead to a huge sack which took the Falcons out of field goal range where a field goal would have won it for them. Horrible reffing where 3 consecutive holding calls kept the patriots alive. Not running the ball in the second half when your dynamic dyo tandem who were tearing up the Patriots all game long.
      </p>

       NFL is obviously rigged and I used to believe it would be too difficult to fix college games but you definitely opened my eyes to how they could.

       The super bowl is being played at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis Minnesota. Justin Timberlake is the halftime performer. Pink is singing the National Anthem.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a connection through this language between Pittsburgh and 52 which this is Super Bowl 52.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also a connection between "Justin Timberlake" and "Pittsburgh Steelers" in this language.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a connection between "Pink" and "Carson Wentz" in this language.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just scratching the surface. Those are some of the blatant, in your face connections.

       I’m on my lunch break right now at work but if I was at home I could get on and show some examples of what I mean by this. Where the Super Bowl is being played this year, The date it is being played, and other factors are connected to the quarterback’s of both teams as well as the teams themselves in the cities they are from through this code so what I am saying is I see a connection between those two teams in this year Super Bowl.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there’s a good chance that we see the Pittsburgh Steelers against the Philidelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl this year.

       You forgot one Bama player was born in June (6th month) and another was born on the 6th day of another month and yet another had 6 jockstraps in his locker. They're all on the same team (666)  .  Also, a Bama fan had a beer and hot dog at the stadium $26.00 and a Georgia fan had two corn dogs for $23.00 ... the final score? 26-23.  Rigged.

       Scripted? Highly unlikely.  Now outside influences trying to decide outcomes of games....... now there's something there. 
Also Op do you think Satan is scripting these games? I only ask because of your linking of the 666 numbers.

       No. Has nothing to do with “Satan”, a made up deity. This same code was used to write the Bible which is a fairy tale story but has information which is useful. It connects to the Lore of the Bible. The Bible itself is written in this language pretty heavily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion as a whole Nother thing that was just created to control and miss guide people and take advantage of money and control the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       666 is a “trinity of 6” in the lore of the Hebrew Bible the number of man is 6 because god “created man on that day”, jesus dying on the 6th day, and Johns message that Satan is just a 6...

       No. Nick Sabin one his sixth championship at age 66. 666.

       Then No. 6 catching that touchdown is just another tribute to Nick Sabin winning his sixth championship. It’s a separate person and separate act. It’s connected but not factored into that.

       wouldnt surprise me.
      </p>
      <p>
       what clued me in was how at the introduction of the starters before the super bowls, they always got it correct as to which team would be kicking off and which team would be recieving before the coin toss happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see how by random chance it could happen on occassion, but when it happened year after year like it did in the eighties,ninties and early 2ks, something is rotten in denmark

       I read about a conspiracy surrounding players with the number 23 on their shirts, some sort of weird correlation with the number and success of the players.. Also,  I've no doubt that many games within many sports are fixed, too much money involved for there not to be corruption.

       Speaking of the number 23 that’s LeBron James’s number in the NBA. He usually wins a championship when Alabama Wins one...

       honestly i have been thinking a lot about this theory ever since i saw that video of Steph Curry supposedly "ignoring" one of his fans calling out to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you watch the video, Curry looks
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       out of it. first thing that came to my mind was mk ultra. his eyes were dead and he looked like he was on autopilot.
      </p>
      <p>
       thought it was strange they're trying to smear his name right now.

       The final score of that super bowl was 20-17 Patriots. In gematria you don’t include 0 because it’s a non-factor. So we get 217....New England Patriots =217 in the English ordinal calculation...so does national championship....
      </p>
      <p>
       2017... yeah that was last year right who won the NBA championship last year? The Golden State Warriors 217 is also in their gematria code...
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one of the factors that could key into the New England Patriots winning the championship this year for the 2017 season but I think more things favor the other two teams I mentioned. That’s why this crud code can be a little tough to crack Ahead of time

       You're aware how many people would have to be involved and keep their mouth shut right? Trainers, players, coaches (apparently announcers too) etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the scenario you're suggesting is taking place, do you think it's plausible that you wouldn't have any individuals speak out about it? We are talking thousands and thousands of people.

        Probability theory is a great tool for modeling random variation within language, such as whether you say it isn’t or it’s not. They mean the same thing, but you have to mentally flip a coin to decide which to say.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This just isn't how language works -- its a creative endeavor.  Flipping a mental coin?  Is he nuts?  People aren't statistical models
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore .... Sorry I just don't  see how your random (as far as I can tell) associations you make between numbers corresponds to a "langage" in your mind.  Or why such a thing happening would even matter.?
