If  you haven&#39;t seen the special  Dave tells the story of Pimp Iceberg slim and his Bottom Bitch.  And what Iceberg Slim did to get some extra mileage out of his bottom bitch... 
My question... what are you thoughts ?   who&#39;s the bottom Bitch in this Story ?  Dave ?   Did his &quot;Mileage&quot; run out ?  Who&#39;s the Pimp ? Comedy Central?  Hollywood?   Fame ?  or something even much bigger that I am just not seeing ? </p>

<p>His language was obviously very deliberate, especially when talking about taking down the system and not one another.</p>

Word of advice: If you&#39;re going to question the intelligence of others then you should probably learn to use your own native language first, otherwise your point is immediately invalidated by your display of ignorance of your own language.

The point, again, (because you appear to have the intuition of an autistic child) is that if you&#39;re trying to assert your intellectual superiority, it&#39;s best that you display linguistical competence equal or superior to the person you&#39;re accusing. Linguistics is a part of the measure of intelligence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what i understand, Dave was the bottom bitch. I saw an interview with Katt Williams where he talks about this. Chappelles contract stated he was entitled to 50% of the revenue his show generated. Show generated approximately $500 Million. Comedy central told him he made so much money that his contract was no longer valid, and offered him $50 million. So he said fuck that and jumped onto a plane back home. By time he made it home, the media had already been fed stories about him being a crackhead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I liken it to the manipulation and abuse that we all experience in our lives.  I think the Pimp is a small microcosm of our lives today in which we are used as tool to run the machine and be fodder for the grind that is our day to day lives.</p>

<p>We have precious little time here and we spend one third of our lives sleeping, another third working and try and live in whatever we have left.  You can go ahead and say work harder, go to school and ear more but that&#39;s not the point here.  We&#39;d all be working at something, creating and such but its the <em>how</em> that is at the cruz of the matter.  Like a slave in an evolved slavery system.</p>

<p>No one has the time to open their minds to living a full life and devote their time to thinking on a bigger scale.  We work, eat and sleep to survive.  That process is a creation of humans, we (some people) choose to have it this way.  In this world, those who have the most money can experience all that this world can currently offer.  It&#39;s the new darwinism, you participate or you&#39;re that bum on the street or the guy living in the sticks by himself.</p>

<p>So, back to the Pimp.</p>

<p>We are used as the whore while the pimp continually reaps the rewards of owning the whore in small and large ways.  More and more they can squeeze blood from the stone and money from our labors while &quot;they&quot; (AKA rich criminals) use the tool of money to control and stay in control).  Why?  They don&#39;t want to stand in line at the store like we do.  They don&#39;t want to go to a beach and sit with us.  They want all the best for themselves.  It sounds human enough in a survival of the fittest kind of way but that&#39;s not what this life is for.  No one has claim over this life and what it should or should not offer to people.  It has just been crafted that way.  The universe doesn&#39;t care if we pay ourselves in digits or dollars.  The pimp is the abuse over humanity.  A skewed and continually growing attempt at survival for the few at the cost of the many.</p>

<p>You know how I know things can work differently?  Because I can survive in this world on the ground floor.  So can those rich criminals who manipulate.  At some point I&#39;ll be called the old word &quot;communist&quot; and thats not what I want.  I only know the balance is skewed drastically and the rich get richer.  The communist card is tossed out because people don&#39;t currently have an alternative....but clearly there is the capacity for more.  Detroit doesn&#39;t have to deteriorate.  There is money and work to be done but its priority is elsewhere....not because it can&#39;t be done.  </p>

<p>There is no balance, the pimp owns us currently and owns the game as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! I&#39;m glad someone posted something about this. &quot;now we got us a little secret bitch&quot; and his comment about hollywood. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be something if that wasn&#39;t the worst of it?&quot; </p>

<p>I think they (hard to say who &quot;they&quot; is) were trying to make him a &quot;bottom bitch&quot; because he was so influential. And to leave $30million and in the middle of a season, plus considering they smeared him on the way out saying he smokes crack.. I think he knows Some of Hollywood&#39;s darkest shit.  </p>

<p>The only thing I can think of is what the ex Illuminati Dutch Banker, Ronald Bernard, was saying. (I know this is going to be hard for some people to swallow) but the dude said that he was invited to a party and pretty much in the back room they were going to have a child sacrifice. That&#39;s when he freaked out.</p>

<p>Whether this happened to Dave or not I believe he got a little too close to the devil in Hollywood. To me that would explain the sudden disappearance</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before we get to the Pimp metaphor think back to the beginning when Dave is talking about .#metoo and what&#39;s happened in hollywood over the past couple of months.</p>

<p>He talks about how unless we change the actual system it&#39;s going to keep producing the same fruit it&#39;s been producing. As long as we collectively give our attention to a priest/royal class power will continue to be concentrated and the most psychopathic among us will capture it. </p>

<p>Furthermore he hits on the concepts of <em>Compartmentalization</em> and <em>Forgiveness</em>, these are critical concepts that aren&#39;t understood in Pop-Conspiracy culture. Without understanding these concepts one will be incapable of beginning to imagine new collective patterns of being that are less subject to corruption. Without forgiveness and de-compartmentalization all you have access to is &quot;An eye for an eye.&quot; the pattern humans have been stuck in for the last epoch of our development.</p>

<p>A couple of other things he says are very important for contextualizing his breakdown, &#39;What if what&#39;s being exposed isn&#39;t even the worst of it?&#39; and &#39;Pimp is the capitalist manifesto.&#39;</p>

<p>Dave is definitely aware that what hollywood is allowing to be exposed is the tamer stuff that&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>The Pimp metaphor: While it IS a capitalist manifesto, might be better described as a <em>materialist manifesto</em>. Socialism and Capitalism both promise the same basic thing in the end, affordable personal nuclear warheads for everyone. They differ in their delivery mechanism, state directed delivery or oligarchical &quot;market&quot; based delivery. These are materialistic philosophies that are concerned only with material distribution. </p>

<p>However, if you look at the life of a human under either idealistic construct you&#39;ll find the same basic &#39;Pimp&#39; pattern of being. Someone with &#39;power&#39; tricks someone else into being their bitch. </p>

<p>The trick won&#39;t work without the participation of the bitch, she has to be motivated by material goods to be willing to actually do someone harm.</p>

<p>The trick is financed by the bitch, Iceberg wouldn&#39;t have had the resources to trick his bottom bitch without her making money for him and keeping the rest of his stable in line.</p>

<p>The deception is allowed by the bitch, she had to be unwilling to deal with the potential consequences of her actions. This allows Iceberg to &#39;clean up the mess&#39;, now the bitch owes Iceberg.</p>

<p>In this way we are party to our own enslavement. We don&#39;t follow our dreams, we ignore our conscience, we won&#39;t take responsibility for our own actions good or bad. We value material comfort more than we value truth, or even our own souls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dave has mentioned Pimp before, and I have also read Pimp. The version he tells is a dressed up version of the ending, made to be a bit funny. What he says about the book in the earlier interview and what I understand about the book is this: It&#39;s the most clear depiction of what Capitalism is that you can find.</p>

<p>Francis Ford Copolla said he would only direct the Godfather if he could make it about &quot;Capitalism.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know Dave&#39;s exact experience, no one will, and besides his story is meant to entertain and be a metaphor, not an exact truth. What he is saying is that he realized that he despite potentially getting $50 million, he was still on the labor side of the labor/capital schism. No matter how much he made that would always be the case, pursuing that direction could never make him truly wealthy/master, it would just make him a more expensive whore. That&#39;s the trick labor plays on capital, that&#39;s the trick a pimp plays on a whore.</p>

<p>Also note: the story was he was supposed to get $50 million. Supposed. Comedy Central was making $500 million, he was entitled to 10%. They said 10% stops somewhere. He said that&#39;s not in the contract. They said fuck you. He went to Africa. They smeared the fuck out of him. He saw he had been used.</p>
