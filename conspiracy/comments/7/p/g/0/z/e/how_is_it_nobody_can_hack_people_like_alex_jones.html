<p>Right but the problem is before he was very articulate on the reasoning why we did not go to the moon.  He was well researched and passionate about this subject.  He has given no reason or evidence why he now completely flipped his stance.  He has not articulated why he is now contradicting his previous statements.  So what &quot;new information&quot; are you talking about? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That is true but we are talking about a specific person (Joe Rogan).  For example his first episode of &#39;Joe Rogan Questions Everything&quot;  (on mainstream tv) He teams up with well known mega shill Mick West and they &quot;debunk&quot; chemtrails on the very first episode.  If you watch the show it was obvious hit pieces and not real research/experiments.</p>

<p>You can not have followed Joe through the years and not realize that he has been compromised to sell a certain narrative and now dismiss things that he used to openly question.  It is over the top obvious.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is making fun of Ancient Aliens because they are a joke. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve listened to literally every second of content Joe has put out over the last 10 years and there is overwhelming evidence that he is a normal dude. </p>

<p>The truth is, he switched his conspiracy minded thoughts to ACTUAL conspiracies. Like the sugar industry, hemp restrictions, Operation Paperclip, the flaws in our banking system, and hours upon hours of focus on corruption in government. </p>

<p>If you want to use some straight BULLSHIT ancient aliens argument to prove Joe is a shill, you better realize that doing so makes you look like a fool. You obviously have very little evidence other than your slanted opinion. Please tell me you are one of the people who  think Joe is a flat earth shill. I&#39;d bet my bottom dollar that that notion is where this stems from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. He found himself in a position of having to defend his theories/views and realized that a lot of them fell apart the more research he did.</p>

<p>Which is why he now talks about conspiracy theory people with so much disdain - he used to be one and had to pull himself out of that with some hard work, research, and exposing himself to actual experts. He isn&#39;t too patient with people who just blindly follow conspiracy theories anymore than he is patient with people who just swallow the story.</p>

<p>FWIW I find his take on most conspiracy theories to be accurate. </p>

<p>Lets break down where and when Joe has been a shill, other than a cheap joke on a shitty reality show he did.  Again, I am assuming you are a flat earth fanboi, which is ironic and hypocritical because you are trying to paint me as some sort of weak minded slave like yourself. </p>

<p>That&#39;s simply untrue. There are reasonable explanations for every single so-called &quot;problem&quot; with the moon landing. I&#39;ve even spoon-fed you some. If you find those explanations implausible, you haven&#39;t said so. If you have a rebuttal to those explanations, you haven&#39;t said so.

<p>Feed your fascist bullshit to someone who gives a fuck. Skepticism is the foundation of reason. You&#39;ve done nothing more than join a cult if you&#39;re completely unwilling to consider evidence contrary to your beliefs. Better yet, to provide reasonable counter-points to that evidence if it doesn&#39;t meet your expectations. </p>

<p>For my part, I&#39;ve tried to show why the most convincing arguments for the moon landing being a hoax have been debunked. Either debunk the debunkings, show me a website or video providing additional evidence, or go back to the church of conspiracy-theories.</p>

All homes owned are typically archived on a public platform for real estate purposes. 
Most celebrities are common people with usual records keeping, and have their information  (telephone number and legal name residence and email within the documentation. </p>

<p>So your technically wrong, the real reason hackers haven&#39;t accessed these members is likely their difficulty rating. I.e. which security systems are In place. Related to the devices they use, and their encryption level. 
Most people whom make sizeable salaries are dedicated to only purchasing quality systems. Which are too top of the line in digital security. </p>

<p>Going as far as having personal digital security teams installing their servers and equipment to lessen the chances of a penetration. As well as using third parties to monitor their financial portfios. </p>

<p>What is painful is that you all expect to find juicy details in common actors inboxes, as though these members would be privy to some Area51 level clearance and topics. Which is laughable in itself-</p>

<p>Not to mention that there are much higher profile targets more easily accessible to digital intruders readily being attacked on a near daily basis-
Hence anyone which would have a clearance level and sophisticated background worth exploiting. </p>

<p>Ergo, no one cares what Oprah has to say. She&#39;s just a talk show host that exploits peoples problems on television for profit-</p>

<p>How people can argue her as a high profile target in that aspect alone, let alone a presidential candidate is shocking-</p>

<p>Tl/Dr 
Hackers are typically highly intelligent people that have better things to do with their lives then chasing celebrities, like would be fangirls-</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes this and not necessarily I am talking hypothetically. The idea is that you should have your theory based on logical reasoning based on the world around you. Thus is you we&#39;re to be wrong then things would look different. If things would look the same in a scenario where Anonymous and Wikileaks aren&#39;t controlled opposition then that is a huge red-flag in your theory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would answer with Born Again King James Bible believing Christians. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think your definition of truth doesn&#39;t match what I have found. Let me ask you these questions. Are you a &quot;Born Again King James Bible believing Christian&quot;? If so we&#39;re you raised around predominantly &quot;Born Again King James Bible believing Christian&quot;&#39;s? If so what effect would this have on your mind? Are you open to other truths? Why King James version? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Why do you think the future is already written? What is another name for Lucifer? Does this correspond with the nickname for a planet in our solar system? Is this a coincidence? Is anything a coincidence?</p>

<p>Right but the problem is before he was very articulate on the reasoning why we did not go to the moon.  He was well researched and passionate about this subject.  He has given no reason or evidence why he now completely flipped his stance.  He has not articulated why he is now contradicting his previous statements.  So what &quot;new information&quot; are you talking about? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just because a person may not agree with another person&#39;s theory doesn&#39;t explicitly imply that they are a shill. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is true but we are talking about a specific person (Joe Rogan).  For example his first episode of &#39;Joe Rogan Questions Everything&quot;  (on mainstream tv) He teams up with well known mega shill Mick West and they &quot;debunk&quot; chemtrails on the very first episode.  If you watch the show it was obvious hit pieces and not real research/experiments.</p>

<p>You can not have followed Joe through the years and not realize that he has been compromised to sell a certain narrative and now dismiss things that he used to openly question.  It is over the top obvious.  </p>
