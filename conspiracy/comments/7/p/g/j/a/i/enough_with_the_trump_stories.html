       Anyone else getting sick of trump stories being 2/3 of the content posted on this sub? Don't you people have enough sub reddits to post this crap in? There are literally hundreds of trump hate subs where you can circle jerk to trump articles. It's just getting really fucking old. Anyways, I'm just going to down vote every trump article posted on this sub and I hope the rest of you like minded people do the same.

       Selling military arms to Saudi Arabia whom funded and supported the terrorists on 9/11, bailing out the banks in interest rate schemes, recognizing Jerusalem as the capital, being bailed out of debt by Wilbur Ross from Rothschild Inc's bankruptcy advisor team and certainly much more I haven't learned about yet paint a very different picture. I recommend thinking for yourself.

       I recommend you not assume I

       It is plainly obvious that Russia has a majority stake in Trump’s headspace. Israel may well have some influence too. They aren’t mutually exclusive concepts.

       By subscribing to the Russia theory it strongly implies that you get your ideas from the media rather than due diligence.

      <p>
       They are in many ways mutually exclusive actually because Russia is supporting Syria and Syria is fighting vs. Saudi Arabian backed terrorist groups.

       I don't see any actions of Trump that are pro-Russian where I see

       actions that are pro-Israel.

        Globalism is a group of ideologies that advocate the concept of globalization. It tends to advocate for such policies as increases in immigration, interventionism, and global governance. Economically, globalism varies between free trade and lowering tariffs to Marxist proletarian internationalism. It is typically viewed as opposite of nationalism, and has become increasingly divisive in politics in many developed countries, such as the United States.--was the wiki on globalism, now has been edited hundreds of times.

       "We shall have World Government, whether or not we like it. The only question is whether World Government will be achieved by conquest or consent."
       <strong>
        —Statement by Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) member James Warburg to The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 17th, l950
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       "We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination practiced in past centuries."
       <strong>
        --David Rockefeller, founder of the Trilateral Commission, in an address to a meeting of The Trilateral Commission, in June, 1991
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Today, America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order [referring to the 1991 LA Riot]. Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond [i.e., an "extraterrestrial" invasion or Russians!!], whether real or promulgated [emphasis mine], that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government."

       "In the next century, nations as we know it will be obsolete; all states will recognize a single, global authority. National sovereignty wasn't such a great idea after all."

       "For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure--one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it."

       "The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies is to create a one-world government combining supercapitalism and Communism under the same tent, all under their control.... Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent.

       "The Trilateral Commission is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the United States. The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power political, monetary, intellectual and ecclesiastical. What the Trilateral Commission intends is to create a worldwide economic power superior to the political governments of the nationstates involved. As managers and creators of the system ,they will rule the future."

       For a long time I felt that FDR had developed many thoughts and ideas that were his own to benefit this country, the United States. But, he didn't. Most of his thoughts, his political ammunition, as it were, were carefully manufactured for him in advanced by the Council on Foreign Relations-One World Money group. Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of artillery, he exploded that prepared "ammunition" in the middle of an unsuspecting target, the American people, and thus paid off and returned his internationalist political support...... "The UN is but a long-range, international banking apparatus clearly set up for financial and economic profit by a small group of powerful One-World revolutionaries, hungry for profit and power. "The depression was the calculated 'shearing' of the public by the World Money powers, triggered by the planned sudden shortage of supply of call money in the New York money market....The One World Government leaders and their ever close bankers have now acquired full control of the money and credit machinery of the U.S. via the creation of the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank.

       I asked for two things. Your original claim is that Obama didn't count people after they were unemployed for 2 weeks. Blatant bullshit. None of these sources say that. I also asked you to show me that Trump counts unemployment differently than Obama did. None of these say that either.

       Some of us remember how IMPORTANT it was, during the Obama years, that the Dow Jones and GDP are metrics made for corporations and economists looking at aggregate measurements, not actually all that important for the vast numbers of working Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Productivity and wages have been decoupled for decades now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Dow Jones measurement is of 30 companies, and has more to do with the potential dividends their stockholders will get than anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure some people will cash out their 401k funds during this high point, but tons of people have no such savings and most people won't be cashing out now.

       So, the front page being being filled with pizzagate, anti-clinton stories etc. over the past year is fine even if they have no new developments, but breaking news on the biggest conspiracy theory should be downvoted. Got it.

       Yeah, that's exactly what I said. You can question anything your want, personally I'm sick of fucking hearing about the guy. There are so many other places to talk about trump, whether you like him or hate him, but it's getting out of hand around here. There are so many more interesting things to talk about then trump

       No, I didn’t say that whatsoever. Of course we’d be inundated with stories of her every day if she was president. That’s how the media works. Of course she’s smart enough to tweet out every idea that comes into her head so they wouldn’t have as much to work with.

       His campaign and administration is currently under investigation by a special prosecutor for...conspiracies.

       There are various foreign policy and domestic policy decisions he's made and is making that are fertile ground for discussions of...conspiracies.

       I don't think your getting it buddy. I don't care what your say about trump, I'm just tired of seeing his bullshit posted every fucking day. This sub is starting to look like r/politics, I.e. Filled with trump horse shit. I don't care if you think he's the savior or the anti Christ. it's been long enough since we've been fixated on his every move. Let's talk about something else beside the 2016 election, it's been long enough

       Leave and come back in late January 2021?

      <p>
       Until then, he's the president of the United States and any site related to conspiracies is going to have a lot of posts about him if only because of his position and power.

       Asking everyone
       <em>
        else

       to assist you in shielding your eyes from Trump posts is not taking personal responsibility nor is it a remotely reasonable request given the person, their position, and the purposes of this sub ("free thinking and discussing issues which have captured the public’s imagination").

       Just to clarify, I down vote both positive and negative stories about trump. The guy is the fucking distraction of the century and ever since 2016 the entire US has been talking non stop about trump ad nauseum.

       Yeah, that's exactly what I said. You can question anything your want, personally I'm sick of fucking hearing about the guy. There are so many other places to talk about trump, whether you like him or hate him, but it's getting out of hand around here. There are so many more interesting things to talk about then trump

       I asked for two things. Your original claim is that Obama didn't count people after they were unemployed for 2 weeks. Blatant bullshit. None of these sources say that. I also asked you to show me that Trump counts unemployment differently than Obama did. None of these say that either.
