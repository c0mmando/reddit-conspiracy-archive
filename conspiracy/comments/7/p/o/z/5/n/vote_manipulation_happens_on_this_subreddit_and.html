       Give this a try.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find a thread that deals with a controversial topic. This is r/conspiracy, so that should be easy. Topics calling out zionism, paid shilling, or vaccine safety are good candidates for this little experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go through and give upvotes to comments and users calling out these conspiracies. Refresh the page and make sure your upvotes are still there. Take careful note of which comments and users you have upvoted. Now, wait a little while. Ten minutes should do it. Now go back to that thread and take a look at all the comments you have upvoted. You may be surprised (or not) to find that some of the upvotes you have given are no longer there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does this happen? If anyone has a mundane explanation that isn't targeted vote manipulation, I'm all ears. I've tried this across many different subreddits and what I've noticed is that it only happens in conspiratorial topics. I've also noticed that it targets specific users as well. I sure as shit haven't seen it in r/aww.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, if there is a legitimate reason that this would be happening, I'd love to hear it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT:
       </strong>
       Just to be perfectly clear, when I say your upvote disappears, I mean literally your orange upvote arrow will no longer be selected. It is as if you never clicked it at all. It does not return if you refresh the page. It only returns if you re-upvote the comment. I have yet to see upvotes disappear on comments I have re-

       That doesn't seem to be the same thing I'm talking about. I mean that my literal orange upvote arrow is no longer selected. And if that is how vote fuzzing works, then why is it more prevalent with certain users and topics?

       can you post some proof ?like record how you upvote a post while connected to the internet, refresh the page and then see how the upvote's gone.maybe try on more browsers?on the phone?

       I am not sure how I can prove anything, thats why I'm suggesting people try it for themselves. The vote doesn't disappear immediately after refreshing the page, there is always a delay of several minutes. I post and vote using safari on an ipad. If it is a problem specific to this browser and tablet, that would be noteworthy for sure.

       that would imply you have an argument and proof/evidence to back said argument.

       He's asking people to test the theory for themselves. I'm not sure what your issue is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have noticed this phenomenon and have noted it in the past. In fact, recently I commented on the fact that I was looking for a particular thread that I knew a particular user that I had upvoted had commented in. I went to that users history as a shortcut to said thread and found several pages of blue arrows- as if I had downvoted every comment this user had made for 24 hours. I know for a fact that I have never downvoted this person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, how do I prove this with a screenshot? What is to say that I didn't just fake the downvotes and take a shot of it?

       Convincing you is really not a priority for me, and I honestly don't care if anyone outside this community thinks this observation sounds delusional. Those folks are welcome to test the theory themselves as OP suggests.

       When it happened, I did record it, noted it in several comments and now I'm telling you. Now it your job to test it if you give a shit or don't test it if you don't care to. Short of giving you access to my account, there isn't any other proof I can offer that would satisfy you, and that isn't going to happen. You are on your own.

       Maybe setting up a camera or a continuous screen capture or something, because obviously screen shots alone won't prove anything. Is there a way to record what is happening on your screen using an ipad? Is there an app that can do that? I really am not very tech savvy. Maybe I'll try to get a friend to help me with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But really, it can be proven if people just do it themselves. It is easy to see if you just do it.

       I refresh pages with stuff I've voted on all the time and never noticed any votes disappear. You need to get a camera and film your screen so that people it hasn't happened to can see it in action.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the boring part where you're waiting a few minutes before hitting refresh, use that part to put you talking about what you've observed/why you're filming. In the beginning of the video you can list the time at which you refresh onscreen so that people can skip the waiting part.

       This is always what they say when you bring up any of the weird vote manipulation stuff. Have you ever had particular comments get tagged for "hovering"? I dunno what to call it. It isn't vote fuzzing, because it only happens to certain comments, but it's this thing where your total vote count will hover within 3 points up or down of, say, +5 votes, and it'll stay that way for days and days, long after the thread has died out. That only started right around the election.

       I've also noticed that vote counts you can see on your comment history are sometimes much different from the vote count on your comment if viewed on the actual thread if you log out and look at it.

       you left out the word required. required explanation.

       studied world war II extensively and always think of the SS when seeing the two letters, perhaps a different standard should have been chosen if you think it so inappropriate to point out--because it'll happen again.

       no. certainly not.

       ..but a requirement where there used to be none that leads to repeatedly reading 'submission statement' and 'SS' over and over again. yes, yes this does lead me to think of brainwashing, authoritarianism and yes, because of that pesky 'SS' coincidence, those darned nazis.

       OP, interesting theory, but wouldn't it be more convenient (and covert) to just "make up" votes (whether up or down, depending on whether the offending comment is for or against the propaganda), than to cancel votes?
      </p>

       I'm not denying the plausibility of what you're saying, and I even think I've observed it myself. But if you can fuck with the DB, I don't understand the rationale. Why not just apply an arbitrary score?

       I've wondered that myself! It is very strange and I don't know why it would be happening this way. I really would like to know if there is a legitimate technical explanation for this, but after observing this for months at this point I can't image a legitimate reason it would be taregting conspiracy topics.

       Here is something I observed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed some time ago that when I make a reasonable comment on a mainstream sub (but that goes against the narrative), I
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       get the dagger, and my comment is never downvoted into oblivion. My comment will typically end-up at +1, or +2 ... (
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7mua7m/court_rules_bookkeeper_of_auschwitz_96_must_go_to/drx66w7/">
        latest example
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       So there is always exactly 50% of reasonable people, or the bots/brigade/shills make it so my comment appears ignored/irrelevant (indeed a score of -100 means at least 100 people have read it, which provides some satisfaction too).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5rnvup/the_conspiracy_of_opinions_or_how_the_state_is/">
        see this
       </a>
       . It is very important in my opinion to understand the reason for vote manipualation, and most importantly why they had to disable the actual up/down vote count.

       Agreed.  Pretty much anything that isn't a controlled narrative is in "controversial" and "new" now a days.  They are actively fighting a lot more now.

       I have comments in this sub that fluctuate wildly for months after I've made the comment. It's usually anything Trump or Hillary related, and I'm pretty sure it's from bots that scan for keywords. So if the bot finds a comment with those key names with negative or positive words then it automatically upvotes or downvotes accordingly.

       Yep, that's how I first noticed. If you go to your comment and refresh the page over and over it will fluctuate by 4 or 5 votes every split second. And for me it's pretty much only my comments on this sub or anything related to politics. I'm pretty confident it's from bots.

       Thats vote fuzzing. Every time you refresh the page reddit adds +/- x% of votes at random. Its a trick to make it harder for bot owners to know if their bots votes are ignored or not.

       Interesting that this thread is only 60% upvoted, yet most people commenting are responding positively. This always happens on topics that discuss shills or vote manipulation or other such fuckery.

       You seem pretty active and woke so let me run this theory by you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know World of Warcraft and how there are too many players to all be online in the same server at once so there were 100+ different servers you could play on, but it was the same maps.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think something similar is happening in Social Media or on the larger elements of the internet.  Divide and Conquer.
      </p>
      <p>
       This goes beyond simple shadow banning.  More of a regional or geographic shadowban.  I'm pretty sure the internet is being sectioned off into different smaller groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially when it comes to the smaller sites like Reddit.  That's why us real users never seems to get much traction.
      </p>
      <p>
       You telling me in the English speaking Western world this is it?  What we see on Reddit Conspiracy.  Probably 60-80% astroturf/shill accounts so that leave what a couple hundred actual real people.  Should be more of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we have any checks and balances to verify we are not grouped into smaller playpens on the internet?  Twitter employees just admitted on video this is rampantly already in place in their company.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if there were far more like minded people but we are all being artificially/clandestinely divided.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a thought.  If I came up with it then the puppet masters have also and/or already doing it.

       Shit man, I never thought of that but I can totally see that being the case. Awhile back there was a thread, I think on r/c_s_t but maybe somewhere else, where someone asked what region people were located. And an unusually high number of responses came from my general region of the northeast USA. There are a lot of reasons this could be the case (high population and lots of colleges and universities around here), but it did strike me as a little odd.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always thought that there were a lot more people awake to the lies, or willing to wake up, than the general reddit experience would indicate. Get someone alone and ask them what they think about 9/11 or chemtrails or whatever and you're likely to get a way different answer than if you ask them around a group of people. I think people are mostly afraid of ridicule so they just don't want to "go there." I think most people are a bit smarter and more open-minded than they are generally given credit for.

       In short: working together.
      </p>
      <p>
       I need to create a post, make some suggestions, and get more people involved. Right now I'm so busy with other stuff I don't really have the time. We all need to be thinking creatively about how to solve this problem; there aren't enough people working on it. Spam-- it's not just for emails, it's also for social networking. (somewhere in the background -- Monty Python: "I don't like spam!" -
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anwy2MPT5RE">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anwy2MPT5RE
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Astroturfing is a different matter. We need developers (Python, Ruby, C++, OpenStack), system implementers, sysadmins (Linux primarily, that would have a familiarity with GRSecurity/PaX), and DB admins (MongoDB, Reddis). I'll take inclined people who are willing to train themselves and are familiar with Agile Project Management. This project requires the ability to think outside-of-the-box, think holistically and solve problems laterally across an entire infrastructure.

       OP didn't claim that the vote arrow disappeared, they claimed that "the vote disappeared"... Which is generally attributable to vote fuzzing.

       I felt it was safe to assume that OP understands that the vote tally would change upon refreshing because she realizes that many other people are going to be contributing votes. From that assumption, it is fair to deduce that OP was describing her personal vote disappearing by way of her orange arrow changing to neutral, since that is the only way to track her personal vote.

       I didn't see in OP where the vote arrow was removed, but I doubt that's true... I'd bet a refresh would show it...
      </p>
      <p>
       And, in general, the Reddit platform is extremely extremely broken... The idea that all the good content should float to the "Front page of the internet" based on quality has been totally forked by their censorship and "clever" things like vote fuzzing...
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess my point is that Reddit is an experiment that has obviously completely failed, and it's mechanisms are really poorly developed... So I'm not surprised people are seeing issues, and I wouldn't be surprised if there is active manipulation...

       I had a similar hunch so i tried something a little different. Even if you don't believe anything about Flat Earth, try mentioning or even promoting the idea and watch. Guaranteed to be met with hatred from accounts that ONLY target FE stuff or it's down voted into Oblivion and/or is deleted.

       I did it with an old account and it was actually banned from Reddit.

       It's kind of sad, all it did was prove to me exactly what the op is talking about. It's nothing really new. They've been doing it. Just not to this extreme, which tells me someone doesn't want others to think for themselves and only believe what they see on the program box.

       That isn't the same thing I'm talking about. I know that clicking back to leave a thread can do that. I'm talking about upvoting, refreshing the page to see that your upvote is still there, and then coming back 10 - 15 minutes later and seeing that your upvote is gone.

       Sure, there's very good reason to be critical of the nation of Israel. But for every logical critic there's two white nationalists glomming onto it for nazi purposes.

       "Schilling" isn't even a thing. It's a crybaby ad hominem attack used by people who don't have fact based arguments; like fedora, and crybaby. See what I did there, crybaby? That's right. Stop saying schilling you retard.

       There's good reason to be invested in vaccine safety, but no, again there's a huge group of mouthy mommy bloggers who think Tits McCarthy's "it causes autism" meowing is true.

       To find out if your theory is true, you have to pick topics that AREN'T hot button issues and see if it still happens because there's every good reason to police those other topics on purely legitimate grounds.

       This is always what they say when you bring up any of the weird vote manipulation stuff. Have you ever had particular comments get tagged for "hovering"? I dunno what to call it. It isn't vote fuzzing, because it only happens to certain comments, but it's this thing where your total vote count will hover within 3 points up or down of, say, +5 votes, and it'll stay that way for days and days, long after the thread has died out. That only started right around the election.

       He's asking people to test the theory for themselves. I'm not sure what your issue is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have noticed this phenomenon and have noted it in the past. In fact, recently I commented on the fact that I was looking for a particular thread that I knew a particular user that I had upvoted had commented in. I went to that users history as a shortcut to said thread and found several pages of blue arrows- as if I had downvoted every comment this user had made for 24 hours. I know for a fact that I have never downvoted this person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, how do I prove this with a screenshot? What is to say that I didn't just fake the downvotes and take a shot of it?
