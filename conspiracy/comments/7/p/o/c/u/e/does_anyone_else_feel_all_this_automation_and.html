       I'm slowly working on that now.  Took a week off and started researching Bitcoin /Blockchain / AI / Singularity / Automation.
       <a href="https://youtu.be/gK2jkkB2yyc">
        I saw this video 2 months ago
       </a>
       , and since have dived down a rabbit's hole.  Now I've been gathering all the shit I've researched over the past couple months trying to piece together a self post.
       <a href="https://youtu.be/5tn4P7IBqoQ">
        Check out this video
       </a>
       , it's the general concept of what I'm looking at, but they fail to mention some of the major players pushing this stuff like: Peter Thiel, Jared Kushner, Jeff Bezos and
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7pk7rh/singularity_or_bust_full_documentary/">
        THIS GUY - Ben Goertzel

       .  Also check out singularitynet, it's his company.  Just a few clues to what I'm working on currently.

       what exactly do you mean by being something that is hard to turn away from. Thats like saying the Car would be something that would be hard to turn away from. For sure it is. But is there a need to? Maybe. And maybe we figure out in what direction to pivot with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think smart Tech will become ingrained in our everyday lives, so yes it would be hard to turn away from if there becomes a need. But the same innovation that goes into tech will go into figuring out the new tech to turn to.

       Here lies the issue. You believe that technology advances, which is a fallacy. For instance, writing and cursive writing will become non existent and will be replaced with keyboards even though writing has been proven to stimulate more brain activity and memory development.

       "There is no security against the ultimate development of mechanical consciousness, in the fact of machines possessing little consciousness now. A mollusc has not much consciousness. Reflect upon the extraordinary advance which machines have made during the last few hundred years, and note how slowly the animal and vegetable kingdoms are advancing. The more highly organised machines are creatures not so much of yesterday, as of the last five minutes, so to speak, in comparison with past time. Assume for the sake of argument that conscious beings have existed for some twenty million years: see what strides machines have made in the last thousand! May not the world last twenty million years longer? If so, what will they not in the end become? Is it not safer to nip the mischief in the bud and to forbid them further progress?" - Samuel Butler, 1872

       Uh no. They‚Äôre related.
      </p>
      <p>
       The blockchain is going to function as the transactional layer between IoT devices. There‚Äôs a cryptocurrency called IOTA which is an IoT focused transactional distributed ledger system using a tanglement algorithm for consensus. It already exists and it has a 9.7 billion dollar market cap already.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile blockchain based smart contracting systems will be used by IoT devices to negotiate with each other without the need for human intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
       The blockchain and cryptocurrency are a critical stepping stone to fully automated systems as the cryptocurrencies function as a mechanism of trade, and the blockchain functions as a distributed ledger system for keeping a record of transactional data. Meanwhile smart contracts allow devices to work together to accomplish tasks within defined parameters.

       The real question is whether there is an "end game."  If the end game is to be able to leave Earth and settle in other planets/galaxies, then pushing toward automation, AI, and hyper-efficiency makes total sense.  If the end game is more like "peace on Earth, universal happiness," then we need to pump the brakes.

       Yes, not only are we further advancing the surveillance state, but also increasing our dependence on technology. If we have something that pretty much does everything for us without us having to think about it then eventually we would become wholly dependent upon it. For example we lived a long time with no electricity, internet or cars, imagine if all that were taken away from us now and we had to go back to actually hunting and growing our own food. Many many people would not survive this. Its all about putting people into a box under the guise of convienience and security until one day you notice that its more of a prison cell than anything else and these things that are there to make life easier are really just making sure you do what you're told.

       I think the IOT stuff will lead to greater surveillance for sure, not sure how automation will affect us. I think if labor is made obsolete then the only use that the average citizen has is consumption, reproduction, and bullet fodder.

       Work in tech, live in the Bay Area. It‚Äôs already happened here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of the small shops and businesses are gone. Most of the independently owned stores are closing or going out of business or already shut down. Almost everyone with money uses Amazon and Googles delivery services to buy basic goods. Even food. There‚Äôs only a few streets left with boutique items you just can‚Äôt buy online that are still around, but that‚Äôs it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only remaining stores are major chains like Wholefoods, Safeway, Target, Best Buy, Macy‚Äôs, etc. Even then some of these locations are struggling and probably won‚Äôt make it to 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile IoT devices like Amazon echo and other smart speakers not only spy on you, but make you more dependent on their services. These smart speakers sold like hot cakes this past holiday season, and both Amazon and Google now have a foothold in millions of Americans homes. More ‚Äúsmart‚Äù products are coming as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, on the Internet we are about to experience a new wave of innovation thanks to distributed computing systems, smart contracts, blockchain, machine learning, and significant advances in cloud computing. With the advantages of virtual container technology such as Docker and Kubernetes just about everything can and will be automated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I‚Äôve spent the last 3 years building a software as a service automation system and it enables you to put a multi-million dollar software service company on steroids with just a few developers required to service hundreds of thousands of customers. It would have taken 100 employees 5 years ago to do what we can now do with 2-3 people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Automation is already here, it just hasn‚Äôt hit critical mass yet outside the major tech companies but once it does its game over for most of us. Even many knowledge workers and programmers in the tech industry will lose their jobs to automation.

       As humans we are basically on life support right now. If we pulled the plug (literally the main electrical plug) to all electricity, we would be fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at how people react when you take away their phone or even cut off their internet (remember anonymous fucking with xbox live and PSN over xmas?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, take those same people and take away things that really matter; easy access to food, clean water and shelter.

       oh they are going to force us to use it. soon even die-hards wont have a choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       everything is going to be on rental-service devices that you don't own that are monitored 24/7. you buy the device, and then rent all the services which get monitored to make sure every spare nickel is drained from your pockets.
      </p>
      <p>
       you will still have to buy new devices, since nothing will stay compatible, even simple basic stuff. as low-level knowledge becomes less common, higher level abstractions which will be platform specific will be the only programming languages 90% of people ever even know exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       things like compilers and interpreters for generic languages will no longer work on mainstream platforms, in order to 'enhance security', and each device will be locked down in firmware.
      </p>
      <p>
       everything will be an iPhone. all ownership will come down to the idea of Netflix. the danger of digital, as much as I love it, is that over time, things really could get locked down, monitored and spied on 24/7.
      </p>
      <p>
       it opens the potential to help shift to a rental economy with concepts of planned obsolescence, Software as a service instead of a product, and the idea of telecoms providers as owners of independent networks and not gatekeepers of access to the ONLY public network.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fear this future, but I can see it coming. I can see it coming in the trends in computer science and security. Companies already love games consoles and iPads and other managed consumer environments -- they don't like the potential for people to use high-level features against them (piracy, blackhats, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       eventually the compromise will be pushed by security, after getting people used to the new way of doing business over a generation or two. People will say its just too dangerous to let anyone write code not in a managed language like .NET but on steroids.
      </p>
      <p>
       for the most part, people wont object to it, because it will make productivity easier, lower wages/barrier to entry in the field by making it an easier job where coders don't have to know all the complicated low level stuff -- which is already (mostly) kept alive only by hobbyist communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       but that is only one, small benefit, as opposed to increasing prices if calculated yearly to all consumers, eliminating piracy in total, and total control/observation of the populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       everything will have backdoors back to the sources, but ultimately be nigh-impervious to exploit yourself -- meaning security from most outside hackers, but none from the government/corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO this trade is not worthwhile.
