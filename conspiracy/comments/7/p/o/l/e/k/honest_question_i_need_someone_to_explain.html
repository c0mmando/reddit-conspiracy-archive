       Not that this is the main assertion of the Russia conspiracy folks, but nearly every voting machine in the US, and thus most of the votes in the swing states that decided the election, are unaccountable and fairly easily hackable.

       Well that's one of the main avenues for the US deep state to hack elections themselves (eg 2004), so of course TPTB aren't going to talk about it.  There's been plenty of discussion of this possibility though outside of government officials and corporate media though.

       I never said anything about Russia. Russia didn't do shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, I mean, they did. They bribed Obama administration officials and got that Uranium One deal. Then the Clinton campaign decided to attack Trump over alleged connections to Russia to distract from her own corrupt dealings she pulled while Secretary of State.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia didn't hack anything though, nor did they particularly influence the election. I mean, you could say that they ran RT and produced news segments, and people who saw those news segments containing true legitimate news could have been "influenced"... But why shouldn't RT be allowed to run an international cable news channel? Is it illegal for me to watch RT on YouTube because if I did, that means Russia hacked the election? It's all just bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       ps I showed that article because it shows significant irregularities in the vote data, there's no way it's legitimate. There were more votes in precincts than there even were registered voters. I'm suggesting that it was tampered with electronically, i.e. hacked. It's also possible the votes were cheated in some other way, but I think electronic editing is the simplest explanation.

       Some vote systems were hacked actually
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        DHS' acting Director of Cyber Division of the department's Office of Intelligence and Analysis, Samuel Liles, said that by late September the intelligence community concluded that 21 states "were potentially targeted by Russian government-linked cyber actors" with scanning of Internet-connected election systems. Liles did not specify which 21 states he was referring to.

         We assess with high confidence that the GRU relayed material it acquired from the DNC and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks.
        </strong>
        Moscow most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its self- proclaimed reputation for authenticity.  Disclosures through WikiLeaks did not contain any evident forgeries.

         <p>
          In early September, Putin said publicly it was important the DNC data was exposed to WikiLeaks, calling the search for the source of the leaks a distraction and denying Russian “state-level” involvement.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          The Kremlin’s principal international propaganda outlet RT (formerly Russia Today) has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks. RT’s editor-in-chief visited WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in August 2013, where they discussed renewing his broadcast contract with RT, according to Russian and Western media.  Russian media subsequently announced that RT had become "the only Russian media company" to partner with WikiLeaks and had received access to "new leaks of secret information."  RT routinely gives Assange sympathetic coverage and provides him a platform to denounce the United States.

       Meanwhile, multiple attempts to discredit WikiLeaks by other means have backfired dramatically on the establishment propaganda organizations involved. Glenn Greenwald's been writing about that since CNN/CBS/MSNBC printed claims that WaPo falsified then refused to discuss the process by which the false claims made it into print. Here's Glenn's latest on the topic:

        Covering the Trump presidency has not always been the media’s finest hour, but even grading on that curve, the month of December has brought astonishing screwups. Professor and venerable political observer Walter Russell Mead tweeted on December 8, “I remember Watergate pretty well, and I don’t remember anything like this level of journalistic carelessness back then. The constant stream of ‘bombshells’ that turn into duds is doing much more to damage the media than anything Trump could manage.”

        I was sitting in the nearly empty restaurant of the Westin Hotel in Alexandria, Virginia, getting ready for a showdown with the federal government that I had been trying to avoid for more than seven years. The Obama administration was demanding that I reveal the confidential sources I had relied on for a chapter about a botched CIA operation in my 2006 book, “State of War.” I had also written about the CIA operation for the New York Times, but the paper’s editors had suppressed the story at the government’s request. It wasn’t the only time they had done so.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So what you're doing here is spreading an unsubstantiated claim that was disavowed by Obama, pushed by a known propaganda outlet, rejected by the public at large and has provoked an attack by the less corrupt establishment media outlets.

       Shortly after the election the vague claim in the media was that Russia "hacked" the election.  Since then they've switched around between words like "influenced, "meddled", and "colluded".  Russia bought a few thousand dollars worth of Facebook ads.  Big fucking deal.

       Ironically Every part of the system could be corrupt. The other comments are correct about the accusations of "influence". But at this point with electoral voting it is a pay to win scenario. A lot of money rode on Hilary Clinton. Problem is attention was more valuable than a candidate in prison. With every system so diversely corrupt they all still fell for escapism. "Leaders" my ass.
