       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you believe that vaccines are completely safe and effective?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you have any studies showing the current CDC recommended schedule is safe?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you believe that giving more than one vaccine at a time is safe?
If so, how many vaccines do you think is safe to give in a single visit?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you have any studies that can back up your opinion that more than one vaccine at a time is safe?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you do any
         <strong>
          screening
         </strong>
         to identify children who are at risk of being vaccine injured?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you give vaccines to kids who are currently sick?

       <li>
        <p>
         Do you screen children for allergies to substances in vaccines before giving them? (Such as egg, latex, yeast, neomycin and so forth?)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What studies did you use to justify vaccines exceeding the FDA’s daily limits on aluminum?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Would you be comfortable taking the current CDC vaccine schedule yourself?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Would you be comfortable adjusting that schedule for differences in weight and taking it (meaning 15 Dtap vaccines at once to account for larger body weight than an infant’s)?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you screen for mitochondrial disorders prior to vaccination?

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you screen for genetic mutations like MTHFR that make kids unable to detoxify from vaccines and increases their likelihood of having an adverse reaction?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you read your patients the insert before every vaccine and identify reactions they should watch out for?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you follow up after vaccinations to identify any adverse events and report them to VAERs?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you have any studies that injecting every child with both male and female DNA from aborted fetuses is safe and doesn’t affect sexuality or personal identity?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Can you provide a purity test to ensure that vaccines are free from mycoplasmas, retrovirus and parasites?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Can you provide a purity test to ensure the vaccine doesn’t contain the weed killer Round Up (glyphosate)?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you have a test that can determine the levels of aborted tissue in vaccines containing human DNA?

       Such a virtuous person. It is amazing how you can be so absolute.  Such a well of unquestionable knowledge.  So in your perfect little world any differing opinion is idiocy, so smug.

       There's myriad vaccines out there. Some good, some with more risks. I don't believe anyone is arguing against the concept of vaccination so much as they are speculative that each and every vaccine is completely harmless.

       Many stone fruits contain toxic chemicals: cyanide. And yet we eat them. Why do you think that is?
      </p>
      <p>
       People have tried very, very hard to find proof of bad effects of these vaccines, and yet there have been no significant side effects discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those studies that did show it were later demonstrated to have falsified their data.
      </p>
      <p>
       So whatever's in vaccines (as in the case of stone fruits), it hasn't demonstrably hurt us, and it
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       demonstrably helped us.

       Sureley you missed the fact there is in the USA a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court">
        special court
       </a>
       to deal with vaccine injuries, a
       <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/">
        special fund
       </a>
       to compensate the victims, and that the proceedings of this court are kept secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you may want to look into the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act">
        National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act
       </a>
       , and ask yourself whether it was enacted by Reagan to defend patients, or pharmaceutical companies.

       No, but I haven't exactly been looking either to be fair. Based on the few studies I've glossed over, I'm wary of vaccines, and separately have my own negative personal experiences with other hardcore pharmaceuticals. I am most concerned with seemingly irrelevant adjuvants such as peanuts, as peanut allergies have progressed to the point where you can't even bring a plate of cookies to a public function for fear of sending someone into anaphylactic shock.

       Despite an autoimmune condition that's thrice come close to taking my life, I'm drug free, though have never felt better. In my situation, there wasn't a correlation between medicine and healing. I don't discount the concept of vaccines, but the careless execution of the idea is what concerns me. Equally frightening is the money behind these drugs. Profits outweigh human cost up to a certain point, and I find this to be abhorrent.

       All true.  The problem is a soon as you start asking question the Doctors get defensive by putting on a patronizing and passive aggressive attitude.  They’ll ask you if you have any questions but clearly resent patients for asking question especially good questions about the quality of their own care.

       Had a self-described Merck executive show up on my fb feed a few days ago ranting incoherently when I dared question the schedule and vaccine makers lack of accountability. When asked to address those specific issues, he had no argument whatsoever and devolved instantly into an ad hominem attack. He clearly felt personally attacked by the concept of accountability and tried to lump me in as an anti-vaxxer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the funny part: I'm completely pro-vax. My kids are fully vaxxed (although not according to the schedule), I'm fully vaxxed, hell even my cats are fully vaxxed. I think it's reasonable to question the schedule as there's very little research into it so far. I would go so far to say that if as a parent you haven't researched and questioned the schedule, you aren't doing your parental due diligence. And I find the special court and laws surrounding vaccine manufacturer's accountability HIGHLY suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't even get a chance to mention that I think the government requiring vaccines is fundamentally immoral, as I had to cut him off after the ad hom. Dude obviously had no idea what to do with a nuanced position. I was either with him or against him, and if I dared question the authority of Big Pharma, I was automatically an uneducated, uninformed anti-vaxxer in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lesson I had reinforced from this experience: People within any given industry or profession are the first line of propaganda. They vehemently believe it themselves as their own self-worth depends on it.

       People are afraid of diseases. The thought that, "If you/your kids don't get vaccinated, then me/my kids will die!" is enough to short circuit any interest someone might have in people's medical rights or investigating whether vaccines might be less than perfect in every way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm scared of diseases, too, but I think the right approach is for society to pressure people to stay home when they're sick, to wear a mask while they're sick, and in the case of Ebola, quarantine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most deadly illnesses start off looking like regular illnesses, so if people routinely stay home with mild ones then when someone catches something deadly but thinks it's not, they'll stay home anyway and it won't spread.

        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you have any idea what is in this particular vial or are you just trusting the label?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you have the expertise and equipment to test the contents of this particular vial? Can we do that now?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Will you sign an agreement to assume full responsibility if my child is injured by this vaccine?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you vaccinate your own children?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         May I inject you with this vaccine, dose adjusted for your bodyweight, and wait 3 months for any adverse side-effects before injecting my child?

       Regarding #1 I just want to point this study out. Basically shows that NICU babies crash after vaccines, yet the conclusion says they're still good to give LOL

       Sureley you missed the fact there is in the USA a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court">
        special court
       </a>
       to deal with vaccine injuries, a
       <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/">
        special fund
       </a>
       to compensate the victims, and that the proceedings of this court are kept secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you may want to look into the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act">
        National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act
       </a>
       , and ask yourself whether it was enacted by Reagan to defend patients, or pharmaceutical companies.
