<p>Edit: I&#39;ll add some thought to this.</p>

<p>OPs assertion is stupid. He is demonized for the murder of people under his watch. How many and who really doesn&#39;t matter here since there is proof he was responsible for their demise. Be it 10 people or 6 gorillion the blood of innocents still stains his legacy, something his &quot;good intentions&quot; cannot erase.</p>

<p>So if short, fuck off with this bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People do die in work camps in time of war as has been the case since beginning of time. In this you are correct. </p>

<p>However I will tell you that when Hitler started smashing into Russian lines he showed soviet POW&#39;s fair treatment at a time when Soviets were killing their own officers who were captured. </p>

<p>So it is war and people died in huge numbers on every side. Am I saying Hitler is an angel? No, I am saying he stood up to a very powerful usury driven deep state entity and the reason you are conditioned to hate him is because he almost won. </p>

<p>ah okay, now i got your point... That must be the reason why he was so fine with Krupp, IG-Farben, Siemens, Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, Rheinmetall, Thyssen and Dresdner Bank to name a few, simply because these were the greatest charity organisations ever working on a non-profit manner and absolutely non-establishment. The Robin Hoods of capitalism for sure, how could we forgot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, really. </p>

<p>Hitler believed that the Jews were a stain on humanity and had to be removed from it. He believed that they were the reason Germany was doing poorly, and he believed that they were weighing down Germany. With this, he killed thousands upon thousands of Jews, as well as other &quot;undesirables&quot;, such as homosexuals, mentally and physically handicapped, etc.</p>

<p>Yes, he killed a whole lotta people, for no reason other than opinion and belief.</p>

<p>However, he did whisk Germany out of the Depression, he did give thousands of Germans jobs. It&#39;s true that these jobs were helping the war effort, and they were driving Hitler more towards the decision of war.</p>

<p>Hitler, morally, was scum. </p>

<p>Hitler as a leader, was wonderful. </p>

<p>These positive things that he did are in the shadow of the awful things that he did. I&#39;m not trying to make Hitler out as the good guy, but it&#39;s just as important to know the good things he did. </p>

<p><em>Any</em> industrialised nation committed to total war will all but eliminate unemployment. The same things happened in Britain and the USSR when they turned their economies entirely towards the war effort. Hell, one of the major milestones in securing labour rights for women in many nations was that they were mobilised to help the war-effort due to the shortfall of men. </p>

<p>Unemployment dropping in Germany during WWII has <em>absolutely nothing</em> to do with any particular qualities that Hitler had as a leader, and everything to do with the nature of industrialised warfare at the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  Hitler offered peace several times before WW2 broke out.  The problem is that Hitler had taken control of the German central bank and issued his own currency, which was based on labor.  This eliminated usury.  That is Hitler&#39;s crime.  </p>

<p>JFK attempted to do the same thing, and we all know what happened to him.  JFK actually admired Hitler&#39;s economic policies.  </p>

<p>Also, you should consider that many Jews could have been saved from the camps, but the Allies would not save them.  Hitler wanted to send them to Madagasgar.  So, if Hitler is evil for the Holocaust, then aren&#39;t the Allies just as evil for not saving more Jews?  </p>

<p>Why would the Allies not save the Jews from the camps?  I know, but not many other people know...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on what you mean.  Hitler knew what the Communist Bolsheviks were doing to the Slavic people, and Hitler wanted to prevent that from happening to the German people.  This is reasonable, right?  Hitler saw a rise in Bolshevism in Germany in the 1920&#39;s onward.  </p>

<p>I mean, you see what is currently happening in Europe, right?  It is reasonable to want to prevent that from happening here in America.  I am assuming you are American...  Guess who is behind what is happening in Europe?  </p>

<p>Hitler made the mistake of over expanding.  He thought he could get away with it, and there was nobody brave enough to tell him no.  Another mistake Hitler made is that he was a mere Corporal, but he was trying to play General.  These are mistakes from the German point of view, of course.  </p>

<p>Have you looked at the Spanish Civil War?  It was fought between July 17, 1936 and April 1, 1939, so it ended before WW2 began.  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War</a></p>

<p>Look at the &quot;Belligerents&quot; on the right hand side of the wiki page.  </p>

<p>The Republicans were Communists, and were supported by the Bolshevik controlled Soviet Union.  </p>

<p>The Nationalists were supported by Nazi Germany.  Hitler helped Spain because he did not want Spain to fall to the Bolsheviks.  Germany would then have Bolsheviks on both sides.  </p>

<p>One interesting fact is that Hitler was &quot;friendly&quot; with the Vatican and Jesuits, but the Vatican and Jesuits created Communism.  I am not sure Hitler fully understood this.  Hitler was friendly from the point of view that he did not invade Vatican City when he controlled Italy.  </p>

<p>Hitler also did not invade Switzerland, which is where the international bankers kept a lot of their gold.  Same with the Vatican.  It seems like Hitler had the chance to capture most of the world&#39;s gold, but didn&#39;t.  He could have ruled the planet financially if he did.  I will add this to the mistakes I mentioned above...  </p>

<p>The international bankers, including George Herbert Walker and Prescott Bush, helped fund the rise of Hitler.  Why would they do this if Hitler was such a horrible person?  In fact, Allen Dulles was sent to meet with Hitler before he became Chancellor.  Hitler was told by Dulles that he can only be Chancellor on the condition that he honors the German loans to the international bankers.  This was 1933.  </p>

<p>Why would the international bankers risk loaning money to Hitler unless they knew Hitler would make them a profit?  These people are not stupid.  These bankers tried to prevent the entry of the U.S. into WW2 because they were making so much money.  </p>

<p>Sure, that doesn&#39;t sound like post hoc rationalization the Nazi&#39;s made up for domestic reasons at all. That totally justifies occupying Poland for years, and claiming it as &quot;living space&quot; that the German people were naturally entitled to. I bet France, Hungary, Belgium, Luxemburg, Norway, Czekoslovakia, Greece, Albania, Lithuania, Ukraine, <em>also</em> &quot;abused Germans living in their territory&quot;, yeah?</p>

<p>I sincerely hope you don&#39;t really believe this shit, because there&#39;s a reason no-one else does...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Because they&#39;re bankers; they lend people money. That&#39;s what &quot;banker&quot; means.</p>

<p>And, are seriously you asking why the bankers didn&#39;t refuse to lend Germany money in 1933, on the grounds that they&#39;d invade Poland in 1939? </p>

<p>You can try to spin it and obfuscate however you want, but in the end the inescapable act is that it was the Nazis who either invaded, or tried to invade, over a dozen other sovereign nations, causing the biggest conflict in human history, and resulting in the deaths of tens of millions, including millions of Germans. All of which they justified with the idea that the superior German people were naturally entitled to &quot;living space&quot; (in other nations&#39; territory). Believe it or not, most people see that as a fair bit worse than your accusations of dubious lending practices.</p>

<p>If Germans in the Danzig were being abused by Poles and Hitler sought to protect them, then Hitler appears less of a madman.  This contradicts your belief that Hitler was a warmongering madman.  Sorry.  </p>

<p>Bankers do not have to lend money to a &quot;madman&quot;, right?   I mean, that is your position.   Hitler was a madman and the bankers enabled him to wage war throughout Europe by loaning him money.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And what land did Germany lose to Norway in the treaty of Versailles? Or Finland? Or Bulgaria or Romania or Hungary?</p>

<p>And Borders change when nations lose wars. Thats&#39; how wars work. And there&#39;s no &quot;takesies backsies&quot;.  By your logic, the USA is British land unfairly occupied by Americans. It doesn&#39;t work like that. Besides, 1918 Germany conceded those territory losses, <em>and</em> Hitler validated them <em>again</em> with the German-Polish non-aggression pact in 1934. There&#39;s no possible way you can slice that shit that gives Germany legal claim to the land <em>they actually lost</em> in Versailles- let alone the vast majority of land they occupied in WW2, which was <em>never</em> German territory.</p>

<p>You keep giving these piecemeal rationalizations, that <em>even if they were reasonable</em> (which they patently aren&#39;t) would only justify a tiny percentage of German WW2 expansionism.</p>

<p>Yes, Versailles granted Poland a significant chunk of land that formerly belonged to Germany (til Germany lost it, in the exact same way as all the other myriad countries that lose territory when they lose wars). But [a] Hitler himself signed, and repeatedly swore to uphold, a non-aggression pact  stating they accepted the borders as defined by [b] Versailles which would be binding whether or not Hitler agreed to it (which he did) and [c] the Germans didn&#39;t just take back <em>that</em> land (which Hitler has conceded was now Poland), they occupied <em>all</em> Poland, and used that as a base to push out into Eastern Europe, deeper into territory which had <em>never</em> been within 500 miles of a German border.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s just Poland- Nazi invasion of other countries was even more impossible justify with that &quot;old borders&quot;, &quot;lets pretend history never happened&quot; shit. The amount of other Nations&#39; soveriegn territory that the Nazi&#39;s illegally occupied at the height of WW2 was dozens of times more than the land Germany legally agreed to cede after WW1. </p>

<p>So now, in your &quot;woke history&quot; <em>losing</em> a war <em>gains you</em> vast tracts of territory!?! Sure- that makes sense, and <em>I&#39;m</em> the one who &quot;really drank the koolade&quot;. </p>

<p>And you keep trying to put this &quot;madman&quot;, &quot;Hitler was  crazy&quot; shit in my mouth; where did I ever say, or even imply that? The fact that you&#39;re so fixated on creating this strawman speaks volumes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have no idea what you mean in your paragraph about 1933 and 1939. It is nonsensical.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. That was the point. I was repeating <em>your own</em> non-sensical logic to highlight the fact that it is non-sensical; You keep saying &quot;why would the bankers back Hitler (which they did in 1933) if he&#39;s so crazy?&quot; But Hitler was just another European leader in 1933; his &quot;crazyness&quot; (as you keep trying to frame it- but I&#39;m assuming you mean &quot;acts of war, and breaches of international law&quot;) only became apparent when he started his unrivalled-in-modern-history expansionism- in 1939. How are your (((bankers))) supposed to know what would happen six years in the future?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are merely learning it for the first time, and it undermines your belief system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are merely wrong. Twice. All these rationalizations are just oh-so-obviously irrelevent, because <em>Hitler invaded 2/3rds of Europe, and tried to invade the rest</em>. You keep trying to get lost in the weeds, but the big picture is obviously 10000% unjustifiable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hitler invaded those countries after the war had progressed.  You understand that it was a changing situation, right?  Hitler made a mistake because he over extended himself.  </p>

<p>Hitler was selected to be a dupe to further a certain agenda.  Hitler had no idea about his role in this dance.  If he did, then he never would have been friendly with the Vatican or the bankers.  Hitler had captured a Rothschild, and then ransomed him back.  If Hitler knew his role in this dance, then he never would have ransomed the Rothschild.  Hitler got played by both the banker and the Vatican.  </p>

<p><strong>Hitler was a dupe until he took control of the German central bank and issued his own currency.</strong>    The bankers did not have a problem with Hitler until he did this.  Hitler was making them a ton of money, but it stopped once Hitler took over the German central bank and issued his own currency.  Hitler was making the bankers so much money that the bankers sought to delay the entry of the U.S. into WW2.  FDR forced the U.S. into WW2 by allowing Pearl Harbor to happen.  </p>

<p>In the time leading up to WW2 and after WW2 started, the bankers did nothing to save the poor Jews.  They left them to their fate!  </p>

<p>Notice that Hitler did not invade Vatican City or Switzerland.  Why do you suppose that is?  I am not even sure Hitler bombed the City of London, which is where the Bank of England is located.  The Bank of England is the bank of the Vatican.  </p>

<p>I am more interested in Hitler&#39;s rise to power and the agenda that put him there.  The rest of your comments are not worth responding to.  Those are events that happened after the war started.  Of course Hitler invaded those countries.  Once it became clear that there was not going to be peace, Hitler had to block the Allied forces and prevent them from acquiring natural resources.  The (((Allies))) considered it an act of war for Hitler to take control of the German central bank and to issue his own currency, so there was not going to be peace once that happened.  Churchill was given his marching orders by the bankers and there was no turning back. </p>

<p>Do you realize that the same families and organizations that used Hitler to further their agenda are still at work today?  </p>

<p>Let me ask you this.  What do you think of Muammar Gaddaffi?  Why do you suppose he was taken out?  What about Lincoln and JFK?  See a pattern here?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hitler accidentally got tricked into attempting to invade all of Europe? You realize how completely nonsensical that idea is?</p>

<p>But it&#39;s always funny when Nazi apologists play the &quot;poor Hitler was a hapless victim; outsmarted by the superior intelligence of the Jews because he was mentally weak enough to be manipulated&quot; card. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Switzerland and Vatican City were two of the only European countries to remain neutral throughout WW2. If the Nazis had taken VC, they would have burnt bridges with their ultra-Catholic ally, Mussolini. And by the time that alliance with Italy crumbled, the Germans had their hands full with the Eastern front, and Vatican City was surrounded with Allied troops. </p>

<p>And Switzerland is the only country in Europe that has never been invaded by anyone in over 500 years, because it&#39;s surrounded on all sides by mountains- it&#39;s geography makes it naturally almost invasion-proof, and the Swiss have been building on those natural defences for centuries. </p>

<p>lol. Yeah, it&#39;s hard to spin the fact that Hitler went back on a Non-aggression Pact that he chose to sign, or the treaty of Versailles, that previous German leaders chose to sign (I notice you skipped over <em>that</em>, despite the rest of your autistic drivel).</p>

<p>Anyway, I just wanted to make sure there was a clear explanation in this thread of exactly why your ideas are laughably retarded, for the sake of anyone coming back on it later. And I&#39;m sure you have other people to try to bait into talking about your &quot;madman Hitler&quot; meme, or the Holocaust or <em>(((Da Jooz)))</em> or whatever, so I&#39;ll leave you to it. It&#39;s been fun, though...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course they knew how bad it was...  The camps started before war even broke out.  The &quot;Jewish&quot; international bankers could have saved a lot of poor Jews, but they did not.  Why is that?  </p>

<p>A lot of what you are posting occurred after the war had started.  I will look though.  I have read quite a bit about WW2, so I am aware of the atrocities.  There were a lot of atrocities between the beginning of WW1 and the end of WW2.  </p>

<p>It seems like this discussion is mostly about the economics of Germany pre-WW2.  At least, my original post is about the economic reform that got Germany out of the depression it was in.  It did not happen because Hitler created a war economy.  Hitler took control of the German central bank and the issuance of the currency-Hitler got rid of usury and the German economy recovered and grew into a powerhouse.  That is my point.  </p>

<p>Just to be clear about what I am getting at.  The U.S. currently has a war economy that is not sustainable unless we have perpetual war.  No moral human being wants perpetual war.  The way to get rid of the U.S. war economy is to get rid of usury by nationalizing the Federal Reserve and by issuing a currency that is not a Federal Reserve Note.  </p>

<p>I personally think that we should have multiple currencies- at least one cryptocurrency and one or more paper currency.  That way it is decentralized and much more difficult for one person or group to enslave everyone else.  </p>

<p>We need to nationalize the Federal Reserve, right?  The POTUS has the Constitutional power to issue a currency that is interest free.

    <div class="md"><p>The Nazis borrowed prodigious sums to finance the re-armament of Germany, the Autobahns and the social benefits the Germans received. &quot;Fortunately&quot;, at the very moment the chips were due to fall and they would have had to face insolvency, they started the war and turned it into a great expopriation scheme. That the Nazis looted all Europe and made it pay and work for the war machine is quite well-known; the mechanics of the process shows that the German was effort was to a large degree a financial pyramid, where the conquered countries and the murdered Jews were looted to pay off the deficits the Nazis had kept accruing.
Yes, great social programs paid for from the blood sweat and tears of occupied counties and their people. I mean really? Germany was absolutely devastated financially after the great depression. Where do you think the Nazis got the money for all those great social programs? Because we all know that just printing money didn&#39;t work out well for them. So just so we are clear, international bankers bad, genocide and slave labor good, because we have to have those great social programs, and what better way to pay for it then the exploitation and murder of millions of people. Glad we have our priorities straight.</p>

<p>I am sorry, but you have no idea what you are talking about.  You do not know the real history of what happened between WW1 and WW2.  </p>

<p>Here is a great starting point for you:  </p>

<p>WWI to WWII: Daniel Sheehan - 4-21-2016</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/BDurYQ8xSv4?list=PLVza7sesLJh5ZR8exn0lKoCjC3ayShvdd">https://youtu.be/BDurYQ8xSv4?list=PLVza7sesLJh5ZR8exn0lKoCjC3ayShvdd</a></p>

<p>Up to about the 27 minute mark is a review of his previous lecture, then he starts getting into Germany, WW1, the Dulles Brothers, the loans given to German post-WW1, and the international bankers involved.  </p>

<p>Here is a flow chart that shows the connections between the people and organizations involved.  A good portion of the flowchart is not relevant to our discussion, but look at the center and to the top right.  Brown Brothers Harriman is at the center, and Hitler is at the top right.  Notice the names associated with Brown Brothers Harriman.  Also notice that George Herbert Walker and Prescott Bush are listed.  Prescott Bush is the father of George Herbert Walker Bush, and George Herbert Walker is the grandfather.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once I really am in power, my first and foremost task will be the annihilation of the Jews. As soon as I have the power to do so, I will have gallows built in rows‚Äîat the Marienplatz in Munich, for example‚Äîas many as traffic allows. Then the Jews will be hanged indiscriminately, and they will remain hanging until they stink; they will hang there as long as the principles of hygiene permit. As soon as they have been untied, the next batch will be strung up, and so on down the line, until the last Jew in Munich has been exterminated. Other cities will follow suit, precisely in this fashion, until all Germany has been completely cleansed of Jews. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are only two possibilities in Germany; do not imagine that the people will forever go with the middle party, the party of compromises; one day it will turn to those who have most consistently foretold the coming ruin and have sought to dissociate themselves from it. And that party is either the Left: and then God help us! for it will lead us to complete destruction - to Bolshevism, or else it is a party of the Right which at the last, when the people is in utter despair, when it has lost all its spirit and has no longer any faith in anything, is determined for its part ruthlessly to seize the reins of power - that is the beginning of resistance of which I spoke a few minutes ago. Here, too, there can be no compromise - there are only two possibilities: either victory of the Aryan, or annihilation of the Aryan and the victory of the Jew. </p>

<p>Why would Hitler allow the Bolsheviks to do to Germany what they did to Russia?  Hitler knew what they did, and he saw it beginning to happen in Germany.  Just like it is happening now in Europe.  It would be happening here in the U.S. today, but the cunt lost the election.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that Hitler fought the Bolsheviks and took control of the German central bank.  Hitler also created his own currency, which was based on labor.   This is the real reason WW2 happened.   The international bankers will not tolerate such behavior.  </p>

<p>Now, compare this to what Lincoln did, and what JFK tried to do.  </p>

<p>Lincoln issued his own currency, in accordance with the U.S. Constitution, so he would not have to pay the extemely high interest rates to the bankers to fund the Union.  The bankers missed out on the interest payments, and had Lincoln killed because of it.   </p>

<p>JFK took steps to do the same thing, and was killed for it.  JFK studied and admired Hitler&#39;s economic policy.  </p>

<p>To answer your question, yes, I am comparing Trump to Hitler in the context of my above statements.   </p>

<p>If you believe that Hitler was all evil and did nothing good, then you will not get what I am saying.  That is fine.  You can do your own research, or continue to believe whatever you believe.   </p>

<p>Here is an extremely useful flowchart he provides.  The bankers are at the center, and Hitler is at the top right.  </p>

<p>Not rhetoric.  Daniel Sheehan explains who the deep state is.  They want to enslave humanity, and I am fighting against that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The situation is you are saying that x is bad, when it is really x and y, because x would not exist without y.  My point is that x did not magically appear.  They are intimately connected.  You are saying that x is bad like x exists in a vacuum.  This is very misleading, and you are omitting material facts.  You are also saying that x did evil, which is true, but y could have stopped x from doing evil.  You seem to not recognize this.  </p>

<p>Is your position that Hitler&#39;s economic policies are all evil because of the Final Solution?  So, a person does something evil, which means that all they do or have done is evil.  Is that your logic?  </p>

<p>From my point of view, it is not rhetoric because we are discussing verifiable historical facts.  What did I say that can be considered rhetoric?  How are you defining rhetoric?  </p>

<p>My original comment was about Hitler&#39;s economic policies, then I get messages saying I support or deny the Holocaust.  LOL.  It is like I say that Hitler liked to eat eggs for breakfast, and I am accused of hating Jews.  </p>

<p>I have read about how Hitler was able to turn around the German economy so fast.  What strikes me as being important is he took control of the German central bank from the international bankers and he issued his own currency, which was based on labor.  These acts were considered acts of war.  They still are.  Look at what is happening to NK and Iran.  The only other country without a Rothschild controlled central bank is Cuba.  However, I have heard that other countries are backing out.  We will see what happens, though.  They might get a dose of American &quot;Freedom and Democracy&quot;.  </p>

<p>What also strikes me is that Lincoln issued greenbacks to fund the Union during the Civil War.  The greenbacks were issued without interest.  Lincoln did this because the bankers would not give him loans at reasonable rates.  </p>

<p>Then there is JFK...  JFK was taking steps to move back to the gold standard, as required by the U.S. Constitution, and JFK signed an Executive Order to issue a currency that is not part of the Federal Reserve.  </p>

<p>Am I the only one that sees a pattern here?  </p>

Not to mention the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger_Plan">hunger plan</a> in which Slavs and Jews were intentionally starved to make room for German settlers. </p>

<p>Any Slav, current or in the past who became or collaborated with Nazis are traitors working against the good of themselves themselves and their people. The world can have more than one evil, and the Nazis were evil even if the Soviets were also evil. Comparing the levels of evil of the administrations is a pointless affair, as if half your family was murdered by one and the other half murdered by the other, you wouldn&#39;t be saying &quot;well, the Nazis aren&#39;t so bad, they only murdered my cousins and uncles and didn&#39;t murder my mother who I love dearly&quot;.</p>

<p>Fuck you, and fuck anyone who denies the Holocaust or the evils of the Nazis. My family personally suffered from war crimes committed by the Soviets, and I hate them, but that doesn&#39;t make me excuse the crimes of the Nazis. The &quot;good&quot; they did for Germans pale in comparison to the evils committed not only against Jews, Slavs, and other conquered peoples, but to countless Germans themselves. Skepticism is fine, denying undeniable historical truths is not. Go look at all the photos, videos, personal accounts, sites of the crimes, and the other mountains of evidence yourself. You will not only be sickened by the end, but if you have at least a few braincells left you&#39;ll be convinced of this fact as well.</p>

<p>Nothing really demonstrates military prowess like losing a war, does it? But even if the Germans had been able to take Stalingrad, how would that have ended the war. It isn&#39;t like Stalingrad had a secret &quot;Red Army Self-Destruct&quot; button.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Caucasus oil fields provided 80% of Soviet oil, and Stalingrad was on the flank of Army Group South who were tasked with taking these oil fields, so Army Group Center was tasked with capturing the city. If Stalingrad fell, Army Group South&#39;s flank would be secured and Red Army units in the Caucasus would be cut off, hence it was extremely important for both sides to capture the city. Army Group Center&#39;s failure to capture the city forced Army Group South to retreat, and put Germany on the defensive as the Red Army took the initiative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well initially they expected Germany to make a push for Moscow, and many German generals also wanted to take Moscow. Even after Case Blue started, the Soviets still expected a push for Moscow, and kept significant reserves deployed in and around the capitol. The attack never materialized, their failure to take Stalingrad put them on the backfoot, and a series of aggressive counter-attacks forced them away from Moscow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wut? The Germans didn&#39;t attack Stalingrad until over a year after they first invaded Russia. They attacked <em>Leningrad</em> early on, but they took it pretty swiftly. </p>

<p>It kinda sounds like you&#39;re referring to how they came within a weeks march of <em>Moscow</em>, ie the capital, in the first 3 months of the invasion which would have been devestating...but then they got beaten back and never came close to it again. </p>

<p>Also why do you think them taking Stalingrad would have defeated Russia? Stalingrad wasn&#39;t the capital or anything and the only reason they attacked it to begin with was because they wanted to cut off communications via the Volga river from the south of the country. Which is to say the opposite direction from the capital, because they wanted the oil reserves in the south. Doing so wouldn&#39;t have &quot;ended bolshevism&quot; because the entire red army was hundreds of miles north of there</p>

<p>The funny thing is Germany probably could have taken Stalingrad and then the caucasus too.....if it hadn&#39;t been for Hitler. Operation Blue was meant to be a 2 stage plan; Wermacht Army Group B would take Stalingrad after which Army Group A would invade and occupy the Caucasus. It was a smart plan formulated by smart people in the German military </p>

<p>But because Hitler was a dumb fuck who didn&#39;t know what the fuck he was doing he heard the resistance in the south was weak (do to all the army being in the north) and decided he knew best and ordered the 2 army groups to invade and occupy the 2 targets simultaneously. </p>

<p>And what do ya know, it failed!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean don&#39;t get me wrong, the citizens of the city dealt with hell on earth in the most literal way imaginable and never stopped fighting their oppressors. But if the nazis didn&#39;t take control of the city they did something that looks really similar </p>

<p>I&#39;ll agree they didn&#39;t occupy the city in the typical sense but that was by choice. The nazi high command decided prior to attacking the city to lay siege instead of occupying since the latter would make them responsible for food. If they&#39;d wanted to occupy it they could have, at least initially. </p>

<p>I&#39;d agree completely that after the first year the nazis would never have been able to occupy and hold the city. My point is just that for all intents and purposes from 41-44 they controlled Leningrad in a distinct way that Russia did not</p>

<p>Edit: also it&#39;s a fucking crime that in American schools we don&#39;t read and learn Tanya Savicheva&#39;s diary and story alongside Anne Frank&#39;s. It&#39;s despicable how the price Russians paid for all of us in their blood is forgotten and ignored in this country </p>

<p>By instituting a fascist state where thoughts were controlled, invading other countries, and enabling the military/secret police to run rampant over people&#39;s rights...and on and on. Not even talking about the &quot;undesirables&quot; here, talking about Germans in general. It was a goddamn authoritarian police state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the meantime I would suggest that Hitler&#39;s war machine was accomodated by the likes of General Motors, and other players/companies with an angle and/or looking for a yield.
And that both Bolshevism and Nazism were  created and sponsored as ideologies that rose inorganically, not so much at the will of the people (who got to feel the sting of it in great numbers while insane leaders played real life chess), and one or more groups of certain elite were rubbing their hands while playing with good old hegelian dialectics.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s just me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you are right.  </p>

<p>Why would Hitler allow the Bolsheviks to do to Germany what they did to Russia?  Hitler knew what they did, and he saw it beginning to happen in Germany.  Just like it is happening now in Europe.  It would be happening here in the U.S. today, but the cunt lost the election.  </p>

<p>I am <strong>not</strong> saying that Hitler was a saint. I am simply saying that you don&#39;t seem to look at any of the good he did. Yes, he did kill hundreds of thousands, millions, whatever amount of people. That is truly awful. </p>

<p><strong>HOWEVER</strong> he did fulfill (most of) his promises to the German people. He also (supposedly) did many other small, yet positive, deeds. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t support Hitler, but I refuse to be bigoted or biased in any matter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is your source for all of this?  </p>

<p>Who exactly did Hitler borrow money from?  Do you know?  I do...  </p>

<p>I am sorry, but you have no idea what you are talking about.  You do not know the real history of what happened between WW1 and WW2.  </p>

<p>Here is a great starting point for you:  </p>

<p>WWI to WWII: Daniel Sheehan - 4-21-2016</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/BDurYQ8xSv4?list=PLVza7sesLJh5ZR8exn0lKoCjC3ayShvdd">https://youtu.be/BDurYQ8xSv4?list=PLVza7sesLJh5ZR8exn0lKoCjC3ayShvdd</a></p>

<p>Up to about the 27 minute mark is a review of his previous lecture, then he starts getting into Germany, WW1, the Dulles Brothers, the loans given to German post-WW1, and the international bankers involved.  </p>

<p>Here is a flow chart that shows the connections between the people and organizations involved.  A good portion of the flowchart is not relevant to our discussion, but look at the center and to the top right.  Brown Brothers Harriman is at the center, and Hitler is at the top right.  Notice the names associated with Brown Brothers Harriman.  Also notice that George Herbert Walker and Prescott Bush are listed.  Prescott Bush is the father of George Herbert Walker Bush, and George Herbert Walker is the grandfather.  </p>

<p>Flowchart:  </p>

<p>Daniel Sheehan has a whole series of videos there that are very informative.  It is called Rulers of the Realm.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not interested in defending anyone.  I am interested in historic fact.  </p>

<p>You say that you never said the Soviets were guide guys.  Fine.  Don&#39;t you think that Hitler knew the Soviets were not good guys and behaved accordingly?  </p>

<p>Hitler took land back that was lost in the Treaty of Versailles.  It escalated from there.  This was after the Spanish Civil War.  </p>

<p>Your understanding of history is very superficial.  You do not see the underlining causes for historical events.  You think that Hitler magically worked his way up to become Chancellor.  </p>

<p>You do not know that Hitler was chosen to be Chancellor, or who chose him and why.  Hitler was a dupe.  He did not know his place in the grand scheme of things.  Hitler was played like a fiddle, and Israel was created...   </p>

<p>Of course I would never be hired to teach history.   People are not supposed to know what really happened.  People are supposed to spew the propaganda, like you do.  </p>
