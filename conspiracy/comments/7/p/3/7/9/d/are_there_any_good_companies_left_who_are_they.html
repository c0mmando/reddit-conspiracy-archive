<p>Follow up question: If they are &quot;evil&quot;, what do they do? Do they collect and sell personal information? Do they provide bogus links to scam you and infect your device?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Etsy may be nice for consumers but my best friend got fucked hardcore by them as a seller. He had received an unprecedented amount of orders for his product and was struggling to get them packaged and shipped out, then Etsy shut him down for Fraud after being just slightly backed up and refused to listen to his many please up and down their back-end bureaucracy. It shattered his business, and he didn&#39;t get Etsy privileges back for almost a year, when they apologized for over-reacting...too late tho, damage done.</p>

<p>Replace &quot;shareholders&quot; with &quot;owners&quot; and the point stands. But corporations are scarier because essentially the ownership, management, and hence the blame is distributed over thousands of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding your follow up question:</p>

<p>What they - the evil companies - <em>do</em> is; in all conceivable manner of ways facilitate, perpetuate, and reinforce the existing global power structure, which is an inherently corrupt and evil centuries-old world-wide con game. Directly participating in and supporting an evil power structure is what makes evil companies &quot;evil.&quot;</p>

<p>As to what makes the power structure evil, and recognizing the responsible parties for who they really are, ... that takes most of us years to fully assimilate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO most companies start out being good. Especially if started by one or a few founders from their garage etc.</p>

<p>What happens then is that as soon as the company gets on the stock exchange it all goes to shit from there on. 
Being listed on an exchange <em>requires</em> the company to seek short-term profits instead of long-term strategies. Any director/CEO who doesn&#39;t do this will soon be fired by the shareholders. </p>

<p>So instead of being &#39;good&#39; they will almost instantly go &#39;bad&#39; because now the bottomline is <em>the only thing</em> that matters. period.</p>

<p>You can still find some &#39;good&#39; large companies, they are always family-owned.  </p>

<p>The problem is the stock exhange. Get rid of that and it will help alot. Another big problem is that companies are allowed to merge endlessly, in the end we have this situation of a handfull of mega-corps owning like 50% of worlds companies or something.</p>

<p>Muscle Milk and Intellibed are both at the very least charitable corporations. </p>

<p>I have a rare disease, and wasnt able to eat solid food for ~6 months. Muscle Milk sent me crates of product, tshirts, and a personal letter from the CEO.</p>

<p>Intellibed also gave me a reclining bed to help. My insurance would only cover a hospital bed, but that sucks ass. Intellibed&#39;s owner got on the phone with me personally and not only gave me a free $6k bed, they honored the warranty when it broke and replaced it free of charge.</p>

<p>I always take the opportunity to push these companies. I cant stomach Muscle Milk nowadays, but they saved my life pretty much. That intellibed is still comfortable as shit. </p>
