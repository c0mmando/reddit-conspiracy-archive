    <div class="md"><p>SS: Fire in the Sky is a book and movie based off the testimony of Travis Walton (who may or may not be a disinformation agent). His story lines up very well with other’s. In the film, they leave out the part about human-looking aliens helping him espcape. </p>

<p>Also, notice that the “Grays” here have a much more humanoid appearance. Minutes before this clip of the movie Travis can be seen discovering several suits that look like “traditional Grays” with huge, completely black eyes, and chalk white skin. </p>

<p>It’s almost like they’re framing another civilization or perhaps disguising the fact that they are related to us; using an insectoid suit to hide this fact. </p>

<p>Either way, the Grays are typically portrayed as cold and detached but this scene takes the cake. </p>

<p>My own abduction experience, while horrifying, was much less scary and more enlightening. The Gray’s relationship to humanity cannot be understated. </p>

<p>When I came into contact with them myself they referred to me (telepathically) as <em>family</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. That’s what I’m saying.. the ones I encountered looked like the “spacesuits”, but that was their flesh; and they were much kinder and didn’t torture me; they did put me in a machine and have me kill other people on another planet, but overall they were very kind and thoughtful <em>towards me</em> </p>

<p>That’s why I’m suggesting that perhaps there is some kind of disconnect. I could see there being different groups of “grays” or “watchers” </p>

<p>I’ve seen plenty of evidence for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They communicate telepathically, through touch. The “leader” (I guess” touched me gently, conveying enormous amounts of information and feelings in a split second. </p>

<p>Basically they told me I was safe, they were gonna show me what they wanted from me (using my emotions to power their machines). </p>

<p>There were 4 other young men; all blank expressions. As I said, there was no talking, just understanding. We all knew we were safe but they we were going to be used in some kind of experiment, against our will. </p>

<p>The grays did everything they could with their body language and kinesthetic communication to reassure us that we were in no danger. </p>

<p>They put me in some kind of mech, similar to iron man. Tons of cables connected to my nervous system; feeding me drugs (imagine LSD, DMT, MDMA all combined and on steroids). </p>

<p>I experienced every emotion at once; Love, hate, euphoria, fear, guilt, excitement. It was all very intense and my emotional state seemed to be the force powering the machine. </p>

<p>The machines we were operating, the 5 of us, were dropped on to some world with humanoids, similar to us, but primitive. We killed everyone on the planet in a matter of hours. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They made it very clear that they lack emotions. The machines we used ran on our “human energy” or “human essence”.</p>

<p>I don’t know perhaps they were built by humans. When I touched them I got flashes of interstellar civilizations. It was very clear that there were humans, grays, and wide spectrum of beings in the middle; some kind of spectrum. As if, some kind of “proto-humans” had hybridized itself. </p>

<p>The only time they have ever reached out to me was the next night when I was taken again, but this time it was just a “conversation” between me and the “leader”. </p>

<p>He basically just signed me off, told me he knew I felt ashamed for what we did, and that they were gonna leave me alone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I remember (this part was the haziest, I was like I said, on some kind of heavy drugs), we used some kind of sonic device. We each crashed into a major city or town. The sky was reddish/orange and the planet had two suns. When we crashed, it basically demolished the target cities. That in itself put a major dent, essentially having the same affect as a nuclear device. </p>

<p>After that we used more “traditional” ways of killing. Each had a list of targets; each followed through and used very powerful energy based weapons to destroy large segments of land. There was no defense for the weapons we had. The native population had no firearms. They stood no chance. I was moving at such incredible speeds from the drugs that by the time we had narrowed it down to small towns and villages I was destroying a town every few minutes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh the media portrayed our higher-dimensional extraterrestrial brothers and sisters as horrifying? In an attempt to socially engineer surface humans to fear galactic contact and find solice and safety in our governments and militaries?</p>

<p>My only advice to people is to keep an open mind and not be afraid. They are just as apprehensive about us. All I really learned from my experience was the power of human emotions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theory: Once you ascend to a higher dimension, going back to a lower dimension, you wouldn&#39;t need muscles, eyesight, etc, the only thing that would still have an effect on you is EM stuff, radiation, etc.</p>

<p>Greys always seem soo uniform. </p>

<p>Is it possible that when higher dimensional beings lower their vibrations or whatever to our dimension, they could have forms that are not essentially humanoid. An alien who would show you its true form is honestly one to trust over one who is willing to put a facade up, unless they tell you this specifically like in South Park, remember, the pooping ice cream guy?</p>

<p>Or as another user says, they could be doing the exact opposite, taking steps to camouflage to scare us off from something. </p>

<p>Anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mea culpa. Reinstated. I looked at the selfpost text which looked like it was trying to bypass rule 13 by making it a self post, and I didn&#39;t check all the comments.
