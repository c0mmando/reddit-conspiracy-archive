        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">22</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-01-09 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Sing_about_me.html">Sing_about_me</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A few days ago u/MAGAhatter &quot;exposed&quot; the guy who threatened to dox certain TMOR members as having multiple accounts, one of which he claimed was my account.</p>

<p>He explains it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2/https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7o43pq/cucumberowning_homophobepizzagater_and_new_best/">here</a> saying that &quot;admins were contacted (and) he (the doxxer) lost 42 out of 53 accounts and maybe more we werenâ€™t aware of.&quot;</p>

<p>MAGAhatter offers absolutely no evidence that my account was one of the doxxer&#39;s, we are just supposed to take his word for it. Why admins would only have wiped out 42 out of 53 of this guy&#39;s accounts, and not all of them, is also not explained. Furthermore, why they would have wiped out most of his accounts but left an account which is an active participant in TopMindsExposed, the subreddit they claim was responsible for this user, is also unexplained.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I&#39;ve had people harrassing me, accusing me of being this user who was threatening to do the dox, as can be seen <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7nnv3t/hundreds_of_top_skeptics_on_topmindsofreddit/ds6zpbn/">here</a>. Another user did the same <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/goddesses/comments/7ospw3/rosie_jones/dsc5oce/">here</a>, but interestingly, this guy seems to have been banned after I reported him to the admins. This tells me the admins are onto these guys and are perhaps even turning against them.</p>

<p>Now consider these points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why would they be annoying me if they thought I was capable of hacking and doxxing them?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you really believe that <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wwofso1.jpg">this</a> was a sincere TopMindsExposed user? Do you think their motives were sincere? It&#39;s so blatantly obvious that this is a troll. The whole swatting thing is very topical now, given the recent tragedy, and there&#39;s no way that someone would sincerely advocate it right now, knowing full well the kind of consequences it could lead to. It&#39;s such a blindingly obvious attempt to incriminate TopMindsExposed.</p></li>
<li><p>Why would I have been one of the first people to attack the accounts who were threatening to do the dox, as can be seen <a href="https://imgur.com/a/OvfBl">here</a>?</p></li>
<li><p>Who is more likely to do this shit, some random <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users or a subreddit of people who will hunt down and harass anyone who tries to counter them, and brigade any post which doesn&#39;t suit their narrative? These people behave very similarly to the likes of Scientologists or big corporations like Monsanto. They are clearly very, very concerned about crushing anyone who tries to expose them and will go to great lengths to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>Whoever actually did this clearly wasn&#39;t either able or actually intending to hack into people&#39;s computers to dox them, or they would have had the technical savvy, or simply the intention, to hide their tracks and stop their accounts being banned. All it would take is to make throwaways while using a VPN. Why would a sincere contributor to TopMindsExposed threaten to dox when they actually weren&#39;t able to? If you look at <a href="https://i.redd.it/dhgvz3001u701.jpg">this</a> post, it&#39;s clear that the poster isn&#39;t just pushing other people to dox, he is saying that he is capable of it and has the technical knowhow to do it. And yet, for some reason, they either weren&#39;t able, or simply didn&#39;t intend, to cover their tracks. That is clearly bullshit, and stinks of manipulation and deceit that could only work in TMOR&#39;s favour.</p></li>
<li><p>Something I find interesting (although I&#39;m not sure where it fits in the puzzle) is that in u/MAGAhatter &#39;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7o43pq/cucumberowning_homophobepizzagater_and_new_best/">list of accounts</a> which he attributes to the doxxer, he does not actually list one of the two accounts who were threatening to do the dox, who was <a href="/u/RosaRosaeRosam">/u/RosaRosaeRosam</a> , as can be seen <a href="https://i.redd.it/dhgvz3001u701.jpg">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>My last point though, is how the fuck would <a href="/u/MAGAhatter">/u/MAGAhatter</a> know all this guy&#39;s accounts? He tries to explain it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180108223018/https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7o43pq/cucumberowning_homophobepizzagater_and_new_best/ds75cos/">here</a>, saying that he just looked through the doxxer&#39;s post history and then &quot;connected the dots&quot;, in the short time before the doxxer was banned. I&#39;m sorry but how the fuck would that be possible? On reddit you interact with hundreds, if not thousands of accounts, but he claims he was able to connect 53 accounts up &quot;in seconds&quot;? And yet he wasn&#39;t able to list the name of one of the actual two accounts which came on TopMindsExposed to threaten doxxing? If you look at my post history you can see that aside from my fairly brief interactions, on <a href="/r/TopMindsExposed">/r/TopMindsExposed</a> and a single post on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, with the handful of TopMindsExposed members he incriminates, I have barely interacted with these users elsewhere, so the whole idea that he was just joining the dots falls apart, especially given that most of these users have been around for a while and I have only been interacting with them very recently, and that they only comprise of a very small section of his list of the accounts which he attributes to the doxxer&#39;s.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I can&#39;t say I know what really happened, but it sure seems fishy.</p>

<p>Edit: Grammar</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: <a href="/u/MAGAHatter">/u/MAGAHatter</a>, using his alt-account <a href="/u/dronetape">/u/dronetape</a>, has sent me <a href="https://i.imgur.com/4b6PqHU.png">this PM</a>, admitting that he knew I wasn&#39;t the doxxer/swatter when he incriminated me.</strong></p>

<p>The tiptopmind outs itself.</p>

<p><strong>Tiptop Tactic #1</strong>:  Pretend two things that are not the same really are the same.  </p>

<p>In this instance, pretend that TD (a sub designed as a rallying point for the President&#39;s loyal base) is equivalent in its relation to r/conspiracy as is TMOR (a sub designed to harass and disrupt discussion on and users of r/conspiracy in a cozy hatesub hugbox).</p>

<p>Here this tactic is employed to pretend like the tiptopminds are providing a service to r/conspiracy by acting as a balance against influencers from TD.  This tiptopmind assumes  you&#39;re ignorant of the fact that TMOR exists only for its relationship to r/conspiracy and that their efforts to provide &quot;balance&quot; predate the existence of TD.</p>

<p><strong>Tiptop Excuse</strong>:  I&#39;m actually doing you a favor.</p>

<p>Unless I&#39;m missing something, TMOR seems like a sub where people go to laugh at stuff on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> (which I can see how people might be offended or upset about, I guess, though I still think it&#39;s just worth ignoring), while TopMindsExposed legitimately had someone involved who hoped to swat people from TMOR.

<p>There&#39;s absolutely no proof that the users who were threatening to do the dox were our guys, and I as I explain in my OP, I think it seems far more likely to be a false flag attack by TMOR. You&#39;re free to argue against my arguments for why I think it is likely to have been a false flag, but start from there, don&#39;t pretend the point hasn&#39;t even been addressed.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t seem like you&#39;re actually interested in gaining any kind of knowledge from this discussion, or you would have considered the things I have already said, which leads me to feel you aren&#39;t sincere.

<p>TMOR at least shows the posts made by people in TopMindsExposed and ConspiracyUndone that posted addresses and identities of TMOR-ers. (<a href="https://imgur.com/GHHW7gj">Here</a> and <a href="https://imgur.com/01bNPcB">Here</a>). Based on the attitudes of people here about the so-called &#39;shills&#39; in TMOR and the fact that a subreddit was <em>specifically created</em> to &quot;expose&quot; them, I can believe that a member of ConspiracyUndone and TopMindsExposed might have posted those things.</p>

<p>Your argument, as I understand it, is &#39;come on, guys, do you really believe that was real?&#39;, which alone, I don&#39;t find compelling.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know the backstory of this whole feud and honestly probably don&#39;t care enough to learn it, but it&#39;s not that I&#39;m ignoring the discussion in this thread and trying to waste your time. Rather, I&#39;ve read the discussions in this thread and haven&#39;t seen any evidence or any reason to think that the TopMindsExposed comments weren&#39;t genuine, from genuine members. If nothing else <em>if you&#39;re going to make an entire sub who&#39;s point and name is about EXPOSING members of another sub, you don&#39;t get to be on your high horse when someone accuses members of that sub, with proof, of doing just that.</em></p>

<p>Sorry that I don&#39;t agree with you, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not interested in the discussion. It just means I don&#39;t agree with you and you haven&#39;t put forward any new evidence or arguments that have begun to convince me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By &quot;exposing&quot;, it didn&#39;t mean doxxing. That would literally serve no purpose to us. Our only intention was to bring attention to how fucked up that sub is, and how it should be banned because its users stalk and harass people, and brigade threads. By exposing, we meant exposing the bad shit they did, so doxxing them would be obviously hypocritical. <em>So</em> obviously hypocritical that no sincere user would do it. </p>

<p>But in the end, neither of us have any evidence that proves which side did it, or even hints at which side did it, so if you&#39;re just interested in evidence, why bother to even continue the discussion? I thought you don&#39;t care about this stuff anyway?</p>

<p>I <em>don&#39;t</em> particularly care about this stuff, but people like you are CONSTANTLY spamming <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> crying about TMOR, so I can&#39;t help but get dragged into it slightly, I guess. Sorry that apparently annoys you?</p>

<p>Obviously we&#39;re not going to agree, but it still looks to me, as someone not personally involved with all of this, as though the TMOR people (even if they are jerks who make fun of this sub) have put forth a pretty convincing case that someone in TopMindsExposed tried to do just that - expose some members of Top Minds. Your rebuttal seems to mostly be &#39;but we wouldn&#39;t do that!&#39; which doesn&#39;t seem convincing in the way their story does (based on the pictures and screenshots that show it happened and the admin&#39;s seemingly banning people involved in it). </p>

<p>I don&#39;t claim to actually know what happened here, but I think your &#39;side&#39; needs either some evidence or at least some reasons people should believe you, or stop complaining that people believe that a member of your sub tried to dox and swat someone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you need some evidence to believe your side. I really would be interested to know what you consider to be compelling about TMOR&#39;s case that describes how TopMindsExposed was responsible.</p>

<p>I notice you have been disingenous about my case for why it was TMOR. I actually have said:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Whoever actually did this clearly wasn&#39;t either able or actually intending to hack into people&#39;s computers to dox them, or they would have had the technical savvy, or simply the intention, to hide their tracks and stop their accounts being banned. All it would take is to make throwaways while using a VPN. Why would a sincere contributor to TopMindsExposed threaten to dox when they actually weren&#39;t able to? If you look at <a href="https://i.redd.it/dhgvz3001u701.jpg">this</a> post, it&#39;s clear that the poster isn&#39;t just pushing other people to dox, he is saying that he is capable of it and has the technical knowhow to do it. And yet, for some reason, they either weren&#39;t able, or simply didn&#39;t intend, to cover their tracks. That is clearly bullshit, and stinks of manipulation and deceit that could only work in TMOR&#39;s favour.</p></li>
<li><p>Do you really believe that this was a sincere TopMindsExposed user? Do you think their motives were sincere? It&#39;s so blatantly obvious that this is a troll. The whole swatting thing is very topical now, given the recent tragedy, and there&#39;s no way that someone would sincerely advocate it right now, knowing full well the kind of consequences it could lead to. It&#39;s such a blindingly obvious attempt to incriminate TopMindsExposed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but I don&#39;t actually believe that you seriously believe that swatting threat was sincere. It was clearly a false flag, it&#39;s the most obvious troll I&#39;ve seen in some time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I agree somewhat in that I&#39;m not sure the swatting threat was 100% sincere. But I do find it plausible that a member of the Exposed community would post the information they thought was related to mods of TMOR and somewhat seriously suggest someone swat them. It boggles my mind that people somehow think anyone posting in TopMindsExposed would be somehow above that <em>when the very title of the sub suggests that&#39;s the point of its existence</em>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m kind of confused at the moment - I thought this conversation was about the doxing and swatting threats I linked above (the pictures originally posted to TMOR), and whether or not they were from legitimate members of Exposed? I don&#39;t know the context of the picture you published. Like I said, I genuinely haven&#39;t been following this whole drama, so it&#39;s entirely possible I&#39;m missing something or misunderstanding something to me.</p>

<p>I will say this, once again as someone coming into this drama after merely being an uninterested spectator who&#39;s mostly been annoyed at how often <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> gets spammed with the same two or three people crying about how TMOR was mean to them - I don&#39;t pretend to know the backstory nor the details of either &quot;side&quot; of this conflict. BUT after reading the stickied thread at TMOR and this and I believe another thread about it on this sub, this is how the situation comes off to me (and if you feel like correcting me and aren&#39;t tired of me yet [which I wouldn&#39;t blame you for!], I&#39;m happy to be corrected if there&#39;s parts I&#39;m missing):</p>

<ul>
<li>TMOR acts like jerks to conspiracy people</li>
<li>Conspiracy people (specifically <a href="/r/ConspiracyUndone">/r/ConspiracyUndone</a> people) decide to make a sub EXPOSING the people who post in TMOR, specifically called &quot;TopMindsExposed&quot;</li>
<li>TMOR post pictures of SOMEONE posting in TopMindsExposed and ConspiracyUndone with personal information they thought was from the mods of TMOR. They also show that admins banned a bunch of accounts known for posting on Conspiracy and ConspiracyUndone, which were all run by one person (who hated TMOR a lot)</li>
<li>Members of TopMindsExposed deny any doxing, locking the community so that people like me, who again aren&#39;t involved in this, can&#39;t see the community and know what the point of it is, despite the obvious one (exposing top minds)</li>
</ul>

<p>I appreciate your replies and discussing this with me, and totally understand if you decide you&#39;re done wasting time talking about this with me. But you have to see how people not knowledgeable about the ins and outs of this drama might believe TMOR in this instance, or at least think they have a pretty good case, even if the community is known for making fun of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>
