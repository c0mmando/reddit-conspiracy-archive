It might be because this sub has gained in popularity, but the quality has gone down in my opinion.</p>

<p>EDIT
What I mean is that there are many posts that do not contain a conspiracy. Not in the title, not in the post. I just get redirected to a news article. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As thankfully many others here have commented similarly, politics are a effective method of distracting and dividing the public.</p>

<p>The controlled media amplifies this even more.</p>

<p>People should understand that none of the US. or other nation high-degree politicians are working for the good of the people.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like a theater. Good guy vs. bad guy. Trump vs. Clinton, but both are against the people, otherwise the other aristocratic politicians would not even allow them to be in office.</p>

<p>It would be great if people like Trump, Clinton, Ron Paul, Obama would actually start doing something that benefits the people more than the industry moguls, but this would mean for them to sacrifice their wealth, status etc. unless many more politicians would start doing what is morally correct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub was being hit by brigades for a long time. /conspiratard that later became /topmindsofreddit. Apparently what we discuss here is completely false, but it&#39;s false in a way that requires them to come and try to steer conversations away from certain subjects. </p>

<p>Then as the election heated up Correct the Record, Share Blue, Media Matters, JIDF and other groups began to shit all over this place. Then people on the left and right began to use this sub to push the agenda they wanted, instead of trying to remain politically neutral and remember that left vs right has long been used as a tactic to divide and conquer. Same as rich vs poor, black vs white, etc. </p>

<p>Now we have both of those things as well as bots, shills or just trolls coming in to downvote everything, post politically motivated information and kill conversation. Sad really. </p>

<p>I&#39;m guilty of some of it myself as I&#39;m a Trump supporter, so far I haven&#39;t seen the man do anything that I haven&#39;t supported. Just the fact that the Operation Mockingbird media hates him so much is a good sign to me. But I try to keep my pro-Trump posting to appropriate subs. Most folks don&#39;t. </p>

<p>No, not even close. There are dozens of subreddits out there that you can post pro-Trump stuff to. But I don&#39;t think that really matters to you. This is just you trying to make it seem like the rest of the world is bullying the Republicans and Trump who just want to help (which of course couldn&#39;t be further from the truth). Even when the R&#39;s are in power, they&#39;re still somehow the victim.</p>

<p>But r/conspiracy really appeals to me because it’s one of the few pseudo neutral debate grounds on reddit. Politics, T_D, latestagecapitalism, conservative...you’ll either be banned or downvoted into oblivion for sharing an antithetical opinion. Even though conspiracy definitely leans right (as is the nature of conspiracy theorist demographics), it holds itself out as a space for discussion and free thought, at least necessitating <em>some</em> degree of interaction between either side. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m not, though. And I don&#39;t mean to come at you sideways, but this is how the leaders of your society are acting in such frivolous and utterly mad fashions... and so many of their people are messes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s gross. I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m going to get down-voted because I know everyone is caught up in the sensationalism, but let&#39;s all just call it as we see it. And it&#39;s so western, American-culture and cliche and just tired. Like... I&#39;m over it. I don&#39;t want to be a Negative Nancy but this is the f**king life that I&#39;m living. In reality I really DON&#39;T have the time for their selfish, sinful games. I&#39;m not interested in the sex, money power this and that. Let me live my life and stop screwing it up. It&#39;s literally just sin.</p>

<p>It makes my head spin to see this actually play out in front of my eyes... It&#39;s ridiculous. I&#39;m sorry, I know a lot of people buy into it but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Thankful probably isn&#39;t the right word for it.</p>

<p>However I&#39;ve always been a little envious of my grandparents who all lived through and served in ww2. Not because I would want to experience the suffering or live through the what could easily be historys greatest human tragedy, an event that ruined the lives of hundreds of millions of people, but to have seen such an incredible historical event unfold, without knowing the outcome, first hand. It&#39;s perverse and maybe I&#39;m a little weird, but I love history and it&#39;s exciting to be living through and event that will be studied and dissected for generations. I&#39;d rather it didn&#39;t happen, I&#39;d rather have competent leaders and for this to be a fair happy world, but if stuff like this has to happen I&#39;m, in a strange silver linings sort of way, thankful to be a part of it and see it unfold in real time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, lots of people believe one of the following things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Trump colluded with Russia to break in to DNC servers and steal/publish embarrassing emails. That&#39;s the Watergate scandal, with a Russian twist.<br/></li>
<li>Trump did not collude with Russia, but has committed crimes that might come up in an FBI investigation, with the leading theory being money-laundering or some other financial crime (since Trump refuses to release his tax returns and warned Mueller not to look at his finances). That &#39;s a criminal conspiracy that reaches all the way to the White House</li>
<li>Trump is innocent, and the &quot;Deep State&quot; is trying to execute a soft coup by undermining or even framing the President of the United States, which is full-on shadow government stuff. </li>
</ol>

<p>There are other plausible theories on the Mueller probe, but a lot of people believe one of those three, and all three of them are massive conspiracies that involve the highest levels in the US Government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, agreed. Where I seem to differ from others on Trump/Russia is that I think the whole election meddling is utter bullshit to detract from the DNC emails and the corporate oligarchy that actually rigs our elections. They have done this since Woodrow Wilson. People don&#39;t realize that the corporate media has <strong>always</strong> pushed their propaganda when they desired it.</p>

<p>Wilson was wildly unpopular, but thanks to CFR meddling and media hype, they painted the illusion that he was &quot;their guy.&quot; Same with every president after.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re finally noticing something that&#39;s been going on with the conspiracy community for some time: it&#39;s been over taken by people with political agendas. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s shills, as many of them are clearly not, but conspiracies of dubious have been used to demonize political opponents for some time. It&#39;s not that all political conspiracies are false, but it&#39;s clear that there is manipulation of conspiracy people going on.</p>

<p>Remember when Russia Today dominated this subreddit? That&#39;s one clear and hard to dispute example. RT is fun funded by and controlled by the Russian government, the very definition of establishment. And what happened? People here ate it up, because they mixed truth with lies. That&#39;s a textbook propaganda technique. When people pointed out there BS they were spewing, useful idiots would say that they got a lot of things right (for example, NSA surveillance) and saying they&#39;re wrong makes you a shill.</p>

<p>Everyone needs to think for themselves, and think carefully about sources, evidence, and use common sense. Without critical thinking, it&#39;s easy to get manipulated, and that&#39;s a shame because there are conspiracies that can be looked into with an objective lens.</p>

Like false flags,  they are an insult to the intelligence,  a total farce,   and the arguments are meaningless because they will make no real difference at this point,  they are going to do what they want to do and tell us what they want to tell us.
