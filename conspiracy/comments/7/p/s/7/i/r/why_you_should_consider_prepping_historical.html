        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>SS: Ok, so I used to write a blog but I could never find enough time to carry it on so I&#39;ve stopped. I was working on a post which was taking ages to write up properly and altho I can&#39;t find the time to write this as nicely as I would have liked, I thought this might be of interest to some of you out there:</p>

<p>So basically, the worlds in a shit state as I&#39;m sure people are aware, but most probably don&#39;t realise that almost all of the problems staring us in the face today have come about before in the past. In a way, confronted with the fact that civilisation has gone through adversity in the past should give us some hope, but at the same point, it would be moronic to assume whatever lies ahead is going to be easy.</p>

<p>Long story short, I was working through three main historical events which I feel have considerable similarities with today&#39;s converging crises. The first being the fall of the Eastern Mediterranean Bronze Age nation states. </p>

<p>So circa 1400BC, the civilisations around the Mediterranean very much resembled, in some sense at least, a modern world in minature. The Minoeans, the Caananites, the Egyptians, Cretians etc, all spoke Akkadian as a common language, all had a similar styles of art and architecture and despite an economy still somewhat based on plunder, operated huge fleets of merchant vessels that traded anything from the abundant precious metals from Egypt, to textiles and even preserved foods such as olives and grain. </p>

<p>There was an extensive trade network of tin and copper that was required for the manufacture of bronze - which was as some historians say, this era&#39;s version of oil. (Who knows, perhaps the 20th to the early 21st century will be known in the future as the oil age!)</p>

<p>The problem was, that the empires were too reliant upon each other for trade, particularly for tin which bronze was reliant upon. Climate change (the Bond Event is responsible for cold arid weather every 1000 years or so) began creating famine across Europe, which presumably led to a situation where refugees sought food and warmer climates by heading south east towards Greece and Anatolia. </p>

<p>The Minoans fell, creating displacement, and a closure of ports for trade. The Minoans then looted the Cypriots, and so Cyprus fell, creating displacement and the closure of their ports. The Cypriots and the Minoans then looted Caananite lands and so it went on and on. A domino-wave effect created by both opportunistic raiders and genuine refugees wiped out all the empires except the Egyptians who somehow clung on until the Roman&#39;s dominated the Med. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t take a genius to see how the current &#39;refugee crisis&#39;, in part caused by droughts, is very similar to the current situation. Also, the domino effect seen by those bronze age empires is very much akin, albeit on a smaller scale, to how we might expect the world economy to go were any of the bigger economies to disappear. </p>

<p>There is more to it than what I&#39;ve just explained, but these were the general themes that caused a total collapse some time around 1100BC. </p>

<p>Next is Rome, which is actually is more simplistic than the earlier bronze age example. Basically it exhausted itself economically by expanding too far geographically, succumbing to costly, high-level corruption in the Senate, debasing the precious metal content of its currency in an attempt to squeeze its failing economy (think modern day &#39;quantitative easing&#39; and rampant inflation over the last century) and excessive taxation.</p>

<p>Excessive taxation prevented start up industries from forming, and made the prospect of being a farmer so miserable that many left for Rome where they could live off state welfare. Again, the parallels between this; ie calls for greater welfare/UBI and the current urbanisation of humanity is startling. The similarities don&#39;t end there either though, because in an attempt to keep farms operating and producing grain, Rome invited many Germanic people (many of whom were &#39;refugees&#39; fleeing war in German lands) in to live and work and hopefully pay taxes.</p>

<p>Hmm, where have we heard that before? Unfortunately for Rome, those Germanic tribes, saw weakness in the Roman ideals of the day and overthrew the ruling elite.</p>

<p>Additionally, it is likely that Rome had a birth rate issue owing to lead cooking pots and the popular defrutum which was left to preserve in lead carafes affecting general fertility, declining morals towards sex and relationships towards the end of the Empire, with many seeing financial interest in having less children, and because men had the habit of taking baths (so hot that people often feinted) that sterilised the men. Today, we have the same issue, although we&#39;re being feminised or made infertile by plastic oestrogen mimickers, food low in nutrients, and general unhealthy lifestyles. Like in ancient Rome, we too are sold the idea of immigration because of failing birth rates - yet the authorities today are disturbingly mute on the causes (feminism, high living costs, infertility, &quot;alternative lifestyles&quot;, etc.)</p>

<p>Finally, I present the third case scenario which is more ecological than economic/human caused. Easter island.</p>

<p>Easter Island is, in a way, a small version of what may await our whole planet if steps are not taken to seriously improve our environment and our impact on it. To some degree, Easter Island&#39;s obsession with making stone heads which required a lot of timber to move and position, is a bit like our current materialist mindset. Today we know that a lot of the shit we buy or throw away is harmful, but we accept that that is just the way it is. In the same respects, those islanders on Easter Island must have known that the forests were not growing back and were finite, yet at some point that last tree must have been chopped down by them. </p>

<p>As the land was deforested on the island, the top soil blew away into the sea leaving a mostly sterile environment. Admittedly, some of the damage at Easter Island was caused by an out of control rat population which ate the tree&#39;s seeds, preventing new ones from being grown, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily detract from the message here. In some respects, our agriculture methods mimic the rat&#39;s behaviour.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether it was man, or rats that did the most damage, we have a very concerning issue in the world right now with both deforestation and our modern argriculture which is stripping every last bit of nutrience out of the soil (not to mention causing nitrogen pollution) and again, like on Easter Island, lot of the useful soil is blowing away on the wind, or entering into the water table.</p>

<p>Add into these scenarios the prospect of AI and a world which no longer requires human labour, and well, everything looks rather bleak. So basically, my point is that long-term it looks like we&#39;re heading into stormy weather and that prepping for future catastrophic collapses isn&#39;t all that insane as the mainstream media has been making out. Although interestingly, even the media and governments themselves are beginning to soften their tone on this subject.</p>

<p>Anyway, hopefully this has been interesting and informative for those who didn&#39;t know this stuff before hand. I will probably get around to writing this properly at some point, but suffice to say I reckon the basic facts are enough to jar some into action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, it wasn&#39;t just trade. Agriculture was very difficult before the Iron Age and agricultural techniques understanding, like using manure as fertilizer, crop rotation, etc. There were also reported climate changes. </p>

<p>The truth is the nomadic tribalism was powerful against the Roman system of urbanization. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to prep, do it inconspicuously. All these people building bunkers or purchasing MREs and equipment online or with a debit card are gonna have their properties raided first. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best way to prep- buy land. Learn how to farm, and stockpile seeds and non-perishables like rice and beans (in mass quantities). Land can be defended, farmed, rented, or sold in better economic times. It is the only true security against economic, and especially social, collapse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And as far away from major cities and economic centers as possible. In a total collapse the chaos will start there and emanate outwards, diminishing in scale the farther you get as more people settle down in the ruins of small towns, kill each other, or simply starve to death. You want to be as far away from the refugees and roving bands of thugs as possible. And ideally in some form of small community as well- something where a few houses with farms and land have all been built in the same valley, and can work together to secure access to and from it. </p>

<p>Sadly it never really all implodes and society doesn&#39;t totally collapse and we end up having to work little by little for progress :-/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only major issue is our reliance on technology and our extreme interconnectedness. The average US supermarket only has 36 hours worth of food. If somehow the trucks stop moving, we&#39;re only a day and a half away from total chaos. And if the National Guard and the Army can&#39;t keep the trucks moving, the highways clear, and some semblance of order in the cities maintained, we could see total collapse occur in a matter of days. </p>

<p>This, of course, would come after months of warning signs. Economic collapse doesn&#39;t happen overnight, it is a process. Only the very end is sudden. After months of wear and tear on the system, of capital flight, and of actual people fleeing the country, the writing will be on the wall. Flights will still be available, at ever increasing prices, until the bitter end. But once it ends, it will end fast. From one day to the next there won&#39;t be food in the stores. There wont be power. There wont be police or national guard. It will just revert to the law of &quot;Might makes right&quot;. </p>

<p>I pray we never see it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the only way we would see a &quot;fast&quot; collapse is through some sort of cataclysm that is not human made. Climate change is too slow, but a meteor impact, super volcano,  or solar flare would do it. A solar flare could knock out all power grids, no power = we&#39;re fucked. Should be part of any doomsday plan to have back up power generation for at least 6 months, and not only with solar panels.</p>

<p>Anyways if one of those things happens it would be the &quot;shit hole&quot; countries in Africa that survive, ironically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That cascade of famine, migration and looting you&#39;re describing, is essentially a plague of resource deprivation. When you consider that your mechanical plague could be combined with a biological one; yeah, prepping ain&#39;t dumb.</p>

<p>It gets little press, but the threat of bio-terrorism is growing at an alarming rate. Improvements in biotech are making the tools necessary much cheaper and accessible, even outside of professional institutions. Of course, if it&#39;s feasible for terrorists, it&#39;s feasible for states to do it, and pin it on terrorists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great write-up, but one small quibble: The Original Poster wrote: &quot;The Minoeans, the Caananites, the Egyptians, Cretians etc, all spoke Akkadian as a common language&quot;.</p>

<p>Actually, no. Akkadian is an East Semitic language. Semitic languages are the newest layer of the Near East. Prior to the rise of Akkadian, you had non-Semitic languages like Sumerian and Luwian predominating (as well as a whole host of Indo-European languages, like Hittite).</p>

<p>Before the older Indo-European layer is the Hurrian layer.</p>

<p>My point? Cultures like the Cretans and Minoans are OLDER than the Akkadians.</p>

<p>Rise of Semites = new</p>

<p>Original substratum of the Eastern Mediterranean and Levant = pre-Semitic.</p>

<p>To place a Semitic language as the common language of these disparate groups is like claiming that Barack Obama is older than George Washington. </p>

<p>It&#39;s hard for non-history buffs to understand (because in the modern world the Middle East = Semitic), but in Antiquity, the Marsh Arabs (i.e., Semites) were a fringe group off on the edges of the Saudi peninsula. They were pre-literate, isolated and irrelevant. The original groups of the Near East had more in common ethnologically with Balkan groups and peoples from the Caucasus than people from, say, Yemen.</p>

<p>The Yemen type is the new type.</p>

<p>The older Middle Eastern substratum looked like these Sumerian statues: <a href="http://www.ancientpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/blueeyessumer.jpg">http://www.ancientpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/blueeyessumer.jpg</a></p>

<p>The original populace (as we can discern from DNA testing and skeletal remains) looked like Syrian journalist Hala Gorani: <a href="http://frostsnow.com/uploads/biography/2015/11/16/hala-gorani.jpg">http://frostsnow.com/uploads/biography/2015/11/16/hala-gorani.jpg</a></p>

<p>Or Bashar Assad: <a href="http://liberatinginfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/maxresdefault-1.jpg">http://liberatinginfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/maxresdefault-1.jpg</a></p>

<p>The original language Gorani and Assad&#39;s ancestors would have spoken would have been a Hurrian language in Antiquity. (Not a Semitic one.)</p>

<p>The rise of the Marsh Arabs and the spread of Semitic languages are, in historical terms, extremely new.</p>

<p>Long story short: No, Minoans are not even remotely related to Semites, nor did they ever speak a Semitic language. Neither did Cretans. Nor Egyptians. The only group that had a Semitic language imposed on it were the Canaanites. And prior to that time, they spoke Indo-European languages. Prior to that, Hurrian languages.</p>

When I said common language, I wasn&#39;t referring to the every day language spoken but the language of business, in the way that Chinese people will trade with a Frenchman by both speaking English.

<p>I&#39;m not 100% with middle eastern history, northern Europe is more my thing generally, but I understand the original indo-iranian-european roots of the region and how we&#39;ve been misled on the appearance and ancestry of the eastern Med.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wonderful analysis, over all, though.</p>

<p>Loved the conceptualization as this being the &quot;Oil Age&quot; [instead of the &quot;Iron Age&quot;].</p>

<p>Liked your take on the &quot;People of the Sea&quot; movements from the Western Mediterranean, who (due to famine) flowed eastward and started destabilizing kingdom after kingdom in the Levant.</p>

<p>It&#39;s why King Tut (when they did a DNA test on him) had Atlantic Coast European DNA (haplogroup R1b).</p>

<p>His ancestors were Europeans, who most likely fled Sardinia and swooped into Egypt. One of the &quot;Peoples of the Sea&quot; were the Shardana [which is the root name of Sardinia]. </p>

<p>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, too, may have originally been &quot;People of the Sea&quot;. The tribe of Dan sounds an awful lot like the Greek name for themselves, in the &quot;Iliad&quot;: The Danaans. The &quot;Tribe of Dan&quot; lived right next door to other proto-greeks in Canaan [the Philistines], and they were the only &quot;tribe of Israel&quot; that was seafaring.</p>

<p>So you had tons of Euro-Mediterranean gene flow entering the Near East at the time. And you&#39;re right: These refugees destabilized and collapsed the nations into which they flowed. </p>

<p>They were considered a scourge. </p>

<p>The only difference between then and now is that the refugee flows today are synthetic. The people aren&#39;t coming of their own volition. They&#39;re having their passage paid for by George Soros (and other such groups) with the express purpose of destabilizing Europe and changing its demographics.</p>

<p>The UN&#39;s head of Migration, Peter Sutherland, openly called for this. See the article: &quot;EU should &#39;undermine national homogeneity&#39; says UN migration chief&quot;: <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-18519395">http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-18519395</a></p>

<p>You also have non-governmental organizations tied to George Soros-types calling to demographically change Europe on purpose. Like the head of Norway&#39;s Jewish community, Erwin Kohn, who made international news when he said that Norway was too &quot;dangerously white&quot;: <a href="http://conservative-headlines.com/2014/11/head-of-oslo-jewish-claims-norway-is-too-white/">http://conservative-headlines.com/2014/11/head-of-oslo-jewish-claims-norway-is-too-white/</a></p>

<p>Or the head of the American Jewish community in Sweden Barbara Specter-Lerner saying the same thing: <a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.infiniteunknown.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Barbara-Lerner-Spectre-Europe-Multiculturalism-Migrant-Crisis.jpg">https://i0.wp.com/www.infiniteunknown.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Barbara-Lerner-Spectre-Europe-Multiculturalism-Migrant-Crisis.jpg</a></p>

<p>So what&#39;s happening now is not organic (as it was in Antiquity). It&#39;s being paid for by forces INSIDE Europe, and coordinated from the West.</p>

<ul>
<li>Footnote: My own theory on this is that they&#39;re siding with China, strip-mining wealth from the West and transferring it to Asia. To ensure Asia&#39;s predominance, they&#39;re knee-capping the West by getting rid of its greatest asset: Its people. By replacing Western populations with Third World populations (and using them as resource-drains on the Europeans and Americans) they will have a harder time competing with homogeneous Asia--who won&#39;t be expected to pay for the world&#39;s poor. China will therefore have a massive demographic (and financial) advantage. Basically what&#39;s happening is that they&#39;re uprooting the money from the West, transferring it east, and setting fire to Europe and North America to ensure that they can&#39;t compete in upcoming generations. What we&#39;re watching isn&#39;t organic; it&#39;s insurance fraud. They&#39;re setting fire to their own former property to collect the insurance money before they cut out.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>My friend. You and I are totally on the same page and my own conclusions are the same. I didn&#39;t mention the Kalergi, and UN&#39;s &quot;replacement population scheme&quot; out of fear that less informed (read ignorant) intellectuals will then bash everything written here.</p>

<p>I believe there is a lot about history we are not taught, in particular the bronze age period because of its implications for certain tribes claims. </p>

<p>The Germanic barbarians of Rome at least had a roughly equal IQ when they decided to take it over for themselves. When it happens in the West today we run the risk of centuries of brutal inter-ethnic fighting. Honestly, the best thing scenario would be that it all collapsed sooner rather than later, to preserve some of the native population in Europe.</p>

<p>As for Asia, I think you&#39;re right about their moving there for a reason. They arent sending all our industry abroad for no reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Elliott Wave Principle posits that markets move upward in a series of five waves then downward in a series of three waves. What&#39;s interesting is that you can apply it to different timescales, arguably spanning centuries or millennia.</p>

<p>If you apply it to the span of our civilization, you get this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wave 1: Bronze Age</li>
<li>Wave 2: Late Bronze Age Collapse</li>
<li>Wave 3: Classical Era</li>
<li>Wave 4: Dark Ages</li>
<li>Wave 5: Modern Era</li>
</ul>

<p>Waves 1, 3, and 5 are the motive waves while 2 and 4 are the corrective waves. Corrective waves tend to be shorter. What follows wave 5 are the three downward waves that combined make wave 2 and 4 look minor. Fortunately for this timescale, it could take centuries for wave 5 to peak. It could also be peaking now...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Since 2009, an estimated one person every second has been displaced by a disaster, with an average of 22.5 million people displaced by climate- or weather-related events since 2008 (IDMC 2015). Disasters and slow onsets, such as <strong>droughts in Somalia</strong> in 2011 and 2012, floods in Pakistan between 2010 and 2012, and the earthquake in Nepal in 2015, can leave huge numbers of people traumatized without shelter, clean water and basic supplies.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Tens of millions of people will be forced from their homes by climate change in the next decade, creating the biggest refugee crisis the world has ever seen, according to a new report.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>Successive droughts, like those seen in sub-Saharan Africa, could cause millions to migrate to Europe.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;If Europe thinks they have a problem with migration today … wait 20 years,&#39; said retired US military corps brigadier general Stephen Cheney. &#39;See what happens when climate change drives people out of Africa – the Sahel [sub-Saharan area] especially – and we’re talking now not just one or two million, but 10 or 20 [million]. They are not going to south Africa, they are going across the Mediterranean.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The report argues that <strong>climate change played a part in the build up to the Syrian war, with successive droughts causing 1.5 million people to migrate to the country’s cities</strong> between 2006 and 2011. Many of these people then had no reliable access to food, water or jobs.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Climate change is the the unpredictable ingredient that, when added to existing social, economic and political tensions, has the potential to ignite violence and conflict with disastrous consequences,&#39; said EJF executive director, Steve Trent.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[...] climate change and the growing human population are working against global food security. <strong>Climate change is warming and acidifying our oceans, causing droughts and other extreme weather events, and degrading the quality of arable land. At the same time, our growing population demands more resources than the planet can provide.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;NASA research forecasts that North American droughts in the second half of this century could be &#39;drier and longer&#39; than those of the last 1,000 years. Additional <strong>research indicates a global increase in droughts</strong>. This new normal will have far-reaching effects for food production and our ability to feed a growing planet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Looking ahead, climate change will boost productivity in some areas, but agricultural yields will decline overall, <em>particularly in developing nations</em> whose populations will grow most quickly. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. Maybe Ill do a proper covering of it in the future, but as a tdlr:</p>

<p>Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi was an Austrian-Japanese political and philsophical figure between the 20s and 50s and was created what was the forerunner of European Union with his Pan-European movement which started in the 1920s.</p>

<p>His operation was funded by big known American bankers the Rothschilds and the Warburgs as well as being friends of a lot of Zionists behind the scenes. </p>

<p>Interestingly, given his funding and close personal friends (including even Churchill) he once wrote that Europe would cease to be white and that because of immigration, would eventually resemble the ancient Egyptians due to miscongeniation - with the old European elite and Jews running the show.</p>

<p>When the EU began to form through the economic ties of the EEC during the 50s, Kalergi was awarded the very first &#39;Charlemagne Prize&#39; in recognition of his efforts to create the eventual pan-european superstate. Recently, Merkel, the Pope, Tony Blair, Macron, Schultz even Bill Clinton - have all won the award for furthering the EUs agenda. And they all have the same neo-liberal agenda, all promote massive multicultural changes, unregulated laise faire economics.</p>

<p>(Bear in mind, Charlemagne formed the Holy Roman Empire but genocide and by imposing militant Christianity on his neighbours. Its hardly a nice figure to have as your organisations patron saint.)</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2018 and it seems maybe Kalergis aims were a blueprint that are still being intimately followed. Maybe, just maybe, Hitler had a point when he pointed his finger at what certain financial powers had planned for Germany and all of Europe?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got into prepping a bit a few years ago, but my biggest concern is food.</p>

<p>I can siphon gas out of my cars to put in my unused-still-in-box-generator. Boil water. Eat my Iodide tablets. Shoot bandits. Hunt, fish, and grow food. However, in the short term storing food is a huge pain in the ass. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t make food that last more than 10yrs, and i&#39;m not about to start buying prep food and cycling it out just wasting money. The shit they sell for survival food lets face it, the shit isn&#39;t exactly gourmet and i&#39;m not eating that stuff unless I have to to survive.</p>

<p>My only other option is to pillage other people for their supplies in the short term while I fortify my defenses. What do you guys recommend for short-term food needs in the event of SHTF?</p>

<p>It should also be noted, I eat at least 75% of my meals from restaurants or from a personal chef. The other 25% are things like cereal, protein drinks, or sandwiches. I know how to cook (i&#39;m a great cook) I just can&#39;t stand cooking. I don&#39;t have the patience for it and I hate it. No, i&#39;m not going to buy a fucking crock pot. I told you, I hate cooking. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve often considered that any failure of water systems might result in a large-scale die off resulting in food surpluses.  It might make sense to have the ability to filter even the worst water for a couple of years.</p>

<p>10 years for stored food isn&#39;t bad, I think there&#39;s all kinds of problems with survival out past even a couple of years. The big one is health care and lack of access to basic medicines like antibiotics and painkillers.  Lack of access to dentistry is a problem most people don&#39;t consider, but how will you handle a bad tooth with no painkillers and no dentist?</p>

<p>The more I&#39;ve thought about it, the more I&#39;ve figured &quot;survival&quot; without civilization out past maybe a couple of years gets really problematic and possibly features some really horrific outcomes.  I figure maybe 6-12 months is all you need to prepare for, if some kind of functional local community doesn&#39;t evolve by then you may wish you hadn&#39;t survived.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Since 2009, an estimated one person every second has been displaced by a disaster, with an average of 22.5 million people displaced by climate- or weather-related events since 2008 (IDMC 2015). Disasters and slow onsets, such as <strong>droughts in Somalia</strong> in 2011 and 2012, floods in Pakistan between 2010 and 2012, and the earthquake in Nepal in 2015, can leave huge numbers of people traumatized without shelter, clean water and basic supplies.&quot;</p>

<p>Nov. 2017: The Guardian, &quot;Climate change &#39;will create world&#39;s biggest refugee crisis&#39;&quot; -
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/02/climate-change-will-create-worlds-biggest-refugee-crisis">https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/02/climate-change-will-create-worlds-biggest-refugee-crisis</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Tens of millions of people will be forced from their homes by climate change in the next decade, creating the biggest refugee crisis the world has ever seen, according to a new report.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>Successive droughts, like those seen in sub-Saharan Africa, could cause millions to migrate to Europe.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;If Europe thinks they have a problem with migration today … wait 20 years,&#39; said retired US military corps brigadier general Stephen Cheney. &#39;See what happens when climate change drives people out of Africa – the Sahel [sub-Saharan area] especially – and we’re talking now not just one or two million, but 10 or 20 [million]. They are not going to south Africa, they are going across the Mediterranean.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The report argues that <strong>climate change played a part in the build up to the Syrian war, with successive droughts causing 1.5 million people to migrate to the country’s cities</strong> between 2006 and 2011. Many of these people then had no reliable access to food, water or jobs.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Climate change is the the unpredictable ingredient that, when added to existing social, economic and political tensions, has the potential to ignite violence and conflict with disastrous consequences,&#39; said EJF executive director, Steve Trent.&quot;</p>

<p>Oct. 2015: Food Chain Reaction, &quot;The Chain Reactions of Food Security – Part Two&quot; - <a href="http://foodchainreaction.org/index.php/2015/10/05/the-chain-reactions-of-food-security-part-two/">http://foodchainreaction.org/index.php/2015/10/05/the-chain-reactions-of-food-security-part-two/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[...] climate change and the growing human population are working against global food security. <strong>Climate change is warming and acidifying our oceans, causing droughts and other extreme weather events, and degrading the quality of arable land. At the same time, our growing population demands more resources than the planet can provide.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;NASA research forecasts that North American droughts in the second half of this century could be &#39;drier and longer&#39; than those of the last 1,000 years. Additional <strong>research indicates a global increase in droughts</strong>. This new normal will have far-reaching effects for food production and our ability to feed a growing planet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Looking ahead, climate change will boost productivity in some areas, but agricultural yields will decline overall, <em>particularly in developing nations</em> whose populations will grow most quickly. &quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[...] natural factors, like flooding, drought, and warmer temperatures can reduce the amount of food produced, causing regional shortages that can have far-reaching effects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;At the same time, disruptions to food security have a cascading effect on communities across the globe. Disruptions can impact human health, harm the environment, contribute to civil unrest, hinder economic growth, and even threaten national security.&quot;</p>
