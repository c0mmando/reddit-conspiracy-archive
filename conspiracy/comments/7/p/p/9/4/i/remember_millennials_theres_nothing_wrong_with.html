       Intergenerational warfare is one of the ways the Elites divide and conquer. Fox News and the New York Post are aware of their audience's age and are happy to attack millennials overall for acting different.
      </p>
      <p>
       It pains me to see a few millennials even buy into the disparagement.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Millennials are more strapped for cash than previous generations.
       </li>
       <li>
        But they save more.
       </li>
       <li>
        They donate more.
       </li>
       <li>
        They are driving Big Soda out of business.

       Hi, millennial here. We are not the only ones suffering. The only division people should focus on is class division and income inequality. No more liberals/conservatives using IDPOL to pit us against each other.

       Yes, it wasn’t our fault but again we aren’t the only ones suffering.

       What's more important is what happens at home, do the parents push their children to be better, to be moral, to always seek truth and honest, do they push education as the top of their priorities no matter the circumstance. I promise you if every parent did this, we'd live in a thriving populace and economy.

       Of course there's nothing inherently wrong with being from "x" generation. Just like how everyone blames the Baby-Boomers for everything these days. It's not their fault, they were just reaping the benefits of a much more fruitful country than what we have now. Anyone would have done that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any argument you can make against Millennials all boils down to the sad sad society we currently live in. People used to spend their 20's having children in their house that they owned, and afforded, with their rewarding career. Now people in their 20's work at Starbucks and live with their parents because they can't drop half their income on rent.
      </p>
      <p>
       71% of Americans made less than $50,000 last year, did you know that? Marriage rates are down, birth rates are down.
       <strong>
        So of course
       </strong>
       these people in these destitute situations are instead, thrusting themselves into things like individualism and social/political movements and revolutions. Of course they feel
       <strong>
        entitled
       </strong>
       to a better American Dream than what they're offered. What even is this country anymore...

       The new joke goes~ Your Great Grandparent's has 6-10 children.  Your Grandparents had 3-5 children.  Your Parents had 1-3 children.  You have 1 cat and 1 dog and live in your parent's basement.
      </p>
      <p>
       All jokes aside.. it's common that both people in a marriage have a job (or two) and still can't even afford all that they need.  I see my wife 30 minutes a day as we pass each other in our studio.. if I'm lucky.

       I agree with you, but this does not change the fact that most families waste outrageous sums of money on alcohol, cigarettes, other drugs, netflix, fuel for frivolous driving, processed foods, junk toys for kids, videogame subscriptions, and all other manner of completely unnecessary crap.

       If anything millennials should be pissed at the other generations because they are inheriting the short straw for what happened under the other generations watch. Yet I hear that ignorance so much, that millennials are the issue. It's not their fault you can't work a search browser or don't know dick about computers. The majority of millennials that I know are holding off their lives (getting married, starting a family, etc.) because the are buried with the work of picking up the slack of a older co-worker that has a family. Seems like they are still being viewed as kids and when older people have families and take time off it is ok, but heaven forbid that the productive millennial wants to enjoy their life. They are a dime a dozen, so that if you don't want to sell your soul to work for a company they can just move on to the next millennial that is hungry enough that will.

       Can't believe that you're getting downvoted for reminding this generation that you're less likely to get a real job if you have a useless degree than if  you have one in a field they are hiring for.
      </p>

       There are jobs for Womens Study Degree holders - mostly in teaching of other fools who want Womens Study Degrees.

       You're a millennial, don't you want to distance yourself from biased feminist shit? There's a reason people dislike stereotypes
(e.g. generalizing "Trump supporters are racists" or "left wingers are snowflakes", etc.).

       How about just not taking on a name like Millenials in the first place?  How about not allowing yourself to fit into someone elses creation so that you can be marginalized in any way?  How about just being a human being first and only.

       You can make it disappear by not participating in its usage at all.  It it to show others how it can be used as a tool to manipulate.  That gets the job done and doesn't pigeon hole people and allow it to continue.

       From various articles, I've come to the conclusion that "millennial" includes everyone between the ages of 18 and 48, but only when they do something we don't like.

       The old hate the young, because they're pissed they're not young anymore.  They always have, and they always will, and they'll keep voting for shit that makes the lives of young people fucking miserable.  Old people were hating the kids back in the 60s, and they've been going strong ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you disagree because you're old and you don't hate the young, good for you, you're better than your peers.

       The West has been degenerating for many decades. It was written about extensively last century. See Huxley's "Brave New World Revisited" published 1958.

       its my favorite work of all time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was born in the 90s, but chose exile from society at a young age and decided I didn't like everyone, they were all lying to me, and that I would have to come up with my own belief systems, ethics, and religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did this at about 6 or 7. stuck with it ever since. I almost turned out autistic because I spent such little time socializing until I got older and needed to manipulate people to get what I wanted out of them. it was at that point I realized how sick the world was.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a sociopath, and learning manipulation didn't come easy. I felt... guilt. sadness for these people who were of lesser intelligence and lacked my true sense of freedom and independence, unbridled by the shackles of accepted law or taboo.
      </p>
      <p>
       the first thing I noticed when I re-integrated into society was females glorifying behavior and lyrics in songs which degraded them as people. Now, I hate feminists as a true egalitarian, I'll be honest with you; but the fact that young people were unable to discern good from bad in relation to shit like that was ridiculous. whats more ridiculous is seeing benign normal behavior derided by such groups, yet the major cultural "accomplishments" which basically amount to fecal murals on a bathroom wall, are not and these people are "good role models with talent" lmao.
      </p>
      <p>
       eventually I realized that even more evil people than me would just take what I wanted anyways and leave others used, abused, and hurt. so I figured if I was straightforward and didn't mislead people too much, being a bit evil wouldn't hurt as long as it served my end purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       in the end, I still choose exile anyway. I don't want friends unless they have something for me. Everything I try to smile or laugh with them about is mostly a fraud anyway. I have few friends, and among them are only those who also count as heretics.

       The vast, vast, vast majority of people alive today cannot and will not think for themselves, because to do so would mean going against the herd, and people hate going against the herd. Their nature is to try to fit in, to seek validation and approval from the humans around them. This is just how it is.

       No I don't really think they hate me, but I do think the Cold War mindset is holding the world back, severely. And I see the Baby Boomers currently holding the wealth and power of this world as the biggest hurdle towards a more reasonable future.
