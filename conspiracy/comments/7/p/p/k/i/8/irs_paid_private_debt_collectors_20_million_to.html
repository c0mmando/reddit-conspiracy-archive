<p>Congress directed the beleaguered IRS to use private contractors in 2015 in an attempt to make some headway into the $450 billion of unpaid taxes owed to the federal government. </p>

<p>This is the problem.  People hate paying for government employees, and especially hate the IRS.  It would be more cost effective to just have the IRS do this.  A lot of people like to cut back on federal employees, but they don&#39;t seem to realize that the work still needs to be done.  So instead they have to hire private contractors who cost a whole lot more.</p>

<p>No you don&#39;t seem to realize the IRS does not need to exist at all.  The only &quot;work&quot; that needs done is closing the IRS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was not attempting to &quot;game Rule 13.&quot; Since Rule 13 as stated does not apply to self posts, I was adhering to Rule 12 that asks the OP to supply some context for the self post. That is why, in addition to the link, I added the comment:  &quot;Your tax dollars at work&quot;. Was that not sufficient? Please clarify what rule was violated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s either you were gaming rule 13 or violating rule 12 by providing no context/content.  Take your pick.  Self posts require a bit of fleshing out, not just a throwaway sentence with a link.  Your post as is would have been much better served as a link post with submission statement, unless you felt like you wanted to add some of your own commentary to make it a self post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for that clarification - I can accept the reasoning behind violating Rule 12 based on insufficient context provided. In hindsight, I agree that it would have been much better to have done this as a link post with submission statement. That is good guidance going forward.</p>

<p>You might consider adding more clarification in the rules or the FAQ on the requirements or expectations for self-posts to avoid rule violations (if it is a problem). Right now, the rules do not preclude links in self-posts but some consider self-posts to be text only. For this subreddit, I gather that it doesn&#39;t matter as long as sufficient context or fleshing out is provided with the link.</p>

<p>Exactly this.  Pretty much any self post is fine as long as it isn&#39;t from a troll and a bit of unique thought by the OP went into it.  Sometimes adding a link or multiple links even improves the post because you can use the links to support your argument or show different perspectives.</p>
