       This tweet caught my eye, so I decided to look it up and see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turns out that in the Fusion testimony leaks they mention Tevfik Arif.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look him up, all kinds of shady dealings and criminal cases hound him and his "business partners".

       Turns out they were having "cheese pizza" parties on the Turkish President's boat. He managed to have the charges dropped but we all known that means he used his money and influence to shut it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not one mention of that in r/pizzagate or r/pedogate. Not even in the voat forums, I've checked.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder why? 🤔

        Could this be the reason?

       EDIT!:

      <p>
       Proof they were sleeping with underage prostitutes but used influence to have charges dropped!

       It's definitely sticking to a particular group, but that's because it's relevant. What it's not doing is saying that this only occurs on that side though, which would be partisan. It's just a particular aspect of the larger issue and therefore worth exploring.

       Great find and good post, I upvoted. But I hate the term pizzagate it is so easy for doubters and shills to argue and deny, I wish we could change the name to something new and define it. I think this is all part of the pedocracy were TPTB use underage sex as a gift and for blackmail.

       That's because the initial pizzagate was a blatant political hitpiece based on complete fabrication to discredit democrats.

       Thats absolute bullshit. The 4chan fantasy about comet pingpong was 100% partisan.

       General investigations into child abuse are not the same thing as pizzagate and are not partisan.

       Didn't Trump have model agencies and pageants and  a thing for former Soviet women. His Mossad and (Czech ) Russian mafia links would make him perfect for human trafficking and money laundering. Hotels are just empty brothels and model agencies are essentially pimps. 
Wonder which oligarch backed his debts with Deutsche bank and what they have on him.

       If there are breadcrumbs pointing to trump involvement, please push them towards liberal subreddits (because they’ll be as inclined as TD users are to call attention to it). If people could unite over the fact that there truly is an issue of children being abused and often shuttled through state agencies to facilitate, ill regain some faith in humanity. I do not believe there is a pedo ring running out
If comet ping pong. There is, however, some troubling findings available that people refuse to investigate or report on. I sincerely doubt that American political parties matter at all at a level of society where people and children are bought and sold for sexual abuse. Their politics are of literally no importance at that point.

       Okay, I'm not one for 4D chess but ... "centipedes" and (I assume) Russian spies pushed the pizzagate narrative hard (and still do)...

      <p>
       Maybe its so they're in a position to suppress what some of them already know: Trump is actually involved in an elite pedophile ring.  What better way to ensure you can prevent people from finding out by leading the charge in the opposite direction?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's amazing that so far, literally everything the Trump side has accused the other side of doing, they have been doing themselves with the exception of this (without literally any corroborating evidence) until now.

       My experience doesn't match what you're saying here.  Like
       <a href="/u/FoxRaptix">
        /u/FoxRaptix
       </a>
       said above, the only true widespread support of someone who most would count as a pedophile came from hardline ultraconservatives in the form of support for Roy Moore in the Alabama election.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that individuals, regardless of their political leanings, surely support pedophiles on their own but there isn't credible evidence to suggest that democrats, even neoliberal democrats, protect pedophiles.  Even saying republicans as a whole support pedophiles isn't true, since many party leaders came out and condemned Roy Moore, for example, before the election and fractured wholehearted party support for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       It almost reaches the point of
       <em>
        whataboutism
       </em>
       in my mind, where no party can be at fault because each party is at least a little in the wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I invite any serious evidence that suggests any sizeable faction of democrats actually protect pedophiles; in my mind pizzagate is different things to different people:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        a crowdsourced search for pedophiles hiding among our elite; a noble but at the same time misguided cause
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        a suggestion that Clinton or parties related to Clinton harbored or protected pedophiles
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       If pizzagate sounds like the second, to you, then I would love to see your evidence.  Though I've not kept up with it closely, the only news I've heard out of that camp is some of the individuals close to that group had odd artistic proclivities but never any credible proof.  And, do recall, at the beginning
       <strong>
        everyone
       </strong>
       was looking directly at them.  Hell, we had all of their emails.  The DNC is one of the most-scrutinized political organizations in recent memory and the results of all of that intense scrutiny was ... what, exactly? Some references to hotdogs and pizza? That's not enough for me, and I would think with all of these crowdsourced detectives, we'd find at least the bare minimum to give to authorities to start a proper investigation.

       A group of children, showing signs of sexual abuse, were found being transported to Mexico with two adult members of the cult. They knew food only as a reward, were dirty, didn’t know what a toilet was, etc. Authorities searched the compound of the cult and found the kids were involved in ceremonies where they sacrificed goats, took baby goats out of the mother, and a child had a goat head presented to it. They found evidence of buying and selling children abroad, moving kids around to avoid the authorities, child porn, a room for creating the porn, and so on. The end result? The investigation was called off because it was a “CIA internal matter.” These are profoundly evil people.

       Note the sources used in the article above. They are all mainstream respected newspapers like The New York Times and The Chicago Tribune. This isn’t some theory a deranged paranoid person came up with, these are verifiable facts.

       Why aren't the Pizzagate people raising hell about this? There's MSM reporting of it. Fuck, there's proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems obvious to me that it's bc "Pizzagate Researchers" have ulterior partisan motives. They'd rather chase circumstantial evidence than demand answers for proven cases, bc their fairy tale has a "bad guy" they really want to see go down.

       Tried to look at your link but it comes up as a Chinese webpage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I copied and pasted your above paragraph but could not find. "Mexico with two adult members of the cult". Any information on names and location and who did the bust?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Why aren't the Pizzagate people raising hell about this? There's MSM reporting of it. Fuck, there's proof." I just don't know what you're talking about. The DA in California during operation Reclaim and Rebuild, what were the results of that? Why did outlets to run the story for an hour never report on it again? Not even a follow up report to find the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       CNBC, European Press released a huge Norway bust for a connected traffic ring that led to US citizens in Georgia and Connecticut, after CNBCs 5 minute segment they never bothered to do any followup for the connections in the US which should have been a concern. Remember the Florida, Texas, and Tennessee busts and how over 700+ people were rounded up? Almost all these cases are massively under reported and no follow up, we don't know who has been charged with what. If Russia had anything to do with it they'd jump into it and find exactly who was behind it, names, locations, links, suspects, a full 24 hour session with speculation, connections, ect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can keep bringing up pedo busts that have been long forgotten by MSM, only to resurface again years later with no surprise on their face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the above ones, MSM would gladly accept any pedo bust at face value then brush it off. Connect it to someone in politics? Uh oh, better bring out every talking head in existence to bury the narrative, forgetting that numerous people connected had actual verified sexual scandals in their past.

       I believe the pizzagate crowd is more interested in highly dubious circumstantial "Evidence" conerning a pizza parlor than actual documented cases of spooks trafficking kids. Their posts are ample proof of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I then have to question their motives. The only thing that makes sense is that it's not about the kids, as they don't go after the verifiable cases, but about political attacks. Sad!

       Is there anyone who's anyone that Trump hasn't been photographed with? He's a classic and consummate schmoozer when it comes to any opportunity to get some free press.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure he knows all kinds of wicked and unconscionable things about what some of the filthy rich get up to in amusing and entertaining themselves, as do countless others among the elites who may personally disapprove of it but nevertheless still turn a blind eye to it or ever dare to say anything bad about them because of the business, power, money, and connections they all happen to have that are worth considerably more to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd think that they were all the best of friends they way they glad hand and go out of their way to greet each other at any of their social gatherings and affairs but that's simply how it is and how it works. There's a pay-back in the offing for it and all kinds of nasty complications that can arise if they don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not necessarily letting Trump off the hook, just suggesting that we try to be realistic about the bigger picture of how the elites operate. They wouldn't have all the money that they do and still continue to accumulate more if they didn't respect any and every opportunity to make it whether they really respected any of the people behind those opportunities or not so they don't ever rock the boat.

       A large number of progressives (including myself) believe that pedogate implies high level pedophile rings in our society across party lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there seems to be a never ending stream of people on this sub trying to politicize the child abuse. Pretending it's only the democrats or the Republicans who are pedophiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is that there are pedos on both sides of the aisle. The whole idea behind it is that the oligarchy use underage prostitutes to bribe/blackmail the most influential politicians. The oligarchy controls both the red and blue parties, therefor both parties are involved in these pedophile rings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep shining a light on all of these Pedos, no matter where they fall on the political spectrum.

       No offense, but I don't think you understand what Pgate actually was and weren't involved with the original investigation. You're finding a guy and trying to link someone who did business with him to his crimes with no evidence whatsoever. Not to mention this guy was acquitted on all charges. It says so in the damn article you posted (that is 7 years old btw). The thing with Epstein (which isn't even pgate) is that he was criminally charged and prosecuted and found to have these parties on his plane. Bill Clinton was on the flight logs so people put 2 and 2 together. So to try and attach Trump to this yacht is just ridiculous.

       You realize you are in the Conspiracy sub, right? It is common knowledge here that Pedosta is an ugly man and Julian Assange is a hero. Context is everything and that is why WikiLeaks always releases EVERYTHING. So how about you show me the context you speak of in emails like "handkerchief that seems map related" and "dominoes on top of pizza rather than pasta" or ya know the whole thing about spirit cooking or Hillary rigging the Palestinian election, or Hillary colluding with media, or selling Russia US Uranium supply, or being in bed with ISIS.

       Ah Newsweek, the bastion of journalism. So a Jane Doe comes forward with accusations on June 2016 when it appears he is gaining ground in the election. It doesn't pan out. Charges dropped. Am I missing anything?

       Nope. But you do realize this is a conspiracy sub. (Sorry for the Newsweek article but it was reported pretty far). It had came out the same time as the prince andrew report. 
So you don’t think trump has the means to either a) pay someone off to keep quiet or b) could threaten someone so much so they would back down?
And are you saying that bill Clinton could of been involved but not trump? Am I missing something?

       Woah dude! Are you for real? Trump has a track record. Raped his wife, numerous women coming forward for sexual misconduct. Allegations from a victim that went to court that he was part of the Epstein thing. That’s a track record. 
Clinton has no evidence either. I think they are both dirty scum bags

       It's definitely sticking to a particular group, but that's because it's relevant. What it's not doing is saying that this only occurs on that side though, which would be partisan. It's just a particular aspect of the larger issue and therefore worth exploring.

       My experience doesn't match what you're saying here.  Like
       <a href="/u/FoxRaptix">
        /u/FoxRaptix
       </a>
       said above, the only true widespread support of someone who most would count as a pedophile came from hardline ultraconservatives in the form of support for Roy Moore in the Alabama election.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that individuals, regardless of their political leanings, surely support pedophiles on their own but there isn't credible evidence to suggest that democrats, even neoliberal democrats, protect pedophiles.  Even saying republicans as a whole support pedophiles isn't true, since many party leaders came out and condemned Roy Moore, for example, before the election and fractured wholehearted party support for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       It almost reaches the point of
       <em>
        whataboutism
       </em>
       in my mind, where no party can be at fault because each party is at least a little in the wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I invite any serious evidence that suggests any sizeable faction of democrats actually protect pedophiles; in my mind pizzagate is different things to different people:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        a crowdsourced search for pedophiles hiding among our elite; a noble but at the same time misguided cause
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        a suggestion that Clinton or parties related to Clinton harbored or protected pedophiles
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       If pizzagate sounds like the second, to you, then I would love to see your evidence.  Though I've not kept up with it closely, the only news I've heard out of that camp is some of the individuals close to that group had odd artistic proclivities but never any credible proof.  And, do recall, at the beginning
       <strong>
        everyone
       </strong>
       was looking directly at them.  Hell, we had all of their emails.  The DNC is one of the most-scrutinized political organizations in recent memory and the results of all of that intense scrutiny was ... what, exactly? Some references to hotdogs and pizza? That's not enough for me, and I would think with all of these crowdsourced detectives, we'd find at least the bare minimum to give to authorities to start a proper investigation.

       A group of children, showing signs of sexual abuse, were found being transported to Mexico with two adult members of the cult. They knew food only as a reward, were dirty, didn’t know what a toilet was, etc. Authorities searched the compound of the cult and found the kids were involved in ceremonies where they sacrificed goats, took baby goats out of the mother, and a child had a goat head presented to it. They found evidence of buying and selling children abroad, moving kids around to avoid the authorities, child porn, a room for creating the porn, and so on. The end result? The investigation was called off because it was a “CIA internal matter.” These are profoundly evil people.

       Note the sources used in the article above. They are all mainstream respected newspapers like The New York Times and The Chicago Tribune. This isn’t some theory a deranged paranoid person came up with, these are verifiable facts.

       Why aren't the Pizzagate people raising hell about this? There's MSM reporting of it. Fuck, there's proof.

       Seems obvious to me that it's bc "Pizzagate Researchers" have ulterior partisan motives. They'd rather chase circumstantial evidence than demand answers for proven cases, bc their fairy tale has a "bad guy" they really want to see go down.
