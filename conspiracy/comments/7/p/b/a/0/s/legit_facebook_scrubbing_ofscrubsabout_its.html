        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">26</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-01-09 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Werewolf35b.html">Werewolf35b</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think I found a bit of a real &quot;conspiracy&quot;- </p>

<p>I was arguing with a guy on a nother sub about Facebook listening to you.</p>

<p>He said they don&#39;t and it&#39;s impossible for various reasons. </p>

<p>I informed him that his view was outdated because a year ago or so, they admitted that when you post on desktop, while your text box is open, they listen until you hit send. This was all over the net. People got mad, and Facebook responded with a link allowing you to opt out by hitting a button or switch. </p>

<p>So while crafting my response to the guy, who is getting upvotes, while I got downvotes, I looked for articles about it. 
It appears to be scrubbed from the net. I went through three pages of links saying they don&#39;t listen before I got to one that said &quot;maybe they could.&quot; </p>

<p>So I crafted a post here in conspiracy bemoaning Facebook&#39;s excellent SEO scrubbing, and asking for help finding proof of my claim. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the post </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7oezf4/facebook_has_seo_scrubbed_its_admission_of_spying/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7oezf4/facebook_has_seo_scrubbed_its_admission_of_spying/</a></p>

<p>So the post didn&#39;t get much attention, but here&#39;s the reason for this new post- in the comments a guy finds a local news station article reffering to the listening program, that&#39;s all that could be cooked up! Sure, I&#39;ll take it, better than nothing to prove I&#39;m not crazy, (well, I&#39;m crazy, but not for that reason...)</p>

<p>Well, in the couple of days since he posted his link, and me clicking on it, it&#39;s now a &quot;page not found&quot; error! The poster even had a legalese quote from the article, so I don&#39;t think he was cleverly yanking my chain, and here&#39;s the conspiracy-</p>

<p>Is Facebook actively scrubbing from internet history and public consciousness it&#39;s admission of listening, to such a degree that my insignificant little post was found, and they got the article from some random local news stations webpage also scrubbed due to my post, and the responders post reply? </p>

<p>I think so. What do you think?</p>

<p>and here&#39;s a few google results from searching that quoted phrase (“We use your microphone to identify the things you’re listening to or watching&quot;)  </p>

<p>This one is dated before the <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/h/facebook-does-not-use-your-phones-microphone-for-ads-or-news-feed-stories/">FB statement</a>, so I&#39;m not sure where they got the original quote:<br/>
