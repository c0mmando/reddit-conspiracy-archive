I&#39;m skeptical about monitoring nowadays because people are doing a pretty good job of monitoring themselves and then posting it on Facebook, but one of the longest standing treaties of the space age is to not weaponize space.

    <div class="md"><p>Nuclear weapons are complicated and unnecessary. They could drop a steel beam from orbit and cause nuclear-bomb-level devastation without radioactive fallout that would spread to other areas. I&#39;m sure they have some weapons like that up there. Probably other types too. I hope there&#39;s not many nuclear bombs though. I hope they would have realized that massive destruction can be achieved from orbit without risking uncontrolled release of weapons-grade radioactive material. </p>

Mind blowing that this would mostly be done with kinetic energy.

    <div class="md"><p>I mean the weapon once fired is difficult to counter. Several other delivery systems have some form of &quot;counter&quot;. You can shoot down planes and maybe even ICBMs but once an orbital platform has fired there is nothing you can do, due to the velocity the impact happens extremely fast. You can obviously destroy the orbital platform but this would have to be preemptive. Once such platform gets the firing command you can&#39;t really stop it. Compare that to a bomb delivered via plane. After the decisions is made to bomb there is plenty of time to intervene.</p>

<p>I maybe didn&#39;t make myself clear, I am not arguing you can&#39;t destroy weapon platforms in space I argue you can&#39;t <strong><em>react</em></strong> to a firing command.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there is no orbital gun platform in use to our knowledge and what they eventually brew up is up to debate. I am no expert but this orbital stuff will hit within minutes with 10k kph. Far faster than ICBMs also harder to shoot down I would imagine. I works just by kinetic energy so it also be less vulnerable to problems. Once the thing is on its way I doubt there is anything to be done about it.</p>

<p>&quot;Another example is the array of technologies—often referred to collectively as geoengineering—that potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change. One that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI, a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun’s heat, in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do.&quot; </p>

Not sure what the angle is here, but I don’t think standard procedure when there’s a failure or issue during a classified government operation (in this case working with SpaceX) to come out and announce it to the public, unless it’s someone’s idea of a PR move attempting to seem more transparent, if so I’m not buying it. </p>

<p>Because launch a real billion dollar satellite, fake the failure (once it&#39;s in orbit it&#39;s pure data, and no judge is going to accept tracking of a classified military satellite as evidence in court) and claim the insurance money. That would be how you launch a black budget satellite with no &quot;credible&quot; suspicions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you we follow your logic, I should be able to throw myself off the CN Tower and land by the same way physics I used to jump off. Not possible. </p>

<p>it&#39;s basic Newtonian physics. An object of that  size with its mass concentrated at its center, cannot land at those speeds on a boat. if you are falling at 21 000km/hr down, turning on boosters at last minute will NOT result in a stop when all your mass is centered! This only happens in animation. It is equivalent to  me landing on my feet perfectly after jumping off the CN Tower because I put my boosters on last minute before I touch the ground.</p>

<p>not possible unless you use CGI. Which exactly what they are using in their videos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The booster is practically empty. An empty rocket booster is not very heavy at all. A fully loaded Falcon 9 rocket is only 500,000kgs, but in the above you are claiming the booster is 1 million. And the booster itself is not travelling at orbital velocity, like you claim. If it was travelling at orbital speed than it wouldn&#39;t be able to fall back into the atmosphere to even land (the second stage brings the payload to orbit). Furthermore, the atmosphere itself slows things down and there is something called terminal velocity. </p>

<p>It&#39;s basic Newtonian physics. You fire your thruster in the opposite direction of your vector, and this slows you down. That is how they land. Just because you don&#39;t believe it&#39;s technically feasible is your own prerogative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do.  Tracking space objects  in orbit like that is really easy, I don&#39;t believe they would be able to hide it.  Furthermore, its far from surprising spacex set more tax dollars on fire.  I dont see what other possibility there is -- the satellite failed to deploy or we would be able to track it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>tracking objects in orbit around the planet is crucial to civilian space operations... things up there are so expensive, and it is not easy at all to coordinate them (compared to something on earth anyway) and you do not want things crashing around up there. Especially if things fall back down on valuable land.  Furthermore, the satellites themselves are just difficult to hide from civilian astronomy.  Remember, civilian astronomers can detect objects that are incredible far away. even a minute object that is so close to earth it is below moon orbit is easily detectable.</p>
