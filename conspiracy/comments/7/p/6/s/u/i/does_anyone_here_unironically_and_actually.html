       Did anyone know what the payload was?  Doubt that it got destroyed but I do wonder what is up there now.  Maybe they can drop nukes from space now with whatever that was.  Emp device maybe

       It could be anything. I'm skeptical about monitoring nowadays because people are doing a pretty good job of monitoring themselves and then posting it on Facebook, but one of the longest standing treaties of the space age is to not weaponize space. Perhaps it's got something to do with that.

       Nuclear weapons are complicated and unnecessary. They could drop a steel beam from orbit and cause nuclear-bomb-level devastation without radioactive fallout that would spread to other areas. I'm sure they have some weapons like that up there. Probably other types too. I hope there's not many nuclear bombs though. I hope they would have realized that massive destruction can be achieved from orbit without risking uncontrolled release of weapons-grade radioactive material.

       He is exaggerating but due to the possible velocity orbital weapons could easily exceed normal non-nuclear weapons in terms of destructive power. On top of that, there is hardly anything you can do about.

       Interesting, well the range of atomic bombs is pretty big. Didn't read the link did they estimate the TNT equivalent? Mind blowing that this would mostly be done with kinetic energy. Looks like sci fi needs to catch up to real war, most sci-fi ideas about orbital bombardment feature nuclear weapons when you can apparently just drop a big enough metal projectile.

       I mean the weapon once fired is difficult to counter. Several other delivery systems have some form of "counter". You can shoot down planes and maybe even ICBMs but once an orbital platform has fired there is nothing you can do, due to the velocity the impact happens extremely fast. You can obviously destroy the orbital platform but this would have to be preemptive. Once such platform gets the firing command you can't really stop it. Compare that to a bomb delivered via plane. After the decisions is made to bomb there is plenty of time to intervene.
      </p>
      <p>
       I maybe didn't make myself clear, I am not arguing you can't destroy weapon platforms in space I argue you can't

       Well, there is no orbital gun platform in use to our knowledge and what they eventually brew up is up to debate. I am no expert but this orbital stuff will hit within minutes with 10k kph. Far faster than ICBMs also harder to shoot down I would imagine. I works just by kinetic energy so it also be less vulnerable to problems. Once the thing is on its way I doubt there is anything to be done about it.

       They describe using tungsten, I suppose I was mistaken suggesting steel although I'm not sure steel wouldn't also be effective. They also say that "some systems are quoted as having the yield of a small tactical nuclear bomb." I guess you could argue I was wrong to say "nuclear-bomb-level", but they're still being compared to nuclear bomb there.

       ICBMs already function this way, they enter space before re-entry.  I highly doubt they have nuclear weapons deployed permanently on a satelite, due to the fact that the russians (and probably chinese) have anti satelite weapons systems.  However, I wouldn't say it is impossible -- just seems like bad strategy to me, and a waste of money.

       It makes sense to have more weapons to deploy. When it comes to a nuclear war it's all about multiple means of delivery. That's why there's what's known as the trifecta - silo, plane delivered, and submarine based

       Yeah but take not that all those delivery means are remarkably defensible, submarines being considered one of the most important and dangerous delivery systems. due to the fact that they are essentially undetectable, and then consider the value of a satellite that everyone knows where it is at all times and could destroy it or even capture it if they saw fit.  Not saying its impossible, just seems like a SAT is a platform illsuited to storing nukes in my mind

       "Another example is the array of technologies—often referred to collectively as geoengineering—that potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change. One that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI, a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun’s heat, in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do."

       I think it’s strange that supposedly it was taking a top secret satellite into orbit and because there was a malfunction they felt the need to announce it through the media. Not sure what the angle is here, but I don’t think standard procedure when there’s a failure or issue during a classified government operation (in this case working with SpaceX) to come out and announce it to the public, unless it’s someone’s idea of a PR move attempting to seem more transparent, if so I’m not buying it.

       But if I needed to hide a couple billion dollars in embezzlement, black ops, budget overruns, etc, I would just build a "billion dollar" spy satellite out of spare junk parts and then launch it and make sure it burns up.  Then I have an extra billion dollars in my budget with no questions asked.

       Actually I was wondering if the military insures it's satellite launches like commercial companies or if they do the "insurance fund".
      </p>
      <p>
       Because launch a real billion dollar satellite, fake the failure (once it's in orbit it's pure data, and no judge is going to accept tracking of a classified military satellite as evidence in court) and claim the insurance money. That would be how you launch a black budget satellite with no "credible" suspicions.

       Agreed. Top secret items don’t really scream, “front-page material”. This is either a soft disclosure or some form of controlled narrative.

       You mean like how 'communications satellites' were a science fiction fantasy created by Arthur c Clarke, and within a few years were suddenly a 'real thing'?

       And of course we all know that satellites are real. We have all seen the crappy CGI images and videos on our telescreens.

       What if this is a misdirection. Now other countries might believe there is an errant spy satellite in orbit. Other countries will mobilize to intercept the satellite. There are Chinese satellites that do very odd things, so maybe the US wants to force the hand of other countries and see what they have?

       I agree. Also the fact that the info is being pushed out to the public instead of trying to contain &amp; distract from it (like usual) definitely affirms my belief that it was planned, or like someone above said soft disclosure possibly to prime public perception for whatever the next incident is.

       That's not what I am saying. I don't think this has anything to do with disclosure or an "incident." I'm saying it could be an espionage game, basically.

       Again, How do you slow down a missile weighing over 1 million kg going 21,000 km/hr to a halt on boat vertically from 7km distance?( This is their own telemetry reading on the screen when it lands.)

       You should not accept this nonesense! This is a really bad magic trick that depends on the observer to suspend all reason and scientific understanding of how natural physics works.

       If you we follow your logic, I should be able to throw myself off the CN Tower and land by the same way physics I used to jump off. Not possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's basic Newtonian physics. An object of that  size with its mass concentrated at its center, cannot land at those speeds on a boat. if you are falling at 21 000km/hr down, turning on boosters at last minute will NOT result in a stop when all your mass is centered! This only happens in animation. It is equivalent to  me landing on my feet perfectly after jumping off the CN Tower because I put my boosters on last minute before I touch the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       not possible unless you use CGI. Which exactly what they are using in their videos.

       The booster is practically empty. An empty rocket booster is not very heavy at all. A fully loaded Falcon 9 rocket is only 500,000kgs, but in the above you are claiming the booster is 1 million. And the booster itself is not travelling at orbital velocity, like you claim. If it was travelling at orbital speed than it wouldn't be able to fall back into the atmosphere to even land (the second stage brings the payload to orbit). Furthermore, the atmosphere itself slows things down and there is something called terminal velocity.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's basic Newtonian physics. You fire your thruster in the opposite direction of your vector, and this slows you down. That is how they land. Just because you don't believe it's technically feasible is your own prerogative.

       I watched the launch from my front yard about 30-50 miles from the coast and I could see the silhouette of the same plume that was lit up by the sunset in the recent space x launch over nevada/california. It looked like a massive chemtrail dump to me. Went to bed with clear dry and cool weather conditions and woke up to 100% cloud cover blocking the Sun all day.

       This can happen literally any day if conditions are right. Did you look up weather predictions? What systems were heading your way beforehand? Any data at all that would tell you what the weather would be like? Why jump to chemtrails?

       I look at satellite imagery. They pump moisture into the air using rapid evaporation boats off the coast. The water vapor clings to the nano-metals that are being deposited into the atmosphere by the chemtrails. They can then use high power radio waves to manipulate the cloud cover.

       I do.  Tracking space objects  in orbit like that is really easy, I don't believe they would be able to hide it.  Furthermore, its far from surprising spacex set more tax dollars on fire.  I dont see what other possibility there is -- the satellite failed to deploy or we would be able to track it.

       tracking objects in orbit around the planet is crucial to civilian space operations... things up there are so expensive, and it is not easy at all to coordinate them (compared to something on earth anyway) and you do not want things crashing around up there. Especially if things fall back down on valuable land.  Furthermore, the satellites themselves are just difficult to hide from civilian astronomy.  Remember, civilian astronomers can detect objects that are incredible far away. even a minute object that is so close to earth it is below moon orbit is easily detectable.

       Orbital mechanics are deterministic (well for our purposes) and the people tasked with tracking these objects are following them, often from the moment they leave the ground.

       The big problem with things crashing around up there is that they
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       fall back down.  They stay up there for decades or centuries just thrashing around.  That's why this story is so far fetched.. That satellite would not have come down at all after separation unless it was slowed down enough to deorbit, and that takes quite a bit of energy to just happen by mistake.

       It happens sometimes especially if some part of the sat is leaking something or depressurizing, or simply if the vehicles trajectory was altered by a collision.

       Considering it was rumored to be carrying a top-secret spy satellite and the "break-up" was first reported by
       <em>
        the WSJ

       Actually nothing broke the unit that was used to eject the payload was made by Northrop Grumman instead of SpaceX and that failed to disengage properly and dropped into the ocean.  SpaceX performed flawlessly.

       The big problem with things crashing around up there is that they
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       fall back down.  They stay up there for decades or centuries just thrashing around.  That's why this story is so far fetched.. That satellite would not have come down at all after separation unless it was slowed down enough to deorbit, and that takes quite a bit of energy to just happen by mistake.
