       Does anyone think the same? If they are the paid opposition, which does exist here, that means things they highlight and ridicule are true.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I am correct and TMOR are SB and MM then someone paid them to change the narrative of the original post by cross referencing and putting that post in their sub. Then miraculously, they all agree with each other with no dissenting voices among them, then they post with positive comments and upvoting each other in galore, all in unison. Fishy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because you could say, as many have said before, they are just bullies, but what is the point of harassing if it indeed cross referenced posts are conspiracy in nature? It's just a waste of time.

       I didn't know about them till I joined this subreddit either. TopMindsOfReddit subreddit. They are mostly banned users from here back when you were banned for being liberal. Hence they are mostly of the same mindset in being liberal. It's a joke subreddit where they post dumb shit people write.
      </p>
      <p>
       Us being a conservative leaning sub and since those users were banned from here they often target this sub for ridicule. They openly admit they target dumb shit and it is not representative of the sub the user is from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy seems to have take this quite literally and I'll be downvoted for writing this. However, people gotta stop taking shit literally every time. Who cares what they post and are people really so fragile to get offended by them?

       You're mistaken about the origins of that sub, although maybe you're right about people banned here going there.
      </p>
      <p>
       In actuality, TMOR formed when the sub r/conspritard changed their rules to not allow any posts that link back to Reddit. Seeing as that was the entire point (laughing at outlandish theories, and the rampant racism/antiwhateverisms that were/are commonplace here) a majority of the users left and formed TMOR. Oh and in case you were wondering, the sub's name comes from a post by a user here. Some pasta worthy diatribe about how the users of this sub were the top minds of Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can assume they are all shills if you like, but I'll tell you that the users there will just get a kick out of it. I mean personally I love being called a shill for having dissenting opinions, it's hilarious.

       I enjoy perusing their sub to see if there’s anything of interest that I’ve missed here. If TMOR have picked something out for ridicule, the chances are it’s something that threatens their handlers. That in itself is enough for me to look closer at the original post.

       With the way some of the posters of TMoR vehemently deny, literally, everything, it may seem as if they're paid shills.  I really just think it's a lot of bored people though, mainly trolls, who get off on causing an uproar on the internet.

       The thing about them that doesn't sit right with me, is how they pass up the low hanging fruit.  If you sort this sub by new, especially at night in the US, you can find enough foilheaded batshit for a weeks worth of front page material on TMOR.  Instead they routinely attack our more prominent users for their political views, which are only marginally unconventional.  It really does feel like a smear job.

       I mean, sure, most people who post there and go to the sub are genuine. But I'd be surprised if most of the Mods and other organizers are genuine users. I think this is likely part of their job description.

       All these careerist demons feasting off the social capital, duplicitous and decietful in their righteous posturing and celebrated championing of divisive identity polictics and their other assorted foul activities carried out in the shadows and grey areas of societies awareness/conciousness can only be suppressed in the bowels, gutters and swamps of society for so long.
