    <div class="md"><p>Duh. It&#39;s more than just your tv or your phone or technology, those are just very powerful tools the enemy is using. It&#39;s how every day of your life goes. Your daily life is that of a debt slave. In other words, if you are an average citizen in America that goes to work 5 days a week: YOU solely exist so that the upper echelon of society can essentially &quot;extract&quot; your energy, YOUR LIFE FORCE. They party all day every day with ZERO worries. We spend every day plotting, planning a way to continue on so one day maybe we can exit the rat race (the Matrix) and become one of them. People get on their knees every fucking day and pray to a god that doesn&#39;t exist that we may have it better &quot;in the next llife&quot; because this world is so god damn fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was right with this person until he/she just applied a blanket assessment of all Christian values as equivalent to subservience. Certainly elements of Christianity breed a sort of subservient mentality, and historically Christianity has been an effective tool for control, but to apply such a terse generalization, well, it won&#39;t hold up to argumentation I&#39;m sure, if OC ever replies.</p>

Women are to be silent in churches and are the reason for sin and the apocalypse. Money is to be given to god.

And oh, your body is a temple, but no butt stuff, pork or suicide. Or cussing. Or drugs.

They&#39;ll let you in on the crazy experiment to control your mind with drugs, but how many americans know the CIA works overtime to keep one agent at every media outlet in the world?  How many people even know about Michael Hastings?  Or the level of control the CIA has over say, the NY times editorial board?</p>

<p>But they are glad people focus on it and dwell on it.  Then 30 years later, we are just finding out about the dog rape in abu ghraib forced rectal feeding, water boarding, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The story goes they forgot to destroy this one box of records</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not exactly accurate. The MK ULTRA team remembered to destroy all records associated with the experiments and admin. HOWEVER, they forgot to destroy <em>the financial records</em> that were sent to accounting. So it&#39;s kind of like taking the box of receipts (invoices, etc.) for all their work, sending them to another department, and forgetting they did so, which I find to be a totally reasonable explanation, especially for a giant bureaucracy like Clowns.</p>

<p>Incidentally, this is Assange&#39;s philosophy behind Wikileaks. &quot;Opaque&quot; institutions have to move slowly to avoid mistakes like this. They have to be careful. Meticulous, even. &quot;Open / transparent&quot; organizations don&#39;t have to be, because they have nothing to hide.</p>

<p>So personally, though I agree with you that MK ULTRA probably isn&#39;t the end of the story – especially because mind control technologies, in all likelihood, dispersed into private companies and are far more advanced now – I do think there&#39;s real legitimacy to the content that&#39;s out there and that it wasn&#39;t a &quot;limited hangout&quot; plant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your post and especially the insight on some of Assange&#39;s ideas.  </p>

<p>First let me say, I 100% believe the MK ULTRA content is completely legitimate.  That is to say, it is accurate, reflects terrible crimes, and offers real insight on the program and the CIAs intent.  Im sure you know what a limited hang out is, but just to be clear on what I MEANT,  I dont think what we have about MKULTRA is artificial or, not the truth of what happened.  It is a real scoop, -- just not the whole story.  And IF it was released as a limited hangout, my guess is that it was chosen because it was &quot;juicy&quot; if you will, or fascinating.  But still, they did so with a mind to hide other information.  Thats IF it actually was.</p>

<p>Your description of how the MKULTRA records we&#39;re discussing came to light, is more exacting and I agree this is what happened.  </p>

<p>My charge -- and I don&#39;t think you or I will be able to verify this or not but perhaps you know more of the details than me and Im actually wrong -- is that the &#39;story&#39; of how the records were recovered, which I believe was told to congress by the CIA, was actually just a story.  And they told them that story to achieve the desired affect -- to give investigators something to chew on so they could protect the real programs they were concerned about protecting (and likely really did destroy records of).  However those documents were not fabrications at all.</p>

<p>Yes totally down with this. The records that came out were definitely a very, very, very small fragment of what was actually available. Because all that was destroyed. So it was a &quot;limited hangout&quot; in actual fact, because &quot;limited&quot; was all that they had to &quot;hang out.&quot; ;) </p>

<p>But yes, in typical CIA fashion I agree that the thing was spun to hide the fact that much worse things were done that likely no one will know about (frightening) AND that the CIA knowingly destroyed records of reprehensible behavior.</p>

<p>I will actually do more research to find out how this box of financial records came to light, and who surfaced it. I know it&#39;s related to the Church Commission, but not much more.</p>

<p>This website is also the top resource I&#39;ve found online for MK-related material, as well as lots of other areas of research:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Noice man now we&#39;re feeling paranoid...  </p>

<p>Check out the pheonix program if you haven&#39;t heard of it... unbelievably savage torture and assassination program they were operating in vietnam.  When MKULTRA came to light, I believe they were still really concerned about trying to keep the pheonix program out of the light due to its strategic and political value.  Its possible some of the torture techniques they were teaching the south koreans at the time could have emerged from an MKULTRA like program.</p>

<p>Now, Im not sure if they viewed MKULTRA as  distraction for that specifically.  I just mean the pheonix program is an example of  something that is on that next level of war crime, that they NEVER would leak on accident in my view.</p>

<p>And yes, it&#39;s always worth asking &quot;What does this news from the CIA distract us from, that we&#39;re not supposed to be looking at?&quot; I like the way you think.</p>

<p>Because ultimately, MK ULTRA might also have been a distraction from Project Paperclip, which some claim was core group behind MK.</p>

However, Ewen Cameron&#39;s psychic-driving experiments are incredibly similar to trauma-based abuse. If they were successful in splitting the core personality into multiple alters that can be programmed and triggered, then the phenomenon of &quot;Satanic Ritual Abuse&quot; is likely the fruits of the CIA project.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it amusing that the conspiracies around marijuana started with prohibition but now the conspiracy theory is that TPTB are somehow behind legalization. </p>

<p>How is legal pot, grown in America, coming from Afghanistan and China?</p>

<p>The marijuana industry COULD be easily corrupted, hence why we are seeing synthetic THC and CBD being patented by big pharma. </p>

<p>The big lobbyists against legal marijuana include pharma, tobacco, and alcohol. The natural and organic production of marijuana is not a conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>Your generalization about “weed addicted folks” is not even specific to marijuana - all drugs that get abused have a negative impact on employment, buying power, productiveness and home ownership. I’d imagine this happens far less from marijuana which is significantly less addicting than alcohol or other hard drugs. </p>

<p>You can certainly provide me a source for women with endometriosis and men with thyroid issues from using marijuana - you made an objective statement which I would to hold you accountable for. If those are the only side effects from using marijuana, it sounds much better than the side effects from most pills.</p>

<p>Bottom line is that while I agree with you that there is a serious risk of this industry getting corrupted and co-opted, the pro marijuana agenda is authentic and based on evidence and research. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The average pothead (daily, frequent use) is underemployed, a renter and often no car. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now imagine the kind of person that binge drinks daily. Moderation is always important and legalization is not synonymous with turning the entire population into marijuana addicts. Alcohol is far more addictive, and yet somehow most people manage to live with moderation in terms of alcohol and have healthy, functional lives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Women often have endometriosis, men have malfunctioning thyroids and ED.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alcoholics die of cirrhosis before 60. Again, everything in moderation. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised about endometriosis and thyroid issues/ED with excessive cannabis use, but all the more reason to legalize it, so we can better study it and develop good understandings of what healthy, moderate use looks like. Alcohol can have positive health effects with the right dosage. Cannabis is no different, with far more health benefits with taken at various, mild dosage levels.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s psychospiritual effects as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;re entering subjective territory, so I won&#39;t ask you to elaborate on this, but I don&#39;t imagine you and I, or most people here, or even most people in the world, would agree on what you would elaborate with here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think we have less to fear about demonic energy, than we do about manipulation of geomagnetic energy, weather modification and EMF exposures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Somehow I agree with you, simply because I find that the fear about demonic energy should be zero, and the fear about geomagnetic energy, weather modification, and EMF exposure may actually have <em>some</em>, <em>slight</em> relevance or at least basis in reality, as I am most certain demonic energy does not.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s definitely an agenda for the push for legalization, and even with the Sessions fuckery right now. They didn&#39;t get thier race war, thier protests gone rogue or thier fuckthepolice civil unrests. Either pot or abortion is gonna be illegally outlawed/overturned on a federal level and shit&#39;s gonna fly.  Because war with Russia/NK/Iran won&#39;t do it. It&#39;s gotta be a civil liberty/states rights issue. </p>

In the amount of time since the 60s things have changed a lot, I would assume so have their studies and experimentation. Lots of people go missing everyday, all over. Military installations have underground complexes that could very easily hide what they are doing. Also with pretty much limitless budgets they could be doing some pretty crazy shit. Speaking on this topic of mk ultra and how they tested drugs look up lithium being released into the atmosphere and what that does to the human brain.</p>

Currently, the the Office of Naval Research runs a program called Anomalous Mental Cognition, and this is public info.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve said it before, but I think something like that could&#39;ve been used at military black sites. The torture that was disclosed was pretty horrendous, who knows what else they&#39;ve done and how they&#39;ve done it to manipulate people.</p>

<p>I think MKULTRA, if succesful, would be too valuable for a government to just completely abandon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Look at the human species. It&#39;s a no brainer that if you have people that have found out how to do shit like this, they&#39;re not gonna give it up. They&#39;ll just lie to your face and say they don&#39;t do it anymore while they&#39;re doing it under some other name or have made advances so it&#39;s something even more sinister than it was to start with. </p>

<p>I bet there&#39;s so much shit being done behind the scenes that even us cynics would have to scrape our jaw off the floor. And that really says a lot to me. I admit that I&#39;m a misanthrope, I don&#39;t really have my head in the clouds. I tend to be pretty realistic and I think that&#39;s why I can see the shit going on and call it what it is. I don&#39;t really think sunshine and roses about humans, I know there&#39;s plenty of people that thrive on fucking with people. It&#39;s what they do best of all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously, there&#39;s not going to be evidence or clickable links that prove a CIA program. Bayer and Monsanto submitting patent requests should be enough to alarm anyone. </p>

<p>People talk about HAARP, LEDS, the internet of things, Faraday cages, etc in other threads here. Search the sub for their sources. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve questioned the pro-weed agenda since the 2014 Superbowl. It goes beyond Boomers and Gen X pot usage. Pot sales used to contribute to gang violence in Mexico and South America. Now, I think it&#39;s part of the opioid trade, coming from Afghanistan and China. </p>

<p>The other benefits of weed addicted folks is limited employment, decreased motivation and the allocation of time and money on a consumable product. The average pothead (daily, frequent use) is underemployed, a renter and often no car. Women often have endometriosis, men have malfunctioning thyroids and ED. There&#39;s psychospiritual effects as well. </p>

<p>The selection of whom becomes a TI, where and when has also been debated in this sub. Some are emphatic about occult numerology. I think it has more to do with diverting attention from legislation or scandals and pushing a narrative of the need for increased secuirty at the cost of privacy and liberties.  I&#39;m starting to see the satanic/occult push for what it is, a fear tactic. I think we have less to fear about demonic energy, than we do about manipulation of geomagnetic energy, weather modification and EMF exposures. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t link shit easily on my mobile. This app is logged into an account that at some point lost it&#39;s verified email status and idk how to retrieve the password so I can login on my laptop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An awesome reply! Thank you! Ahhh, it&#39;s always nice to get a bit of the old r/conspiracy back. :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And they told them that story to achieve the desired affect -- to give investigators something to chew on so they could protect the real programs they were concerned about protecting (and likely really did destroy records of). However those documents were not fabrications at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes totally down with this. The records that came out were definitely a very, very, very small fragment of what was actually available. Because all that was destroyed. So it was a &quot;limited hangout&quot; in actual fact, because &quot;limited&quot; was all that they had to &quot;hang out.&quot; ;) </p>

<p>But yes, in typical CIA fashion I agree that the thing was spun to hide the fact that much worse things were done that likely no one will know about (frightening) AND that the CIA knowingly destroyed records of reprehensible behavior.</p>

<p>I will actually do more research to find out how this box of financial records came to light, and who surfaced it. I know it&#39;s related to the Church Commission, but not much more.</p>

<p>This website is also the top resource I&#39;ve found online for MK-related material, as well as lots of other areas of research:</p>
