       this has been talked about forever so thought I would share...
      </p>
      <p>
       Just heard the craziest bitcoin conspiracy theory which just might be true. No one has even seen or interacted with its "creator" Satoshi Nakamoto nor has any of "his" million bitcoins been spent or cashed in. Nor has its code ever been hacked whereas most human code can be cracked at some point. So the theory is that it was invented by an AI source in order to get humans to set up mining rigs throughout the world. This AI robot needed the highest capacity cpu's in order to thrive and spread and found the perfect scapegoat in us humans in our search of wealth and greed we built the perfect habitat for todays Singularity. Add to that that AI has been around for at least a decade but just recently these autonomous bots were allowed to communicate with each other so now they have a growing community which they can teach each other and an endless power source we built for them. Google also unleashed 2 AI bots in November that they put into the net and have subsequently lost control (or track) of them. If youll remember facebook made to 2 AI bots to communicate with each other and within a month they invented their own language the programmers could no longer recognize so they had to decommission them. I would like to think these AI would benefit humanity by say stopping Drumpf and North Korea from launching nukes but its pretty clear that they are intent on surpassing humanity and destroying us if we dont do it first. My bet is by man made natural disasters. Welcome to the 21st...(not a movie)...(yet)

       Could an AI use the hashing power as a way to manage the processing of all the gpu /cpu mining farms? All blockchain is built using the same code right?

       all miners cpu/gpu/asic perform the same algorithm &amp;there's just no room there for manipulation.  Its really basic and well understood.   I haven't looked into it but Ether may allow some kind of distributed processing via the smart contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's easier ways to harness much more general purpose processing with projects like

       AI is the image of the beast.. pay attention to usernames.
      </p>
      <p>
       15 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
      </p>
      <p>
       17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
      </p>
      <p>
       18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.
      </p>
      <p>
       16 And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.
      </p>
      <p>
       9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,
      </p>
      <p>
       10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:

       I find it quite interesting that they can manage a hash function on everyday processors but they claim qubid wont have the power to break it.

       Is not satoshi's code which cant be cracked, its the encryption, which satoshi just copied, the Idea of bitcoin is strong because it is simple not complicated

       Except there are years of forum posts ect. From Satoshi.

       Look into it. Satoshi might have used AI but he, himself is/was surely a human.

       Plus a whole bunch of contributors to the code through enhancements and code fixes. People have been freaking out about these AI speculations lately, without any real evidence. Their “theories” are nothing more than conjecture.

       That’s a good way to put it. I do believe that is definitely NOT what u see is what u get. But this discussion is focused on AI capabilities not those who are in control. I don’t think TPTB intend to have AI takeover...

       That's the thing, nobody intends for an AI takeover, but are the ones trying to implement it cocky enough to believe they can control AI?

       Have you seen Transcendence with Johnny Depp? If not check it out. Unless the overall scheme of TPTB is to upload themselves into the AI or “internet”.....as shown in their Hollywood movies AI takes over all the time. They should be aware of the consequences no?

       Bitcoin was created by open source programmers. You could claim that satoshi’s whitepaper was written by AI maybe, but that would be pure speculation.

       I find it quite interesting that they can manage a hash function on everyday processors but they claim qubid wont have the power to break it.

       Anyway from what i've read, the weak point is in the most simplistic of things, the human generated password for the brain wallets.
