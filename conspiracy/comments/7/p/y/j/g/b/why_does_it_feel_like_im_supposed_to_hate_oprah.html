        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>All she did was make a speech, and there was speculation that she would run for office. This has happened before, but what didn&#39;t happen was this forced meme where &quot;We hate Trump and he&#39;s an entertainer, and so is Oprah, therefore NO THE STANDARDS ARE TOO LOW RAISE THE BAR!&quot;</p>

<p>Oprah has been active in politics and a democrat surrogate since the 80s. She&#39;s a personal friend of the Clintons and the Obamas. Whatever you want to feel about that, it&#39;s not like she has no experience. It&#39;s not just the right wing fringes trashing her either, it&#39;s all over the &quot;liberal&quot; media and even leftist subreddits like <a href="/r/socialism">/r/socialism</a>.</p>

<p>I try to butt in and ask, what would you prefer? Another lawyer? At all levels of government, candidates from the energy industry get a pass, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, name an industry and nobody looks too carefully at their job performance. But the entertainment industry? WHOA WHOA WHOA STOP THE CLOCK!</p>

<p>Does anyone have any Alt sources that can explain this seemingly totally random mass hysteria about Oprah? Please and thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oprah is a Corporatist. The fact that she is in good with the biggest Corporatists in the DNC right now- the Clintons and Obamas, proves this. These neoliberal scum have driven this country into the fucking ground and don&#39;t deserve any more continued support. The Left needs to stay far, far away from Oprah. The only way to beat Trumps Right Wing Populism is with the Left Wing Populism espoused by Bernie. We need a <em>real</em> Progressive to run in 2020.</p>

<p>Oprah changes nothing- she would be the perfect puppet for the final looting of the country and death of the Republic. I will never support her, just like I wont support Kamala Harris, Deval Patrick, or any other Corporate Centrist hack. </p>

<p>The time of centrism is over. The time for radical change has come.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Elsewhere in this thread I explain how the organizations he has founded since conceding are actually making gains against the Corporatists and have taken 8 State Parties with the grassroots. He didn&#39;t sell out, his endorsement prevented him from being Nader&#39;d and the movement lives on despite the ire of the DNC- who recently purged his picks from the Ethics and Rules committee. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read things about her schools in Africa that are horrendous.  Coupled with the fact that she&#39;s just another ridiculously rich celebrity who we are just supposed to trust because she had a tv show, I&#39;m not buying into her at all.  We need to get a whole different cast of people into our government, and make it work for the people and not for the wealthy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oprah has made her living as a TV personality.  There is nothing wrong with that, but we&#39;ve all heard of her and that&#39;s her only qualification.  Like it or not that was also Trumps only qualification.    We live in world that is coming apart at the seems, and the only people who can save us are people we&#39;ve never heard of.  Political scientist, activists, fringe radicals, grass roots politicians.  The next great President <em>should</em> come from this unseen pool of people who care to make a difference.  But the Media.. The people who have the power to write our entire social political story.. The same people who keep Trump and Oprah&#39;s name on our lips are keeping the real heroes invisible. </p>

<p>If they run Oprah it&#39;s proof that neither party take the institution of executive government seriously.. If she wins, it&#39;s proof that neither do the citizens.  It&#39;s proof that power doesn&#39;t rest in the hands of our elected leaders or our voters, but instead in the hands of our televisions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She gained more traction. </p>

<p>And some of us thought that Trump shouldn&#39;t be elected because he is just a celebrity.</p>

<p>Those of us who want the DNC to change and not just elect another celebrity to maintain the status quo don&#39;t like the idea of a celebrity head of the DNC.</p>

<p>They tried to promote Cory Booker, we didn&#39;t bite. They moved on to Kamala Harris. Then Terry McCauliffe. They keep failing to gain traction with anyone. Oprah is now the current one. They need someone to stop the Bernie movement that may manifest itself in people like Tulsi next election.</p>

<p>So if we want the DNC to change, Oprah and the desire to just have a celebrity mask hide the corruption in the party must be opposed.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my take.</p>
