    <div class="md"><p>Trump had a chance to be the level headed, business oriented professional to bring people together.   Instead he&#39;s gone the loose cannon, divisive, inconsistent and addled old man route.   He creates the hate directed at him.   Before he ran I just thought he was a decent human being, but now he&#39;s just a petty little prick we gave the nuclear button to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is the exact same guy he’s been for the last 40 years.   He takes credit for things that go well (even if he had nothing to do with it), blames others for things that don’t go well, denies everything... everything is about winning and losing and people who lose should be humiliated.      It’s ridiculous to me that people either thought that a 70 year old man was going to suddenly change who he was once he was elected, or people were just completely oblivious to Trump, who’s been a megastar since the early 80s.  </p>

<p>Also,  I get sick of the old ‘he was a better choice than Hillary’, because that should have never been the choice.    It was originally Trump versus 16 Republican candidates who were all much better choices.    People just got swallowed up by Trumps cult of personality, vague promises, and catchy 3 word slogans (build the wall, lock her up, make America great, etc).... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would have voted for McCain until he pulled in Palin. Although I didn&#39;t like Hillary, I did not vote for Trump. Obama was attacked for a lot, including putting French mustard on a cheeseburger. However, if the attacks and criticism aren&#39;t close it&#39;s because of the behavior and words of each. Simply put Obama didn&#39;t give media reasons like Trump does. Are you refusing to see that or just that biased?</p>

Were you crying foul on here when this sub was (and sometimes still is) polluted with Hillary, Pizzagate spam?  Trump is likely involved in a large scandal of his own doing, not the MSM , not the alphabet agencies, just his own stupid ego.  He deserves all the shit thrown at him and more (if you knew much about his history of behaviour ).  Years down the road when this is all over and his family is penniless I&#39;m sure Hillary will eat Barron&#39;s first born.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just wow.. did I mention True Pundit or Zero hedge? No, I didn’t. <em>You</em> did.</p>

<p>And no, I was not “crying foul” on this sub when pizzagate was broke by private citizens investigating DNC emails and questionable Instagram posts from prominent people in the D.C.. </p>

<p>I implore you to google search the name “Michael Aquino” and do a little reading about him. I highly suggest you look into the Franklin Coverup. Another good source would be some Ted Gunderson YouTube videos. </p>

<p>Do that research and then come back and try to tell me that pizzagate is spam. If you do as I suggest, (you don’t have to if you don’t want to) you might discover that ritual satanic child abuse is not spam, and definitely not a laughing matter. </p>

<p>And the MSM, which is literally the propaganda mouthpiece of the “alphabet agencies” you are so quick to defend, went WAY out of their way to “debunk” pizzagate (which they failed to do by not asking the important questions). Any intelligent person would see their obviously feeble efforts as damage control. </p>

<p>It would be wildly entertaining if Hillary ate Barron’s first born, but would that not be just like the soap opera you’re so obsessed with currently? Sorry my friend, but I disagree with you on a fundamental level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate was never about ritualistic satanic  child abuse but instead a political smear job.  Where are the victims?  And what have you done for the victims of child abuse? Have you volunteered at shelters or mentored those who have suffered it&#39;s horrors? 
As for Ted Gunderson....I thought we shouldn&#39;t trust a member of those very alphabet agencies the MSM is the propaganda arm of?  </p>

<p>They cancelled the 4th and final debate before California that they promised to do. There were also far less debates than &#39;08 in a year that <em>needed</em> to have those debates. HRC knew she lost to Obama because of those debates. It definitely slanted the field.</p>

<p>Nothing I said is debunked, and your attempts at doing so are pathetic. HRC cheated Bernie out of the Primaries and went on to lose to Trump because of her hubris and ineptitude, and didn&#39;t campaign in essential Dem states like Wisconsin and Michigan. So again- nice try at changing history and defending the failed candidate that was HRC. </p>

<p>Ahhh. Unite the Party. Unite the Party by backing out of their promised debate. Bernie still wasn&#39;t mathematically eliminated.

<p>Haha. Keep on lying about that. HRC&#39;s plan was bad, written by Insurance lobbyists, and expanding Obamacare doesn&#39;t lead to Single Payer. Obamacare is about coverage, not care. Insurance needs to be gotten rid of and universal <em>care</em> must be the goal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel he was about as close to an answer as we were going to get. This was because he not only spoke of a movement of the People, but after he lost he helped set its continuance in motion with organizations like Our Revolution, working at the grassroots level to organize and take the Party from the Corporatists, and they&#39;ve taken 8 State Parties so far. They had 18/21 of their endorsed candidates win in the special elections in early 2017, and 21/23 of their endorsed candidates won in November. This was at all levels from city council, state house, and even a congressman. This is how we actually accomplish real change.</p>

<p>That said, if someone disagrees with his politics then they definitely don&#39;t think he was/is part of the answer, and I understand that opinion, though I disagree with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My argument to the whole Bernie thing is at the end he showed he was still willing to tote the part line and eventually gave Hilary his nod. It’s just a metaphor for the greater picture of “following g orders” and so on. So if pressed the argument could be made that he would eventually tote the party line and not really do anything different that what was planned. He got completely fucked by Hillary and after being pressured he still gave her his endorsement. If that doesn’t show you his true colors then I don’t know what does.</p>

<p>False reports on Trump/Russia:</p>

<p>1) CNN:</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/12/09/the-u-s-media-yesterday-suffered-its-most-humiliating-debacle-in-ages-now-refuses-all-transparency-over-what-happened/">CNN claimed the Trump campaign was given special access to Wikileaks documents before they were published based on an email they said was dated September 4, prior to the release of those documents. They updated the story to show that the email was actually dated September 14, after the documents were made public, which means some random person messaged the Trump Campaign about public information, which is a non-story</a>.

<p>2) From CNN</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606234238/http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/06/politics/comey-testimony-refute-trump-russian-investigation/index.html">Washington (CNN)</a> In his much-anticipated congressional testimony on Thursday, fired FBI Director James Comey will dispute President Donald Trump&#39;s blanket claim that he was told he was not under investigation multiple times, according to sources familiar with Comey&#39;s thinking.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/06/politics/comey-testimony-refute-trump-russian-investigation/index.html">CORRECTION AND UPDATE:</a> This article was published before Comey released his prepared opening statement. The article and headline have been corrected to reflect that Comey does not directly dispute that Trump was told multiple times he was not under investigation in his prepared testimony released after this story was published.</p>

<p>3) From CNN</p>

<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/26/media/cnn-announcement-retracted-article/index.html">&quot;In the aftermath of </a>  the retraction of a story published on CNN.com, CNN has accepted the resignations of the employees involved in the story&#39;s publication,&quot; a spokesman said Monday evening. The story, which reported that Congress was investigating a &quot;Russian investment fund with ties to Trump officials,&quot; cited a single anonymous source. </p>

<p>4) From Wash Post</p>

<p>Original title that they have changed, which you can verify by checking the url: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-hackers-penetrated-us-electricity-grid-through-a-utility-in-vermont/2016/12/30/8fc90cc4-ceec-11e6-b8a2-8c2a61b0436f_story.html?utm_term=.9ea5a949fb20">&quot;Russian hackers penetrated U.S. electricity grid through a utility in Vermont, officials say.”</a></p>

<p>6) Fortune Magazine: <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/01/12/cspan-rt-interruption/">Correction: This story originally ran under the headline “C-SPAN Confirms It Was Briefly Hacked by Russian News Site.” C-SPAN confirmed that an interruption took place but has not yet identified the cause of the interruption.</a></p>

<p>7) The Guardian: &quot;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/24/julian-assange-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-interview">This article was amended</a> on 29 December 2016 to remove a sentence in which it was asserted that Assange “has long had a close relationship with the Putin regime”. A sentence was also amended which paraphrased the interview, suggesting Assange said “there was no need for Wikileaks to undertake a whistleblowing role in Russia because of the open and competitive debate he claimed exists there”. It has been amended to more directly describe the question Assange was responding to when he spoke of Russia’s “many vibrant publications”.&quot;</p>

<p>8) New York Times:  <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/06/08/in-the-main-it-was-not-true-comey-denounces-new-york-times-story/">James Comey: a controversial New York Times story in February about alleged contacts between Trump intimates and Russian officials was bogus. “In the main, it was not true,” he said. “The challenge, and I’m not picking on reporters, about writing stories about classified information is the people talking about it often don’t really know what’s going on and those of us who actually know what’s going on are not talking about it,” said Comey during questioning from Sen. James Risch (R-Idaho). “And we don’t call the press and say, ‘Hey, you got that thing wrong.’ ”</a> </p>

<p>9) New York Times:  Notorious &quot;17 intelligence agencies agree&quot; claim <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/pageoneplus/corrections-june-29-2017.html?_r=0">retracted</a> by the New York Times.

<p>11) from ABC News:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>JUST IN: @BrianRoss on @ABC News Special Report: Michael Flynn promised &quot;full cooperation to the Mueller team&quot; and is prepared to testify that as a candidate, Donald Trump &quot;directed him to make contact with the Russians.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171201162158/https:/twitter.com/ABC/status/936628560374071296">https://web.archive.org/web/20171201162158/https:/twitter.com/ABC/status/936628560374071296</a></p>

<p>CLARIFICATION of ABC News Special Report: Flynn prepared to testify that <em>President-elect</em> Donald Trump (not candidate Trump as initially reported) directed him to make contact with the Russians <em>during the transition</em> -- initially as a way to work together to fight ISIS in Syria, confidant now says. <a href="https://twitter.com/ABC/status/936760299146956800">https://twitter.com/ABC/status/936760299146956800</a></p>

<p>The reason this &quot;news&quot; was so big was because it was basically evidence of collusion. After they corrected it, it&#39;s no longer evidence of collusion. It&#39;s just normal presidential business.</p>

<p>12) The Hill: </p>

<p>The Hill writes article and Tweets claim that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171003215924/http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/353685-trump-admin-denied-puerto-rico-request-to-let-hurricane-victims-use">&quot;Report: Trump admin denied Puerto Rico request to let victims use food stamps for fast food.&quot;</a></p>

<p>13) NPR claims Wikileaks posted Macron leaks and also claims some of the documents were fake so they could tarnish Wikileaks&#39; reputation, had to issue a correction stating that they don&#39;t know who leaked them.

TPTB want this, too - it keeps everyone divided up into their own little media enclosures, but I don&#39;t think they have to do anything special to promote it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s exactly what they’re doing because he’s probably going to run in 2020 and the other side wants his base to abandon him so it makes their candidate look more attractive, and it means less votes for Trump. </p>

<p>I think it’s not necessarily the message of “Trump bad”, “abandon all hope ye who Trump here”, but it’s more of “overwhelm them with Trump to the point where voting for him, and 4 more years of this, makes them feel sick”. Eventually people get tired, even if it’s fabricated bullshit, and want something different just to make it stop. It’s literally a form of torture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the MSM has put out shit, this is true.  but it&#39;s such transparent and illogical shit that i find it hard to believe it&#39;s what would normally occur with a candidate.  which is to say that it smells of a setup intended to paint him as a public hero against the evil forces of the swamp.  Trump is the swamp.  this wasn&#39;t apparent initially but it&#39;s pretty clear now.  good people don&#39;t threaten nuclear action.  they don&#39;t take the selfish road AS A POLICY.  Trump does.  that&#39;s all you need to know.  i&#39;d be wary of whatever setups are planned because they&#39;re likely planned to ratchet up a police state.  these people know their time is up and they will do anything to stop that.  the public cannot let fomented division define itself.  it must recognize the core values that made the country what it is, and align with those things instead of with artificial division whose narrative is written by a select few and only goes towards the ends they want.  we cannot and must not follow the script designed for us. that is the threat.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, they turned up the propaganda machines to full-power for Trump. Propaganda has always been incredibly potent, and you can see how many people fully buy into it. Plenty of people in this very sub are especially disposed to being propagandized, which is sort of paradoxically a big part of why they come here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>California. She won California. Trump won the majority of counties in the majority of states and won a Constitutional election. HRC thought that she would win that way...until oops...she didn&#39;t. HRC shouldn&#39;t have even let Trump get close. She lost Democratic strongholds that were part of her &quot;firewall&quot; like Wisconsin and Michigan, because she never campaigned there more than 4 times after the convention. She was a <em>terrible</em> candidate, and because of that she lost to Trump, lol. Her ineptitude and hubris destroyed her. </p>
