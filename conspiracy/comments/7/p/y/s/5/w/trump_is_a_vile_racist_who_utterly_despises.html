<p>Basically we find a shitty country (we being the US) and we go in there and say &quot;hey, your infrastructure sucks how about we send in one of our companies and set you up with a modern electrical grid&quot;</p>

<p>Once the country signs on (literally, they sign a contract) they&#39;re done.  The contract is written up in a way that we know said country will never be able to pay it back and the fine print lays the hammer down knowing this will happen.  We then basically act as loan sharks and extort the fuck out of the country.  Cheap resources for us, still a shitty country for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump didn&#39;t just call a country a shithole.  He said that we shouldn&#39;t take <em>the people</em> from those countries.  That black people from developing countries don&#39;t deserve to come to America like the good white people from places like Norway do. He believes that a person&#39;s race and origin determine whether they&#39;re worthy of the US. That&#39;s what&#39;s fucking racist, the same racist mindset Trump has openly shown us since day one.</p>

<p>The White Nationalist army is out in force today defending this indefensible racist bullshit.</p>

<p>(Btw, it&#39;s literally illegal to discriminate against immigrants on the basis of national origin. We admit people, not the country they come from. Racists don&#39;t see non-whites as individual people, they only see the race or group they assign them too. Fuck racists.)</p>

<p>Edit: Some more new stuff is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/amp/trump-s-history-breaking-decorum-remarks-race-ethnicity-n837181">coming out of the woodwork</a>, on top of everything we already know:</p>

<p>A career intelligence analyst who is an expert in hostage policy stood before President Donald Trump in the Oval Office last fall to brief him on the impending release of a family long held in Pakistan under uncertain circumstances.</p>

<p>It was her first time meeting the president, and when she was done briefing, he had a question for her.</p>

<p>&quot;Where are you from?&quot; the president asked, according to two officials with direct knowledge of the exchange.</p>

<p>New York, she replied.</p>

<p>Trump was unsatisfied and asked again, the officials said. Referring to the president&#39;s hometown, she offered that she, too, was from Manhattan. But that&#39;s not what the president was after.</p>

<p>He wanted to know where &quot;your people&quot; are from, according to the officials, who spoke under condition of anonymity due to the nature of the internal discussions.</p>

<p>After the analyst revealed that her parents are Korean, Trump turned to an adviser in the room and seemed to suggest her ethnicity should determine her career path, asking why the &quot;pretty Korean lady&quot; isn&#39;t negotiating with North Korea on his administration&#39;s behalf, the officials said.</p>

<hr/>

<p>At a March meeting with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Trump asked the elected officials if they knew just one member of his incoming cabinet — Ben Carson — according to two people in the room.</p>

<p>Carson, the only black member of Trump&#39;s Cabinet, had never served in Congress and spent his career as a surgeon. None of the lawmakers knew Carson, and Trump found that surprising, the attendees said.</p>

<p>During that same meeting, a member relayed to Trump that potential welfare cuts would harm her constituents, &quot;not all of whom are black.&quot; The president replied, &quot;Really? Then what are they?&quot;</p>

<p>The participants spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to share details about the private meetings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since trump has become president, he has done away with a lot of Obama initiatives. In that, he has lowered his head to the ground for Israel and shown he will not challenge anything they do, especially since Israel called Obama antisemetic. In that time, Israel has gotten more money, all of Jerusalem, and has had America pressure Iran like not seen since 2007. Now, Israel is denying black Jewish people their right to a pilgrimage to the holy land. They are also forcibly removing 70% of the black population in Israel bc as Netanyahu&#39;s regime said, &quot; it corrupts the purity of the religion and the country.&quot; Trumps racism is giving power to other racist regimes to act in ways never before seen. It is dishonorable for Israel to attack a group based on race as the Nazi attacked the Jew simply for his race. </p>

<p>I hope people wake up to trump, Netanyahu, and the Ukrainian/polish/ and European racial uprisings. </p>

<p>The foundation of democracy as described by America&#39;s founders is freedom of religion, but freedom of the government from religion. Israel and theses other racist states don&#39;t do that and can&#39;t be called modern democracies bc of that. I hope you guys stand up for the black jews and Africans who migrated to Israel for peace and to be close to their God while participating in democracy that doesn&#39;t favor one race or religion over another.</p>

<p>I am so disgusted to see the underlying issues of the holocaust be adopted by the people who survived it. It&#39;s 2018, we have no place for racism or religious suprimicism.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, because Nazi Germany declared war with every European nation, some African nations, and eventually Russia. Even counting all of that, the USA didn’t actually “declare war” on Germany until after Pearl Harbor, which was years after Hitler controlled most of Europe. To equate politics in the USA right now to anything that happened in the 1930s and 40s is actually retarded and shows that you know nothing about history. </p>

<p>I don’t care if you shit on Trump, or even the US. Hell post anything you want in this sub, but I’ll be god damned before I let you skew history to fit your shitty narrative. If you want to discuss Trump’s ideals compared to Hitler’s in order to equate the two, fine we can talk about it, but don’t bring in your stupid un-factual bullshit revisionist history into it.

    <div class="md"><p>You are just perpetuating the false narrative to protect Israel when they are literally doing v exactly what Nazi Germany did. Palestinians must have a special marker, like the yellow star, to move around Israel. They are often followed by idf, like the ss did to Jews in the early days. They keep being forced into a smaller and smaller ghetto like the Nazi did. They then don&#39;t get food or water or medicine or plumbing... Now Israel has started attacking black people to kick out duopoly bc of their race like the Nazi did to Jews. They say their chatcharacter is flawed. aLL black people. That&#39;s fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t give a shit about Israel, I was referring to policies of the USA. There’s no false narrative at all, it’s actual history and events that almost every person on the planet agrees happened. The United States of America did NOT invade Germany because of the atrocities committed by the Nazi’s, and for the most part didn’t even know those crimes were being committed (especially not on the level that was actually occurring). The US didn’t even play a large role in the invasion of Germany. If you’re going to honestly deny that as some kind of falsehood then you probably need some help. That part of history isn’t even a conspiracy, it’s just a series of actual events that occurred. </p>

<p>Secondly, if Israel is doing anything to their own citizens, then that’s their problem. It’s morally wrong, but if it’s their public policy then I have no reason to say otherwise. Now if it becomes an issue (like Nazi Germany) where US allies are attacked on a grand scale (such as the entirety of Europe) and then the USA is actually attacked, then yes we should step in a do something. Had both of these events happened, then I would agree with you, but what Israel does should not be an issues of the USA, and policy of the USA should remain the business of the USA and it’s citizens. What changes this is action by Israel towards the USA and its allies (which won’t happen because they are an ally of the USA). </p>

<p>Please stop with your BS revisionist history. The USA and Russia invaded Nazi Germany not because of the treatment in concentration camps, but because the Nazi’s has attacked allies of the USA, attacked Russia to the point of almost overtaking the country, and eventually the USA was attacked by an ally of the Nazi’s and likely with the Nazi’s consent. To say otherwise is just incorrect and a blatant lie. </p>
