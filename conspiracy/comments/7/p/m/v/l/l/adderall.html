    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s safe to take everyday as prescribed but probably not beneficial for years upon years of use. Also, I think it is a BAD idea to medicate very young children. Perhaps 14+ could benefit IF it would truly benefit the child/young adult. ADHD is real, but I think it may be over diagnosed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can agree with that. I was diagnosed with ADD, but definitely  have/had no hyperactivity problems.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Totally. The meds definitely turned me into a working machine, but then again I&#39;m the beginning before I started up a tolerance I read &quot;The Idiot&quot; by Dostoyevsky, often out on a bridge at a creek on my mom&#39;s old property. Totally devoured that shit. Was looking up words I didn&#39;t understand in the dictionary and copying them down to a notebook. It wasn&#39;t even for a class either lol.</p>

<p>And maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;ve always been a big music person. Not a lot of mainstream stuff, but I used to listen to music a lot when it was easy to download. Everything from classical to experimental electronica to Radiohead</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ADHD as it was described to me is more like a mild form of autism; my psychiatrist (who is noted in the field) told me that the &quot;H&quot; in ADHD refers to an obsessive component, &quot;hyperactive focus,&quot; rather than being a fucking spaz. So, in the colloquial sense, kids with ADD are the ones &quot;acting like kids,&quot; while the kid who won&#39;t stop drawing is more ADHD. I hope that makes sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I definitely agree. And also young children SHOULD NEVER be medicated with these psychotropic meds. SSRIs, amphetamines. It&#39;s all BS because the teachers don&#39;t want to deal with all the energy of the children, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s overwhelming but medicating them and fuxking up their developing brains is beyond unethical and downright dangerous </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Adderal is a mix of left and right handed forms of amphetamine.</p>

<p>So basically, if you&#39;re taking adderal, you&#39;re taking speed.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall</a></p>

<p>You could probably take it once or twice a week and you&#39;d be ok in terms of side effects. But there are plenty of stories about people getting dependent and running into problems after a few months of doing the daily.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think there&#39;s a conspiracy to it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it&#39;s hilarious that you could go to jail for dealing amphetamines... but when it&#39;s a pharmaceutical company selling the same shit through a network of physicians it&#39;s totally legal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read an article about this over at r/foodforthought a few months ago. The story was written by a female university student. She talked about widespread Adderal use among uni students for cram sessions. </p>

<p>She got into it for the same reasons, take a pill and study like crazy, get all kinds of stuff done etc. At first it was one or two a week. Then she progressed to using it every day. Then she had some kind of seizure/breakdown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something similar like that happened to me in college after I started taking the Adderall daily for months on end. This just gave me a whole new perspective.. I never thought it was the ADD meds. I ended up dropping out of school and falling into a deep depression and didn&#39;t leave my apartment except a few times to take out the trash. Ordered food delivered... The doctors thought I had a &quot;Bipolar episode&quot; but nothing like that has ever happened before or since. Some minor depression (caused by events in my life) and ongoing anxiety sure, but if you have a bipolar episode wouldn&#39;t that mean you&#39;re bipolar and wouldn&#39;t mean that this kind of thing would be happening more than just once in your life? </p>

<p>Wow totally rethinking a lot of stuff from my college years about 10 years ago... I only got the ADD diagnosis because I wanted the Adderall to help me study and to help me keep on point etc. although I do believe I have it, if it exists... anyway this is getting a little personal and props off-topic but damn</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to be prescribed Adderall almost 17 years ago.  I was diagnosed with ADD/ADHD.  Yeah, it helped me focus for the first 2 hrs when it kicked in, but after that I felt like shit for 6 hrs.  The first 2 hrs you feel like superman and can focus on any task, but when the drug starts to wear off it makes you feel like jumping off a cliff for the next 6+hrs.  Everything is super depressing during that time period.  Can&#39;t focus.  I also had social anxiety pretty bad, which adderall made worse.  Eventually I decided the benefits of taking the drug weren&#39;t good for me so I stopped after 6 awful months.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t imagine why they give this drug to little kids.  It&#39;s pretty much straight up pharmaceutical grade speed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Addie is great...if you have ADHD. It&#39;s also great if you don&#39;t...but for very different reasons. It has totally different effects on the brain of an ADHD afflicted person vs. someone who doesn&#39;t have it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen friends with ADHD who act...normal, when they take their adderall scrip. It&#39;s a lot of fun if you take it without ADHD, it will help you study, clean, focus, do pretty much anything you zone yourself into. But it will leave you wanting more. I have another friend who absolutely doesn&#39;t have ADHD but has an Addie scrip and he goes through an entire months worth in 8 days without sleeping, 85% of it nasally. It&#39;s...insane, and absolutely not healthy. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t recommend lying to a doctor for a scrip and I definitely don&#39;t recommend giving it to small children even if &quot;prescribed&quot;. I wouldn&#39;t let my kids take it, that&#39;s for damn sure. By my reckoning, it has about 10 years left on the market before it goes the way of Quaalude...but it has an incredibly long shelf life so even after it is discontinued there will be a black market for years to come. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with you. I have diagnosed ADD and take adderall and I can say that it has absolutely changed my life. That being said, it is also important to find the right dosage, at some point I was just on too much and literally felt sick to my stomach all the time. Additionally, I don&#39;t take my medication on days I really don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; it; if I&#39;m staying in all day watching Netflix or going on vacation I never take my adderall and this helps me to keep my tolerance lower long term. </p>

<p>As someone who truly suffers from ADD, I can honestly say adderall changed my life for the better. I am definitely someone who acts &quot;normal&quot; when I am on my medication and seems totally scattered when I am not. </p>

<p>Being in university, I have always kept my prescription kind of a secret because I never wanted people to bother me about purchasing it to study. I have had friends use it to study and ended up similar to the other comments I have seen here. Interestingly I had a friend take adderall unprescribed and he said it had no effect on him which I found interesting because I can literally feel the exact moment my adderall hits me after I take it. </p>

<p>I do think it has become an epidemic though and shows just how hard society pushes us to learn and perform. I feel sorry for some students who take it unprescribed because I feel they often feel overwhelmed by their courses and life in general. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really believe this. Lets say two people are competing for the same promotion, in the fields of business/research/journalism/child care/videography/lawn care/ anything.</p>

<p>Person 1 has diagnosed ADD and takes two 10mg pills throughout the day, everyday.
Person 2 has no diagnosed ADD and takes no pills.</p>

<p>If adderall is about correcting a deficiency, all else being equal, wouldn&#39;t you say these two people are now on the same level? They have a 50/50 shot at the promotion? But, any person who has experienced an hour on adderall would put all their money on person 1 getting the promotion. How can this be called corrective medicine if it gives the patient actual superhuman traits for the duration of the effects? (never getting bored, never getting tired, makes the most mundane unexciting drudgery feel great to slog through)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem is, stimulants like Coke and Addie are a very slippery slope. I would say Addie even more so because in some parts of the US it&#39;s insanely hard to get a hold of any coke worth actually doing, but Addie is far more prevalent and it&#39;s not hard at all to BS your way into a scrip. I&#39;ve got a friend who has an Addie scrio w/o ADD and he goes through the whole damn thing in 7-8 days every month, nasally, without sleeping <em>at all</em>.</p>

<p>That&#39;s an extreme case but anyone without an actual <em>need</em> for it, but plenty of access, will end up in the same situation eventually, because that&#39;s how this shit works. It&#39;s an amazing drug, pretty much a wonder drug in my book, but that&#39;s what makes it so scary, that coupled with its highly dependent nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First I&#39;ll talk about the social rationale, then the science...I wouldn&#39;t call the medication a conspiracy, but rather a symptom of the conspiracy within our education system.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a linear relationship between rise in standardized testing and Adderall prescriptions, simply because we are educating students by sitting them down and teaching them to memorize via lecture just to take an exam. 
There&#39;s a really good rsa lecture on YouTube about it and how our education system was designed to train workers for the industrial revolution. If you want to say that&#39;s a conspiracy, sure, endowments from people like the Rockefellers took over our education system planning and made it that way...but  Adderall is just a symptom of a horribly inappropriate education system.</p>

<p>More and more students have &quot;add&quot; now because outside of school they have things like the internet that allow them to self-educate and rapidly satisfy their own curiosity at a rate far faster than the learning that takes place in didactic school lectures. Also with the increasing penetration of digital entities into our economy, students are finding the material they learn in school to be increasingly irrelevant. Simply put, we are taught this curriculum by inertia, because no one knows what the overall job market is going to look like in 30-40 years....all of that just to say that students increasingly don&#39;t want to be sat down and lectured/tested uselessly, so we put them on meds to force them to learn this way.</p>

<p>While studies from Columbia show that the subjective experience of Adderall is identical to meth (which it definitely is per my friend that does meth), the &quot;methyl&quot; group added on in meth-amphetamine has very important biochemical properties that make it more potent and far more addictive than the amphetamines in in ADHD medication. (Namely more penetration through your blood brain barrier and more receptor attachment). That being said, Adderall, Vyvanse, etc are all still amphetamines and work in the same way as meth by increasing the release and blocking the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine in your brain. However, just to be fair, drug companies take steps to reduce the addictive/abuse potential of these medications. For example Vyvanse has a specific amino acid attached to the amphetamine which forces it to be first metabolized by the liver before it can work in your brain, this greatly reduces the abuse potential (because you can only take it by mouth) and less off target effects on your dopamenergic reward system so you don&#39;t get addicted.</p>

<p>All of these drugs carry certain risks: heart problems, global hypertension, futue erectile dysfunction, sleep interference, increased subjective feelings of persecution, paranoia etc that can manifest in different ways such as anger and aggression. </p>

<p>There is no doubt these meds, just like opiates are wildly over-prescribed, however there are certain people who actually do have pathological ADD/ADHD. They need them and see great benefit from them, and not just for add. For instance I have a friend who used to have tourettes syndrome (uncontrollable tics and outbursts), he takes it daily and claims it forever changed his life for the better. These meds, if started early, have also been shown to reduce rates of other psych problems later in life like depression and addiction in people who actually need them.</p>

<p>If you think you need this medication daily, you need to see a psychiatrist, not just a regular doctor. There is a fairly specific/robust test that many of them can run where in you see a series of black dots and white squares on a screen and are asked to repetitively push a button for specific patterns. It tests your response time over 30+ minutes (and also your attention span), and then compares it to the national average. This is a fairly reliable way to see if you actually have a problem or if you just need to work on being more mindful/focused through things like breathing exercises and daily meditation...If the doctor you see doesn&#39;t make you take that test, then I would be very dubious about the diagnosis he gives you, so be conscious of who you go see. Also most psychiatrists will tell you Vyvanse is far better than every other med in many ways so I recommend using that if you actually end up on meds. </p>

<p>Regardless, if you&#39;re considering add medication, I highly recommend trying a daily meditation routine first, start with just 5-10 minutes a day in the morning and before you go to bed. Just sit in a chair and close your eyes, imagine that your attention is a glowing ball bouncing around in your skull, try to get the ball to slowly come to rest in the very center of your skull, don&#39;t force it, just lightly focus it...if you lose focus and trail off, that&#39;s fine, just whenever you catch yourself going off on a tangent, stop and refocus on the exercise. You&#39;ll find that it gets easier within a matter of days-weeks and youll see more focus in your daily life. If that doesn&#39;t suit you because it&#39;s too hard to sit still, try manta chanting, some people find doing something active is easier than passive concentration.</p>

<p>Hope this helps</p>

    <div class="md"><p>. Although hallucinations are a common symptom of amphetamine psychosis, amphetamines are not considered hallucinogens, as they are not a primary effect of the drugs themselves. While hallucinations can occur when abusing stimulants, the nature of stimulant psychosis is not unlike delirium.</p>

<p>L. E. Hollister&#39;s[who?] criteria for establishing that a drug is hallucinogenic are as follows:[1]</p>

<p>in proportion to other effects, changes in thought, perception, and mood should predominate;</p>

<p>intellectual or memory impairment should be minimal;</p>

<p>stupor, narcosis, or excessive stimulation should not be an integral effect;</p>

<p>autonomic nervous system side effects should be minimal; and</p>

<p>addictive craving should be absent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Psychosis and psychedelic/hallucinogenic are totally separate things. Cocaine can give you powerful psychosis and hallucinations, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a hallucinogen. Any upper (like add meds) if taken enough to incite sleep deprivation can make you psychotic and also have hallucinations as a secondary effect. Those drugs however are largely restricted to the dopamenergic/adrenergic pathways.</p>

<p>Hallucinogen is a very specific term for a class of compounds whose primary effect is either visual or auditory hallucinations. And it has nothing to do with how they cross the blood brain barrier...it&#39;s actually related to a complex interplay between the serotonergic and dopamenergic pathways in your brain. In fact they discovered serotonin and it&#39;s link to depression all thanks to experiments on hallucinogens like LSD. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i wouldnt just take these comments as gospel.. every drug has bad effects, and everyone&#39;s brain chemistry is different, so you need to ask yourself, does the medication add more benefit to your life than the risks/side effects take away?</p>

<p>the truth is that people have been taking amphetamines since the 20&#39;s in america, and the prescription ones are far cleaner than ever, so dont just think in black and white ..if used properly they radically improve some ppls quality of life.</p>

<p>its just like pain meds---for someone with under six months of constant lower back pain, the risk of them getting addicted is way higher than the benefit of their marginal pain relief...thats why we no longer prescribe these people opiates. However for someone with breakthrough cancer pain, opiates can allow them to function and live a &quot;normal life&quot;. Everyone&#39;s situation is different, you have to make the decision for yourself. Take everything in context and think for yourself before you just jump to conclusions. </p>

Whether or not it&#39;s as effective as other standard treatments is very hard to say cause most people judge its effect by very subjective tests, so it&#39;s hard to make comparisons between the drugs.</p>

<p>So if you like it, and it works for you, then you should stick with it. It&#39;s a non stimulant (only dopamine reuptake is weekly inhibited) so it&#39;s probably better for cardiovascular system and far lower abuse potential. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I 100% recommend it! They are actually experimenting with them at Psychiatric hospitals in my area instead of drugs. Honestly, serenity as you say even in a float tank takes practice. My first time I only got there in the last 5-10 min of an hour session. It takes some getting used to just as far as where you are most comfortable in the tank. But when you eventually let go, all you are left with is your mind. Breathwork practice helps the experience. What&#39;s crazy is that even though you can&#39;t see, hear, or feel your body, your mind plays tricks on you and you can see things and hear things during the experience. I suppose it is a little like lucid dreaming but there are also times where you can fall asleep. I keep my eyes open to try and avoid that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The preferred Matrix Medication! </p>

<p>But really I take vyvanse (Lys-amphetamine) consistently and can attest that it is a very mechanical, unnatural feeling. Keeping yourself in flight-or-fight mode is not healthy, but makes for a good worker. Is basically legal speed, keeps us coming back to refill. (I take the smallest dose available, for music..... yeah i know excuses)</p>

<p>Honestly, the supply wouldn&#39;t be there if there was no demand. Maybe if more people went for long-term expansion and growth, rather than quick fixes and instant gratification, we wouldn&#39;t see 95% of the &quot;problems&quot; we create, both collectively and individually. </p>

<p>Working on this shendig myself :l</p>

<p>So yeah we can call a lot of things &quot;conspiracies&quot;, but what if they&#39;re really just unnatural symbiotic relationships, like between a drug dealer and an addict, or a &quot;ruling elite&quot; and &quot;ignorant civilians&quot;.... Or just a greedy humanity still indulging in it&#39;s inner animal urges/vices and intelligent manipulators cashing in on our own self sabotage... </p>

<p>But yeah from birth we are told to CONSUME CONSUME CONSUME so I understand why everyone is confused now, we are waking up in swathes to an unhealthy, unnatural way of life. </p>

<p>Maybe if we changed our own behavior and what we invest our time/money/energy into, we&#39;d see the world change. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was put on Vyvanse when there was a (orchestrated, IMO) shortage of Adderall at the end of 2013. I had been on Adderall for about 4 years at that point.  Vyvanse may have well just been a placebo, because it did nothing for me.  Even after getting bumped up to the highest dose, nothing.  So, after a trial of a few months, my dr. finally put me back on Adderall, at which point, the DEA had allocated a much larger production of in 2014. All that said, I take Adderall IR, but do take breaks several days per month.  After 8 nearly 8 years, I do have some focus issues after not taking it for a few days (after the residual is out of my system), but nothing serious or debilitating. It&#39;s a nice tool to have in the toolbox, if used properly and responsibly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would definitely go with Vyvanse. It&#39;s about 40% as strong per mg, but much easier come-up and less crack-y. Easier on your body. 
Drink plenty of water and supplement with good protein and nutrient-dense foods. Magnesium keeps your nervous system calm (ish) and helps prevent tolerance build up. </p>

<p>Take the smallest amount possible to gain the focused benefits (open a capsule and empty half on your tongue if you need to) but do not go over, do not chase the euphoria. I have been able to stay at 10-20mg for years. 3-5 days per week, and I still see negative long-term effects like motivation issues and neurotic/anxious interactions. </p>

<p>On it right now. Hence the paragraphs</p>

<p>Really just don&#39;t take it, haha. But hey you came to Earth for a full experience so do what calls out to you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Adderall will burn you out in 3-5 years if you use it and drink coffee and work hard.  There <em>are</em> limits to how much you can work.  Also Meth causes rapid brain damage (reduction of Dopamine and Serotonin receptors on neurons in the brain, or even death of the neurons from excessive dopamine transmission.)  Also Dopamine which is released from adderall - breaks down and can generate Hydrogen Peroxide.  I took a maximum of 40Mg Adderall over 3 years and was no longer able to funcction without it.  I got really sick for two years and was out of work (without adderall) and I&#39;m finally feeling half normal.  </p>

<p>But if you can keep it to a 2 day a week kind of thing at no more than 20 mg (I took 40 but I&#39;m 300 pounds), and avoid coffee, you can avoid my mistakes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take it every week day after being recently diagnosed with ADHD.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t take a massive dose, but good Lord is it a game changer. I used to be incapable of staying focused, getting work done, being organized, really just functioning like everyone else can.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not good for you in the slightest though. It&#39;s an amphetamine, and long term use is going to take it&#39;s toll at a certain point. I&#39;ve been really careful to not get excited about &quot;feeling it&quot; since I don&#39;t want to constantly chase a higher dose because of this, but I&#39;ll absolutely be feeling the effects when I&#39;m older.</p>

<p>The thing is that they&#39;re worth it. I&#39;ll choose a somewhat harder time in the future if it means I get to actually enjoy everything leading up to it. Your health doesn&#39;t matter if you can&#39;t hold a job, be attentive in a relationship, etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been looking a lot into microdosing LSD as a substitute since it has 0 toxicity to my body. Everything I&#39;ve read seems to suggest that it works better than adderal. It&#39;s cheaper, safer, and apparently feels a hell of a lot better.</p>

<p>I do think that doctor&#39;s are too quick to prescribe it, and I&#39;m sure that many who are diagnosed with ADHD don&#39;t actually fit the disorder, but for those of us that do actually have it these medications are a God send.</p>

<p>I really can&#39;t explain the changes I&#39;ve experienced in the last few months. They&#39;re amazing and have changed the course of where my life will go in 99% positive ways.</p>

I&#39;ve done this a few times because my diet eventually goes to shit in a negative feedback loop.      </p>

<p>Keto puts a higher emphasis on fats and fatty meats, and excludes fruits and starchy vegetables.</p>

<p>Regardless of diet, I usually supplement with a quality multivitamin, fish oil, and Magnesium (to keep things moving). </p>

<p>Many people have issues with certain foods.  Not allergies or serious complications...but issues.  Exclude wheat, corn, and dairy for two weeks and see if you feel better once the cravings are gone.    </p>

<p>I also lean toward organic produce to avoid the chemicals.</p>

<p>Not all GMO is necessarily bad.  If you modify a crop to handle longer droughts, I wouldn&#39;t expect any difference in nutritional quality.  If you modify a crop to survive a constant spray of herbicide (glyphosate, roundup), the plant itself might not have any difference in nutritional quality.  However, some of that poison will make its way to your table.  I don&#39;t expect them to start certifying and labeling &quot;POISON FREE&quot;, so I&#39;ll stick to the cleanest food I can find.  Hence, non-GMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes there is a conspiracy it’s not just adderall it’s all of the pharma drugs. They create the issues then sell the drugs to treat.. I understand some of the drugs truly help and save people but I can’t help but feel that they created a lot of the reasons. I used to be on it as a kid in high school.. it seemed to help but it only fixed me “temporarily” instead of focusing on the root cause. I since learned meditation (still a major noob) and it helps way better than adderall. It actually slows my thoughts down rather than Speeding my body to match my mind.. those drugs are legal meth. People don’t like hearing that especially if it helped them, but chances are those people never tried the other option.. learn to meditate, it takes time and isn’t an instant fix but it’s a great skill to know and can help with many many life problems. </p>

Helps with stress, anxiety, depression.. basically most anything that effects the mind. Meditation can help.. it’s all about taking charge of your own brain learning that your mind is so darn powerful!</p>

<p>Almost all ancient civilization did some form of meditation and somewhere along the way we forgot about it.. the west has atleast.. we wonder why depression and suicide is at an all time high, we need to stop looking to big pharma to fix issues.. I hate to sound preachy but I’m past that point.. your body is a temple and seems that the powers that be want your temple to be broken so you’re easier to control. Always look at alternative options!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The symptoms that Adderall treats can be treated with discipline. But pharmaceutical companies don&#39;t profit from discipline.</p>

<p>Things like cutting carbohydrates and eating more fat.  The spikes in blood sugar followed by the subsequent crashes aren&#39;t good for the brain, especially while having a sedative lifestyle.  Eating less candy, bread, soda, and more things like beef, chicken, eggs, fish, fish oil, etc. can often, and have been proven to do the trick.  But the patient is the only one that benefits.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s not talked about in the psychiatrists office normally.</p>

<p>Exercise.  There is not enough strenuous exercise to exert the amount of energy that is consumed from said carbs, so the energy just goes to thinking.  A person tends to overthink and become fat with that much volatile energy swimming through their veins.  There is far too much glucose in the system.  Exercise, like heavy lifting, running, sprints, depletes glucose and glycogen, but if a person is sedative, that energy goes to fat and negative mood.  they need to cut back on those sugar and carbs if they aren&#39;t moving around as much.</p>

<p>also meditation, relaxation techniques, good sleep, and less hyper stimulating psycho physical activities like porn/masturbation or video games.</p>

<p>Also things like dealing with past trauma through writing or talking can free up a lot of this energy as well.  We know that people do a lot less of that in today&#39;s society. </p>

<p>I think that because psychiatrists don&#39;t address anything that I described, like diet, habits, etc. before prescribing such a sketchy drug, makes it more along the lines of conspiracy.  Mainly because they are paid to prescribe drugs and not necessarily paid to heal the patient.  And the subsidies they receive and the lobbying that occurs, is never in the interests of the well being of the patient, but towards profit.  These drugs can often make people lose their ability to feel empathy too, they increase aggression. That&#39;s why some of the most brutal armies, and fervent criminals have been users of amphetamines.</p>

<p>ADHD can be a real thing in some cases, I think, but the majority of cases are circumstantial repercussions based on lifestyle, which of course has solid medical research.  If the sufferer would take time out to make simple changes, they can really change their body, self-esteem, and quality of life without drugs.  But that requires an acknowledgement of responsibility for one&#39;s health.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Adderall is literally amphetamine salt (speed), that&#39;s it.  Taking speed improves cognitive function in the short term, but is terrible for people in the long term and horrendous for development.</p>

<p>Throughout US history pharma companies have been looking for ways to legally sell speed, and have gone through various highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Depressed housewives</li>
<li>Diet pills</li>
<li>ADD/ADHD</li>
</ul>

<p>That we allow this to happen to children is disgusting, it&#39;s also ridiculous in a work setting.  We banned performance enhancing drugs from baseball to protect integrity, but health insurance plans cover speed for worker bees.</p>

<p>Personally, I enjoy it from time to time as a recreational drug (and benefit from it&#39;s wide, clean availability), but think that any &quot;medical&quot; applications do a lot more harm than good, on balance.</p>

<p>Broadly, there are a million &quot;think pieces&quot; on this from a variety of outlets - most folks seem to agree that getting people hooked on speed so they can study/work harder is bad for the world.</p>

Get the kiddos hooked on speed and then regulate the supply as it becomes an &quot;epidemic&quot;. Doctors over prescribed opiates in the early 2000s while the US military guarded poppy fields in Afghanistan and we now have a heroin problem. Once we socially get on board to fix the heroin problem, speed will be the next way to keep the jails filled and police chasing &quot;criminals&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I took adderall and ritalin for about 3 years in college. Being someone who really struggled in high school to pay attention and keep focus, it really did help me with my studies. However, I feel like it turned me into a different person entirely when I was on it. I became closed in and didn&#39;t talk much. Lost like 30 pounds because it suppressed your appetite like a mofo. I stopped taking it after a few years due to a sickness (no idea if related to the meds) but eventually what helped me more than the drugs was actually sensory deprivation float tanks. I had a VERY busy mind and I found the tanks reset my brain somehow and I was able to really be more linear in thought that bouncing all around if that makes sense. Highly, highly recommend them. </p>

<p>EDIT: just going to throw this out there. I believe my busy mind comes from the massive amounts of screen time I had as a kid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might be kinda unpopular but there definitely people that are helped with adderall.  It calms people with “add” and helps them focus on tasks at hand.</p>

<p>But there are more people that abuse it or just say oh my kid isn’t focusing when they don’t have it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its amphetamine salts, or minor amphetamines in a cocktail. its speed, although less powerful than methamphetamine it is essentially very similar in terms of effects, just not dosage.</p>

<p>snorted tons of the stuff as a young adult to stay up for days.</p>

<p>it does have detrimental aspects. for me, speed was always a cost-benefit analysis sort of thing -- it wasn&#39;t &#39;fun&#39;, but how much improvement in overtime hours (80 hr work week no sleep) or how much extra studying I could get done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was put on Vyvanse when there was a (orchestrated, IMO) shortage of Adderall at the end of 2013. I had been on Adderall for about 4 years at that point.  Vyvanse may have well just been a placebo, because it did nothing for me.  Even after getting bumped up to the highest dose, nothing.  So, after a trial of a few months, my dr. finally put me back on Adderall, at which point, the DEA had allocated a much larger production of in 2014. All that said, I take Adderall IR, but do take breaks several days per month.  After 8 nearly 8 years, I do have some focus issues after not taking it for a few days (after the residual is out of my system), but nothing serious or debilitating. It&#39;s a nice tool to have in the toolbox, if used properly and responsibly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would definitely go with Vyvanse. It&#39;s about 40% as strong per mg, but much easier come-up and less crack-y. Easier on your body. 
Drink plenty of water and supplement with good protein and nutrient-dense foods. Magnesium keeps your nervous system calm (ish) and helps prevent tolerance build up. </p>

<p>Take the smallest amount possible to gain the focused benefits (open a capsule and empty half on your tongue if you need to) but do not go over, do not chase the euphoria. I have been able to stay at 10-20mg for years. 3-5 days per week, and I still see negative long-term effects like motivation issues and neurotic/anxious interactions. </p>

<p>On it right now. Hence the paragraphs</p>

<p>Really just don&#39;t take it, haha. But hey you came to Earth for a full experience so do what calls out to you</p>
