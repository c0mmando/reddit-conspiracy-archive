       Yep, a 64 year old man had 7 cell phones...Pilots licence , 2 private planes..
      </p>
      <p>
       Was he a drug kingpin or decent weight dealer and realised the Feds were onto him so took this way out?

       That theory never made sense to me. If your deal goes sideways, you don't hang around and shoot a bunch of people through a window. That also draws a lot more scrutiny to what otherwise would have been a relatively tame story about a random guy found shot dead in a hotel room that would have been forgotten after 24 hours by the media and maybe not  even reported outside of Vegas. Also, the time and place were clearly selected to shoot people at the concert. If there was some kind of conspiracy, false-flag anti-gun psyop makes a lot more sense than "arms deal gone wrong". I'm not even convinced that there was some kind of conspiracy, but there are way too many loose ends and coincidences for my taste. I don't know, too much stuff was weird about that, such as the security guard, the police response, the problems with the timeline, and the changes in the official story.

       It's a set up. Paddock brings the guns for a deal but that was never the intention of the "buyers". They got a government agent to bring them the guns they needed.

       The 'botched assassination' theory is up there too. In that one the mass shooting was always part of the plan, cover for the targeted killing of one or more vips (MBS often claimed as the main one, tho no real evidence he was there).
      </p>
      <p>
       Only something went wrong, the targets fled and the assassins/patsies were scattered trying to chase them down. All that was left at the scene to tie into the isis attack story they'd prepared was paddock's body. Which makes no sense, and indeed still doesn't.

       The explaination I read was that Campos came up and interrupted the whole thing and gave the cops the heads up thus the killers were not able to make the clean exit out. so they made this last minute decision to start the shooting but the guns were not all loaded hence the time gap in the volleys. Like I said makes the most connections of any of the stories I have heard...ESPECIALLY THE LONE WOLF BULLSHIT!!

       So true but why not just try and get away? Or just take out Campos? Why attract so much attention by killing that many people?

       I cannot get into the heads of insane or at least sociopathic people but I assume that they thought that it would deflect their crimes and put LEO's in other places besides where they were perhaps. This also gives a reason for all the other shots that people said they heard fired all over casinos in Vegas that night... Human lives be damned we have a helicopter to catch!!

       I have yet to see any evidence that the shots heard in other locations were not echoes and weird sound propagation on the Strip. If there were multiple shooters, they were at Mandalay Bay.

       Always thought the same thing, like none of these theories ever explained WHY anyone shot out of the window. The narrative that exist just makes more sense. But, my theory is that Paddock was CIA working undercover as a point of contact to illegal gun buyers (ISIS, cartel, etc.. my guess is Saudi-related given the proximity.) Anyways somehow they figure out he's CIA, kill him and unleash terror, which may have been their plan all along. Given the way the investigation has gone it feels like CIA or FBI is involved somehow and LVMPD is covering for them.

       The deal thatbwent sideways was in Saudi arabia... That's why someone had Jesus  out the window to make it look like Stephen paddock (not the gun running cia Isis dealer) shot the crowd.

       Running guns and drugs for the cartels and the CIA, most likely. Maybe even a government informant who was running guns for the cartel and feeding info to the CIA and other government agencies. Campos drove straight to Mexico after being shot in the leg.....back to the cartel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just think about it. The cartel can have people in casinos and setup displays for possible weapons buyers in the luxury hotel suites at the casinos. Paddock transports the guns and possibly drugs throughout the country via his private air hangers. Paddock had houses all over the country—empty houses.

       I never understood the whole idea behind crisis actors. Why would they complicate the number of people in the conspiracy by making sure the victims are just actors. Dont they wont to cause death. Wouldn't having just one "actor" (the shooter) be far more effective with regard to compartmentalizing information on the false flag.

      <p>
       Yea, I got into it with one of these idiots yesterday and put together this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, consider that the powers that be would really love to reduce the overall population in the world, killing off 58 people really would seem like a drop in the bucket to them.  Why go through the trouble of faking so much evidence that would be needed for this to be a hoax?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The entire LV police department would have to be in on or at the very least, aware of the hoax.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       One of their officers was shot is what we are being told, so either:
      </p>
      <p>
       -A) The department created a LVMPD officer named Charleston "Chester" V. Hartfield out of thin air.  Faked records i.e. Birth Certificate, SS etc. The department would have to had years of foresight of the shooting as records of The officer go as far back as at least 2011 according to
       <a href="https://www.lvmpd.com/en-us/Documents/2011Annual%20Report.pdf">
        THIS
       </a>
       LVMPD Annual Report from 2011 which clearly illustrates on page 21.
      </p>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <p>
       -B) Mr. Hartfield was some sort of undercover spook/deep state operative with years of foresight and knowledge of the event that's going to happen late 2017.  Took a job at the LVMPD
       <em>
        MANY MANY
       </em>
       years in advance, so he could fake his death during the "shooting".
      </p>
      <p>
       -Many people would have to be involved in faking his death, including the person who "discovers" his body, the coroners office, or someone providing fake death records, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Actors would have to be paid/blackmailed into pretending to be his
       <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/the-strip/thousands-attend-service-for-las-vegas-officer-killed-in-strip-shooting/">
        wife and children
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       -So many years of dedication and preparation to the character of Chester Hartfeild, for such a small minor detail in the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note: It was also reported that a officer was shot on the police scanner audio:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        10:18:35 [3M male voice] “Control 3-Mary, I’m in route to UMC, code 3.  I’ve got a sho-, a gun-shot officer, P number 1-5-2-8-0.”
       </p>
       <h2>
       </h2>
       <p>
        10:22:39 [3M male voice] “Control. 3-Mary.  We’re at UMC Trauma. P number 1-5-2-8-0 is shot with a shoulder wound to the right shoulder.  He’s going into trauma now.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       These two direct quotes from the scanner audio can be found
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VrCY4XYDM0&amp;amp;t">
        here
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        it is unclear if P15280 is actually related to Mr. Hartfield, as I can not find it in relation to his name anywhere, nor can I find a place to look this up online.  If anyone can confirm this or point me to a place that can help figure out what the P number is and where to further pursue this avenue, it would be highly appreciated.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly,
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The entire police scanner audio would have to had been scripted or manipulated by people from inside the force to illustrate a specific narrative.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       A) The entire LVMPD force would have to had willingly/unwillingly relayed scripted scanner traffic to coincide with the desired narrative.
B)Paying at least a hundred voice actors to participate in the faking of the police scanner audio, a company entity or government agency contracted to oversee the project.  and the actual LVMPD scanner audio would have to be completely scrubbed, and every single police officer on that force would be aware of the phony audio.
      </p>
      <h2>
       <strong>
        People to fake the crime scene, carry weapons/body to room/breaking out windows
       </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Actors to play out the narrative
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       -Actors paid/blackmailed into pretending to be physicians/police officers to tend to the "bullet wounds" at the medical tents inside the venue that were reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       -video Footage at the front doors of UMC, of people wearing cowboy hats/boots carrying "gunshot victims"  would had to have been faked, or actors were to paid to go to UMC as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       ......and on and on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the powers that be had an end game to this shooting, regardless of what that may or may not be,  why would you go through soooooooooooo much trouble of hoaxing it, when just simply paying some guy to shoot a bunch of people, who are very expendable in your eyes, would be easier/way less costly/less likely of a leak to happen over the years of preparation necessary to hoax such a large scale event?

       They? Why would the government want to stage a bloody massacre in order to push the citizenry further against guns and gun ownership? Paddock was mostly likely the fall guy for a goal that had nothing to do with him—he was expendable.

       One major conspiracy is that the mass shooting was planned and maybe even executed by a US government agency in an attempt to tighten gun laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another conspiracy I heard was that this was to make body scanners/metal detectors a lot more common in the United States. This isn't too far-fetched in my opinion.

       There are probably dozens of others, but these are the two that I've heard.

       We have dozens of mass killings a year that get blamed on the government trying to tighten up gun laws, but gun laws never get tightened up. Why?

       This kind of stuff happened under Obama as well, except back then Obama planned it to further his anti-gun agenda. What is this doing for Trump?

       There was a few bills proposed in congress to limit magazine capacity, slide fire stocks, "assault rifles" and what not that thankfully didn't really take off. Massachusetts however Massachusetts did ban slide fire stocks. Our second amendment rights are being slowly eroded away by deceiving people into thinking by only letting the government have firearms makes everyone safer. Why don't we ask communism how only letting the government have weapons turned out. Yeah, over 100 million deaths in the twentieth country alone

       How exactly are our 2nd Amendment rights being taken away? If anything at all, our rights have been furthered by allowing more and more types of weapons available to the public. And not only guns but accessories for guns, like the bump stock Paddock used. Or, hell, even the shitload of Tannerite he had. Silencers were about to be up for a vote. magazine capacity, 50. cal rifles, etc... So....how in the world have any of these mass shooting eroded our 2nd amendment rights? I am a proud gun toting son of a gun and will never back down from it. My point is that I always hear people saying that these mass shootings are nothing but a conspiracy to take our rights but in reality, our rights have been expanded every year. I can still buy a gun without an ID in Tennessee

       You are thinking short term, the goal isn't kill people to pass a law. It's to systematically change opinions over a long period of time so that enough people are disgusted by gun ownership they willingly give them up. It only took cigarettes about 15 years for that to happen. You used to be as to smoke pretty much everywhere and now you can't even smoke in bars.

       I can't give you the exact conspiracy but I can outline for you why I think the public is being lied to about this. That in itself is disturbing and worth further discussion and investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       My questions boil down to one hinge point
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Given basic principles of investigation and ruling out suspects, how (with what evidence) did the FBI so quickly determine (before morning) that Stephen Paddock acted entirely alone?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       What we do know based on the story we have been given:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        There were other people actively moving about on floor 32 during the attack
       </li>
       <li>
        In contradiction to the original story, the cops did not show up until after the shooting ended, meaning until more evidence is released there were periods during all this unfolding where someone could have gone up or down the stairwell to escape without being seen by the cops who gave their personal accounts of entering the scene to CBS the week of the shooting
       </li>
       <li>
        No one actually witnessed Stephen Paddock shooting, and for some unknown reason he just stopped and shot himself mid-attack
       </li>
       <li>
        Not one, but two handgun shots are heard clearly on multiple videos shortly after the automatic fire ends.
       </li>
       <li>
        that 2 windows were broken, not one, and the amount of guns and ammo in the room is unbelievably large for use by one person. (please don't respond to me saying it's still possible for one person to get and transport all the guns and use 2 windows. I know, but the point here is that it at the very least suggests more than one person, which warrants further investigation)
       </li>
       <li>
        The same point can be made with the multiple cell phones
       </li>
       <li>
        Stephen Paddock was independently wealthy from gambling and real estate, owned empty houses throughout the country, had a pilot license, and has a work history with both the government and defense contractors- I'm sorry but on paper he looks like a spook or a criminal or both
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I could go on but any one of these points should be enough by itself to warrant an investigation into the possibility of conspirators. The resounding insistence that it was just one guy and DEFINITELY NOT TERRORISM from the get go is what has made me so distrustful of the story from the start. It was clear the Sheriff was being forced to lie and that more than anything they didn't want this event labeled terrorism. Couple this with it's total disappearance from the news in less than 2 weeks, and the fishiness is hard to ignore.
       <strong>
        For me, it started with their swift insistence it was only one person despite all the compelling avenues of questioning they clearly had not had time to pursue.
       </strong>
       Hello cover up.
      </p>
      <p>
       From there the questions explode
      </p>
      <p>
       Why still no footage of Paddock in the casino?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who did he order room service with?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the monetary value of those guns? Is it 100k?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did ISIS claim responsibility and again, how was it so quickly ruled out?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who was staying in The Four Seasons that night, and has that hotel been a part of the investigation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did Jesus Campos go straight to Mexico right after the shooting, and how did he even drive with a right leg that had just been shot?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is Marilou Danly? Is she being indefinitely held by the FBI?

       I said it in another comment on this thread, but a day or two after the event, a user made a comment saying Paddock's plane's tail number was designated as not in service on the FAA website, but third party sites that didn't update that information on a daily basis showed the tail number registered to Palantir.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't in any way confirm this allegation, but I remembered the comment so I brought it back up because it didn't receive much response at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I can confirm, is the suspicious nature of his addresses, his FAA registration address, and its subsequent proximity to an address that's connected to a suspicious email address attributed to Paddock. When doing a reverse search on that email address, it yielded the name of a woman who lives down the block from the address attached to his FAA registration.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry if the above paragraph sounds cryptic, but I was temporarily banned for doxxing as a result of discussing this in more explicit language shortly after the shooting. Given that information, you should be able to find what I'm talking about through a quick Google or duckduckgo search. A PDF of Paddock's background check from BeenVerified containing the first pieces of this information was posted to a hosting site. I confirmed the validity of the posted background check on the BeenVerified app.

       Ive been saying this. Paddock has no digital profile while maintaining lirs of devices. His device ID trail was long and chanfed frequently. Only people with SAP or higher clearances can't be tracked or have digital info stored for safety. If he was a private citizen, Google Microsoft Facebook experian visa comcast and other mega data brokers would have loads of info on the guy. Someone tried to buy his digital footprint and info but couldn't get it. He had an unusually clean digital footprint. Everytime you fly internationally, they take a biometrics scan of everyone and store it. Paddock didn't have one in the FBI CIA NSA database, which only high agents get tge privledge of (according to a NIS agent I see at my bar). Rememver tge ATF and FBI getting in a gun fight during Fast and Furious? They didn't know the othwr was an agent because of this special protection paddock fits that same profile. He was deff a gun runner or some sort of middle man between government and buyer. I believe it was an FBI fake ISIS buy and Paddock was ATF and the fake Isis botched it and then carried out the attack to blame Isis but had to blame paddock as it coukd of jeapordize spec ops somewhere.

       I know you haven't seen anything to convince you but I'm telling you right now, I have a friend that was there and heard shots fired in Paris, which is far from Mandalay Bay. Then someone from the Bellagio phoned a friend at Paris and said there was an active shooter there, too. My friend wouldn't just make this up. She's a 55 year old woman who just wants answers. She still posts about it on Facebook every few weeks, telling people not to give up the search for truth. I know that's still not proof for you, but I'm sharing with you why I am personally convinced there was more than one shooter.

       This is a bit different.

      <p>
       I've not seen anything to convince me there were multiple shooters at Mandalay Bay. I do however, think there is sufficient evidence to seriously consider the possibility that there were shooters near the Bellagio / Planet Hollywood and other locations.

       The next day, someone made a comment saying they found the tail number of his aircraft scrubbed from the FAA website, but on third party sites that hadn't updated yet, the tail number supposedly came back as being connected to Palantir.

      <p>
       I can't verify this claim, but I remember the comment.

       There are other strange connections I've found, and was temp banned for posting about it because it was super-doxxing.

       There are background checks of his posted elsewhere online. One of his email addresses stands out more than the others too.

       I'm not as concerned with super secret stuff that they do, I'm just always happy to see genpop have an awareness.  The godless gay immigrant who took down Gawker and helped to elect Trump has a side project that is, effectively, Minority Report.

       Maybe he was part of a Fast &amp; Furious style FBI gun running operation or a CIA gun running operation to actual terrorists. Maybe he was set up by either his handlers or the people he was supposed to sell the guns to. Maybe those people were Saudis linked to the guy who owned the top portion of Mandalay Bay, who was arrested soon after by the current leader of Saudi Arabia. If there is a cover up, the FBI and the hotel owners are the ones most capable of doing so. It's still all speculation at this point.

       What we can conclude is the entire official narrative from the mass media is a complete crock of shit and the public is being kept in the dark.

       He also tried to build a privacy wall around his house, but his neighbors complained and had him take it down.  He then tinted all of his house windows.  I've never seen tinted house windows, not even in some of the most shitty neighborhoods... It's a good idea, but never have seen it before.

        Soon, Paddock set about making alterations to his pumpkin-colored ranch. And his deep desire for privacy had the opposite effect: It drew the attention of neighbors.
        <strong>
         Paddock erected a solid mesh privacy screen that blocked his neighbors' view of his home. About 20 of them signed a petition, and the homeowner's association ordered him to take it down, neighbors said
        </strong>
        . The HOA refused to comment.
Neighbor Scott Smith said he couldn't understand why anyone would want to obscure a gorgeous view of the town below. "Why would you not have that lot for the view? Obviously, he wanted privacy."

       As for the Tinted windows, I can't find it, it was an interview with the realtor that sold him the property and told the story about the privacy wall, then after he was forced to take it down tinted his windows.  I'll to find that interview, BTW I think it was Jason Goodman who interviewed her (the realtor).

       I’m pretty late to this discussion. I’m a Vegas resident, and I just want answers. Here are some of the things I don’t see asked that really bug me:
      </p>
      <p>
       Re: Campos and changing time line and maintenance man... if Campos was truly working security, and according to the current edition of the timeline, he called in that there were shots fired at him, then paddock starts shooting at the concert, more than 6 minutes go by without a follow up call to find out wtf is going on or being done. I know if that was me I would have done one or both of two things... radioed back to find out what the hell was being done and/or get the hell out of there. But he stayed and listened to paddock Fire volleys at the. Concert.
      </p>
      <p>
       Re: adjoining door to the two rooms being locked... the logistics of what had to be done to have the conditions of the room the way it was found make me almost certain that he was not alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just those two things alone warrant a better explanation than what we have or what I think we are going to get.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of good points on this thread. All need to be addressed.

       We have dozens of mass killings a year that get blamed on the government trying to tighten up gun laws, but gun laws never get tightened up. Why?

       This kind of stuff happened under Obama as well, except back then Obama planned it to further his anti-gun agenda. What is this doing for Trump?

       Ive been saying this. Paddock has no digital profile while maintaining lirs of devices. His device ID trail was long and chanfed frequently. Only people with SAP or higher clearances can't be tracked or have digital info stored for safety. If he was a private citizen, Google Microsoft Facebook experian visa comcast and other mega data brokers would have loads of info on the guy. Someone tried to buy his digital footprint and info but couldn't get it. He had an unusually clean digital footprint. Everytime you fly internationally, they take a biometrics scan of everyone and store it. Paddock didn't have one in the FBI CIA NSA database, which only high agents get tge privledge of (according to a NIS agent I see at my bar). Rememver tge ATF and FBI getting in a gun fight during Fast and Furious? They didn't know the othwr was an agent because of this special protection paddock fits that same profile. He was deff a gun runner or some sort of middle man between government and buyer. I believe it was an FBI fake ISIS buy and Paddock was ATF and the fake Isis botched it and then carried out the attack to blame Isis but had to blame paddock as it coukd of jeapordize spec ops somewhere.

        Soon, Paddock set about making alterations to his pumpkin-colored ranch. And his deep desire for privacy had the opposite effect: It drew the attention of neighbors.
        <strong>
         Paddock erected a solid mesh privacy screen that blocked his neighbors' view of his home. About 20 of them signed a petition, and the homeowner's association ordered him to take it down, neighbors said
        </strong>
        . The HOA refused to comment.
Neighbor Scott Smith said he couldn't understand why anyone would want to obscure a gorgeous view of the town below. "Why would you not have that lot for the view? Obviously, he wanted privacy."

       As for the Tinted windows, I can't find it, it was an interview with the realtor that sold him the property and told the story about the privacy wall, then after he was forced to take it down tinted his windows.  I'll to find that interview, BTW I think it was Jason Goodman who interviewed her (the realtor).
