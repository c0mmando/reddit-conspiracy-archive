    <div class="md"><p>If I didn&#39;t read this caption, I totally would have assumed the second laser was the reflection off the moon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment#/media/File:Goddard_Spaceflight_Center_Laser_Ranging_Facility.jpg">in this photo</a> and stopped reading.</p>

<p>But interesting experiment. It seems the laser has a diameter of 4 miles on the surface, thats amazing. &quot;Out of 10<sup>17</sup> photons aimed at the reflector, only one is received back on Earth every few seconds.&quot; Do we know there is nothing else reflecting photons? I mean, the laser beam is technically in the shape of a cone and then it bounces off the mirror back onto earth directly at the equipment, while the earth spins and the moon rotates. 
How do we know that single photon received back isn&#39;t reflected by anything else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Newtons laws make sense to me. </p>

<p>Mostly, I don&#39;t get how if there&#39;s constant negative pressure, the thrust, which is expelling at a continuous rate, can propel against its own exhaust.
As it seems like it would be pulled away by negative pressure at at least the same rate as it was expelled.  </p>

<p>And if the two of us pushed off against one another, wouldn’t we then go in the same direction?</p>

<p>To be clear, your body wouldn’t float backward at the same rate if you threw a baseball, due to the difference in mass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, if we pushed eachother we&#39;d go in opposite directions. </p>

<p>The kinestetics are different. 
Forward momentum of throwing a ball wouldn&#39;t drag you with the ball at the same rate due to difference in mass obviously, but it would pull you forward right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m pretty sure it would rotate you, probably forward more than back from rotating your arm down.</p>

<p>You could do a rough test by trying to throw something while floating underwater, but it would no doubt need to be heavier than a baseball.</p>

<p>When you’re standing on the ground, you are able to use that as leverage to swing your arm forward, like a hinge clamping. You could still use your mass to some extent, but some force would have to act upon your body.</p>

<p>Either way we digress, because the point is that you can throw a baseball in space, just like you could shoot one out of a cannon both on earth and in space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thrust works in spite of atmospheric friction. </p>

<p>Again, think of a firearm. If you shoot it in a normal environment, you will experience some recoil, maybe dislocate your shoulder if the round is big enough. If you (could) shoot it underwater, you can imagine that the recoil wouldn&#39;t be as bad, because the water is cushioning you. In space, there is essentially no friction, so the recoil would literally propel you in a straight line, like the bullet you fired. That&#39;s the idea that led to thrusters, more or less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotcha. Always thought propulsion worked due to it expelling against atmospheric pressure. </p>

<p>like how in water, smaller movements with proper dynamics can propel you much farther due to the greater density of the surrounding fluid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most types of propulsion do, like swimming, which is a less refined form of what a propeller would do (so much so that propellers/animal wings can &quot;swim&quot; in air, which is just another fluid).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah man, this weirdo scientist is saying all the tech we had for the moon landings has been decommissioned or otherwise retired because it’s old as fuck.</p>

<p>Getting to the moon again is a <em>whole different deal</em> than making it to the ISS, for instance. The ISS is a drop in the bucket, distance-wise from Earth, than the moon is from Earth. We’re nowhere near the level where we can just have a one-size-fits-all solution for any kind of space travel. Every single mission has to be specifically designed for what the mission intends to do.</p>

<p>The whole national media thing is totally up to how you feel/think about the NWO, Illuminati, or the lack thereof. Does one entity control it all, or not? Who are they? You will not find a consensus here or anywhere else.</p>

<p>Not really. That was just supplementary. My main point remains the Russian incentive to call out any fuckery with the moon landing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sputnik was in October 1957. JFK says &quot;we will go to the moon&quot; in 1962. Apollo allegedly lands on the moon in 1969. Then in 2017 Don Pettit says we no longer have the technology to go to the moon &amp; getting back to that point is a painful process. </p>

<p>Just to be clear, it took 7-12 years to develop the technology to go to the moon the first time but in 48 years it was too painful to get back to that level of technology?</p>

<p>You&#39;re all welcome to correct me if I&#39;m wrong but it seems like it should take far less than 7-12 years to redevelop technology from the 1960&#39;s now, then it did then, since it&#39;s no longer cutting edge technology and we have far surpassed that level. Right?</p>

The New York Times added that the Soviets had been doing the same thing since at least 1963.</p>

<p>Quote from Wagging the Moon doggie. Silly name, very well put together evidence. Sorry OP just more compelling evidence in support of the lie theory -

    <div class="md"><p>“NASA gives the distance from the center of Earth to the center of the Moon as 239,000 miles. Since the Earth has a radius of about 4,000 miles and the Moon’s radius is roughly 1,000 miles, that leaves a surface-to-surface distance of 234,000 miles. The total distance traveled during the alleged missions, including Earth and Moon orbits, ranged from 622,268 miles for Apollo 13 to 1,484,934 miles for Apollo 17. All on a single tank of gas.)</p>

<p>To briefly recap then, in the twenty-first century, utilizing the most cutting-edge modern technology, the best manned spaceship the U.S. can build will only reach an altitude of 200 miles. But in the 1960s, we built a half-dozen of them that flew almost 1,200 times further into space. And then flew back. And they were able to do that despite the fact that the Saturn V rockets that powered the Apollo flights weighed in at a paltry 3,000 tons, about .004% of the size that the principal designer of those very same Saturn rockets had previously said would be required to actually get to the Moon and back (primarily due to the unfathomably large load of fuel that would be required).</p>

<p>To put that into more Earthly terms, U.S. astronauts today travel no further into space than the distance between the San Fernando Valley and Fresno. The Apollo astronauts, on the other hand, traveled a distance equivalent to circumnavigating the planet around the equator nine-and-a-half times! And they did it with roughly the same amount of fuel that it now takes to make that 200 mile journey...”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what about the mission video tapes? The blue prints? Mission data? All the hard evidence? Missing by NASAs own admission</p>

<p>“As it turns out, however, NASA doesn’t actually have all of that Moonwalking footage anymore. Truth be told, they don’t have any of it. According to the agency, all the tapes were lost back in the late 1970s. All 700 cartons of them. As Reuters reported on August 15, 2006, “The U.S. government has misplaced the original recording of the first moon landing, including astronaut Neil Armstrong’s famous ‘one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind’ … Armstrong’s famous moonwalk, seen by millions of viewers on July 20, 1969, is among transmissions that NASA has failed to turn up in a year of searching, spokesman Grey Hautaluoma said. ‘We haven’t seen them for quite a while. We’ve been looking for over a year, and they haven’t turned up,’ Hautaluoma said … In all, some 700 boxes of transmissions from the Apollo lunar missions are missing.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, it isn’t just the video footage that is missing. Also allegedly beamed back from the Moon was voice data, biomedical monitoring data, and telemetry data to monitor the location and mechanical functioning of the spaceship. All of that data, the entire alleged record of the Moon landings, was on the 13,000+ reels that are said to be ‘missing.’ Also missing, according to NASA and its various subcontractors, are the original plans/blueprints for the lunar modules. And for the lunar rovers. And for the entire multi-sectioned Saturn V rockets.”

    <div class="md"><p>Most types of propulsion do, like swimming, which is a less refined form of what a propeller would do (so much so that propellers/animal wings can &quot;swim&quot; in air, which is just another fluid).</p>

<p>Thrusters are perhaps intuitive because they are not something humans can do themselves... unless perhaps if you eat a lot of broccoli </p>
