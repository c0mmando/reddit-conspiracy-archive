        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey,</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad my Antarctica post went down well, I had been waiting to share it!</p>

<p>Ever facing the downstream torrent of &quot; the sun has always been white.&quot; &quot;Your eyes are older therefore it affects the way you look at the sun,&quot;....</p>

<p>I am boldly stepping into r/conspiracy with what I consider our current, daily observable greatest conspiracy of all. </p>

<p>I made a post a few months back here - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/7btu8c/as_above_so_below_our_detachment_from_the_sky/">https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/7btu8c/as_above_so_below_our_detachment_from_the_sky/</a></p>

<p>With observations, and many interesting responses. Theres also discussion in r/retconned about this phenomena. There is no official discussion on this subject and open discourse normally ends in the discussion being slid and the posters sanity questioned. I&#39;ve never been more convinced of something in my short life.</p>

<p>A short summary, hoping for some discussion -</p>

<p>The sun is a blinding LED-like white light now, forcing you to avert your eyes after maybe 2 seconds of looking directly at it. It USED to be a warm, incandescent yellow which you could look at for maybe 15-20 seconds and see the outline quite clearly. The sky is obliterated with obliterated with chemtrails and a new, alien pallete which is not natural. Everyone is so absorbed with looking down at their phones or their own two feet there is somehow not been some mass protest or awakening to these observable and comparable facts. </p>

<p>What is the thick orange band on the horizon? It is getting worse. Why is the &quot;afterglow,&quot; when the sun goes down lasting well over what one would consider a normal time frame..</p>

<p>So many questions and nobody to give the answers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you aware that you have a pineal gland inside your #verylargebrain?  Unfortunately for the rest of us.. yours continues to provide a combination of melatonin, and seratonin to modulate your circadian, and seasonal sleep patterns. It is essential to your life.. and you likely know nothing about it. I suggest reading about the &quot;the third eye,&quot; before you go any further in your &quot;basic science,&quot; from primary school. It would be beneficial for you to open your eye and accept that our understanding of &quot;reality/science&quot; isn&#39;t quite up to scratch from our Tavistock-related books. I stand by my judgement of the sun being changed, because I feel it to be so from personal observation and a steady wave of many people noticing the extreme weather, weird skies and strange moon patterns.. wake up!</p>

<p>Not that I necessarily disagree with your original post here, but cmon man he’s talking about the science around the sun and it’s appearance, not the pineal gland or the third eye.</p>

<p>Have you researched the mainstream science around the sun? Do you have any experiments that disagree with the official theory? Do you have a competing theory that is better able to predict the sun’s behavior?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The beauty of grade school science is that most of it requires nothing but willpower and elbow grease to test yourself. Maybe a handful of non-specialized implements you can usually find around your house.</p>

<p>Everything that you have mentioned in the original post and in any of your comments are all heavily researched areas of science.</p>

<p>Being that you don&#39;t seem to understand exactly what science is, I&#39;ll let you in on a little secret. It is the consensus and result of experiments and tests that <em>can be reproduced</em> and observed by other parties to allow something called peer review to happen.</p>

<p>Peer review is when someone who doesn&#39;t know you or care about you halfway around the country or planet decides that your ideas are fucking dumb, and works to disprove them.</p>

<p>Stop looking for meaning or problems where there aren&#39;t any. Educate yourself and become a real person instead of running from your self loathing and lack of purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it has to do with the weakening of the magnetic field. There were a whole ton of reports about this in 2014-2015, now you can hardly find any new info. A weakening magnetic field means more solar and cosmic radiation gets through. Could be why they do &quot;chemicals.&quot; They&#39;re composed of barium and aluminum, barium absorbs radiation, aluminum reflects it. </p>

<p>&quot;Earth&#39;s magnetic field, which protects the planet from huge blasts of deadly solar radiation, has been weakening over the past six months, according to data collected by a European Space Agency (ESA) satellite array called Swarm.
The biggest weak spots in the magnetic field — which extends 370,000 miles (600,000 kilometers) above the planet&#39;s surface — have sprung up over the Western Hemisphere, while the field has strengthened over areas like the southern Indian Ocean, according to the magnetometers onboard the Swarm satellites — three separate satellites floating in tandem.
The scientists who conducted the study are still unsure why the magnetic field is weakening, but one likely reason is that Earth&#39;s magnetic poles are getting ready to flip, said Rune Floberghagen, the ESA&#39;s Swarm mission manager. In fact, the data suggest magnetic north is moving toward Siberia.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Atmospheric changes influence how you see it though.</p>

<p>&quot;Refraction not only affects visible light rays but all electromagnetic radiation, although in varying degrees. For example, in the visible spectrum, blue is more affected than red. This may cause astronomical objects to appear dispersed into a spectrum in high-resolution images.</p>

<p>Atmospheric refraction is the deviation of light or other electromagnetic wave from a straight line as it passes through the atmosphere due to the variation in air density as a function of height.

<p>What I said in the post stands up and does not contradict itself, you are tongue-twisting me into a response that makes it look like ive got no leg to stand on. You said &quot;if&quot; there are chemtrails how could one make a judgement on the suns colour. Fortunately, they are not covering the sun 100% of the time. They DEFINITELY didnt when the sun was its old yellow self. If you catch a gap in the clouds wherever you live (if you are alive) i implore you try and look for what I have mentioned in my post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm, I dunno. I will say that they&#39;ve become more regular and widespread since the early- to mid-&#39;00&#39;s, say ~ &#39;02 to &#39;06.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if you are aware of how light works,  but when the sun is highest in the sky,  it is at its closest point to your eyes.  As it gets lower,  and closer to the horizon,  the sun is actually distancing itself from your eye.  The white light of the sun is made of waves of every color light including waves of light that our eyes cannot see (infra). The color red has a longer wave length than the other colors,  so as something gets further away,  it will appear to become more red.  Same thing when the sun goes down.  The sun is whitest at its closest,  and redest at it furthest.  I hope this helps.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol yes, well put. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are seasonal changes. Recently we had dust from the Sahara picked up by winds and blown north.</p>

<p>Where I was in England, the sky was noticeably different, a strange orange glow. It was amazing! So I&#39;m sure things like dust and other factors in the atmosphere can change the appearance of the sun but in general these are seasonal or otherwise temporary effects and there still is a &quot;standard background&quot; appearance.</p>

<p>But this isn&#39;t the conversation op was looking for, apparently. </p>

<p><a href="http://spaceweather.com/">http://spaceweather.com/</a></p>

<p>The only thing happening is that we are at a solar minimum, which is a well known thing guy, secondly, wut. </p>

<p>&quot;So many questions and nobody to give the answers&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s currently the solar minimum. Secondly, with global climate change, when ice melts, it pushes cold air down or around, so we are likely to get more intense winters that will likely last shorter. (hey, I just had that here in Canada, fucking -21C like 5 days ago, its currently like 11C)</p>

<p>This post is actually fucking hilarious, please keep it up, it&#39;s like the dihydrogen monoxide of solar cycles. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t wait for the next solar maximum, when some random posts: &quot;The Sun is overheating!&quot; or some shit, it will be great. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny, in the summer of 2016 i kept looking at the sky, and all around me thinking &quot;damn why is everything so damn white and bright&quot;.
I really could not shake this feeling. So I would have to agree that I find the sun has changed from warm bright, to extremely cold white light. 
The sky itself looks more like a pastell painting than it has before. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to any conclusions from this, only agreeing that the sky and sun seem different. I&#39;m 30+ and noticed this change the summer of 2016. 2015 as I recall, i didn&#39;t think it was off at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your honest reply, already you can see that there haven&#39;t been many in this thread. I too noticed the changes in the summer of 2016, the sky has definitely changed and seeing the amount of noise in here already confirms my suspicions. This topic can never be discussed, but there are always comments such as yours that squeak through and confirm what I am saying. I don&#39;t claim to know anything at all other than I have observed and decided within myself that it is noticeably different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. And Im glad you feel a bit reassured over me agreeing with you. I wonder what is going on with the sun and sky. Hopefully its something that can be explained rationally. But in spring/summer of 2016, immediately as I stepped outside I kept looking around at the concrete, at the cars, at the buildings, at the sky - and thought &quot;this did NOT used to be this fucking bright, and WHITE&quot;. </p>

<p>So yeah its wierd man.</p>

<p>Which comment? Be more specific.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if it did say debunked, who cares.</p>

<p>Why do you find it&#39;s saying debunked significant? Nobody here other than you is arguing that its saying debunked is singificant.</p>

<p>If you want to be taken seriously in a debate, you should care about not using logical fallacies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some tangent about how the word debunked is overused and asinine.</p>

<p>Attack his points, not the manner in which he wrote his rhetoric. The language he used does not have a bearing on the debate, but his points do. This is in fact a special form of the ad hominem fallacy, in which you instead of addressing your opponents arguments you comment on his tone and word choice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The amount of things that are &quot;debunked,&quot; but have massive amount of evidence from various means normally stand behind that eight letter word.</p>

<p>Not an argument. His saying debunked has no bearing on this argument. Other things some people have called debunked being true does not mean that your argument is true because someone called it debunked, m8.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this is what I’ve noticed, as the sun rises there’s always some kind of cloud cover, be it natural or artificial. Not so much during late morning and early afternoon. But there are days where it does look like there’s deliberate “spraying” to obscure our view of the sun and it always seems to be in the path of where the sun will be. Just like the sun setting, there is almost always cloud cover, again natural or artificial.</p>

<p>Try watching the sun set or rise. Take note on how many days that you didn’t see the sun obscured by “clouds.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the obfuscating of the horizon during sunrise and sunset. Seeing that is what got me interested, which led me to more hours than I&#39;d care to admit staring at clouds. Thing is, the more you start looking the weirder things get.</p>

<p>It&#39;s difficult to put into words trying to describe it all but once you do see, you can start to understand where man&#39;s mythologies and religions stem from.</p>

<p>Imagine I come to your house and throw some horseshit on your doorstep and tell you it&#39;s really important and too listen to me, because I say so. With no scientific observation, no evidence, just &quot;my observations&quot;.</p>

<p>MAYBE, you could have cited how the ozone layer could affect this, or the time of day, or locality, or anything scientific. But you didn&#39;t.

As far as the sun is concerned, I do not notice any difference in the color or luminescence.  However, and many people will probably agree with me on this, I in no doubt, over the past 8 years, have noticed that the intensity of the sun has increased.  Not necessarily in brightness, but the heat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The change in the Sun’s appearance could be due to it approaching the solar grand minimum cycle? Maybe the negligible x-ray output has an affect on its color? Also, because of minimal solar activity, more cosmic rays are able to bombard our atmosphere and maybe act as a filter? The magnetosphere is also deteriorating, perhaps that is playing a part. These are indeed facts, but I’m just speculating that they have something to do with the sun’s color. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I accidentally posted on your other thread, but YES I do remember the sun having a more yellow glow, now it is more harsh and white. Definitely like a warm, analog, incandescent light compared to stark, cold, bright LED digital light.  Miss my yellow sun. 🌞 Now it only looks yellow for a short time before the sunset.  All day long it is WHITE and bigger-seeming than it used to be.  Is it getting older and expanding and turning whiter due to age?  Maybe scientists were wrong about the point in our sun&#39;s life cycle that we happen to live in.  Is it something else the secretive military powers are doing to the atmosphere?  Is it due to another celestial body affecting our sun or us?  I certainly have no idea and just miss the yellow rays of sunshine that don&#39;t seem to exist anymore.  I don&#39;t remember noticing when it changed.  Cheers to you for having the guts to post about this!  These kind of subjects really get under the skin of certain types of people.  *EDIT: removed an unnecessarily snarky comment :D</p>
