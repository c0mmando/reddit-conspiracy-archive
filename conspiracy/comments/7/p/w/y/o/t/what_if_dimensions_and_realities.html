Starting out as a way to predict and prevent criminal behaviour, it evolved into a way to test what policies and ideals could be successfully pushed on the masses, and in what proportions. As a result, deja vu and the Mandela effect and other similar feelings/experiences are nothing more than our consciousness sensing something that happened to another sliver of,  or digitally produced recreation of our consciousness...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched that fantastic Black Mirror episode last night. It is pretty close to the truth. We are absolutely trapped inside a Simulated Universe. The difference being that the completely controlling Evil Captain Kirk Character is actually a group of Predatory Aliens in our situation. The Simulation is closed off from Eternal Source Energy. This is why all the inhabitants of this Matrix Simulation are predatory. Humans are FORCED TO REINCARNATE through massive deception. By doing this the Archon Aliens are never fully exposed and the enslavement continues on and on...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ideas aren&#39;t mutually exclusive.  The option exists that we are in an AI controlled matrix AND the real universe contains many dimensions, timelines, etc.  What happens within this matrix doesn&#39;t necessarily have to have an effect on what happens outside of it.</p>

<p>What if the system you so elaborately described is being built in several different forms for different purposes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s all fine and good, but it doesn&#39;t hold true. The notion of replicating the contents of consciousness (or its computational capacity) does not explain subjective experience.</p>

<p>You can imagine replicating infinitely complex sets of information but it does not follow that by doing that subjective experience would arise.</p>

<p>You and I are not real to begin with. There is no such thing as solid matter. Everything is insubstantial and transient in nature. Yet, in every moment we are here to experience it.</p>

<p>We cannot say, that our material selves are with absolute certainty are not simulated within a complex computational system. We may be, but it doesn&#39;t really matter. We have subjective experience, we have an individual vantage point. </p>

<p>You are experiencing things. That fact cannot be reduced to computational power or information. There is no evidence to support that sentience arise from either.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is plenty of good science to support the idea that your knowing, your subjective experience, is - much like in a dream - what creates the illusion of a solid, material world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>98% is about what I say is bullshit, regarding Mandela Effect, which means there are a <em>lot</em> of people misremembering things and mistaking memory issues for Mandela Effect, or perhaps less likely, there is a ton of disinformation about it. The memory mistakes are so easily debunked: Berenstain Bears, Froot Loops, 3 seat benches in JFK limo, Luke I&#39;m your father, all easily explained, and all easy to misremember. The 2nd option: disinfo, would mean ME is real and they are flooding the internet wirh dumb shit, to discredit and misdirect, etc. </p>

<p>All I can say firsthand is, Mandela Effect seems so stupid, and 98% of examples are lame, but when you feel it yourself, it just seems so real, and you can&#39;t let the personal examples go.</p>
