        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Don’t you hate when you have a very logical argument backed up by legit evidence and some one counters by saying, “Isn’t that the plot of XYZ science fiction film?”</p>

<p>Hollywood has been actively involved in what is arguably the most effective and widespread disinformation campaign in history. There are a shit ton of examples in recent decades of the US government providing key information, funding, resources, and in some cases classified footage/documents to Hollywood directors and production companies to make movies, provided of course, that the final content was approved by the government. This includes a number of well-known blockbuster films across several genres. I’ll mention a few in more detail below.</p>

<p>The primary goal of these govt/hollywood collaborations is to control the message being presented to the people. Reasons include:</p>

<ul>
<li>preventing mass hysteria (Orson Welles- War of the Worlds scare, Roswell)</li>
<li><strong>Hiding the full truth</strong></li>
<li>floating an idea to gauge what people think</li>
<li>Conditioning people</li>
<li>Making government agencies look good</li>
<li>promoting a social message</li>
</ul>

<p>Declassified documents reveal:
“These documents for the first time demonstrate that the US government has worked behind the scenes on over 800 major movies and more than 1,000 TV titles.”</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/insurge-intelligence/exclusive-documents-expose-direct-us-military-intelligence-influence-on-1-800-movies-and-tv-shows-36433107c307">https://medium.com/insurge-intelligence/exclusive-documents-expose-direct-us-military-intelligence-influence-on-1-800-movies-and-tv-shows-36433107c307</a></p>

<p>Will be focusing on the ‘hiding the full truth’ reason for now. This is classic counterintelligence strategy, which in this case means hiding the truth you want to keep secret in plain sight by presenting it as ‘the plot to a movie’, instantly granting a means of discrediting almost any claim of the event actually being true. This is what they call ‘plausible deniability’ in counterintelligence strategy. </p>

<p>Just scratching the surface, but here are two movies from Spielberg</p>

<p>Close Encounters of the Third Kind- Steven Spielberg</p>

<ul>
<li>This was supposedly hiding/testing out the idea of Project Serpo</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://inews.co.uk/culture/film/close-encounters-of-the-third-kind-conspiracy-theory-mystery/">https://inews.co.uk/culture/film/close-encounters-of-the-third-kind-conspiracy-theory-mystery/</a></p>

<p>(prob a less skeptical source somewhere but gives a good overview)</p>

<p>-Some also say it is based on the holloway base meeting</p>

<p>ET- Steven Spielberg</p>

<p>-The famous Reagan comment to Spielberg. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.openminds.tv/spielberg-confirms-reagan-705/10057">http://www.openminds.tv/spielberg-confirms-reagan-705/10057</a></p>

<p>This is interesting because Spielberg himself uses classic plausible deniability strategy. He both confirms that Reagan’s comment during the screening was real, but also says he is pretty sure Reagan was joking around. </p>

<ul>
<li>This was supposedly hiding the actual ET testing going on in DUMB’s(deep underground military base) at the time or in the past</li>
</ul>

<p>-A few people  are exploring the idea that it is based on Matilda O’Donnell’s(or whatever her real name is) experience communicating with an ET from Zeta Riticulae from Interview with an Alien.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAdNzVii5dQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAdNzVii5dQ</a></p>

<p>More details from Grant Cameron on Spielberg 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEM6Z7JrPuQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEM6Z7JrPuQ</a></p>

<p>A bit of a digression, but it turns out Spielberg did in fact direct Poltergeist
<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/poltergeist-steven-spielberg-director-conspiracy-theory-confirmed-tobe-hooper-a7846651.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/poltergeist-steven-spielberg-director-conspiracy-theory-confirmed-tobe-hooper-a7846651.html</a></p>

<p>There’s a lot more than can be dug from all sorts of TV and movies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post.</p>

<p>I recall watching Transformers (2007) when it was first released. At the end of the film the military takes Megatron&#39;s dead body and just drops it in the ocean. I remember thinking, &quot;Wow, that makes no sense. I suppose they have to set up the sequel somehow though.&quot;</p>

<p>In 2011 the military takes Osama bin Laden&#39;s dead body and just drops it in the ocean. There was no proof of his death. </p>

<p>I was forced to watch JFK get his head blown off in school yet we are not allowed to see any proof of death for the supposed mastermind behind 9/11?</p>

<p>Reminds me of how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNDmDZi05dY">they fake an entire war</a> in Wag the Dog (1997) but most people, even on this sub, still believe that the &#39;war in Iraq&#39; is a real war. </p>

<p>If you suggest that the telescreens may be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad1iCYcdyiM">lying about everything</a> (just as Orwell told us) they attack you like rabid dogs.</p>

<p>What a bizarre time to be alive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, some things on there I agree with, like the empty space between atoms (I love string theory and the plethora of crazy vibrational wonderment that come along with it, like kinesiology). And the possibility of intelligent life, though I did not think that was so mainstream but I guess it is. Oh, and the earth being a ball moving through space. </p>

<p>But I definitely recognize, after all I have been through and seen, that there are a lot of “truths” we have been taught that are actually wrong (fully or partially) and despite many of them having clear signs that something was wrong with said truths, I still could not see around what I had been taught to be true to see that it was actually wrong (either completely or at least partially). For those reasons, I like to keep my mind as open as possible and entertain different possibilities from a “young mind” perspective (one free of rules about the way things just are) in an effort to see the world as free from the spoon fed bs/constrains as tangibly possible. It’s good mental practice regardless, even if you conclude whatever theory you are looking at as bunk. I did this with the flat earth concept, which was interesting, but inevitably concluded that it was not for me. The good that comes out of such thinking is either you get a new perspective or you end up better understanding exactly why your foundational beliefs are correct. It’s always good to re-evaluate the things you were taught as a kid and come at the info again but from a fully developed adult brain. </p>

<p>Basically, this is why I love conspiracy. :D</p>

<p>The challenge is finding the best way to convey inherently complex things in as simple a way possible such that the amount of original truth lost is minimized in the process.</p>

<p>The conscious mind is not good at dealing with complexity, but the subconscious mind is. It makes more sense to learn to interpret the unconscious mind&#39;s accurate understanding than it does to try to refine an inherently oversimplified fake understanding from the conscious mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the problems that would be solved if only popular discourse used the socratic method more.</p>

<p>The problem with the socratic method is it is based purely on logic and reason, placing a higher importance on logical responses than on things that are just fundamentally True. This can be a real problem at scale, especially when the method is hijacked by the MSM for a nefarious agenda. MSM uses the socratic method to discredit others and control their message.</p>

<p>Example: &#39;given that people believe this widely accepted truth, here is a logical extension of that truth&#39; this is the root of deception. If the widely accepted truth is wrong than the pursuant logical extension is also wrong. Basically MSM has given a piece of shit painted gold.</p>

<p>as the socratic method forms the basis of the scientific method you can get a sense of how widespread the above mentioned problem is.</p>
