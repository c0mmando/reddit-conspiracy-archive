       There is no way he didn't know that anything remotely controversial said in private wouldn't immediately be leaked and hyperventilated about for a week by the international media. Not after a year of leaks. He knew what was going to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why would he say it? Either the Democrats are lying or he intentionally is creating headlines. Why would he do this though after a day of positive economic news regarding Walmart? Why is he dipping back into the racial well after he could just coast on the declining unemployment rate in the black and Latino communities? He continues to do this throughout his presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does he want people talking about Haiti and Africa instead? Why is he forcing his opponents to defend certain nations NOT being shitholes? People said he was insane to whip his dick out at Kim Jong Un but then we hear that North and South are on speaking terms again. What is Trump's plan with Haiti and Africa?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either this guy is insane or one of the greatest statesmen in world history.

       I thought the NFL kneeling contraversy was clear enough, he's using outlandish tweets to keep the masses passified why they ignore major issues like expanding wars, creating a private intelligence community with Price &amp; North, and passing legislation with little fan fair.

       People need to stop trying to pretend there's some master plan.  The NFL tweets came because Donald Trump gets infuriated by what he perceives as ungrateful black people.  It's not a master plan, he's just an ignorant racist asshole who only cares about cultural grievance and personal enrichment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of the GOP recognizes that he doesn't care about anything beyond culture war Twitter battles and will sign anything that crosses his desk, so they play defense for him while their people try and put legislation and executive orders on his desk to sign.

       DC right now is essentially a conspiracy of corporate robber barons and right wing nut-cases doing a "Weekend at Bernie's" routine with the bloated, gristle-filled corpse of an 80s Wall Street caricature.

       I don't know, Trump is known to do some fucked up shit.  For instance, one of his moves when negotiating is to sit down with someone, tell them their breath smells like shit, and proceed to negotiate.  He does it intentionally to through then on their heels.  He also was a reality tv show host for years, and knows how to play the bad guy.   Like I said in my last comment, it's not just him that plays into this, the media &amp; dems all play into it, without having to discuss real issues.

       Thank you, but I think it's even more than just playing to his base.  The MSM latches on to these BS stories to keep the real Trump hate from going after the real agendas.  If #resist / Dems really wanted to go after Trump, they would attack his policies and even try to counter them.  For instance, with the tax plan, the MSM largly ignored it, and the Dem didn't even try to propose their own legislation.  With foreign policy, the dems should be attacking Trump on expanding our presence in Africa, creating a mass starvation in Yemen, and expanding Afghanistan, but you don't hear a peep.  But if Trump feeds fish wrong, every news papers is all over it, and r/politics is plastered with it.  I honestly think Trump &amp; the establishment/msm are literally running the show like a WWE monster jam.

       It goes both ways.  I was accused of being partisan for pointing out the anniversary of Obama signing sec 1021 of the 2012 NDAA that basically killed Habious Corpus because I didn't note all the other times it's been violated through out history.

       It plays right back into my point of a fake left.  If #resist actually was scared of Trump, I'd imagine they should be worried about all the authoritarian powers Bush &amp; Obama passed, which Trump now has.  But they try to twist it into a partisan issue to muddy the waters, rather than have a real discussions of the fact this country is ripe for the taking.  Hell, if they knew about the COG &amp; NSPD-51 that bush passed, it should make anyone shit them selves, regardless of who's in office.  In case you aren't aware, here is Peter DeFazio talking about it when Bush signed it and made it secret:

       What i don't understand i why the Americans can't understand that Trump ISN'T  a politician, he's a fucking businessman. He markets America all over the world and is doing a damned fine job of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a discussion with a yank who came over to England to show us some Yanky stuff to do with work. He identified as a Liberal and all he did was slag Trump off (we didn't give a fuck either way. Us Brits aren't arsed about politics, it doesn't do anything for us. Especially foreign politics) Anyway, this guy was banging on about how Trump has left the Paris Climate agreement and how it shows he doesnt care about the environment. I pointed out that Trump was doing it to free America from any kind of restraints while opening America up to business green and anti-green alike. I said that this was all a massive marketing campaign to get companies investing in America and once the investment is in, Trump would sign back up for the PCA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy gave me the most disugusting look i have seen in a long time, called me an idiot and walked off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a business guy. Everything he does is a marketing campaign to get business into America. He isn't a politician.

       That’s what’s so refreshing about this Presidency. We elected a real person, not an empty suit. I honestly can’t believe Trump is a puppet given the wild shit he says. His entire goal seems to be improving the US, even if that means pissing off others. It begs the question...isn’t that his job? Did we elect him to President of the US or President of Haiti, El Salvador, Iraq, Pakistan, and sub-Saharan Africa? Sure, Israel stands out with Trump but for the first time in my life I feel that we have a guy not trying to benefit foreign nations first.

       Anecdotes have been compiled by the boatload in the book Fire and Fury. Between the number of interviews, the lawsuitv threat that got it published early, and nobody (save Trump himself) questioning its authenticity, I'd say it's a good starting point.

       Firing people, which Trump built a tv off of, is different than unhinged comments like calling places shitholes. I haven’t heard anything that implies Trump isn’t composed in his own meetings. He has been doing this his entire life and has known for a year that anything he says will be leaked Game of Thrones-style.

       My guess? He's about to sign a milquetoast bipartisan compromise on immigration that will NOT make his base happy. They expect a wall. They expect him to be openly racist. So to me this is a blatant dogwhistle to those people who need to know that, at least in private, he's "on their side."

       Not to mention the "democrats made this up" narrative works really well on other parts of his base.

       I saw a cartoon that put it pretty well, basically it's liberals having to choose between "Those countries aren't shithole" and "You can't send illegal immigrants back because their home country is a shithole."
      </p>
      <p>
       I've started to notice this recently, a lot of Trump's actions seem to put his opposition into a position where they cannot be consistent logically, so they lash out with outlandish or overblown attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR; I wouldn't be surprised if this was intentional on Trump's part to get liberals to sing the praises of these countries, so that he has an edge in immigration discussions...

       Maybe try thinking deeper than memes that pop up on the_donald?  People can leave their home country for better opportunities and that does not automatically make the place they left a shithole.

       Yeah, but that doesn't change the fact that Trump got literally all of his opponents together to sing the praises of third world countries... Doesn't matter what the truth is, he's setting up a narrative... (Or, that's the conspiracy theory).

       Nobody but Trump claimed he didn't say it.  The White House even initially confirmed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democratic Senator Dick Durbin confirmed he said it.  GOP Senator Tim Scott, who wasn't there, said that Lindsay Graham confirmed to him that he said it.  (Graham was evasive, didn't confirm or deny the exact words, but said he gave the president a piece of his mind.)  Representatives Kevin McCarthy, Bon Goodlatte, and Mario Diaz-Balart all dodged the question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your two sources, Senators Tom Cotton and Sonny Perdue, said they "couldn't recall if said it," which is obviously bullshit -- you would know for an absolute fact whether or not the president said some racist bullshit and was chewed out by Lindsay Graham in a meeting held earlier that day.

       What is more racist.....calling Haiti a shithole or pretending Haiti (and other third world nations) is normal?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Republican way of talking is more offensive but you need tough talk to prompt change. The supposedly tolerant Democrats portray themselves better but the end result has always been disaster. Almost every major American city they control has violent crime rates and social dysfunction that stands out amongst first-world nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Haiti and Africa need tough talk. You almost need an asshole like Trump to get the message through. Anything less that this and a swamp of corruption will continue to exist.

       Saying we shouldn't take immigrants from black countries and should take them from white countries is the most racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fucking MAGA apologists.  If the president said, "All Chinese people have tiny penises and love math and like to jerk off water buffalo in their rice patties," the red hats would come around and say, "Look, objectively rice
       <em>
        is

       a large part of the Chinese diet, I just don't see how that statement is racist, or why the left is afraid to talk about differences in national cuisine."

       Did he specifically say we shouldn't take immigrants from only black nations?

       Also, isn't treating black nations as incubators for labor and babies in itself racist? It's a modern day transatlantic slave trade that hurts Africa. Young people fleeing Africa hurts them and African leaders have said as much.
