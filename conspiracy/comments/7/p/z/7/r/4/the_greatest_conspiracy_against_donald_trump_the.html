       Everybody knows what he said. It's that he said they are bringing rapists and criminals and .......some... I assume are good people. That's a shitty thing to say. This is mad outdated though. He's said a bunch of dumb shit since then.

       He switches structures into list mode after going to the second thing they are bringing. Why would he switch from listing things they are bringing to an adjective about them? He wouldn’t. So yes, what is correct. “They’re Bringing Drugs...They’re Bringing Crime..Their Rapists.”

       Tbf, OP is right. As a non-Trump supporter, it's one of the things I remember having to constantly check friends on. Their main knock on him from the outset was racism and their main proof was this exact quote that was always taken out of context.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many things to knock Trump on, and it's possible he is a racist (my grandfather is his age and is a staunch Democrat but says racist things every time we go to lunch - if for no other reason, Trump likely harbors racist tendencies out of age alone), but to use this quote as proof is a really tired tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy was describing the characteristics of illegal Mexican immigrants. He wasn't wrong that many are criminals and that their crimes vary in details.

       Thank you. He never mentions illegal immigrants in his quote or in the entire speech.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When do we beat Mexico at the border? They’re laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they’re killing us economically.
       </p>
       <p>
        The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you. It’s true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.

       And yet it’s not only possible but likely for Trump to repeat himself and to hit on the same topic over and over, especially campaign promises like the wall.

       The is answer is if some of the letters are A, then most of the other letters are B.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Trump's scenario, A is the good people in Mexico, and B is the rapists and criminals.

      <p>
       He said some (he assumes) of the people of Mexico that come to America are good, but most of the people of Mexico that come to America are rapists and criminals.

       I know what the fuck you mean, man. Jesus. It's just not an appropriate analogy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You already quoted the guy. He mentions the border and then he mentions the people who cross it. You want to believe he's speaking about legal immigrants when the truth is he speaks about
       <em>
        illegal
       </em>
       immigration ad nauseam.
      </p>
      <p>
       And before you suggest it, I don't agree with his viewpoint but you're making asinine analogies just to justify your belief that this particular quote is racist when it's nothing but a poorly worded stance on illegal immigration that justifies (in his mind) the need for his wall.

       He also didn't say
       <em>
        legal

       immigration so if that's your argument then I guess we're both wrong.
      </p>

       Fact is, when Trump speaks about the Mexican border he is speaking about illegal immigration and the need for his wall.

      <p>
       You just can't admit that because it means he wasn't speaking about legal immigrants.

       You’re a non-Trump fan but yet you have to constantly check your friends on his statements. That doesn’t sound like a non-supporter.

       Trump is a racist not because of the comment yesterday or the one the post is about and the one later where he said some are good but some are rapists and killers. No, there are so many more. It’s not like anyone is even surprised by it anymore.

       He’s basically saying Mexico is ‘getting rid’ of its undesirables in the US. Not necessarily that the Mex gov is literally doing it, but in effect.  The reverse of what always happens in Hollywood movies, with the criminals trying to escape over the Mexican border to be free. Like all of their undesierables coming here and that’s how the country gets rid of them. That’s Trump’s Logic
