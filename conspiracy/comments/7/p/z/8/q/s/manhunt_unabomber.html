Growing up, I never really knew the particulars of the case, so I found it pretty interesting that Kaczynski was a genius, an MKUltra victim, and wrote a “manifesto” on how technology was destructive to humans (which resonated with many scholars). 
Anyone else see this? Any interesting information they left out? </p>

That and  Conversation aux enfers entre machiavel et montesquieu which is to me the most accurate depiction of the &quot;world order&quot; and just how states function. They are what I call &quot;mind expander&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Discovery Productions nailed this series (from an entertainment / audience persecutive - I am not saying that the series was accurate; i do not know the in&#39;s and out&#39;s).  This was an awesome series! </p>

<p>Both lead actors (the fib agent, Fitz / ted K) were stellar. </p>

<p>Kind of implies a lack of competence within the compartmentalized FBI task forces.  Fitz&#39;s intuitions and insights about the character profile for the unknown unabomber were constantly ostracized and discarded by leadership of the unabomber task force. Also, according to the show, the FBI launched a HUGE stop and frisk in SF, attempting to bait Ted K by authorizing only ONE newspaper publication to publish Teds&#39; Manifesto. FBI was certain Ted would travel, as he did for his mailing of bombs, to the news stand to secure a paper; this operation involved hundreds if not thousands of FBI agents, basically interviewing each person that purchased a copy of the newspaper, as they walked away from the park.</p>

<p>It was sad to see Fit&#39;z (the fbi agent that unmasked Ted K) character lose his life, metaphorically; he lost his family and his career went down the pipe bc of the pressures brought about by choosing his career (fbi) over his family. </p>

<p>Of course, being a competent FBI agent is probably more difficult than not. </p>

<p>His breakdown of the flaws in the current human condition, such as skipping necessary steps of developement due to dependence on convenience, is pretty incredible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the start of the Cold War, Henry Murray developed a personality profiling test to crack soviet spies with psychological warfare and select which US spies are ready to be sent out into the field. As part of Project MKUltra, he began experimenting on Harvard sophomores. He set one student as the control, after he proved to be a completely predictable conformist, and named him &quot;Lawful&quot;.
Long story short, the latter half of the experiment involved having the student prepare an essay on his core beliefs as a person for a friendly debate. Instead, Murray had an aggressive interrogator come in and basically tear his beliefs to pieces, mocking everything he stood for, and systematically picking apart every line in the essay to see what it took to get him to react. But he didn&#39;t, it just broke him, made him into a mess of a person and left him having to pull his whole life back together again. He graduated, but then turned in his degree only a couple years later, and moved to the woods where he lived for decades.
In all that time, he kept writing his essay. And slowly, he became so sure of his beliefs, so convinced that they were right, that he thought that if the nation didn&#39;t read it, we would be irreparably lost as a society. So, he set out to make sure that everyone heard what he had to say, and sure enough, Lawful&#39;s &quot;Industrial Society and its Future&quot; has become one of the most well known essays written in the last century. In fact, you&#39;ve probably read some of it. Although, you probably know it better as The Unabomber Manifesto.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A bit off topic, but my friends dad is an exploration geologist (basically hunts for gems and gold), and was tasked with checking out a spot in Montana.  This was at the time where Kaczynski was still free and active.  Anyway as he was exploring through the wilderness he came upon a cabin and was very strictly warned to get the fuck out of here.</p>

<p>After Kaczynski was captured and the location and images of his Montana cabin was revealed to the press, my friends dad related to his son that, that was the exact spot where he had been &quot;shoo&#39;ed&quot; away.</p>
