        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In reading about &quot;The Storm&quot; and QAnon, I&#39;m reminded not so much of Pizzagate, but of prosperity scams like the Iraqi dinar, NESARA, and Omega.</p>

<p>They both center around vast reams of secret knowledge in the form of &quot;intel&quot; which, while deemed to be coming from the highest levels of government, never seems to come true in any meaningful way. </p>

<p>Beyond that, they both rely on an earth-shaking event that&#39;s always &quot;just around the corner&quot; and never actually happens. Isn&#39;t &quot;the storm&quot; of elected officials and powerful people being arrested just like the &quot;RV&quot; making the dinar worth billions, or NESARA&#39;s long-awaited &quot;prosperity packets&quot; or Omega&#39;s &quot;rollover&quot; that never happened?</p>

<p>Because those things never happen, the intel tends to become more and more laden with gibberish and self-created mythology to explain why the promised event never arrives, despite constantly being &quot;about to&quot; arrive.</p>

<p>The language is virtually the same. So is the hopium generated by the false hope that everything is about to become amazing and wonderful, if you just keep believing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s probably just a matter of time before someone monetizes &quot;the Storm&quot; with paid intel updates. I know there&#39;s already self-published books out about it. </p>

<p>So take pizzagate, mix it with NESARA, and you&#39;ve got &quot;The Storm.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s clear from reading his posts that Q is employing cold reading to fuel a massive circle jerk of the current administration.</p>

<p>People constantly post about Q &quot;dropping&quot; some new information or &quot;revealing&quot; something, but Q never actually drops any new information, only asks questions designed to elicit whatever thought the reader was predisposed to.</p>

<p>Show me even one instance of when Q called something out before it happened or released any actual insider information. There is none</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I think you&#39;re just missing the point a bit. Q isn&#39;t dropping specific info about what the administrations next move is. Q is about asking us, the people, questions and letting us fine the answers. I think he does this for two reasons. One and most obvious is if he is legit then he doesn&#39;t want to give info about current ops in plain text format. Two and most importantly, is humans learn nothing when they are just given answers. If we are given questions though it fuels the research. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to go through everything Q has hinted at you really need to go read his posts for yourself to form an opinion about him. Bottom line is there is a ton of shit happening right now the media is just straight up not reporting on, and Q has been hinting at a lot of it. That makes me think he is legit, but nothing I say will convince you. </p>

<p>Maybe you could answer a better question I have. Why is Q bad for the conspiracy community? Why is everyone so hostile towards him? Obvious shills? Or did doing research on the elites become something conspiracy communities don&#39;t do anymore? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I’m definitely not missing that point, because it seems to be the one and only talking point I hear every single time I question the validity of Q.</p>

<p>I have read all of the posts when they were compiled into one big screenshot a month or so back. I haven’t read any of the more recent posts though, to be fair.</p>

<p>Surely though, you can point to at least a couple things Q has hinted at which have even been near the mark? If you don’t want to, that’s fine with me. Like I said, I’ve went through these motions many times at this point, and I’ve yet to get a good answer as to why I should take anything Q says seriously. I suspect anyone who isn’t a fervent believer like you probably feels the same.</p>

<p>That will remain the case until someone can put together a “map” of the hints Q has dropped which have actually come to fruition. I remember reading an attempt at just such a thing back when I read the posts-compiled-into-screencap, but the form (some kind of collaboration tool site) was overrun with random comments and didn’t accomplish what I can only assume was it’s intended purpose.</p>

<p>I will try to answer your question, though I can only speak for myself. I have nothing against Q, and I think Q could in fact be very good for the community. It’s the Q supporters I take issue with and it is they who I feel detracts from the potential good Q could do. I’m happy to read the posts and speculate about what they could mean, but every time someone posts about Q here it’s as if they’ve drawn in ten extra dots to outline a Star of David or something. This is speculation being promoted as fact and used to justify increasingly more absurd speculation.</p>

<p>Please lol, just do what no Q supporter has been able to do when I’ve asked, and show me something, anything, that points to Q being even the least bit legitimate and not just a LARP.</p>

<p>Totally understand why Q wouldn’t want to post specifics (although posting to fullchan should perfectly enable him/her/them to be much more specific), and if I’m being honest I think the “can’t just tell people” rhetoric is tiresome. Surprisingly, I hear that every single time I question Q as well. Is there some literature around that has instructed Q supporters on how to respond to criticism? It sure seems like it.</p>

<p>Something, anything, please. The bar is quite low.</p>

<p>The bar is quite low. Which Q post has lead you to believe he’s a legit insider and not a LARP? That’s all I’m asking for here. Just one instance of Q mentioning something before MSM did would be enough for me to at least consider it. Yet in all this time, nothing. And this post isn’t the first time I’ve went out seeking the truth on this matter, far from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q made a post I don&#39;t remember to exact text, but since you&#39;re so we&#39;ll versed you should know which one I mean. It was the weekend before the SA happenings and in the post he has two capitalized letters in brackets [S] [A]. Now you can sit there and say it&#39;s a coincidence but that same thing happened with the Rothschild plane crash [L] [D] [R]. Lynn De Rothschild. So this are a couple things I remember that originally got me on the train. If you go truly look at his posts, these are two small parts of the Q picture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pasted from another talk with someone who thought the same: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Qanon is nothing but a 4chan larp. There is literally zero evidence to suggest otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean ya you can ignore the fact Saudi Arabia arrested over 20 elites on corruption charges. You can ignore the fact that Tony and John Podesta&#39;s lobbying firm literally dissolved the weekend after Q&#39;s first posts. You can ignore the fact that since BO left office the situation is Syria has seemed to have done a complete 180.  You can ignore the fact that HRC, John McCain and other high level politicians are all wearing boots now. You can ignore the fact a second Republican  just committed suicide related to sex assault charge, and long time Congress men/women from both sides have announced they&#39;re not seeking re-election. You can ignore the fact CEO&#39;s from major companies are resigning (Eric Schmidt to name a really high profile one). Not mention all the tweets from Trump that follow bits a pieces of what Q says. </p>

<p>Like I said man believers will never convince non believers to see and non believers are going to sit there and continually yell larp. I think people need to go to where Q is posting, read all he&#39;s had to say, then make up their own minds. The facts above make me think a storm is coming, but at the very least he is getting people to investigate these elites, who we all agree are corrupt right? </p>

<p>I still have yet to see someone who is so against Q explain why he is bad for the conspiracy community? At the very least I would argue the discussion he has brought to these communities has been worth it  alone. </p>

<p>Sorry but this is all I needed to hear. Please go read all his posts. Look at the info graphics with the timings of Trump&#39;s tweets.

<p>Literally just no. You&#39;re wrong. Go read please. The only times he has referred to happenings, he isn&#39;t specific, and then shit like the stuff I posted before happens. Why is it okay to ignore all those when talking about Q? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not trying to ignore anything. What did you post before? That’s what I’m looking for here! It doesn’t have to be ultra specific, just something that any random LARPer couldn’t do. Because again, I’m looking for evidence that he’s an actual insider.</p>

<p>I’ve already answered this but I will answer it again in the hopes that you will show me the same courtesy:</p>

<p>If Q isn’t really an insider then he is either a psyop or a LARP. If he isn’t really an insider, then what he’s doing amounts to taking stories already in the public consciousness and simply telling people how to interpret them. In other words, literal propaganda.</p>

<p>Maybe Q is just some good hearted LARPer trying to bring attention to important issues, in which case hey no harm done but that doesn’t make him an insider. If he’s a psyop then I don’t think I need to tell you why that would be a bad thing.</p>

<p>Research is exactly what I’m doing here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q made a post I don&#39;t remember to exact text, but since you&#39;re so we&#39;ll versed you should know which one I mean. It was the weekend before the SA happenings and in the post he has two capitalized letters in brackets [S] [A]. Now you can sit there and say it&#39;s a coincidence but that same thing happened with the Rothschild plane crash [L] [D] [R]. Lynn De Rothschild. So this are a couple things I remember that originally got me on the train. If you go truly look at his posts, these are two small parts of the Q picture. </p>

<p>Lmao man you have no idea about Q. It&#39;s so painfully obvious. Explain how someone can be literal propaganda when all they do is ask questions. He doesn&#39;t come up with facts or research or anything the people are answering his questions. It&#39;s definitely better than the bs the msm throws at us, because at least there are documents and facts behind the research Q is spurring. Not to mention him constantly talking  about keeping an open mind and looking for things yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was it really the weekend before? Because in the case of the plane crash it was clearly after.</p>

<p>It’s literal propaganda because it takes current issues and puts a spin on them. That’s what propaganda does, it tells people what to think about things. Like you said, Q doesn’t make statements he asks questions, leading questions. He takes an event, and then asks a series of questions to which he already knows the answers will cultivate the desired viewpoint from his followers.</p>

<p>There are no documents or facts behind any of his claims. If there were, don’t you think somebody would have posted them here by now? This is a slaughter. Surely if there was anything whatsoever someone would post it and put an end to this embarrassment.</p>

<p>He’s telling you to keep an open mind so you will keep looking for explanations so that when he posts one later (as he usually does) you’ll realize it’s already crossed your mind and think that he told you about it beforehand, when in reality he’s learning about this stuff no sooner than you are. This is also why he’s so vague.</p>

<p>Neither of those posts were “before the happenings”. I haven’t even seen them and I can already tell you that’s the case. There were likely some random posts before the happenings, but those could have been about anything. It was only after the happenings that Q ever alluded to the previous posts being about them and not about whatever else could have happened in the intervening time.</p>

<p>If these “pre-happening” posts actually existed, someone would have linked them by now to shut me up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an absolute Gish Gallop. You&#39;re posting so many claims that no reasonable person has the time to debunk them all, and declaring victory because of it.</p>

<p>But here&#39;s a quick swing:
Saudi Arabia is a corrupt kleptocracy.
The Podestas firm still exists.
The Syria situation was never going to end any other way.
&quot;Wearing boots&quot; is nonsense. Lots of older people hurt their foot and wear a walking boot. Athletes too. So what?
People who have horrible sex crimes come out sometimes kill themselves rather than face the consequences of their crimes. 
It&#39;s routine for Congresspersons to retire before midterms, and more Republicans are quitting because they know their party is going to get shellacked. 
CEOs resign all the time, especially ones who are corrupt or who are harassers. 
Trump&#39;s tweets clearly come before Q posts, not after. And the &quot;predictions&quot; are nothing but vague nonsense that could mean anything.</p>
