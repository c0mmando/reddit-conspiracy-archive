<p>The monument sits in in front of Rockefeller building across from St. Patrick&#39;s Cathedral. 
It is the largest sculpture at Rockefeller Center.</p>

<pre><code> This huge bronze figure was created by sculptor Lee Lawrie with the help of Rene Paul Chambellan in 1937. Chambellan also created small Nereids and Dolphins on the fountain near Rockefeller center. 

In Greek mythology Atlas is the titan of astronomy and navigation. He was a leader in the war between the Olympian Gods and the Titans.   After the war was lost, Atlas received the harshest punishment by King Zeus:  he had to hold up the heavens with bare hands and bear their weight on his shoulders forever. Atlas instructed the mankind in the art of astronomy.  A lost traveler can use the statue as a compass -the North-South axis of the sphere on Atlas&#39; shoulders points towards  the North Star as seen from New York City.

<p>This is the original insignia of the Bavarian Illuminati. It pictures the owl of Minerva - symbolising wisdom - on top of an opened book.
Minerva was the Roman goddess of wisdom, medicine, commerce, handicrafts, poetry, the arts in general, and later, war. In many ways similar to the Greek goddess Athena, she had important temples in Rome and was patron of the Quinquatras festival.</p>

<p>In the mystery cults of the highly syncretic Hellenistic era,[18] Pan is made cognate with Phanes/Protogonos, Zeus, Dionysus and Eros. Accounts of Pan&#39;s genealogy are so varied that it must lie buried deep in mythic time. Like other nature spirits, Pan appears to be older than the Olympians, if it is true that he gave Artemis her hunting dogs and taught the secret of prophecy to Apollo. Pan is famous for his sexual powers, and is often depicted with a phallus. Diogenes of Sinope, speaking in jest, related a myth of Pan learning masturbation from his father, Hermes, and teaching the habit to shepherds.</p>

<p>Representations of Pan on 4th century BC gold and silver Pantikapaion coins
Athena, and Hephaestus are worshipped together. Athena as the Goddess of Wisdom, and War, and Hephaestus as the Creator of the great weapons of war for Gods, and Men. Hephaestus was the God of Fire and the Forge, the patron god of smiths, craftsmen, sculptors and artisans. He was the weapon maker of the Gods. In Greek mythology, Hephaestus was the son of Zeus and Hera, the king and queen of the gods. In another version, he was Hera&#39;s parthenogenous child, rejected by his mother because of his deformity and thrown off Mount Olympus and down to earth. As a smithing god, Hephaestus made all the weapons of the gods in Olympus.</p>

<p>Screen shot from the video &quot;Inside The Bohemian Club.&quot;</p>

<p>As one can plainly see by the above comparison, the owl statue, situated within the library at the Bohemian Club headquarters in San Francisco, is an exact replica of the one at the Acropolis – thus, there is no doubt that the &quot;Bohos&quot; (by duplicating a famous statue located at the chief temple dedicated to Athena) are alluding to Athena/Minerva, or the goddess of wisdom. Furthermore, the statue in the Bohemian Club has a plaque on its front base, stating: &quot;Replica of Ancient Athenian Owl&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/images/2009/MinervaOwl/bennettMinerva.jpg">http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/images/2009/MinervaOwl/bennettMinerva.jpg</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s also the tale of Minerva and Arachne (Greek for spider). It concerns a weaving contest between Minerva – also known as the goddess of the arts, needle work and weaving – and Arachne. The latter was turned into a spider after losing the contest. &quot;Weaving Spiders Come Not Here,&quot; the motto on the seal of the Bohemian Club, may well be alluding to the myth; the mere fact that it is accompanied by the owl, which represents Minerva, is significant and noteworthy (and too semiotically sound as to have been a mere coincidence).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/images/2009/MinervaOwl/illuminatiSeals.jpg">http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/images/2009/MinervaOwl/illuminatiSeals.jpg</a></p>

<p>Minerval Seals of the Illuminati: two of three known to still exist. P.M.C.V. stands for Per Me Caeci Vident (Through me the blind become sighted). An owl holding an opened book (signifying learning), surrounded by a Laurel wreath (a symbol of learning or graduation); Per Me Caeci Vident was a reminder to the Superiors of the class, whose responsibility it was to properly instruct the Minervals. These medallions were worn around the necks of Minerval initiates.</p>

<p>The class of Minerval was a relatively low rank in the scheme of things. However, it was the soul of the Order, and functioned as a sort of assembly line for recruits.</p>

<p>The Jews believe the age of Saturn/Cronus was the golden age of man. Man lived side by side with cronus-saturn, and the earth gave forth fruit everywhere. It was an age of Bliss.</p>

<p>In the beginning was the Golden Age, when men of their own accord, without threat of punishment, without laws, maintained good faith and did what was right. . . . The earth itself, without compulsion, untouched by the hoe, unfurrowed by any share, produced all things spontaneously. . . . It was a season of everlasting spring.
By extension &quot;Golden Age&quot; denotes a period of primordial peace, harmony, stability, and prosperity. During this age peace and harmony prevailed, people did not have to work to feed themselves, for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to a very old age with a youthful appearance, eventually dying peacefully, with spirits living on as &quot;guardians&quot;. Plato in Cratylus (397 e) recounts the golden race of humans who came first. He clarifies that Hesiod did not mean literally made of gold, but good and noble.
In classical Greek mythology the Golden Age was presided over by the leading </p>

<p>Titan Cronus.[3] In some version of the myth Astraea also ruled. She lived with men until the end of the Silver Age, but in the Bronze Age, when men became violent and greedy, fled to the stars, where she appears as the constellation Virgo, holding the scales of Justice, or Libra.</p>

<p>Cronus is locked in Tartarus, or the bottomless pit. They just worship him for two reasons. It was a golden age under his rule for man, and he is the god of time. They seek Immortality. When you have all the money, and power in the world all that is really left is to eat from the tree of Life. To taste the ambrosia </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, thanks for sharing this information, really interesting stuff.</p>

<p>The ancient Babylon mystery religions have always fascinated me; perhaps that&#39;s the wrong word, as fascination with evil is most likely frowned upon.  </p>

<p>I consider myself non-denominational, and while I don&#39;t share a lot of the views that most faiths share, this alone coupled with the fact that the worshippers of these deities, in principle, end up rich beyond their wildest dreams tells me something is definitely wrong in this dimensional plane/reality/whatever you want to call it.</p>

<p>If one has to sell an eternity of wonders for a few measly short (wealthy and powerful) years here on this planet just to &quot;get ahead,&quot; I&#39;ll happily die penniless with the hope that a greater purpose awaits in the next plane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a sense, it would be the equivalent of a parent who gives their child chore money/allowance, saying: &quot;Spend it wisely because you can only get so much, and you have to work hard for it, but once you&#39;ve saved enough you can buy something you really want and be happy with yourself&quot;. </p>

<p>Then, later that night (while the child is sleeping), the parent goes down to the basement and just fires up the printing press. </p>

<p>It&#39;s an illusion, and knowledge is power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Masonry, like all the Religions, all the Mysteries, Hereticism and Alchemy, conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be misled; to conceal the Truth, which it calls Light, from them, and to draw them away from it ... So Masonry jealously conceals its secrets, and intentionally leads conceited interpreters away.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The statue of liberty is wrong. It represents the Babylonian King&#39;s wife, Semiramis. They literally said it was inspired by her, so there ya go. The elites worship the Babylonian religion. They just use Roman and Greek images because they felt like it. The real religion comes from Babylon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Statue of Liberty was designed and built to the scale and design of the original Colossus of Rhodes (at least as it was believed to have looked at the time Liberty was constructed).</p>

<p>Colossus_of_Rhodes</p>

<p>Beginning work in 292 BC, it took Charles of Lindos and his designers nearly twelve years to complete the 110-foot statue, which was then erected on a 50-foot pedestal. The base was carved out of white marble and joined to the cast of feet at the ankles. The status was believed to be dedicated to the Greek God of Sun, Helios (or Apollo), whose blessings were supposedly the driving force for Rhodes’ victory Cyprus (305 BC).</p>

<p>The equipments of the vanquished enemy were sold off to finance the building of the statue. It stood for over half-a-century, by which time its fame reached scholars and visitors from far off lands, before a devastating earthquake in 226 BC demolished it. The dedication script on the statue, according to texts discovered later, spoke of a ‘statue leading to Olympus.’</p>

<p>While the representation of liberty and freedom isn’t entirely misplaced per se, it is mainly believed to be something of a modern metaphor about America being the ‘land of opportunity’ and freedom for immigrants.</p>

<p>Colosus and Liberty - georgitsis</p>

<p>(Left: The Colossus of Rhodes depicted in 1880; Right: Statue of Liberty)</p>

<p>However, being based on another statue which was once a renowned representation of ‘freedom’ for this world, the Status of Liberty certainly owes a major allegiance to the Colossus of Rhodes, both in architectural similarity and significance. Similar facial expression, seven beams of light in exact position with those in the Statue of Liberty and the same dimensions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reminds me of the scene from Alan Moore’s FROM HELL (WHICH IS AWESOME CONSPIRACY LITERATURE, srsly look it up) and the Jack the Ripper character is telling this stagecoach driver about the streets and names in London are all pagan deities and that the steeple on every Church is an obelisk, meant to represent worshipping mystery religions</p>

<p>The stage coach driver got sick.</p>

<p>The Jabulon full page thread is <em>mwah</em> in that book if you wanna do a quick search, Jack sees a vision of Baal, Moloch and Osiris or something as huge figures towering in front of him. </p>
