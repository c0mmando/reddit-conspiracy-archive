       I've recently shown some interest in LaVeyan Satanism. And I just saw a link on r/conspiracy that was essentially "Turns out this awful person who does awful things is a Satanist." This kind of upsets me, considering the fact that there are multiple types of Satanism. I never see a news article about a Christian terrorist, or a Catholic terrorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm talking about when religion is explicitly stated within the article or even the title of the article itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this poses the question: why are we targeting Satanism? Why are people so quick to judge somebody based on their religion?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I need to clarify. As u/ZiggyAventure said, I'm more asking why people blindly associate evil, baby killing people with "Satanist".

       There seems to be some kind of general consensus among conspiracy theorists that the NWO and Illuminati, Rothschilds etc. are satanists.

       At least I constantly see people linking satanism to the NWO/Illuminati.

       Strange that you would post this here, considering anyone that knows anything about 20th century occultism, LaVeyan Satanism, Aleister Crowly, Michael Aquino and Jack Parsons have an understanding of the role that occultism played in the formation of NASA, OSS, CIA and other intelligence agencies.

       This is precisely what OP is saying. Satanism is not occultism. People blindly characterize anything evil with satanism. This is incorrect as many Satan religions value self will and being responsible for your actions rather than the will of God.
      </p>

       Satanists have been some of the nicest people I've met. They often do charity and throw cool parties.

       Not saying anything about the quality of people who practice Satanism, but occultism and Satanism go hand in hand. Your ignorance doesn't change the fact that these two things have similar ideological characteristics and one can't exist without the other.

       Occultism is about using hidden or supernatural powers. Satanism is about using yourself and being responsible for your actions. It is the opposite of being an occult.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term cult would apply. However cult applies to much such as The_Donald subreddit.

       Except, the ideological and symbolic characteristics of Satanism is literally taken from occultism. Are we just going to ignore the fact that the basic tenets and rituals of Satanism get their foundation from occult practices?

       The same could be said about any other religion like Christianity. The roots of all religion lie in occultism. One could even say that communion is occultism.
      </p>
      <p>
       But origins does not dictate that currently there is no secret or supernatural powers involved in most satanist sects. There are exceptions for sects that would align with occultism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I am curious why are you trying to shoehorn Satanism into the broad occultism label. It does nothing to discuss it's merits. I'm assuming here, but maybe you see occultism as inherently evil and by labeling satanism such it is how you explain to yourself it is evil. This fact has long been pushed by the Christian church.

       Christianity's relationship to occultism is negligent, to say the least. And I hold no notion about good and evil towards occultism or Satanism. But it doesn't change the reality about Satanism's foundation being deeply rooted in occultism.

       There are many belief systems which could be called occult which have nothing to do with Satanism.
       <br/>
       On the other hand there are different types of Satanists and for some it is a philosophy. I can tell you know a little bit about this but you link Anton Lavey and Aleister Crowley and they are not the same thing at all. Crowley knew hoe to get his name in the papers but his philosophy and practices are a perfect example of something that can be occult without being Satanic.
       <br/>
       Yes, I know he called himself the Beast 666 and all that but that was just to mess with people.
       <br/>
       To answer your question, those things do fall into one definition of occult but I think the definition of "hidden knowledge" is better. And when you use that definition the Catholic Church and the Mormons are occult organizations. Christianity itself with all of the hidden meanings in the Bible could be called an occult religion.

       I realize this. But you can’t mince words and say that satanism doesn’t have deep roots in occultism. This is also why I used the word “esoteric”. Because I understand the occult’s foundations are in hidden knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christianity within itself has very menial ties to occultism. Christian gnosticism would fall into the category of occultism a lot easier. “Hidden knowledge” isn’t an umbrella term in this regard, because occult practices are definitive.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing “hidden” in Christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we also cannot ignore Crowley’s influence on LaVey and his development of satanism. Thelema is all over LaVeyan Satanism.

       This just isn't true. Look at the Book of Revelations.

       Let's say that "Satanism" which we agree has different meanings has deep roots in occultism. That really doesn't justify equating the occult with Satanism. The problem for me is that I am a tarot reader and I study the occult. I have many friends who are witches. Their beliefs vary greatly but I don't think any of them eat babies. I am happy to see intelligent discussions about the occult. I think that many people are afraid to even look into it. Because of this we get a literal witchhunt in this sub. So please consider that because you have some knowledge on the subject and that there may be people here who are afraid to study on their own and may be influenced by what you say, please be careful about how you say it.

       That’s fair. And I have a base interest in the occult. The only point that I was trying to convey is the influence occultism has on the practice of satanism. Doesn’t mean it’s
       <em>
        wrong
       </em>
       per say, but that it’s there.  Occultism is deep in the sense that, it’s influence can be found in dogmas ranging from Gnosticism and Kabbalah, to Hermeticism and Thelema to LaVeyan Satanism.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I never said anyone was good or evil based on what they practiced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, I just don’t think we can deny the influence. Especially in a sub that’s focus is on conspiracies.

       One of the definitions of occult is "hidden knowledge." I don't know what you mean by "occult practices are definitive," but that's okay.  It's getting into hair-splitting.

       If there is an inter-dimensional, negative entity; who wants the death of all life as we know it to preclude anyone from spiritual salvation; including the total transgression of all things in our framework of reality to the ultimate end of absolute Chaos; would worshiping him be a positive thing?

       Look up the term Social Deviance.  Society is shaped by cultural mores to have a defined sense of normalcy.  Anything that deviates from that is therefor scrutinized.  This deviance has a perceived scale from 'evil' to 'good' (antisocial behaviour vs altruistic behaviour) and everybody who falls outside the normal range, whether it be Charles Manson or Mother Theresa, appears 'different' from the group according to the norm.

       It is believed that Satanists are blood drinking, murdering, pedophiles.   In short: really bad People.  When one is associated with a group that the public at large finds abhorrent ostracizing occurs.

       There's a lot of Christian support around here and in general. The majority masses are still worshipping a middle eastern man, be it Jesus or Mohammad and you're interested in it's opposite of "good".

       something to keep in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the so called satanic religions are in no way,shape or form worship satan. Most are pagan religions that follow an entirely different pantheon of gods/goddess's.
The only reason they are called satanic is due to  cradle to grave religious brainwashing and indoctrination by preachers and preists who dont like having to compete with other religions.  Because of this dislike of the competition, they have used mindfuck memes like baby killers to instill fear into their flock in order to maintain their control.
