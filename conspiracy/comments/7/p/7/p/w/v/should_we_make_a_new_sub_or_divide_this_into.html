       The sub is getting spammed with bots, shills, crappy "articles" and it's all gone downhill. I think we need to make a network of smaller conspiracy subs, where we can focus on one issue per sub, or something like that.

       There's already many Conspiracy spinoffs. ConspiracyII, Conspiracy2, ConspiracyRight(Thought I would avoid this one since they had posts literally planning to bot us here and one of the Mods there was called out by InterstellerDinoAlien(a mod here) for bot vote manipulating), and many others.

       Honestly, I am not convinced if Reddit is still the best platform to have discussions such as these on. Perhaps it would be better if we moved to a stand-alone site. It would gives us access to features such as boards as well, so we can split things up a bit without losing traffic.

       As always the biggest problem is getting everyone to agree on the move at the same time. I think we can agree the most valuable thing about this sub is the people here. There have been attempts to create new platforms, but we need to get the rest of the half million users here on the same page. Sadly, until that happens organically, we are stuck.
      </p>

       But new splinter subs are created daily. There are a couple starting to do well on their own, this isn't a new idea though.

       What I'm thinking is a self-hosted forum. It'd be a bit costlier than sticking with Reddit, Voat or [insert alternative], but censorship will always be a problem as long as we depend on third-party services.

       While that sounds good on paper, it can be pretty hard to distinguish between shills and legit users who are just skeptical. Could be a pretty good pretext for censorship also. Note that I'm not accusing you or your sub of censoring anything, I'm just trying to make clear how easily this rule can be abused.

       This is a bold lie though, no one has been banned for having a particular opinion or disagreeing with another particular opinion. I'm willing to state this is a fact, and I'm equally willing to entertain cited references of people being banned for holding a position
       <em>
        and not
       </em>
       being banned rather for
       <em>
        how they presented their opinion

       or otherwise
       <em>
        mocked or attacked
       </em>
       the person they were debating in the process. The sub doesn't hide/remove comments that don't break sitewide rules so this shouldn't be an difficult if what you claim holds true.

       I got banned from

       for telling the creator of that sub they were censoring somebody who disagreed. I wasn’t very nice about it, but in my opinion, the person who got banned from the other sub wasn’t being inflammatory.

       So who was the person and how were they acting when they were banned, direct link to comment would be preferred. What opinion were they banned for holding? You care enough to smear the sub but don't provide any evidence for your opinion yet somehow still get upvotes, just like everyone who smears that sub.

       That's a new one, lie and become apathetic to accountability of opinion. Gotta add that to the list, albeit a lazy tactic. I'm sure it will get upvoted nonetheless, boy I miss the old r/conspiracy before accounts like you started spamming every thread that creates dissonance with "the narrative."

       You said censorship for having differing opinions takes place on that sub, which is far from the truth. Whatever motivates you to speak this misinformation is not a concern of mine, only that it taking place is recognized for what it is - Unsubstantiated bullshit, which you've more or less proved for us in this particular case

       Ok in the last 24 hours you been going quite hard on the turfing. 100's and 100's of comments.  Maybe I was wrong about you not sleeping because 10hr ago it looks like you came back from a 6-7 hour break.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this is quite strange because you are just someone who sits at their computer for 18hours a day posting non stop about 1 subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       One possibility is that your account is being used by multiple people to push an agenda. Possibly run by a PR firm who astroturfs reddit
      </p>
      <p>
       Another is that you are one person, who is working overtime for a PR firm that astroturfs reddit. I kinda hope Im wrong on this because its not healthy to work these long hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or you are just some person deeply obsessed with trump that you spend any time that you are awake posting on a conspiracy subreddit. I really hope it's not this because it would be very unhealthy for your body and mind. If this is the case, seek help.

       Combine with do-nothing job, a break in student responsibilities, the greatest conspiratorial human drama I’m likely to experience for decades, and you’ve got a powerful combination for endless posting on the internet. This shit is so much fun, watching the whole GOP eat itself alive.

       You are absolutely right.  By shills, I mostly meant heavy r/TopMindsOfReddit users.  We have a rule where we give them one chance to be collegial, then we ban them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our rule of collegial discussion (don't attack) is like kryptonite for users with poor intentions like shills.  It has created a truly remarkable Reddit conspiracy related environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of our most important aims is to be transparent with our users (we leave up comments) and to minimize censorship (staying within the Reddit rules).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, note how much my comment was down voted.  I think the top minds are likely doing it.

       While that sounds good on paper, it can be pretty hard to distinguish between shills and legit users who are just skeptical. Could be a pretty good pretext for censorship also. Note that I'm not accusing you or your sub of censoring anything, I'm just trying to make clear how easily this rule can be abused.
