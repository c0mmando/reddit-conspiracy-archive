    <div class="md"><p>I believe Maralou is connected -- she has both australian US and (what is thai or phillipine or something) citizenship.  She has had what like 2 or 3 names since she ended up with paddock?  And she worked as like, a hostess who was assigned to paddock?  Also, I got the impression people were trying to shield her and act as though she was a victim for being a subject of inquiry.  Is there anyone who doubts she was at least aware of the arsenal Paddock was accumulating?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Didn&#39;t like Mondays&quot; was a reference to another irrational killing where the killer said she did it because she didn&#39;t like Mondays.  As much as you wish you could find a reason, as is the question in the headline here, you don&#39;t always get one.  Sometimes, the answer is irrational; I don&#39;t like Mondays.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My original post in response to yours was pretty stupid I guess lol.  But I think you are wrong still.  Why would you say &quot;maybe there will be no rational explanation&quot; when there are still more possible leads to exhaust, and when people are working to conceal information about the case still.  </p>

<p>Like the CEO of Lockheed says &quot;im not showing you this information about what he did&quot; and you&#39;re saying, &quot;yeah, dont bother trying to see, he just did it cos blah blah blah&quot;... thats why I downvoted you... no hate or anyhting though, didnt mean to sound angry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I view it is this, and let&#39;s look at this rationally.</p>

<p>Either...</p>

<p>He acted alone.  And, if he did, why would he do it?  Would there be <em>any</em> rational reason?  No.  There can&#39;t be.  Was he part of some terrorist organization?  Did he have some political agenda? If he did, for either of those, he made no mention of it, so we can discount terrorism or political statements.  Was he having money difficulties?  Women difficulties?  In either case, even if he was, RATIONAL people don&#39;t go around firing high powered weapons into dense crowds.  For pretty much any reason, had he acted alone, the reasons were not rational, therefore, the &quot;why?&quot; question won&#39;t ever really be satisfying to anyone. </p>

<p>So, let&#39;s say he didn&#39;t act alone, but had help, but was a willing actor.  Pretty much all of the above apply.  No one has claimed to work with him for any terrorist or political ends, so again, there is no <em>rational</em> reason why he, along with some compatriots, would do such a thing.  </p>

<p>OK, so lets say he was a patsy in some kind of political operation, which seems to be the consensus on this sub, and has been for over three months.    To what end?  If it was a political assassination, as has been discussed, it was a miserable failure.  But how would we know if it was?  We&#39;d need some information in the positive to that end.  We have none.  We have speculation, a lot of &quot;maybe if you squint, you can see how the dots connect&quot;, which is worth every penny you paid for it.  If it was some kind of attempt to further gun control, well, I generally laugh at those assertions, since there is a mass shooting almost every day in the US, and nothing ever gets done with respect to &quot;gun control&quot;.  Clearly the people who would consider such an operation <strong>know this</strong>.  So, why do it?  It makes no sense.  So, what else?  All the other ideas I&#39;ve heard are just too far fetched, IMHO.  (Please, pointing out that some past conspiracy theories have turned out to be true, to some extent, is not evidence that <em>this case</em> is one.)</p>

<p>Considering the last point, supposing he was a patsy of some larger operation.  So, now what?  Do we think by pounding away at our keyboards, we&#39;ll <em>ever</em> find out the truth?  Do we think we can find out the truth that some intelligence agencies don&#39;t want us to know?  </p>

<p>So, considering all of the above, it is my assertion, as it was from the start, that this asshole acted alone, and we won&#39;t ever find a satisfactory reason, because there isn&#39;t one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He did not act alone -- no one is even attempting to hide the fact that paddock worked for the IRS as a defense contractor auditor, then worked for a lockheed martin predecessor as an auditor, then left lockheed with a large sum of money that he used to create a real estate company which would make him a multi millionaire.  It is literally a matter of fact that if you trace the money that paid for this operation back to its source, you find out that the source was the intelligence and defense industry.  Thats hardly &#39;alone&#39;.... sounds more like a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Edit: Some more elaboration on the above.  Another important fact is that lockheed will not reveal the nature of his work for their company.  They will not even reveal the predecessor company he worked for.  This is because the information is sensitive -- that is to say, relevant.  So did he act alone?  Not even Lockheed Martin would say that!</p>

<p>Furthermore, the FBI is actively covering up the investigation.  They have openly stated they do not intend to reveal any information until late in 2018, long after some other media scheme can take center stage I imagine.  (edit, but that is just speculation based on what happened with weinstein)</p>

<p>Keep in mind, Paddock&#39;s house was burglarized during the course of the investigation.  That&#39;s it, the FBI is either incompetent or a cover up.  Either way, they are done working in secret.  So.  Its a conspiracy, thats a fact, in my view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you on that. Thank you for your comment. Do you think that there is a possibility an Indian girl would know Stephen Paddock and yes know about the attack in advance. She works with Lockheed Martin and when she was drunk 2 months before the attack she  told her friend about Stephen Paddock. No one has covered this story and I&#39;m the first coz I know that girl. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We first talked about movies and stuff then it came to conspiracy theories. I was the one who brought out the topic saying that the seal team 6 who took out Osama bin laden were all dead and she said it is no coincidence that they are killed by the government. She said the helicopters used were old and slow and that no seal team would be put in the same helicopter for missions. So I asked her what type of helicopters mostly used for operations she said the one( name I forgot)  used in the mission  said bearing serial number is a good one. That&#39;s when my jaw dropped. I started asking about her work and she told me Lockheed martin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was reported by mainstream media stories, during the initial news rush (perhaps before intelligence could get the lid on stuff?)  In my view its the best and one of the only leads.    I originally saw the information on ABC news.   There was only like one or two news outlets who mentioned that it was a lockheed predecessor.  I don&#39;t have access to my notes on this computer, but here is a new york times aritlces from wikipedia confirming he worked at lockheed after the irs:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/us/las-vegas-gunman.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/us/las-vegas-gunman.html</a></p>

<p>edit: in my haste I missed that the article mentions the work specificlaly auditing defense contracts, so perhaps this will suffice.  </p>

<p>I will try to find sources which confirm specifically he worked as an auditor of defense contracts.</p>

<p>I will also mention briefly his employment for the postal service in the late 70s.  You never know, he may have been participating in the package and letter opening campaign if it continued on that long after the  church hearings.  I haven&#39;t ruled it out but it&#39;s not exactly relevant either way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he acted alone in the sense that it was not part of a more elaborate conspiracy. I am not convinced that the government/cia or some other organization had anything to do with this. I am yet to hear an explanation that makes more sense than just Stephen Paddock simply snapped. Mental illness can make people do crazy things. We don&#39;t know a ton about Paddock, so it is hard to really know what was going on, but for me it seems more likely that he had some sort of mental break down and decided to kill a bunch of people opposed to him being some sort of CIA operative involved in a top secret mission that for some reason involved killing 50 innocent people at a concert. </p>

<p>I agree that the investigation of this event has been strange, but I think it seems more likely that it is the result of the fact that this happened at a casino. I think much of the irregularities come from huge mega casinos trying to protect their image and security practices. If there is any sort of &quot;cover up&quot;, it is most likely the casinos using their money and power to influence the investigation to benefit them the most. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post... here is one of my problems with your approach though.  You say &quot;I am yet to hear an explanation that makes more sense than just Stephen Paddock simply snapped.&quot;  Well, that&#39;s definitely a start.  But thats no explanaition at all in my mind.</p>

<p>Maybe you can tell from my other post that I am taking a more &#39;conspiratorial&#39; approach.  Truth be told, I am with you though.  I don&#39;t expect to unravel some CIA scheme where their end game is the LV massacre.  Because like you, I don&#39;t see how what Paddock did, could possibly be beneficial to anyone in the world.</p>

<p>So here is where your explanation falls short to me: it doesn&#39;t EXPLAIN anything.  550 people scarred/traumatized/trampled/shot/paralyzed/murdered.  Oh, he snapped.</p>

<p>You see?  That&#39;s what our politicians, columnists, and the FBI are saying, but that&#39;s not going end the madness.  I imagine you get what I&#39;m saying lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, paddock having some sort of nervous breakdown/mid-life crisis and going &quot;postal&quot; is a perfectly fine explanation. This sort of thing happens all the time. Many of the mass shootings through out history are the result of mentally unstable people hitting a breaking point and acting out irrationally. </p>

<p>I guess I don&#39;t know what you mean by ending the madness. I don&#39;t know why coming up with a more conspiratorial explanation will change anything. I&#39;m all for asking questions and not just blindly accepting official narratives, but trying to find more meaning where there isn&#39;t meaning to be found is counter productive. </p>

<p>At the end of the day you can&#39;t always explain crazy. You can&#39;t predict it. You can&#39;t stop it. And for me the LV shooting looks like the results of a mentally unstable person acting out. For sure there are some weird things about the official story that feel unsatisfying, but I think most of that is because we are missing a lot of facts and evidence. Paddock was a private guy with few friends and relationships and his actions don&#39;t make a lot of sense. He didn&#39;t leave a great trail to follow. But at this point all the theories that I have read seem much more implausible than the most the theory that paddock just snapped and acted out irrationally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said... saying &quot;paddock just snapped&quot; is not an explanation, because it explains nothing.  It is the opposite of an explanation -- it exists INSTEAD of facts and explanatory information and context.  WHY did he snap (if he did), WHY in this way?  People and their actions don&#39;t occur in vacuums, for inexplicable reasons.  You&#39;re literally just proposing willful ignorance,  and saying &quot;there is nothing to learn here&quot;.  You say, &quot;You can&#39;t always explain crazy, you can&#39;t predict it, you can&#39;t stop it.&quot;  This is a truly ignorant thing to say -- not because it isn&#39;t true (who knows maybe it is), but because you&#39;ve said it without explanation -- its just something we&#39;re supposed to say yeah, I guess so.  And you have never proven that this is one of those cases.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>trying to find more meaning where there isn&#39;t meaning to be found is counter productive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh?  What are you saying here?  Should people know things before they know them?  &quot;I wonder if this is important, or if investigating this would yield no information.&quot;  No, don&#39;t!  You might be wrong, which would be a waste of time!  Wow, can you imagine all the time wasted by scientists who investigate these &#39;hypotheses&#39; of theirs?  Why don&#39;t they just know beforehand what is worth looking into?</p>

<p>Your explanation isn&#39;t as plausible or sensible as you think, either -- not surprising since your approach is basically to just to propose that we remain ignorant about the facts and details of what happened.</p>

<p>There is very little evidence to suggest that Paddock was mentally unwell, and none which indicates any of his possible mental issues contributed to the massacre.  Not that you seem very interested in learning anything, but consider the findings of contemporary science (commonly used resources when reasoning about the world):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318286/#__sec1title">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318286/#__sec1title</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Surprisingly little population-level evidence supports the notion that individuals diagnosed with mental illness are more likely than anyone else to commit gun crimes</p>

<p>less than 3 percent to 5 percent of U.S. crimes involve people with mental illness, and the percentages of crimes that involve guns are lower than the national average for persons not diagnosed with mental illness</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What about the unprecedented level of weaponry (bombs and powerful automatic weapons, or weapons modified to be fire like automatic weapons), the great deal of planning (even scoping out  multiple locations)?  Nah, he just snapped one day and spent the next year or more planning the massacre.  The year long snap, that all the (few) people around him said they didn&#39;t detect at all.  What can you do, after all..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This sort of thing happens all the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Prove this statement.  Do you realize how insane this is to claim?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He didn&#39;t leave a great trail to follow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How the hell do you know?  The FBI has all the evidence and won&#39;t share, or even tell anyone about what they found.  And there is actually an overwhelming amount of information about his businesses online.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to insult you when I say you come across as willfully ignorant.  Its remarkable how much ridiculous things you say with total confidence and unawareness.  Just because something sounds reasonable, doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t the most ignorant shit you could possibly say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually the nonsensical nature of the official narrative that has me thinking it is legit, or at least not just another staged shooting. The usual psyop is much better at conveying a narrative - there&#39;s no narrative here. The usual patsy is interesting enough to draw the media&#39;s attention - this guy seemed mostly normal. Too much work would have had to have been put into this for these kinds of details to be screwed up.</p>

<p>I think it is possible that it was all part of something else that was going on. The Saudi stuff, Paddock&#39;s previous employment, the FBI coverup. Paddock acting as a distraction for an assassination attempt seems plausible. But generally, for me at least, the rest of it seems so stupid that it rings more true than false.</p>

<p>Like the CEO of Lockheed says &quot;im not showing you this information about what he did&quot; and you&#39;re saying, &quot;yeah, dont bother trying to see, he just did it cos blah blah blah&quot;... thats why I downvoted you... no hate or anyhting though, didnt mean to sound angry.</p>
