    <div class="md"><p>You must have missed the point entirely.</p>

<p>The value of reddit is that it&#39;s an open discussion forum and its supposedly reflective of public opinion.</p>

<p>If everything from the posts, to the comments, to the upvote/downvotes are being manipulated then its really just become a propaganda tool more than an open forum. Everything you&#39;re seeing is being manipulated. So therefore those who are unaware of this are getting a false perspective of fellow humans&#39; thoughts and opinions, and those that are aware of it can no longer trust the legitimacy of anything they read on the forum.</p>

<p>I dont care, i got off reddit as soon as I realize how manipulated it was.</p>

<p>But this kind of thing is in the same category as fake protests, paid provocateurs, dishonest partisan media etc....... It fucks democracy up when you can&#39;t even trust that you&#39;re getting an organic public discourse. Hence the violation of freedom of speech</p>

<p>And that applies across all political spectrums. Its not left vs right (even if thats what OP was on)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone can look at voting patterns overall in the sub to see how it gets brigaded and/or botted. When people like peyote have three simultaneous front page posts with hundreds of upvotes, all from extremely dubious sources about information that&#39;s just torn apart in the comments, it&#39;s pretty clear those post upvotes aren&#39;t organic.</p>

<p>Same way anything remotely anti Trump can&#39;t make it out of new without being instantly mass downvoted, unless it&#39;s a story so big that people from all come here to join in the discussion and overvote the bots/brigaders.</p>

What Im saying is that we should make the problem worse than it already is.  The shill talk is a worse problem then just having vote spam, in my view.</p>

<p>There is no swamp being drained, just more water being dumped into the swamp.  I&#39;m sorry he didn&#39;t do what he said he was going to do, a lot of people were hopeful, even myself included.  It&#39;s over, nothing is going to happen to Clinton.

<p>In fact much of the dirt you see to this day about the Clinton&#39;s Arkansas years was first made widely public by Brock&#39;s article in The American Spectator.</p>

<p>I have no idea if it&#39;s true, but the story I heard was he switched camps because some people on the right who did not like him outed him for being gay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back in the old days, the method was for political groups to urge ordinary citizens to send letters to the editors at their local newspapers to be published. Of course, there were &quot;suggested templates&quot; for these letters. I&#39;m sure this is probably still in play but it&#39;s nothing compared to the size and speed of messaging the internet offers.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had friends who have worked in communications capacities for political parties (not PACs like Brock) so I&#39;m familiar with crafted political messaging. I probably can&#39;t differentiate an employed shill from a rube but lurking in the political sub, I can definitely tell which remarks are borne from manipulative political messaging.</p>

<p>And in the off chance that you are new to the internet yes there is evidence in the form of folks coming forward and ratting them out with pay stubs.

<p>From what I understand it was to prepare materials and content for supporters. And I don&#39;t recall HRC paying for anything.</p>

<p>Again, has anyone come forward and talked about their time as a paid poster?</p>

<p>I certainly don&#39;t dispute that.</p>

<p>No. Plenty of people accuse others of being shills and cannot seem to show that any US political group pays people to post.</p>

<p>The leaked crap from 4Chan is almost laughably suspicious.</p>

<p>As you can see, their operation wasn&#39;t exactly &quot;sophisticated&quot;. I have yet to find any actual evidence of CTR related organizations posting covertly (pretending to be regular users). No where <em>near</em> the type/amount of evidence found of Putin&#39;s &quot;troll army&quot;:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of it is a semi-organized campaign to discredit Trump criticism.</p>

<p>They say the election was rigged, but only to the extent that Trump lost the popular vote - the election being rigged never seems to bring into question his electoral college win.</p>

<p>The polls showing his low approval rate are fake, because how could he have won if he was unpopular? When you point out that the popular vote aligned with the polls they revert to the saying the popular vote count is wrong.</p>

<p>They constantly spam &quot;inorganic&quot; or &quot;&quot;organic&quot;&quot; (with the scare quotes) to discredit the popularity of Trump criticism on Reddit. At this point they don&#39;t even make an argument for why there wouldn&#39;t naturally be few Trump supporters on this site, they just spam the &quot;inorganic&quot; buzzword to drive it into your head by repetition.</p>

<p>And then basically the multitude ways they call people shills. I love how this post goes out of it&#39;s way to only target liberal or anti-Trump groups, and then you get comments saying &quot;these posts are always shill magnets&quot;. So, basically they&#39;re trying to create a situation where they call everyone that dislikes Trump a shill, and then if you push back against that it makes you a shill.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pretty obvious conspiracy to create an echo chamber, but for some people the only criteria for being &quot;woke&quot; is that you defend Trump and endlessly fixate on Clinton in the year 2018.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More than pay stubs and the server? One of the guys with a stub said he was paid to deal with pizzagate. Though he said he felt it was more about laundering money through art at the Pegasus museum than pimping kids to pedophiles. I think it is both. He had names and paperwork. Someone may be able to dig it up for you.</p>

<p>The pizzagate shills are plain to see. It&#39;s fairly easy deduction. You either have an army of hundreds and hundreds of users who are really concerned about the image of one of the most powerful men in Washington. Or that very powerful man thinks he can throw money at his image problem. Pedo apologists aren&#39;t really a thing outside of the catholic church and that is just a netowrk of pedosadists covering each others ass.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the one about &quot;Correct the Record.&quot;</p>

<p>Citing “lessons learned from online engagement with ‘Bernie Bros,’” a pro-Hillary Clinton Super PAC is pledging to spend $1 million to “push back against” users on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and Instagram.</p>

<p>Correct the Record’s “Barrier Breakers” project boasts in a press release that it has already “addressed more than 5,000 people that have personally attacked Hillary Clinton on Twitter.” The PAC released this on Thursday.</p>

<p>The PAC was created in May of last year when it was spun off from the American Bridge SuperPAC, which is run by longtime Hillary and Bill Clinton supporter David Brock. Brock also founded the left-wing media watchdog website Media Matters for America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s one thing missing from that write-up: Evidence that CTR (or any related organization) was actually posting covertly. That is, pretending to be regular users, or &quot;shills&quot;. There&#39;s nothing wrong with a media outreach organization posting online. In fact, that&#39;s pretty much their job. The issue is if they were pretending to be users not related to the organization. <em>This</em> is the crucial evidence that&#39;s missing.</p>

<p>There were paid posters, but all the evidence I&#39;ve seen points to them being upfront about who they were.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a quote <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000154-3082-d20b-a1fc-b3e3368b0000">directly from them</a>, as well as (most of) the accounts they are referring to:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do recall one of the podesta emails containing a plan about creating a &quot;robust echo chamber&quot;. One of the bullet points was literally &quot;control the political discourse&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/329671653/NYC-Meeting-2007-Final-Draft-4#from_embed">https://www.scribd.com/document/329671653/NYC-Meeting-2007-Final-Draft-4#from_embed</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Control the political discourse. So much effort over the past few years has been focused on better coordinating, strengthening, and developing progressive institutions and leaders. Now that this enhanced infrastructure is in place — grassroots organizing; multi-issue advocacy groups; think tanks; youth outreach; faith communities; micro-targeting outfits; the netroots and blogosphere — we need to better utilize these networks to drive the content of politics through a strong “echo chamber” and message delivery system”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And an earlier draft said this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Create a robust echo chamber with progressive messaging that spans from the opposition campaigns to outside groups, academic experts, and bloggers.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But in general though, it is pretty much standard for every major government/corporation to have shills with at least a modest-sized botnet to do damage control/promotion. </p>

<p>Aaaaaand instantly downvoted within seconds with no reply. Standard.</p>

<p>Because identity politics aren&#39;t actually mainstream with liberals? It&#39;s more of a deviant, vocal fringe.</p>

<p>I disagree. This whole astroturfing story about CTR originated from a Daily Beast writer who misread their press release. Now anytime a democratic funded group comes out, it&#39;s assumed to be a shill factory based on <strong>literally no evidence whatsoever.</strong></p>

<p>Unless I&#39;m mistaken (in which case I would welcome being corrected, with proper sources and evidence) - there is just as much evidence that CTR was astroturfing Reddit as there is proof Cambridge Analytica.

    <div class="md"><p>This is the most likely sentiment all along. You can go into the smallest of the Trump satellite subs, with subscribers below 10,000, and people are complaining that Correct the Record is targeting their posts for downvotes.</p>

<p>I would be SHOCKED if CTR or Cambridge Analytica cared that much about Reddit, and especially the smaller subs like r/conspiracy or really anything other than defaults. If they were smart they would focus on Facebook and Twitter, where you can reach a real audience.</p>

<p>The thing is, Reddit gets millions of unique page views per month. Millions of uniques. That&#39;s huge marketing opportunity, right there. No competent business would ignore that. I remember before they started hiding metrics on this sub, I checked and this sub got 40,000+ uniques per month. That&#39;s almost half a million per year.</p>

<p>Now, where it differs from the popular sentiment is that while Reddit is, from a business efficiency standpoint, being astroturfed... it&#39;s most likely a very small group of maybe 3 or 4 people all managing hundreds of accounts. It would be easy to compartmentalize and cheap.</p>

<p>I have friends who work professionally in SEO and online branding and that&#39;s how everyone is doing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK I should clarify. I would be shocked if they exist in the way people here seem to think they do --- with giant teams of people patrolling every r/conspiracy thread to downvote right wingers. I agree that it&#39;s probably in post manipulation. </p>

<p>Like I said, it&#39;s probably 3 people in a room. They don&#39;t need to patrol, programs can be written to parse keywords.</p>

<p>If you work in SEO then surely you know how easy it is to write or have written programs that allow you to automate nearly everything, including keyword targeting.</p>

That&#39;s how I know it&#39;s coordinated. I&#39;ve seen similar situations like this happen like when Bernie lost to Hillary in the r/sandersforpresident sub and this sub (and all of Reddit for that matter) when this stupid dossier came out in the first place. I gotta say, whoever is really pulling the strings in the media, whether it is Soros/Brock/whoever is really scared of the President and wants him gone. I&#39;ve never seen such an effort to impeach a President. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of it is a semi-organized campaign to discredit Trump criticism.</p>

<p>They say the election was rigged, but only to the extent that Trump lost the popular vote - the election being rigged never seems to bring into question his electoral college win.</p>

<p>The polls showing his low approval rate are fake, because how could he have won if he was unpopular? When you point out that the popular vote aligned with the polls they revert to the saying the popular vote count is wrong.</p>

<p>They constantly spam &quot;inorganic&quot; or &quot;&quot;organic&quot;&quot; (with the scare quotes) to discredit the popularity of Trump criticism on Reddit. At this point they don&#39;t even make an argument for why there wouldn&#39;t naturally be few Trump supporters on this site, they just spam the &quot;inorganic&quot; buzzword to drive it into your head by repetition.</p>

<p>And then basically the multitude ways they call people shills. I love how this post goes out of it&#39;s way to only target liberal or anti-Trump groups, and then you get comments saying &quot;these posts are always shill magnets&quot;. So, basically they&#39;re trying to create a situation where they call everyone that dislikes Trump a shill, and then if you push back against that it makes you a shill.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pretty obvious conspiracy to create an echo chamber, but for some people the only criteria for being &quot;woke&quot; is that you defend Trump and endlessly fixate on Clinton in the year 2018.</p>
