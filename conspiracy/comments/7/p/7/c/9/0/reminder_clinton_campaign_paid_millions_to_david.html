       You must have missed the point entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       The value of reddit is that it's an open discussion forum and its supposedly reflective of public opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If everything from the posts, to the comments, to the upvote/downvotes are being manipulated then its really just become a propaganda tool more than an open forum. Everything you're seeing is being manipulated. So therefore those who are unaware of this are getting a false perspective of fellow humans' thoughts and opinions, and those that are aware of it can no longer trust the legitimacy of anything they read on the forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont care, i got off reddit as soon as I realize how manipulated it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this kind of thing is in the same category as fake protests, paid provocateurs, dishonest partisan media etc....... It fucks democracy up when you can't even trust that you're getting an organic public discourse. Hence the violation of freedom of speech
      </p>
      <p>
       And that applies across all political spectrums. Its not left vs right (even if thats what OP was on)

       Why was that contentious? I'm in agreement. But I think the fervency of the manipulation of the political discussion (as opposed to corporate marketing) really began late 2016. Before that I remember much more honest and organic discussion

       Anyone can look at voting patterns overall in the sub to see how it gets brigaded and/or botted. When people like peyote have three simultaneous front page posts with hundreds of upvotes, all from extremely dubious sources about information that's just torn apart in the comments, it's pretty clear those post upvotes aren't organic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same way anything remotely anti Trump can't make it out of new without being instantly mass downvoted, unless it's a story so big that people from all come here to join in the discussion and overvote the bots/brigaders.

       Im sure a lot of people will disagree, but truth be told the bigger problem is the people who brought the "shill" dismissal into our lives.  Scrolling past some propaganda with a billion upvotes isn't hard, whats hard is writing something to try and show someone new information and they just have the blinders on, "shill"

       No -- and by no, I mean that is not something you could logically derive from my post .... its a completely different idea, its unrelated.  My post has nothing to do with attempting to assign blame.  If you really care, I stilll blame the the literal bots and hired shills for the problem.  What Im saying is that we should make the problem worse than it already is.  The shill talk is a worse problem then just having vote spam, in my view.

       The only people who care about shill accusations are shills. If someone accused me of being a shill I wouldn't care because I'm not a shill. It's up to the audience to decide if a shill accusation is warranted

       But when you're downvoted into oblivion and as a result of constant negative karma cannot frequently post in places like this anymore you are effectively silenced.

       If you have something to say and you take the time and try to share that with someone else, and they just  "you're a shill" thats not just like "whatever".   It completely defeats the purpose of communication.

       By all accounts, it seems that the Deep State has started to move valuable assets from beneath the Clinton umbrella, so I firmly stand by the fact that her power is being vastly overestimated and simply used as a deflection against the various pro-Deep State actions the Trump administration has taken, including filling his entire staff with one of the largest international bank's in the world.

       Tunnel vision?  I supported neither candidate in the election, as the entire thing was a shit-show.  It was proven early on that Trump was not what his supporters had hoped for.

       There is no swamp being drained, just more water being dumped into the swamp.  I'm sorry he didn't do what he said he was going to do, a lot of people were hopeful, even myself included.  It's over, nothing is going to happen to Clinton.  And while Trump's chances of being impeached are very low, imagine President Pence yikes, he's not going to do any of what he said he was going to do.  The sooner you come to terms with it, the sooner you can move on.

       Dude i fucking hate trump and the entire establishment. Just saying you instantly started speaking of trump again like a lot of delusional people here. Clintons still have very much power. Very much connections to almost every powerful person in this world, plus probably billions of disposal money

       A reminder as well that Brock started his career by

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact much of the dirt you see to this day about the Clinton's Arkansas years was first made widely public by Brock's article in The American Spectator.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea if it's true, but the story I heard was he switched camps because some people on the right who did not like him outed him for being gay.

       Back in the old days, the method was for political groups to urge ordinary citizens to send letters to the editors at their local newspapers to be published. Of course, there were "suggested templates" for these letters. I'm sure this is probably still in play but it's nothing compared to the size and speed of messaging the internet offers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had friends who have worked in communications capacities for political parties (not PACs like Brock) so I'm familiar with crafted political messaging. I probably can't differentiate an employed shill from a rube but lurking in the political sub, I can definitely tell which remarks are borne from manipulative political messaging.

       Do you have any evidence that accounts are run by paid posters or is this guessing?

       And in the off chance that you are new to the internet yes there is evidence in the form of folks coming forward and ratting them out with pay stubs. The whole "nerd virgins" comment though I can't remember where it originated from, twitter? One of the chans recently managed to get a bunch of info off brocks server which allowed them to doxx a few of the nerd virgins..

       Why don't you just go look at what HRC paid CTR to do? It is public record. I'm surprised that anyone could be here and not know that, but everyone can't know everything. No one disputes that there are groups paid to shape political narratives on the internet.

       From what I understand it was to prepare materials and content for supporters. And I don't recall HRC paying for anything.

       No. Plenty of people accuse others of being shills and cannot seem to show that any US political group pays people to post.

       Lol getting down voted?  Been a member of this sub for many years.  This place is toast.  I’m totally correct and there is no evidence that suggests CTR was anything BUT this.  You can say it ended when CTR disbanded and I can’t prove it didn’t.  But they did this and it’s embarrassing public.

       My understanding is that it was called that because the idea was to counter blatantly false posts in the internet with fact-based responses. They also didn't hide that they were posting as "Correct the Record."

       I find it funny that a lot of the same users now referencing wikipedia think it's complete bullshit when it comes to the pizzagate article calling it debunked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, seeing as nobody is providing any evidence ("Do your own research!", usually means, "I've got nothing!"), I'll address your question:
      </p>
      <p>
       There were paid posters, but all the evidence I've seen points to them being upfront about who they were.

       As you can see, their operation wasn't exactly "sophisticated". I have yet to find any actual evidence of CTR related organizations posting covertly (pretending to be regular users). No where

       There are other articles, as well as interviews with former trolls, leaked documents, etc. You can search for "Putin troll army" if you want to learn more about online paid shills.

       I think a lot of it is a semi-organized campaign to discredit Trump criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       They say the election was rigged, but only to the extent that Trump lost the popular vote - the election being rigged never seems to bring into question his electoral college win.
      </p>
      <p>
       The polls showing his low approval rate are fake, because how could he have won if he was unpopular? When you point out that the popular vote aligned with the polls they revert to the saying the popular vote count is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       They constantly spam "inorganic" or ""organic"" (with the scare quotes) to discredit the popularity of Trump criticism on Reddit. At this point they don't even make an argument for why there wouldn't naturally be few Trump supporters on this site, they just spam the "inorganic" buzzword to drive it into your head by repetition.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then basically the multitude ways they call people shills. I love how this post goes out of it's way to only target liberal or anti-Trump groups, and then you get comments saying "these posts are always shill magnets". So, basically they're trying to create a situation where they call everyone that dislikes Trump a shill, and then if you push back against that it makes you a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a pretty obvious conspiracy to create an echo chamber, but for some people the only criteria for being "woke" is that you defend Trump and endlessly fixate on Clinton in the year 2018.

       They’re still claiming there were millions of illegal voters and that all polls are fake. I don’t understand how anyone thinks Trump is popular. Hell, I don’t even understand how he’s even rated at 30 percent.

       More than pay stubs and the server? One of the guys with a stub said he was paid to deal with pizzagate. Though he said he felt it was more about laundering money through art at the Pegasus museum than pimping kids to pedophiles. I think it is both. He had names and paperwork. Someone may be able to dig it up for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pizzagate shills are plain to see. It's fairly easy deduction. You either have an army of hundreds and hundreds of users who are really concerned about the image of one of the most powerful men in Washington. Or that very powerful man thinks he can throw money at his image problem. Pedo apologists aren't really a thing outside of the catholic church and that is just a netowrk of pedosadists covering each others ass.

       No, it doesn't have anything to do with the actual regulation of free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when people are continually harassed, blasted with downvotes, and ridiculed for having an opinion these paid weasels consider wrong think, a lot of people will either stop expressing those opinions, or start posting opinions that agree with the narrative just to get their fake internet points.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it is an interference with free speech, because they know the psychology of how it works.

       Correct the Record’s “Barrier Breakers” project boasts in a press release that it has already “addressed more than 5,000 people that have personally attacked Hillary Clinton on Twitter.” The PAC released this on Thursday.
      </p>
      <p>
       The PAC was created in May of last year when it was spun off from the American Bridge SuperPAC, which is run by longtime Hillary and Bill Clinton supporter David Brock. Brock also founded the left-wing media watchdog website Media Matters for America.

       There's one thing missing from that write-up: Evidence that CTR (or any related organization) was actually posting covertly. That is, pretending to be regular users, or "shills". There's nothing wrong with a media outreach organization posting online. In fact, that's pretty much their job. The issue is if they were pretending to be users not related to the organization.
       <em>
        This
       </em>
       is the crucial evidence that's missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were paid posters, but all the evidence I've seen points to them being upfront about who they were.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a quote
       <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000154-3082-d20b-a1fc-b3e3368b0000">
        directly from them
       </a>
       , as well as (most of) the accounts they are referring to:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The task force currently combats online political harassment, having already addressed more than 5,000 individuals who have personally attacked Secretary Clinton on Twitter.

       As you can see, their operation wasn't exactly a "sophisticated". I have yet to find any actual evidence of CTR related organizations posting covertly (pretending to be regular users). No where
       <em>
        near
       </em>
       the type/amount of evidence found of Putin's "troll army":

       There are other articles, as well as interviews with former trolls, leaked documents, etc. You can search for "Putin troll army" if you want to learn more about online paid shills.

       Believe what? I didn't exclude the possibility. I'm merely letting people know that no evidence of it has been presented. I'm completely open to it, however. In fact, I encourage you to post any evidence you have. Would make it a bit easier for readers to research the subject for themselves.

       This is the opinion of someone unrelated to the organization. I presented the actual accounts used (that is, direct primary evidence instead of opinion). You can see for yourself how they operate.

       I do recall one of the podesta emails containing a plan about creating a "robust echo chamber". One of the bullet points was literally "control the political discourse".
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/329671653/NYC-Meeting-2007-Final-Draft-4#from_embed">
        https://www.scribd.com/document/329671653/NYC-Meeting-2007-Final-Draft-4#from_embed
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Control the political discourse. So much effort over the past few years has been focused on better coordinating, strengthening, and developing progressive institutions and leaders. Now that this enhanced infrastructure is in place — grassroots organizing; multi-issue advocacy groups; think tanks; youth outreach; faith communities; micro-targeting outfits; the netroots and blogosphere — we need to better utilize these networks to drive the content of politics through a strong “echo chamber” and message delivery system”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And an earlier draft said this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Create a robust echo chamber with progressive messaging that spans from the opposition campaigns to outside groups, academic experts, and bloggers.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But in general though, it is pretty much standard for every major government/corporation to have shills with at least a modest-sized botnet to do damage control/promotion.

       I’d assume so.  I’d assume all political parties capable of doing this probably are to some extent, along with the various companies and special interests that want to push stuff.

       Anyway, I'm talking about active stalking- as in following people around to unrelated subs and harassing them, posting their usernames on unrelated drama subs linking them to false accusations and encouraging gang stalking.

       People disagreeing with your political narrative are not all paid, nor is it censorship. The "freedom of speech" is that the government can't censor speech, like um, perhaps trying to limit the publishing of an unflattering book...

       And how this sub has gotten so obsessed with party radicalism is troubling. We should all be pushing for ranked choice voting and dismantling of PACs. Arguing every media story is a waste of time and their happy diversion.

       It is difficult to tell the difference between useful idiots and shills. I just assume shill and treat them like useful idiot. That way I don't break any rules and since you can't prove it one way or another you just keep speaking to them. Shills rinse and repeat the same tactics. The topics are always the same. Clinton, Pizzagate, Trump.

       It's more than just seeing things differently. Shills use specific tactics like ad hominems and being intentionally divisive.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not so much the individual shills that are the problem though. It's the forum sliding, brigading, and vote manipulation that distract from useful conversations.

       Honestly I feel like there a lot of people on the internet that just have poor debating skills. Are there shills? Sure. There are groups for every organization that I'm certain are trying to sway opinions. However, I feel like on Reddit as a whole the mentality of "They disagree with me/us, they must be a shill" runs rampant and is rather unhealthy when it comes to honest debate.

       I look through a persons post history to determine if they are a shill. That tactic alone is used so commonly I could not use that as an identifier for shills. If I go through a persons account and they only post in certain subs like the Donald or politics and they do it all day then I assume they are a shill

       You obviously have an agenda, a bias and  refuse to acknowledge the hivemind. It's like you guys brigade the same tactic, while screaming about shills and sadly, I think you guys do it for free, often with alts. But if I point that out, I'm violating a rule, put in place by the questionable shift in moderation, that simultaneously happened when y'all overtook this ship anyways...

       I literally only ever get downvoted when I say anything critical of democrats or the Don 2.0 LARP.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get upvoted everytime I'm critical of Trump or the GOP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Because this sub is a hyperpartisan Democrat, hive mind echo chamber.

       I hate trump and have for decades, I've never voted Republican in my entire life, and I talk about how he and stone fucked third parties in the 2000 election all the time, they are some of my most upvoted comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't worry, I'm used to being called a Trump supporter by the hyperpartisan democrats who control discussion on this sub. Its a favortie tactic of yours. It works better for your LARP that you pretend everyone is against you even though all your opinions get showered in upvotes.

       Jill Stein. Johnson is too capitalist for my tastes and the green party was looking for 5% to get access to federal election funds. I knew my state was going full-blue, but there's no way I was voting for HRC or Trump. Bernie write-ins were not an option in my state, would have invalidated my vote on local issues and state reps

       So as a third-party supporter, can you provide me with a comment you've made in this sub promoting third parties?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you provide me with any evidence that you've ever been critical of democrats on this sub? Can you provide any evidence that this sub has been anything but friendly to your opinions?
      </p>
      <p>
       I regularly get voted into the -20s and -30s for criticism of democrats, or promotion of third parties. You got anything like that?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to believe you, since I'm a die hard supporter of third parties and voted Stein myself, but I'm not seeing it. I'm seeing a lot of "Trump sucks" and a lot of upvotes... plus a lot of "I get downvoted by Trump supporters all the time"

       You're free to scan my profile, but I did notice a lot of comments that were doubledigit downvotes on the day I submitted them are now neutral.  The most downvoted comment of mine in the past few days was about drag and 19 downvotes doesn't read as liberal love.

       I'm not still avidly following Jill since her election recount debacle, but I get my fair share of abuse for arguing against the GOP, Trump and Pizzagate. Oh, and the Christians and the alien believers. And I'm pro-choice on weed, but don't use it myself or feel it's necessary for enlightenment, so people "punish" me for that opinion, too.

       You also called everyone who disagreed with you homophobes and you also told Reddit, video game capital, that kids dressing in drag is a better hobby than a video game.

       That's why you got downvoted. Other than that, you haven't gone under -1 in the two weeks I looked at.

       Because identity politics aren't actually mainstream with liberals? It's more of a deviant, vocal fringe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, remember when you told me votes haven't mattered in a year for whatever reason? That's funny. That means those downvotes aren't accurate, right? Or were you full of it earlier?

       I saw plenty of highly upvoted comments. Some highly upvoted anti-trump comments. You get a lot of upvotes from this sub, in fact your most highly upvoted comments from this were from telling me I'm a Trump supporter who took over the sub! That makes perfect, logical sense, doesn't it?

       No, I'm using it perfectly well. You are role playing. You are playing pretend, like a little kid. Fantasy. I couldn't tell you what the reason is, but youre definitely lost in a fantasy. So lost, in fact, that when evidence is presented to you that contradicts your role play, you just sink into denial about it and create new fantasies in order to preserve the old one.

       I think the point is we need to be concerned about all of them (instead of the comments upthread defending this practice since it's not actually a 1st Amendment violation). If you're against those you should be against what these guys are doing.

       Cambridge Analytica got 5 million from Trump campaign and I'm pretty sure had an operating budget of 25 million at one point, which is more than CTR ever had.

       I disagree. This whole astroturfing story about CTR originated from a Daily Beast writer who misread their press release. Now anytime a democratic funded group comes out, it's assumed to be a shill factory based on

       Some kind of secret, proprietary profiling system for targeted ads, from what I can tell. If you think that translates to a massive Reddit astroturfing effort, I don't know what tyo tell you. I don't see it, though.

       Unless I'm mistaken (in which case I would welcome being corrected, with proper sources and evidence) - there is just as much evidence that CTR was astroturfing Reddit as there is proof Cambridge Analytica. I think this is what you're saying, right? Because this is not a sentiment most people here seem to agree with.

       Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Shilling is basically impossible to prove, and neither organisation has been linked to activity on Reddit.

       Thanks for clarifying. I agree completely, along with the idea that there might be some sort of shilling/targeted posting happening but it's not the pure "CTR pays people to talk about how great Clinton is on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       This is the most likely sentiment all along. You can go into the smallest of the Trump satellite subs, with subscribers below 10,000, and people are complaining that Correct the Record is targeting their posts for downvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be SHOCKED if CTR or Cambridge Analytica cared that much about Reddit, and especially the smaller subs like r/conspiracy or really anything other than defaults. If they were smart they would focus on Facebook and Twitter, where you can reach a real audience.

       The thing is, Reddit gets millions of unique page views per month. Millions of uniques. That's huge marketing opportunity, right there. No competent business would ignore that. I remember before they started hiding metrics on this sub, I checked and this sub got 40,000+ uniques per month. That's almost half a million per year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, where it differs from the popular sentiment is that while Reddit is, from a business efficiency standpoint, being astroturfed... it's most likely a very small group of maybe 3 or 4 people all managing hundreds of accounts. It would be easy to compartmentalize and cheap.

       OK I should clarify. I would be shocked if they exist in the way people here seem to think they do --- with giant teams of people patrolling every r/conspiracy thread to downvote right wingers. I agree that it's probably in post manipulation.
      </p>

       I work in SEO myself and I've seen campaigns where their target is to get to the front page of Reddit, and they do it. Pretty easily.

       Like I said, it's probably 3 people in a room. They don't need to patrol, programs can be written to parse keywords.

       If you work in SEO then surely you know how easy it is to write or have written programs that allow you to automate nearly everything, including keyword targeting.

       Going to have to start sorting this sub's comments by Most Controversial and posts by New. It's been absurd the past few days. I've noticed many times in this sub when there is some "spicy Drumpf story" they are pushing in the MSM, suddenly the Reddit subs (not just this one) have an insane frequency of active users who just happen to be going along with that narrative. That's how I know it's coordinated. I've seen similar situations like this happen like when Bernie lost to Hillary in the r/sandersforpresident sub and this sub (and all of Reddit for that matter) when this stupid dossier came out in the first place. I gotta say, whoever is really pulling the strings in the media, whether it is Soros/Brock/whoever is really scared of the President and wants him gone. I've never seen such an effort to impeach a President.

       Obviously. Everyone has paid shills nowadays. Monsanto, pharmaceutical companies, there are shills for movies, shills for products, they're everywhere.

       I think a lot of it is a semi-organized campaign to discredit Trump criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       They say the election was rigged, but only to the extent that Trump lost the popular vote - the election being rigged never seems to bring into question his electoral college win.
      </p>
      <p>
       The polls showing his low approval rate are fake, because how could he have won if he was unpopular? When you point out that the popular vote aligned with the polls they revert to the saying the popular vote count is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       They constantly spam "inorganic" or ""organic"" (with the scare quotes) to discredit the popularity of Trump criticism on Reddit. At this point they don't even make an argument for why there wouldn't naturally be few Trump supporters on this site, they just spam the "inorganic" buzzword to drive it into your head by repetition.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then basically the multitude ways they call people shills. I love how this post goes out of it's way to only target liberal or anti-Trump groups, and then you get comments saying "these posts are always shill magnets". So, basically they're trying to create a situation where they call everyone that dislikes Trump a shill, and then if you push back against that it makes you a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a pretty obvious conspiracy to create an echo chamber, but for some people the only criteria for being "woke" is that you defend Trump and endlessly fixate on Clinton in the year 2018.

       Some kind of secret, proprietary profiling system for targeted ads, from what I can tell. If you think that translates to a massive Reddit astroturfing effort, I don't know what tyo tell you. I don't see it, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no evidence for either of them doing astroturfing on Reddit, btw

       I disagree. This whole astroturfing story about CTR originated from a Daily Beast writer who misread their press release. Now anytime a democratic funded group comes out, it's assumed to be a shill factory based on
