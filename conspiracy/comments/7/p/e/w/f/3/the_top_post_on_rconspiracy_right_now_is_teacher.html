       Could there be vote manipulation going on here to boost certain topics to the top of the page?
       <strong>
        Nearly a 10,000 point difference

       between the top upvoted post and the second most top upvoted post? -

       I'm not sure how nearly 9,892 r/conspirists evaporated between the top post and the second top post?

      <p>
       Does anyone remember how many members there are in the National Education Association, the NEA which represents teachers?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh wait, it's just here,

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The National Education Association (NEA) is the largest professional interest group in the United States.[2]
       </p>
       <p>
        At the national level, the NEA lobbies the United States Congress and federal agencies and is active in the nominating process for Democratic candidates.[11] From 1989 through the 2014 election cycle, the NEA spent over $92 million on political campaign contributions, 97% of which went to Democrats.[12]

       To the top of videos as you so observantly mentioned, to the front page of r/all, and oh it surfaced here as well with 10k upvotes,  followed by a thread with +267.
      </p>
      <p>
       Totally organic. America's teachers are up in the middle of the night upvoting reddit threads to the tune 10,000 on r/conspiracy just because.

       IMO it's as more about reddit manipulation than it is about the topic or article submission.

       If it gets a couple thousand here at #1 and then hits r/all that discrepancy is accounted for. There's a difference on post rankings and how much exposure the #1 slot gets.

       No, because I feel like if it was, then that possibly reflects poorly on democrat, dark-money interest groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, as we all know, democrats dont engage in any kind of advertising or spending on targeted ads... they never do anything like that. Only the GOP does.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, no, I think if someone insinuated that the Democrats used money in any way shape or form to influence voters, that would be blasphemy against this sub's hyperpartisan controllers.

       If you have a quick look at a random selection of people commenting on the post, the majority of them are not users that frequently comment or post on conspiracy. It’s likely that it grabbed the attention of a lot of people on r/all. I don’t think its a conspiracy

       No, they definitely do. I usually browse all on mobile instead of my subscribed list and I occasionally see a conspiracy post. What I don't see are all of the small subs I subscribe to though so I need to switch back to just my subscriptions occasionally.

       I agree the "choosen" PR articles can make it there.

       However there is an honest and verifiable pattern of users posts being suddenly opposed prior to moving into the @/all realm.

       So, surely there is a significant system of exploitation which is obviously at an administrative level on this site. We see only, what they ultimately want us to see.

       The collusion is easy to see, and it's more then likely an intelligence sector in the UK, such as /Jtrig  participating in most the manipulating of our forum.

       I've seen my upvotes disappear on threads and comments before. I'll go through and upvote a bunch of comments, and then later I'll go back and check the thread and some of my upvotes will be gone. It happens most often on controversial threads and controversial comments. I actually see it quite often. And I've only seen it in conspiracy-related subs.

       I notice that too. They often get "reset" to like 1 upvote, giving the impression that nobody is reading my comments, when in reality they're getting upvotes that are cancelled by downvotes. That's why turning on the "mark controversial comments" option is very important.

       The Net Neutrality threads in the past which were, oddly enough,
       <em>
        not a conspiracy.
       </em>
       Just like the article in question about the teachers are
       <em>
        not a conspiracy
       </em>
       unless you happen to subscribe to a cultural Marxist's worldview.

       Just a couple weeks back one of those "this is my senator" net neutrality
       <em>
        images
       </em>
       got upvoted so highly it's now the second highest post of all time for this sub. And those images were upvoted in scores of subreddits, some with less than 1,000 subscribers.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't even have to be that blatant, you don't need 20K shill/bot votes to get something to the top, just a couple hundred to get it the /hot list where organics will take over and do the rest. There have been plenty of posts and videos about how easy it is to manipulate reddit's voting mechanism, even by a single person.

       Ironically I've been downvoted for asking about instances of vote manipulation. Anyway, look. I'm starting to believe this. I was researching this crypto b.s. ponzi scheme called cryptohuge and instead came across this subreddit called ParagonCoin. So there was a post calling it a scam and that their comments were being deleted whenever they questioned the company. Then one guy comments about how their subreddit seems to be flooded with bots made from old abandoned reddit accounts. So I head over to their subreddit and click on a few redditors who post there frequently and, in my opinion, all of their comments seem very short and "bot-like". Most of the comments aren't personal or more than 5 words. I might be wrong, but head on over to that subreddit and check for yourself. If this bot b.s. is true, then they could be responsible for vote manipulation and we could be persuaded into seeing posts that are advertised. Maybe I have my tin foil hat on too tight but, have you noticed how some high upvoted posts of pictures are kind of subtle advertisements anyway? Disney, Goodwill, this FCC thing, star wars, Nike, Apple...

       I believe vote manipulation occurs, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was organic in this case. That video got A LOT of attention outside conspiracy circles and it is the type of thing that people, generally, will be in total agreement that it was outrageous.

       Teachers not getting a raise isn't a fucking conspiracy, either. That's what gets me about this shit. It's just thinly veiled
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       shitposting. Is it shitty that teachers didn't get a raise? Sure. But conspiracy? No, not at all. You can turn literally any leftist political issue into a conspiracy using the same logic people use to justify getting stories like the teacher shit to the front page. For example: I could argue that the "gender pay gap" is a conspiracy using the
       <em>
        exact same logic used to justify the teacher article
       </em>
       and plaster it all over the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty much
       <strong>
        any
       </strong>
       political issue the modern left cares about can be framed as a conspiracy. That is exactly what you are seeing go on in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . This is because, frankly, Marxism, Cultural Marxism and associated narratives on economics are themselves essentially conspiracy theories which presuppose wage inequality (among other things) are the result of what amounts to a conspiracy on the part of the rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       The logical contortions that allow leftists to paint every single issue in terms of victim/oppressor
       <em>
        are very similar to how conspiracy theorists think of conspiracies.
       </em>
       "White men are the root of all of society's problems" is not really that different from "globalist bankers are suppressing the middle class." That
       <strong>
        doesn't mean it belongs on
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        .

       At least, not in my opinion.

       Couldn't have said it any better.  there's no discussion on it regarding a conspiracy.  Its just a case of corruption and likely some missing information on why the person was arrested beyond disagreeing.  Upvoted by shills and pushing a message.

       You can use the same logical games people use to justify the teacher article to justify
       <em>
        literally any
       </em>
       political issue on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . It's a huge problem here and I think the mods need to address it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, if I as a right winger wanted to get one of my pet issues to the front page, it would be trivially easy to reframe the issue as a conspiracy. For example: "Illegal immigration is a conspiracy to disenfranchise Republican voters," "High taxes are a conspiracy to rob the middle class of its wealth and redistribute it to Democrat voters," "Global warming is a conspiracy designed to allow the government greater authority over corporations."
      </p>
      <p>
       ANYTHING can be a conspiracy when you frame it in certain terms. I think some clarification is needed from the mod team on what is a conspiracy, and more importantly, what isn't.

       Of the 28 million they spent last year, 24 million was "soft money", or "party-building" money that is
       <em>
        completely unregulated
       </em>
       .

       The NEA gave the bulk of its spending, 16 million, to it's super PAC, NEA advocacy fund. So let's check that out.
      </p>
      <p>
       First thing you notice is that they spent 0 dollars on federal candidates. Soft money, unregulated, easy to obfuscate.

       So what did they spend that 16 million on? Well, top of their recipients list is "Waterfront Strategies", at 3.36 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is that?

       You tell me. They reported $188.8 million in 2016 from various Democrat-related PACs (all soft money, all unregulated by FEC)
      </p>

       So what is Waterfront Strategies and what does it do? People dont really know, other than that it's a secretive branch of

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Waterfront Strategies is a media buying firm that serves primarily Democratic-aligned super PACs and nonprofits.  The firm was the preferred vendor for Majority PAC and House Majority PAC — the super PACs aimed at securing Democratic seats in the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Waterfront billed more than $81 million for political ad buys for Citizens United-related groups in the 2012 election, yet very little information about the firm is publicly available.
       </p>

       Worth noting that while they took in $92 million in 2012, they took $188.8 mil inbuys.

       The NEA's PAC gave the bulk of its 2016 individual expenditures to a shadowy media firm that appears to operate like Cambridge Analytica; doing sketchy targeted advertising, is part of a marketing firm which does data collection, and hides it's activities as well as it's sources of funding.

       Ok, let's compare. The pharmaceutical industry, by far the largest lobby in the US, last year spent 246 million
       <em>
        for the entire industry combined
       </em>
       .... and that's regulated money, unlike the soft money were talking here.

      <p>
       How's that drop in the bucket looking?
