        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Reddit will die. It is already completely unreliable due to biased mods, censorship, and manipulation. An anonymous up/down voting system will always be subject to manipulation. A new platform using cryptocurrency as a means of voting would be much better. Blockchain does not censor. I know Steemit is doing this, which i love, but is is still so new and working out the kinks. I think a platform like this will overtake Reddit one day. Any other ideas? The real users of this sub are in dire need of another platform.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree, the struggle for freedom hasn&#39;t been solved by the blockchain.  Blockchain currency is useless in real life in as much as most (maybe all, too lazy too search) governments don&#39;t accept cryptocurrency as a medium of tax payment.  i&#39;m not against crypto, it&#39;s just an investment (and honestly seemingly a Ponzi scheme), I think it signals a disinterest in fiat and may ultimately lead to a dollar backed by a basket of goods</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you’re missing the point. Blockchain isn’t just for money. The system can use it for data storage, processing speeds, packet switching, and just about anything you can imagine in the realm of data. Social Media built on blockchain would circumvent internet regulation, government regulation. And with the power of AI it could work autonomously in a decentralized way.</p>

<p>Even if blockchain crypto becomes devalued, protocols like IOTA’s can utilize the same concept without a need for miners, therefor without a need for crytpotcurrency to attract blockchain miners.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oke, that&#39;s true, but the reallife implications are not yet fully in order. Your posts on social media can be a problem when appying for a job now, but this is still in your own hand, you can prevent people from seeing some stuff you like to keep hidden.</p>

<p>How about a society in wich you may not apply for certain jobs becouse of your view on reality as posted on Reddit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, were all monitored here by isp. There is absolutely 0 anonymity-</p>

<p>Users shouldn&#39;t post anything that defies their social character in that regard. </p>

<p>However in terms of astroturfing and damage control PR utilities, shills and biased corporate interests. An open ledger/  non anonymous usership would greatly discourage these parties. </p>

<p>Setting a cap limit per isp. Blacklisting proxies accounts, and openly sharing the tagging system between users would nearly mitigate all biased attacks on the network. </p>

<p>Reddit wouldn&#39;t do this however. Their profit model relies on giving exposure to these PR facets-</p>

<p>It&#39;s nothing more then a PR company, and advertising platform which has no intent to diminish it&#39;s and directives. </p>

<p>Hence the articles title. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s not pretend that they haven&#39;t designed the site to do exactly what they wanted it to do. Taking issues like new years in Germany to a blacklisted state because money was ultimately more important to the mods of /news then morality and civic obligations ever were. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The tech goes way above my head, but the social implications i do get.</p>

<p>Many do know we are already monitord, but it is still not yet legal to use all info and tech they have.
We still have some controll now, this will change if people can&#39;t be anonimous anymore and all they do is monitord and can have deep impact on their life.</p>

<p>It will change society and humanity if we are all under constant obeservation AND we know, accept and let action be taken by people, more propably AI, monitoring them.</p>

<p>Self censure is even stronger then censure, see what the political correctness has brought us...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t this depend on what users want out of Reddit?  I mean, what exactly do you expect Reddit to be used <em>for</em>? </p>

<p>Do you think users are the consumers, or do you realize users are the product?  </p>

<p>Nobody is going to create and support a content-sharing site that can&#39;t be monetized in some way.  And any site that supports &quot;user&quot;-created-content is ripe for manipulation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is not a homogeneous entity. It&#39;s a loose group of communities with a common login.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like how shit is moderated on a subreddit, you do exactly what we&#39;ve been doing since the days of Usenet - create your own community with blackjack and hookers. People will switch in a heartbeat to a better community if they can find one. There&#39;s no cost to switch, after all.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as people find out pretty quickly, running an online community is <em>fucking hard</em>.</p>

<p>Fuck this place. All it does is waste my time and annoy me with idiotic recycled comments for fake internet points. The downvote button is nothing but an &quot;I disagree, fuck you&quot; button for most.</p>
