       Reddit will die. It is already completely unreliable due to biased mods, censorship, and manipulation. An anonymous up/down voting system will always be subject to manipulation. A new platform using cryptocurrency as a means of voting would be much better. Blockchain does not censor. I know Steemit is doing this, which i love, but is is still so new and working out the kinks. I think a platform like this will overtake Reddit one day. Any other ideas? The real users of this sub are in dire need of another platform.

       Dude, reddit is a message board owned by the biggest magazine company in the world.  Their goal has always been to create a "magazine" that still sells ads but doesn't pay content creators.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.

       I like to think we are in a technological revolution. Mainly one that values privacy and free speech which have come under assault in the current technological age. It's going to be much harder to corrupt a decentralized platform running on blockchain technology.

       I disagree, the struggle for freedom hasn't been solved by the blockchain.  Blockchain currency is useless in real life in as much as most (maybe all, too lazy too search) governments don't accept cryptocurrency as a medium of tax payment.  i'm not against crypto, it's just an investment (and honestly seemingly a Ponzi scheme), I think it signals a disinterest in fiat and may ultimately lead to a dollar backed by a basket of goods

       I think you’re missing the point. Blockchain isn’t just for money. The system can use it for data storage, processing speeds, packet switching, and just about anything you can imagine in the realm of data. Social Media built on blockchain would circumvent internet regulation, government regulation. And with the power of AI it could work autonomously in a decentralized way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if blockchain crypto becomes devalued, protocols like IOTA’s can utilize the same concept without a need for miners, therefor without a need for crytpotcurrency to attract blockchain miners.

       Oke, that's true, but the reallife implications are not yet fully in order. Your posts on social media can be a problem when appying for a job now, but this is still in your own hand, you can prevent people from seeing some stuff you like to keep hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about a society in wich you may not apply for certain jobs becouse of your view on reality as posted on Reddit?

       Honestly, were all monitored here by isp. There is absolutely 0 anonymity-
      </p>
      <p>
       Users shouldn't post anything that defies their social character in that regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       However in terms of astroturfing and damage control PR utilities, shills and biased corporate interests. An open ledger/  non anonymous usership would greatly discourage these parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Setting a cap limit per isp. Blacklisting proxies accounts, and openly sharing the tagging system between users would nearly mitigate all biased attacks on the network.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit wouldn't do this however. Their profit model relies on giving exposure to these PR facets-
      </p>
      <p>
       It's nothing more then a PR company, and advertising platform which has no intent to diminish it's and directives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence the articles title.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's not pretend that they haven't designed the site to do exactly what they wanted it to do. Taking issues like new years in Germany to a blacklisted state because money was ultimately more important to the mods of /news then morality and civic obligations ever were.

       The tech goes way above my head, but the social implications i do get.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many do know we are already monitord, but it is still not yet legal to use all info and tech they have.
We still have some controll now, this will change if people can't be anonimous anymore and all they do is monitord and can have deep impact on their life.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will change society and humanity if we are all under constant obeservation AND we know, accept and let action be taken by people, more propably AI, monitoring them.

       Its the story of everything.  If you dont play ball they hammer your company into bankruptcy by withholding ad revenue (see myspace).  MySpace was a financial joke but facebook is same thing with your real name and its magically worth half a trillion...like ok..nothing to see here.

       Users will be able to exchange with each other. Quality posters will reward other quality posters. You'll need a large enough user base for it to work. This sub is over 500,000 people. So let's say 50,000 people gives $0.05 worth of said token - that's $2,500 for one post. It could become pretty expensive to continue trying to manipulate. There are still some problems here and I realize that example is pretty extreme,  but it's something to think about.

       You don't pay, that's not how it works at steemit, more like you stack your reputation with your vote that others will vote like you after you. That pays you. If you vote wrong or get down voted to oblivion then you just don't get paid nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But at Reddit you don't get paid nothing both ways so really steemit is much better

       I think the idea if a free exchange of ideas over the internet is over.  Security is impossible, bots have taken over political discourse, fake followers, paid trolls, deliberate mis-information, pay walls, and unrelenting ads.  Additionally, the governments of the world are restricting access and are using it as a massive data collection sceme.

       There's no way to escape the reality of the broader situation that we all have to contend with whether it's here, there, or anywhere else like just outside our front door in the real world we have to contend with every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we can do is grab any opportunity to get a few licks of our own in against it. To make contact and offer whatever solidarity we can muster for others who may know or suspect but are afraid and feel that they are all alone in thinking and feeling the same way. Doesn't have to be direct either... casually sarcastic or ironic with wink will do.

       Reddit will die for the folks that want to hide in the shadows, for the racists that have been coming here to recruit since the beginning, right wingers that hate liberals, and for the trolls that love anonymity to shit up the things they don't like.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all the claims of shareblue this or CTR that, in all my years the ones doing the most shilling are the turds from stromfront, the right wingers that hate liberal forums (see: Democratic Underground) and the astroturfers with specific policy moves.

       You're the captain of the ship of your own making. Your biased assery is why reddit has become shit. Being in this sub, I'd expect more free thought. You relish in your claims. As for attacking other users, c'mon now. Everyone knows how people like you behave. Based on your initial response to my reply, even you do. Don't be a bitch now, ride your dinghy to the bottom of the sea.

       Reddit is completely compromised by PR groups promoting agendas as well as information control.​ Trying to fool the observer as if it's all real and organic, all the while playing tag team (both sides) of any discussions,  in order to have complete comment control on any subject matter, it's so obvious a blind man can see it.

       I get how you feel, but I think we should try to persevere.  I've got six years of negative karma from smart ass comments to defend.  I'd rather see us try to make a stand.  I've also spent six years watching threads exactly like this one suggesting that the shills are too strong and how we should all run away.  This is nothing new, if we bolt we'll just be further divided.

       This system is already flooded with PR firms and botting, funded by special interests with deep pockets.

       Paying to vote will drown out regular users.

       Can I just have a shout out to the smaller subreddits?  Those are, for me, the heart of this site.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, I'm a photographer, and I'm getting back into film photography, so r/analog has been a godsend,
       <a href="/r/AnalogCommunity">
        /r/AnalogCommunity
       </a>
       as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       from subreddits about cooking, or exercise, or local subreddits covering local cities and towns, I still think, under the surface of the "big" subs, there is still good to be found here.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, that's just me and I might be wrong.

       Exactly. Reddit will continue to be unique and odd because of hobby/interest subs that have human interactions and aren't fueled by fame/competition/branding. r/crochet happyhooker4lyfe!

       Doesn't this depend on what users want out of Reddit?  I mean, what exactly do you expect Reddit to be used
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think users are the consumers, or do you realize users are the product?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody is going to create and support a content-sharing site that can't be monetized in some way.  And any site that supports "user"-created-content is ripe for manipulation.

       Reddit is not a homogeneous entity. It's a loose group of communities with a common login.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't like how shit is moderated on a subreddit, you do exactly what we've been doing since the days of Usenet - create your own community with blackjack and hookers. People will switch in a heartbeat to a better community if they can find one. There's no cost to switch, after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, as people find out pretty quickly, running an online community is
       <em>
        fucking hard
       </em>

       Fuck this place. All it does is waste my time and annoy me with idiotic recycled comments for fake internet points. The downvote button is nothing but an "I disagree, fuck you" button for most.
