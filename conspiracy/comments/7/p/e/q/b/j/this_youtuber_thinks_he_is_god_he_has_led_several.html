    <div class="md"><p>SS: I think flat earth is a lot bigger than we realize. I’ll admit, I was def interested in flat earth back in 2015 when it got going. I met this guy at a bar I worked at, former military dude; told me about it. We met and I was excited cause he was the only other person at the job who knew about conspiracies; then, suddenly he dropped it on me: </p>

<p>“Well, kid, I mean, you know it’s flat.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>I was shocked</p>

<p>“Earth. It’s flat.”</p>

<p>I spent the next 10 days staying up all night trying to prove to myself that it wasn’t true, and still to this day am left with the “flat earth hangover”. That, combined with psychedelic drugs only furthered my delving into black magick and occult mysteries. </p>

<p>He he is again, claiming to be god.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NTNlvDOBdHE">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NTNlvDOBdHE</a></p>

<p>Here’s him literally conjuring up demons by shedding his own blood on camera. </p>

<p>I tried the whole “blood over intent” thing he started; turns out it goes way back. Met the girl I was supposed to marry because of it I think, had sex Iike 8 times a day for 18 months. Best time ever, all because I shed my own blood a couple times.</p>

<p>I’m telling you there’s something really really weird about this stuff. </p>

<p>Flat earth is more than just a hoax/real/fake. It’s some kind of spell. I’m of the camp that we live in a simulation. So, technically both could be real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He also mentions believing in simulation theory, which if true; can theoretically have a world that is not only flat, but also have reptiles from a different planet.

    <div class="md"><p>Basically I started watching these videos, and I did <em>my own</em> blood over intent like he said, and I met theeeee hottest chick ever and started banging like day three. She moved from a different state that week. Just HAPPENED TO get a job a my job, and her grandparents who she’s moved in with just HAPPENED to live on my block. Was gonna marry her, but it didn’t work out. Long story. </p>

<p>Anyway, I was just like brainwashed for awhile and it’s creey, people on YouTube will slice open their hand and act like this quasiluminous guy is god. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was supposed to make a bot roll a 100 sided die I think. I figured if you did a blood sacrifice you could beat my roll? Since the hot girl thing seemed a bit random I thought maybe it will work on other “random” stuff!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I was actively doing rituals asking the universe to send me a dime. </p>

<p>Like 3-4 months of no weed, alcohol and working out, several spells, followed by blood over intent. </p>

<p>When it finally happened it was so obvious that this girl was just dropped in my lap. </p>

<p>We were in an environment with lots of sexual energy and me and my roommate were single. I’m like a solid 7-8, he’s a 10 and she didn’t even give him a second glance. Nor any of the other suitors. </p>

<p>She practically undressed me with her eyes the first time I made eye contact and I was like “jackpot”</p>

<p>If you&#39;re thinking about using this <em>dark magic</em> (If it&#39;s all real) for personal gain, surely you must&#39;ve seen enough Hollywood movies and series to realize there&#39;s going to be a price to pay.</p>

<p>If angels, demons, Gods/demigods exist alongside humans, u can be sure we&#39;re the ones who keep getting fucked over, so don&#39;t do it.</p>

<p>One example that you can&#39;t explain or refute…which is why I chose it. I have many more but I won&#39;t waste my time with them. No point discussing facts with a &quot;believer&quot;.</p>

<p>Your &quot;research&quot; involves latching on to things that support your beliefs and tossing aside anything that doesn&#39;t jibe with those beliefs. That is not research. It&#39;s confirmation bias.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watching youtube videos of shysters telling you what you want to hear isn&#39;t research. I&#39;m sure hearing someone tell you that highway and railway engineers don&#39;t factor in a constant, measurable curve into their designs confirms your beliefs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately your desire to have those beliefs supported causes you to lose sight of the fact that the Earth is not a perfectly smooth, perfectly spherical globe. The Earth has hills and valleys…rises and falls…and because of that there can never be a constant and measurable curve which is why we have these professions called surveyors.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen the &quot;evidence&quot; you research…and anyone with an open and functioning mind can see right through it.</p>

<p>Nice try though.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear that sometime between then and now you lost your grip on the scientific method.</p>

<p>Seriously? Do you know what volcanoes are? They aren&#39;t your biblical lake of fire…or can you prove they are? It would have to be some pretty impressive proof to overturn the accepted narrative that they are conduits to Earth&#39;s molten core that resides at the centre of our globe.</p>

<p>I’m with ya, it’s weird. I refuse to sell out to any theories. Until I’m on another planet myself or I see an ice wall for myself I’m gonna just pretend like everyone’s guessing. </p>

<p>I wasn’t making fun of you, I was making fun of people who <em>would</em> make fun of you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can literally <em>see</em> that heliocentrism is true <em>with your own eyes</em> by watching Venus with a telescope for a few years. Pay close attention to the position of the Sun relative to the <strong>globe</strong> of Venus and you can logically deduce, without a shadow of a doubt, that the Earth and Venus roughly travel in concentric circles about the Sun.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m all for keeping an open mind and reconsidering basic notions about the world, really, but this flat Earth stuff was intentionally propagated by the CIA as an experiment to discredit conspiracy communities. I honestly have a hard time believing that you believe everything you are saying here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s nice. I&#39;m not interested in volcano&#39;s. I&#39;m sure you could look into it yourself. I&#39;m also fairly certain that the current explanation is wrong. Since everything else was lies too.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t change the earth being flat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow one example. I&#39;m seriously researching bigger and better things. If you&#39;re interested look into it, if not, don&#39;t.</p>
