       After hearing an old TLC song, and Wiki'ing and digging through information regarding her death, I found the following, in order, and after revisiting them given information regarding Haiti and tactics used in third world countries. See the TLDR, copy/pasting for a readable map that I took.

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Lopes">
        Lisa Lopes
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Roughly two weeks before her own death, Lopes was a passenger in a traffic accident that resulted in the death of a 10-year-old Honduran boy.[5] As reported in Philadelphia Weekly, "It is commonplace for people to walk the roads that wind through Honduras, and it's often difficult to see pedestrians." The boy, Bayron Isaul Fuentes Lopez, was following behind his brothers and sisters when he stepped off the median strip and was struck by a van driven by Stephanie, Lopes' personal assistant. Lopes' party stopped and loaded the boy into the car, and Lopes "cradled the dying boy's bleeding head in her arms" while "someone gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as they rushed him to a nearby hospital."[46] He died the next day. Lopes paid approximately $3,700 for his medical expenses and funeral,[5] and she gave the family around $925 for any extra costs, although it was apparently agreed upon by the authorities and the boy's family that his death was an "unforeseeable tragedy" and no blame was placed on the driver of the van or Lopes.[46] In the documentary The Last Days of Left Eye, Lopes is shown choosing a casket for the child from a local funeral home. Earlier in the documentary, Lopes mentioned that she felt the presence of a "spirit" following her, and was struck by the fact that the child killed in the accident shared a similar last name, even thinking that the spirit may have made a mistake by taking his life instead of hers.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        On April 25, 2002, in La Ceiba, Honduras, while driving a rented Mitsubishi Montero SUV, Lopes swerved slightly to avoid a truck (it is not clear if the truck was slow moving or stationary) then immediately to the right as she tried to avoid an oncoming car. The vehicle rolled several times after hitting two trees, throwing Lopes and three others out of the windows, and finally coming to rest in a ditch at the side of the road. Lopes died instantly of neck injuries and severe head trauma, and was the only person fatally injured in the accident. She was 30 years old. A camera man in the front passenger seat was videotaping at the time, so the last seconds leading up to the swerve that resulted in the fatal accident were recorded on video. Her sister Reigndrop Lopes was in the vehicle and survived the collision.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        A documentary showing the final 27 days of Lopes' life, titled The Last Days of Left Eye, premiered at the Atlanta Film Festival in April 2007, for an audience that included many of Lopes' contemporaries, including Monica, Ronnie DeVoe, 112, Big Boi, India.Arie, and CeeLo Green.[41][52] VH1 and VH1 Soul broadcast the documentary on May 19, 2007. Much of the footage was shot with a hand-held camera, often in the form of diary entries filmed by Lopes while on a 30-day spiritual retreat in Honduras with sister Reigndrop, brother Ronald and members of the R&amp;B group Egypt.[53] In these entries, she reflected on her personal life and career. A calmer side of her personality was on display, showing interests in numerology and yoga.[43] She was in the process of setting up an educational center for Honduran children on 80 acres (32 ha) of land she owned called CAMP YAC, as well as another center called CREATIVE CASTLE.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        In 2003, shortly after Lopes' death, her family started the Lisa Lopes Foundation, a charitable group dedicated to providing neglected and abandoned youth with the resources necessary to increase their quality of life.[55] Her spiritual motto was the one that used for her foundation: "Energy never dies... it just transforms." Her foundation went into various underdeveloped villages and gave away brand new clothes to needy children and their families. In August 2007, the foundation hosted a charity auction, selling items donated by celebrities. It raised approximately $5,000 for the Hogar de Amor ("Home of Love"), an orphanage in Honduras.[55] In 2012, the foundation began hosting an annual music festival, known as "Left Eye Music Fest", in Decatur, Georgia.

       Well... So my first question, was what was Honduras like at the time, and whether or not it included the same players that swooped into poor countries and essentially ransack them, AKA the Clinton Cabal. Which led me

        In 1998, Hurricane Mitch caused massive and widespread destruction. Honduran President Carlos Roberto Flores said that fifty years of progress in the country had been reversed. Mitch destroyed about 70% of the country's crops and an estimated 70–80% of the transportation infrastructure, including nearly all bridges and secondary roads. Across Honduras 33,000 houses were destroyed, and an additional 50,000 damaged. Some 5,000 people killed, and 12,000 more injured. Total losses were estimated at $3 billion USD.[44]

        The 2008 Honduran floods were severe and damaged or destroyed around half of the roads as a result.[45]

       <em>
        In 2009, a constitutional crisis resulted when power transferred in a coup from the president to the head of Congress. The Organization of American States (OAS) suspended Honduras because it did not feel its government was legitimate.[46][47]
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Countries around the world, the OAS, and the United Nations[48] formally and unanimously condemned the action as a coup d'état, refusing to recognize the de facto government, even though the lawyers consulted by the Library of Congress submitted to the United States Congress an opinion that declared the coup legal.[48][49][50] The Honduran Supreme Court also ruled that the proceedings had been legal. The government that followed the de facto government established a truth and reconciliation commission, Comisión de la Verdad y Reconciliación, which after more than a year of research and debate concluded that the ousting had been a coup d'état, and illegal in the commission's opinion.

       You've gotta be fucking kidding me... Well, let's go straight to this 2008 coup...
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        In June 2009 a coup d'état ousted President Manuel Zelaya; he was taken in a military aircraft to neighboring Costa Rica. The General Assembly of the United Nations voted to denounce the coup and called for the restoration of Zelaya. Several Latin American nations including Mexico temporarily severed diplomatic relations with Honduras. In July 2010, full diplomatic relations were once again re-established with Mexico.[60] The United States sent out mixed messages after the coup; Obama called the ouster a coup and expressed support for Zelaya's return to power. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, advised by John Negroponte, the former Reagan-era to Honduras implicated in the Iran-Contra affair, refrained from expressing support.[61] She has since explained that the US would have had to cut aid if it called Zelaya's ouster a military coup, although the US has a record of ignoring these events when it chooses.[62] Zelaya had expressed an interest in Hugo Chávez' Bolivarian Alliance for Peoples of our America (ALBA), and had actually joined in 2008. After the 2009 coup, Honduras withdrew its membership.

       Now this is honestly where it started to get downright suspicious. You'll see the following
       <a href="https://www.snopes.com/music/artists/lopes.asp">
        Snopes article

       , and it has more inconsistencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stating:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Foul play had no part in Lisa Lopes’ death; her demise was the result of her recklessness and bad driving. Speeding on a Honduran highway in an SUV containing nine people, she had been attempting to pass a car when a truck approached from the other lane, forcing her to veer sharply to the left. The Mitsubishi Montero she was driving struck two trees and flipped over several times. None of the eight passengers were seriously injured, but Lopes was killed instantly in the crash, dying of a massive blow to the head and a fracture at the base of her cranium.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The facts of the fatal accident are not in dispute: Lopes had been speeding and had been trying to pass another vehicle. No one could have engineered such a set of circumstances, so all thought that the singer had been killed by someone other than herself should be dismissed.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        But there was something to the rumor
       </em>
       — roughly three weeks earlier a vehicle bearing Lopes had caused the death of a Honduran youngster.*
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Around 9 p.m. on 6 April 2002 on a highway about a half-hour drive from central San Pedro Sula, 10-year-old Bayron Isaul Fuentes Lopez walked into the path of the van driven by Lopes’ personal assistant. The child had been trailing after his sisters and brothers and stepped off the median strip at the last minute.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The accident was never reported to police or the judiciary, and no autopsy was performed (as required under Honduran law in deaths not by natural causes). Lopes paid about $3,700 U.S. for the boy’s medical care and funeral and also gave the family about $925. The dead boy’s family was satisfied Lopes and her people had handled matters appropriately. No one blamed Lopes or the driver of the van for the child’s death; what had happened had clearly been an unforeseeable and unpreventable tragedy.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, so my TLDR here is; Despite the seconds leading up to the crash being recorded, they don't know what cause the slow or unmoving vehicle on the highway, causing the death of the star, and leaving anywhere between 3 and 8 people completely unharmed. Lopes was working with local youth to increase their quality of life. The death of the kid wouldn't mean anything normally, but given context, is also suspicious. While I don't acknowledge her "evil spirits" following her, could they have been
       <strong>
        <em>
         actual people
        </em>
       </strong>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       My intention is to create discussion, I can answer questions, but this is more of a presentation of (what appears to be) decent leads. The Snopes article trying so hard to dismiss it, so hard, just felt so unnatural, that given the context, well, it all just stinks.

       I adore Lisa. I cried when she passed away. The end of that documentary when the car flipped was heart wrenching. There seemed to be no indication from anybody present that something was wrong until the very last moment. Could the technology have existed at the time for a third party to take control of the car in the same manner speculated to be involved with Paul Walker and Anton Yelchins death?

       hmm very interesting. what are some of your working theories on the relationship between the coup, Clinton, and Lisa? Why kill just her and leave the others? the way Snopes so solidly blames her death on reckless driving several times while chalking the childs death to an "unforeseeable and unpreventable tragedy", doesnt seem to sit right.

       I think the Clintons starting grooming Honduras for their takeover after Hurricane Mitch (just like Haiti) and we're growing the infrastructure when Lopes probably started stumbling across children being trafficked or abused.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton did not comment while the Obama administration called it unjust. They contradicted each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the one advising Clinton was involved in the original Contra coup, so there's that too.

       You copy and pasted the same section twice. You talked about Lisa Left Eye Lopez death and a coup almost a decade later without connecting them. Then you used Snopes as a source.

       I don't get it. Are you saying that there are evil spirits in Honduras and they killed Lisa Left Eye Lopez and then caused a coup?

       I always wondered about the occult part it... How she became obsessed with new age stuff towards the end of her life, how she did the numerology, the spirit she thinks is following her (strange thing is Aaliyah talked a spirit following her in a dream before flying away and how weightless she felt) , the constant camera issues-- like the camera doing strange things , and the last seconds of her life how calm she seemed and how the camera slowed at her expression
