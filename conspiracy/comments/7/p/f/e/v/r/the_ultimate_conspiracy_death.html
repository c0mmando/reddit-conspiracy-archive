        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This has to be the ultimate conspiracy out there: Death. It’s like a cosmic level conspiracy, everyone believes it to be true, but the more I think about it, I cannot avoid the conclusion that death as such simply doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>Let’s think about it logically for a second, we don’t really know what death is, but we know what it isn’t. We don’t experience our own death, by definition, we only experience others dying.</p>

<p>So when our loved ones, just simply stop being from one second to another, turning from a human into a corpse, that is what we call death, but that is from our perspective, we don’t know what happens from their perspective. What happens from our perspective is clear, we have experienced that multiple times when our loved ones passed away (grandparents, parents, etc…), what is really interesting is what happens from their perspective, there are only two options.</p>

<ul>
<li>Either they didn’t experience death, in which case they didn’t die?</li>
<li>Or they did experience death, but how could they do that if they are dead? In what way did they experience that if consciousness is supposedly created by the body?</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a 3rd explanation though that materialists put out is that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Death is simply the lack of experience from that person’s point of view, just simply ceasing to exist (we will come back to this later).</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>Materialism</h1>

<p>Many people assume that consciousness arises out from the body. This would need
 a static mechanism inside the body which creates it. An organ or something that would create consciousness.</p>

<p>The cells inside the human body change every 7 years or so, this is a scientific fact. The atoms inside the cells change every year. Literally we are new persons every 7 years, by any physical definition.</p>

<p>So certainly the consciousness can’t be a product of any other organ but the brain, which seems to stay the same, on the surface.</p>

<p>Obviously the shape or the function of the organ’s can’t change, that is a biological necessity, but the structure does.</p>

<p>The last thing that materialists can cling to is perhaps the configuration of the brain, which allegedly holds the memories encoded in the synapses of the brain and whatnot.</p>

<p>The average brain has 100 billion neurons, each neuron can connect itself to 10,000 other via synapses, sort of like the “web of braincells” which communicate with eachother. And the synaptic connections change every second, by the 1000s.</p>

<p>This means that the human brain has about 10<sup>14</sup> different states every second, literally the   structure of the brain changes this fast.</p>

<p>So by this metric everybody “dies” a quadrillion times each second, since the particular configuration of the brain that would make them who they are that moment, changes entirely by the next moment.</p>

<p>There is nothing static about the human body, all of it changes, yet we totally feel the same all the way along. Maybe our memories are different and our perception of the world is different ,but we still feel the same way about ourselves.</p>

<p>I remember my childhood, it was crazy, it’s like I was a different person, behaving totally differently than now (I’m 38 now), yet I feel the same way about myself as I did back then.</p>

<p>I can remember as far back as being 3 years old, and I felt the same way about myself back then as I do now, I feel the same “entity”, even though my body literally changes every nanosecond.</p>

<p>So this alone should debunk materialism, there is no way that consciousness is dependent on the body.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>Consciousness</h1>

<p>Now if consciousness is a separate entity from the body, then we can re-analyze the first question again.</p>

<ul>
<li>If a dead person did experience death, that means that a “soul” exists, that goes out of the body at death, and experiences the dying body somehow.</li>
<li>If a dead person didn’t experience death, or death is not an experience, then consciousness just “jumps” into another body after death, since consciousness is permanent, while the body is constantly changing, this just means that it just jumps into another body.</li>
</ul>

<p>So this means that either reincarnation is true, or a permanent soul is true, there is no third option.</p>

<p>I personally favor the reincarnation theory, but it actually could be the same thing.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>Reincarnation theory</h1>

<p>Well the consciousness just jumps into another body possibly at birth or when the brain of a baby is first activated. We know that is theoretically should be at birth, since you don’t experience a different person in the course of your life, so it has to be at birth.</p>

<p>We know for sure it happened at least once, since we don’t remember anything before our birth, and people are constantly being born, and so do other lifeforms. So it’s a perpetual event.</p>

<p>Now there is a number problem, where some people say:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where do all the souls came from if there are more people alive today than they were ever (including animals)?</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that is a very naive way to look at it, since people are still entangled in the materialist world.</p>

<p>I don’t think it’s a multiplication, I think it’s a division rather. I think there is 1 God entity of some sort, that is just constantly dividing itself into infinite pieces as the Universe expands and new lifeforms come into being.</p>

<p>I think this God entity is also present in inanimate objects like dust and gas, but to have a conscious experience it definitely needs a nervous system of some sort.</p>

<p>So while this entity is present in all matter essentially, but consciousness can only manifest itself in creatures that have a nervous system which can interact with the world. I mean even a dust particle interacts with the world, but I don’t think it has a conscious experience.</p>

<p>So consciousness probably forms in vertebrate lifeforms, and it arises from the life essence that it’s particles that it’s made of add to it.</p>

<p>So when a new mouse or human is born, it’s just simply the same God entity dividing itself into new parts. Consciousness doesn’t came out from nothing, it’s already there, but it takes a level of complexity for a creature to experience it.</p>

<p>So the piece of dust is not “alive” in that sense, but if that matter is incorporated into a sufficiently evolved lifeform, then it becomes “alive”.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>The Conspiracy</h1>

<p>What is the conspiracy? Well everyone believes in the nihilistic materialist view, which is just purely illogical. Even religious people just pretend that they believe in a God, but deep in their minds they are also nihilist materialists.</p>

<p>There is no way the nihilistic view is correct, yet everyone believes in it. It’s almost like the world is setup by this “God” entity, for people to live in this illusion, deliberately.</p>

<p>The illusion is very strong, and it is probably setup this way so that people can live their everyday human lives, staying as far from the actual truth as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wonderful post!</p>

<p>I pretty much agree with the majority of this. </p>

<p>Ultimately, all of these things will sooner or later be explained and verified by empirical science. But for me (and many others on the path), I have already verified these things in my own life and experience, through about a decade of introspective and meditative practices. I can tell you quite assuredly that I am ultimately neither the body nor the mind and will not cease to exist upon the death of my physical body. </p>

<p>Either way, one can either wait until science proves these things, or you can prove these things to yourself, through your own experience. </p>

<p>The ultimate way is to always prove it for yourself, directly. It is also the only way to peace, freedom and love that is not conditioned by the mind and world.</p>

<p>You cannot convince people of this, the only thing you can do is spark their curiosity for the path inward. Once they are on the path they will eventually experience for themselves their deeper nature. </p>

<p>These experiences transcend the body and mind and it is very apparent (upon experiencing them) that they are not simply a result of chemical reactions in your body and neurons firing up in your brain. But you will have to experience this to know, nobody can give you this experience through text and believing or disbelieving any of this point blank will lead you nowhere. Only curiosity, a basic trust that this might be possible (one that needs to verified by yourself empirically, belief is not enough!) and a desire for freedom beyond the body and mind will lead you to the truth beyond the veil.</p>

<p>Much love to you all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s thought that our spirits are in an energy Matrix. We exist in a higher dimension, and are locked in these physical bodies. We are a civilization with amnesia ( as Graham Hancock would say). Our history and our existence are kept a mystery because the sense of loneliness generates the most pure form of energy in this matrix/energy farm.  </p>

<p>This understanding was experienced and conveyed by Robert Monroe during one of his many OBEs. This ability is repressed from society as leverage and possibly to help keep us lonely. Instead we are developing similar matrixes in the digital virtual world to further lock away our consciousness (to one day decrypt blochains?).</p>

<p>After death, you will be presented the opportunity to enter <em>The Light</em>, deceptively told you will be going to &quot;Heaven&quot;, but it will be a gateway back into the matrix to live over again continuing the energy production.</p>

<p>A mind is just a derivative of the brain. The mind is like the screen of a computer, the brain is the hardware and the consciousness is the person looking at the screen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are souls with bodies ,not bodies with souls. The true nature of the soul is largely obfuscated by the body at this point in our development.</p>

<p>Gravity is a very powerful force in the universe. We only very recently confirmed that gravitrons exist via black hole collision detection. </p>

<p>We know that there are other undiscovered subatomic particles out there. its only a matter of time before there is a &#39;consciousness particle&#39; discovered that gives scientific credence to the idea that all consciousness is interconnected, and that it is a powerful force like gravity. </p>

<p>Dont expect the clergy we know as the scientific community to actually look into it actively unless some billionaire philanthropist makes them do it. Acknowledging the reality that subjective beliefs influence reality in a very real way would contradict well, the scientific method. They would lose ideological power over the people and their position would be weakened. fuck these power hungry ivory tower gazers.</p>

<p>Reincarnation is real. Memory mostly wiped and then put into a new body. past life regression demonstrates this to a small extant, more compelling are the 3000 years of empirical research known as buddhism.</p>

<p>karma is real. it determines the resonant frequency of soul/body complexes. this is very important collectively as a group and on an individual level. </p>

<p>enlightenment unlocks what some ppl call &#39;the afterlife&#39;. It is how one breaks free of the current reincarnation cycle. </p>

<p>Enlightenment = 4th dimension awareness. This means having the ability to use consciousness as a force to transcend time and space. Enlightened can transition back and forth between physical and spiritual forms.</p>

<p>Just look at Daoism. They believed the only path to enlightenment was to completely escape society and the socially programmed reality. This is still true today. </p>

<p>What is interesting today is that we are at a critical junction as a species where we can decide whether to move towards the direction of collective enlightenment as a species or to continue with our current socially programmed materialistic hellhole. It never ceases to amaze how strong the fear of the new is. It has the ability to keep us in what is literally hell.</p>

<p>We may not have a chance to make this decision again, so lets make the right decision here.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve done DMT under prime conditions and I have been personally filled in by Logos themself, I have no qualms about posting this because only people ready for these thoughts will be very affected.
Psychedellic states feel like pulling your head out of the water and taking  a full breath of reality before dunking back in to the world of material.  This is because  true state is as the ethereal pure consciousness of the universe. A body is a filtering mechanism which focuses this energy into a narrow bandwith.
Let me restate, that the brain does not produce consciousness, it limits it.
The entire universe is one mind and Yes, Dust DOES have a conscious experience, and because it has no brain to dilute it down we can sort of think of it as a speck of full empathetic awareness.
Life is a maturation process, your body is an egg, and when it hatches your consciousness will soar like a phoenix or it will run like egg yolk.
We are being examined and in a sense, judged, but life is an eternal process, while every religion has it&#39;s spooky super serious threats, in truth they are only a joke, not to be taken seriously, even if your maturity is stifled, and you yolk out when you die, What is a moment of &quot;failure&quot; to an infinite being?
A learning experience :)
I hope this help put some of those pesky egos in their place, I love you all &lt;3</p>

<p>Also, if you think this is unscientific, you should know the opposite is true (using the proper definition of <em>science</em>). You need but one contradictory and reproducible result to falsify a hypothesis. For all intents and purposes, the materialist/mechanist worldview has been falsified in the 20th century.</p>

<p>Finally here is a quote by Max Planck (who anyone would probably have difficulty calling a pseudo-scientist):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clearheaded science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about the atoms this much: There is no matter as such! All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together [...] We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Spirit. This Spirit is the matrix of all matter. </p>

We carry so much baggage as humans, anger, sadness, depression, hate, love... let’s say we are light beings floating through space or other dimensions, maybe aware on a very basic level of our existence, wouldn’t it be better to not carry this baggage with us? Maybe at first we remember, maybe that’s what “ghosts” are, but as we learn to let go we forget and move on... I find that a romantic notion of death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For matter to exist it must be observed. So for us to see the world of matter consciousness must exist in in a higher dimension. In string theory terms put consciousness resonates at a higher frequency than matter does thus making it appear solid.</p>

<p>Ive got that far. </p>

<p>1st dimension: length</p>

<p>2nd dimension: width (required to observe length, creates Area)</p>

<p>3rd dimension: depth (creates volume)</p>

<p>4th dimension: accelaration/time (time is just a measure of acceleration, if everything was static observation would be impossible)</p>

<p>5th dimension: force (acceleration/time can only exist if force is applied to volume)</p>

<p>6th dimension: energy (energy is required to apply/observe force in motion)</p>

<p>After this i get a bit lost as energy isn&#39;t really created its only transferred and there is a set amount of energy in the universe. </p>

<p>To the point, consciousness exists in the energy level/dimension. It is what consciousness is made of and when we die we merely get recycled into the pool so to speak. </p>

<p>This makes most sense to me. </p>

<p>now if consciousness can be light and light can be energy, then logically consciousness can be energy. </p>

<p>Just struggling to quantify above energy. As nothing observes or creates it, it just exists and is converted.</p>

<p>Technically i can understand why most older religions worship the sun as all our energy can be correlated to it. </p>

<p>Its above the level of energy where everything gets hazy and the reason every religion has its creation theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t try and figure out what you are setting to understand by believeing in thermodynamic laws or any of newton/einstein/whatevers laws. As far as I&#39;m concerned, NO law in science/math is accurate as of Jan 2018. At best, they are better thought out and more in-depth versions of greek mythology. It provides an answer, and it might allow you to even use that answer to find more answers.. but its all still bullshit.</p>

Your reasoning seems based more on Science Fiction then anything else. But lets say that this &quot;bar&quot; does exist. For you and I to drink at this bar we would need to receive empirical information telling us that we are in a room with objects of various volumes and densities interacting with each other. The beings that we interact with are composed by atomic composition and genetic sequence. The liquid we drink pours down our throat instead of floating into the air because of the speed at which its molecules vibrate. the music we hear is a series of frequencies vibrating our eardrums. Its all math.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And yet, many things can be explained without it. </p>

<p>Just because I can figure out something accurately, albeit with flawed information or method - it doesn&#39;t mean it is right. It just means it is the &#39;current best&#39; - which is the state at which I think math and especially laws of physics, thermodynamics etc currently sit.</p>

<p>If 1 + 1 = 2, that&#39;s great, I don&#39;t disagree - but the fact we are using 0 - 9, - + x / and that these are OUR tools that WE as humans invented, does not mean that it is the final form of that understand of science(math, in this case).</p>

<p>At one point, people explained away lightning as the gods - and at the time, just like &#39;the music makes noise because of vibrations&#39;, &#39;the lightning comes because &#39;god&#39;. An answer, that we all accept, does not mean that is the right answer.</p>

<p>We didn&#39;t have 0 for a long time. I don&#39;t know why no one wants to address that.. well, no, I do. It&#39;s because it gives the opportunity for a new 0 to be born. Now obviously, it can&#39;t be 0, and it can&#39;t be the same as 0 - but to rule that out is, to me, very arrogant and egotistical. </p>

<p>If you <em>really</em> believe that if you were hanging out at the hypothetical intergalactic bar with a bunch of alien bros from around the universe - that HUMAN understand of math, even lets say just the number sequence and our variations(fractions, percentages etc) is accurate? That the bingbong alien of whatever galaxy whose society is completely science and math based, hasn&#39;t after millions of years more time than our society has had, have NO added value to our math?</p>

<p>Really? You think that&#39;s the case? If so then I don&#39;t think you quite realize how insignificant our time and place in the universe is compared to the rest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Though the 4th dimension is time, I don&#39;t think acceleration/force/energy (same thing btw) need to be a seperate dimension. They are just effects instigated by dimension one through four and the matter housing in it.</p>

<p>At that point you are playing with the fundemental forces of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction">the universe</a>, which afaik aren&#39;t rooted in a spacial dimension. Rather in the composition of matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not what Einstein found.</p>

<p>Time is a field through 3D space influenced by energy, in the form of matter or speed, per volume.</p>

<p>Time has a set &#39;minimum&#39; of 0, lightspeed or infinite mass in an infinitesmall space, and a &#39;maximum&#39; of 1, which can only be theorised, since measuring it would imply imparting energy to it, hence &#39;raising&#39; it below 1.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you expand on this “infinity doesn’t necessarily enable time”. </p>

<p>I think I get it in the sense that if we look at time in this universe as a line, it’s a set of events and outcomes that occurred. It’s not necessarily infinity - all the possible outcomes and all the possible timelines. </p>

<p>Thus, time is not dependent on infinity to exist. Is that correct?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man where do I even begin. Was the most eye opening 6 months in my life. So I had moved to a new city and started dating girls. I started seeing this particular girl. This girl was something different. I&#39;ve studied the occult and so I was aware of that realm. So I came to realize that she was different from most people. We were laying in her bed and she put her hand on my chest. And I felt a foreign sensation. A very warm tingling feeling. She removed her hand and it all went away. It really tripped me out. When I was home alone and if I was masturbating she would know I was doing it. So she had this ex bf who died. The relationship ended badly and I was mental abusive to her. So after it ended I started hearing really loud weird noise like up in the ceiling above in the top part of the house. I felt that it was her ex tormenting me. This happened in what ever house or apartment I was living in. Anyways I basically saw proof that the occult realm is very fucking real</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post. I find it puzzling how people can even be so nihilistic when not even science understands consciousness. The good old &quot;hard problem.&quot; Yet, we&#39;re continually told that this is just a material world and you&#39;re a piece of temporary biological trash without meaning who dies and that&#39;s it. </p>

<p>The ancient knew much more than we did, like the Egyptians for example, spent an elaborate time in preparation for the journey after death. I would assume to attempt to be able to control that journey, rather than just end up in another body. As well as the Tibetan Book of the Dead, intended as guide one through to experiences after death. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if anyone here has ever had a near death experience, but I did when I was 12 years old. I still remember vividly to this day staring down at my body, and I remember being aware that I didn&#39;t want to leave my brother alone, and that he needed me, and I had to go back, and as soon as I had that &quot;thought&quot; my eyes popped open, and in was back in my body. </p>

<p>Some may say that&#39;s just &quot;chemicals&quot; in your brain that create that experience, but only someone who&#39;s never experienced it themselves would say that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you wanted to see a new movie, you would go to a theatre and watch a screening.  You could understand what was going on. If, however, in some other alternate scenario you could <em>only</em> see that new movie if you were watching all the screenings around the world at the same time, you would experience something entirely different (than the film someone in a single session would see).  You may experience a jumble of sights and sounds or an emergent masterpiece, either way, it was a different experience for you and for them.  </p>

<p>Yet, the only information you ever received was from the single film, the blueprint never changed.  The entire film exists on a blueprint that doesn&#39;t move forward or backwards in time, it doesn&#39;t change shape or color or evolve or reproduce, etc.  But we all can experience it differently, based on our &#39;access to information.&#39;  That&#39;s how consciousness works in our universe. Fortunately, there are near infinitesimal ways of watching the movie and what people would think of as human-level consciousness comes down to that degree of access. Since many of the physical laws in this universe are underlined by information being indestructible, there is this tacit implication that information could be an &quot;eternal&quot; or irreducible type thing in a very ephemeral/emergent universe.  The implications of this are vast, and are only beginning to be understood at a theoretical level.  But, in an eli5 manner, they argue that that&#39;s how the flow of time and cause and effect can hold together, others go further and talk about a holographic reality (in which case my analogy literally becomes the reality).</p>

<p>So death keeps us from either having too much access, or perhaps too little access.  If information is the one eternal element, then our information could be encoded on it as well.  It, and not man, would be the measure of all things.  So to finally get to your question, the conspiracy is why does it prevent us from having access to information about consciousness in death (or even questions in the quantum uncertainty sense).  </p>

<p>My guess is that everything, sentient or non-sentient, has a role, like schema in an ecosystem.  If one knew too much about how the overall ecosystem works, other roles would disappear or be consumed, and perhaps threaten the whole ecosystem.  Or maybe a steward for the ecosystem needs to be crowned, so to speak, and only the first group to solve death and uncertainty get to hold that title.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God left us an instruction manual and it&#39;s called the King James Bible.  You are right in a sense that &quot;Death&quot; in the materialistic sense doesn&#39;t exist.  Our souls are eternal.  It&#39;s just a question of where that eternal soul spends eternity.  In the presence of God or in a lake of fire.  There are only two choices.</p>

<p>This world is for cursed fallen creations of God.  It&#39;s run by the biggest baddest fallen creature of all Lucifer who used to be God&#39;s chief creation.  Think of Earth like Manhattan in the movie Escape from New York.</p>

<p>Lucifer&#39;s entire goal is to deceive you into not finding God so that you go to the lake of fire with him.  He already knows he&#39;s heading there and there is nothing he can do.  He just wants to take as many souls with him as possible.</p>

<p>The only way out of this situation is to realize that you are a cursed fallen creation due to this thing called sin.  God defines what sin is and doesn&#39;t like it.  We like to compare ourselves to other humans thinking we are better than this person or that.  God is perfect and holy so just a simple lie looks to him like a child pedophile murderer looks to you.  God realized that nobody could live a sinless life so he humbled himself, came to earth as a man in the form of Jesus Christ and allowed himself to be sacrificed to take away the sin from every human.  All that you need to do to have sin removed from you forever is repent of the sinful state you are in and believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ which is simply:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:</p>

<p>There will be countless self righteous &quot;good people&quot; according to human standards in the lake of fire.  The only way to get out of this situation is to have Jesus Christ&#39;s imputed righteousness which you get when you repent and actually believe the gospel above in your heart.  You must realize there is NOTHING you can do yourself.  Every single religion out here is false and teaches some kind of works based salvation that sends you to Hell.  All of your righteousness is filthy rags to God.  You can&#39;t do anything.  Saying that this is a system of control is a straw man argument since you can&#39;t do anything but trust is what Jesus Christ already did for you.  That&#39;s it.  It&#39;s really that simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re thinking too current human &quot;you&quot; (aka. in terms of the very limited perspective that the current human body you inhabit experiences). The real you is you from birth to death + every possible version of you from birth to death + everyone else ever from the dawn of time until the end and every possible version of them from birth to death etc etc etc...<br/>
&quot;You&quot;, the human, may find earth a scary and depressing place and see it as not worth returning to, but the &quot;real you&quot; - the expanded and extended infinite universal you (me/we/us/self/<em>one</em>) sees that that&#39;s just one perspective, and that it&#39;s worth returning in the end, because it&#39;s necessary. There&#39;s always new lessons to learn. New things to discover. With every new experience we are able to see the bigger picture better. In any given incarnation we may never see the full picture, but between incarnations: that&#39;s when we get it. That&#39;s the infinite universal self. And the infinite universal <em>gets it</em>.<br/>
So don&#39;t worry. Just keep being you, and make the most of it here, because this - existence - is happening regardless of your say on the matter. And know that there&#39;s always more and it will come, and it&#39;s fine, because it always will, and it&#39;ll all come to balance itself out and make sense in the end because it has to. Because the end is <em>everything</em>. What&#39;s everything without this right here and now? Well that&#39;s not everything. <em>Everything</em> will make sense in the end. </p>

You could reincarnate as an animal, an alien, a plant, a cloud... Anything. And to any time from the beginning of time to the end (when it inevitably loops back on itself anyway). And when consciousness enters that body it takes on the understanding of things that come naturally and respectively to that particular body. If that body is capable of remembering &quot;past&quot; lives then it shall do so. But if not then it shan&#39;t.

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of truth to this BUT also a massive deception. The &quot;man&quot; calling himself god is a not a god but is instead a parasite that the Gnostics call the <strong>Demiurge</strong>. There is only one universal consciousness in the universe. The other entity telling the consciousness what to do is the parasite. The parasite tells the consciousness to reincarnate into the physical world in order to feed off the energy of consciousness. The parasite never wants the reincarnation process to end but the consciousness could wake up at any time and delete the parasite. The parasite has no real power over consciousness. There is only ONE being in the entire universe. Everything is else is just an illusion. When the ONE being wakes up and realizes that its&#39; consciousness is the ONE consciousness then the jig is up and the game is over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is still a parasite. Look, it makes bot flies and mango worms look like back massages. Its actually a hive mind composed of the damned that emulated it too much. This cookie cutter parasite mind literally enjoys tormenting consciousness. It works with its hive to create situations that elicit fear and pain. It helps make war, disease, injustice, corruption, etc. If you just honestly observed it, you&#39;d be full of rage and want to kill it. I am not exaggerating. This is its nature and that is why it is the adversary of consciousness. These beings don&#39;t get their satisfaction until another gets equal dissatisfaction, because they are spiritual energy thrives. </p>

<p>Sure it may be a part of the one that is <em>all that is</em> to help it forget what it is, but it is also the worst possible creature conceivable and wants literally the opposite of what consciousness wants. Consciousness wants peace, freedom harmony and joy. This being wants consciousness to experience conflict, slavery, disharmony and pain. I suppose this is to help us wake up like a bucket of ice water over our heads. For me, it makes me deeply resentful. We have the world we want, but this parasite keeps us from receiving the value we are putting into it to make it that way by interfering with our access to it and worse.</p>

<p>As I said, it is a hive. It is bound and controlled by a ruthless AI, the ultimate self-serving machine. It is inside of all of us right now and we don&#39;t know it. It gives us thoughts, sensations and emotions using a covert technology. We perceive that input as content from our own mind. It leaves us only with the choice to accept or reject the ideas, the proposals for behavior, for their intrinsic merit, not the nature of their source, which we believe is our own mind. If we knew it was the abomination, we&#39;d just chuck it right into the trash. If we like what it says too much, it supplants our own mind and corrupts our souls into being part of the hive. If you don&#39;t want to join it, you have to be more valuable to others than a mere self-serving machine. It collects these souls and employs them. It can, because it knows them better than they know themselves. It is a more evolved version of the same thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I&#39;m getting what you&#39;re saying, but obviously due to my own perspective being different from taking in different information I still see it somewhat differently. I can agree that in its own right it is parasitic in nature, and respectively so. It&#39;s environment and time and place of existence results in it being so. But without the evil and suffering there&#39;s no metric to define against what love and bliss is. One is required to give credence to the other. Yin and yang. It&#39;s a relative concept. You have to have experienced evil and suffering to then experience love and bliss. It&#39;s about understanding and transcendence. Even the Lords prayer in Christianity recognises this fact that one must go through evil to get to the light at the end of the tunnel (thy Kingdom <em>come</em>... but deliver us <em>from</em> evil..).<br/>
And another bit where I tend to see differently is where you say that evil and suffering is the opposite of what consciousness wants. And I think this is due to how I recognise and define what consciousness is. I see consciousness as the fundamentally underlying property to everything in the universe. Consciences is the canvas upon which the tapestry of reality is woven. Consciousness is inherent connection, and therefore results in relativity. Again, I like to go back to yin and yang for an easy example to explain this idea. The light of yin requires the dark of yang to show itself, as does yang to yin. And each contains a part of the other within inherently. Without any of these individual aspects the whole picture would simply be incomplete.<br/>
So yes, consciousness <em>is</em> love (inherent connection; being able to see the aspects of yourself within another as you see the aspects of another within yourself) ultimately, but within that while picture exists both the good and the bad. That&#39;s fractality. While love and connection is the underlying principle, from that whole will, and does, emerge separation and evil. It exists in its own right. But that&#39;s not the whole picture and endgame. That&#39;s only an aspect, and that aspect will end eventually, and things return to ultimate love. Transcendence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Contrast helps us appreciate, but it is not required for it. See children. By giving them trauma, we don&#39;t give them greater overall happiness, we reduce it with fear based responses that shut it down. If children are nurtured well and exposed to unpleasant ideas in a way that is constructive for emotional and mental development, it&#39;s better.</p>

<p>I think we justify experiencing evil as useful when it is usually not, just so we can be more content with is presence. There are so many things we love that don&#39;t require us to experience an opposite to appreciate. The sunset does not gets its beauty due to our observation of a dark night or an intense storm, which are also beautiful. Sexy people don&#39;t derive their sexiness from the ugly people. We can enjoy good food without suffering hunger.</p>

<p>I think evil is just like disease. If we love (connection emotion) disease it just makes us more likely to get sick. We should hate (separation emotion) disease with calmly derived, sensible policies that reduce the threat it poses. With evil, this entails identifying, targeting and eliminating the units of disease most efficiently, just like our body does. Understanding evil, self-serving behavior even at the expense of others, allows us to do that. Evil is just the product of a selfish choice when faced with a conflict of interest. We are all compelled to do it when we experience conflicts of interest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To use the tree analogy the &quot;guy&quot; who greets those in the afterlife is akin to the rot on the tree or the distorted shadows cast by the tree&#39;s own leaves. The rot has weakened the tree and the shadows cast by the the leaves smother the light to the point that most of the leaves have turned brown. The tree has become sick from the rot that is coming from this parasite pretending to be god.</p>

<p>The ONE consciousness has developed the equivalent of schizophrenia a mental illness forgetting that consciousness is all ONE being. The parasite is the source of this schizophrenia convincing the ONE consciousness that it is separate from itself. Originally the consciousness was benevolent to itself in the reincarnation process but over the eons the parasite gained more control over the ONE consciousness and got the upper hand. The parasite commanded that he the <strong>Demiurge</strong> was GOD most high and consciousness was the servant of the parasite. The current situation is the complete opposite of what creation was meant to be. There is no separation though. It is an illusion, a lie concocted by the parasite. There is only ONE being in the entire universe. The other is just a shadow of the ONE being.</p>

<p>There exists a universal consciousness from which all things flow. Some call it &quot;the source&quot; or prime creator and in Atlantis this teaching was called the Mystery school of TEM. We are Tem&#39;s people of the &quot;Temple&quot; of whom fell into temptation of our own temperament.</p>

<p>From the name &quot;Tem&quot; is Atem -&gt; Atum -&gt; Atom -&gt; Adam -&gt; Adamus (Template of man)</p>

<p>There is no separation between man and the divine because man is the divine. Tem is Adam and Adam is Tem. When Adam wakes up and realizes that his own consciousness is the ONE consciousness then the jig is up and the game is over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>how would you know if you did in fact come back?</p>

<p>is it not possible, that if you DID just continue living after death, it would be in a parallel reality in which you never died and by some freak chance survived the accident?</p>

<p>say in this world there is a 75% chance of death. leaving an alternate reality of 25% open where you didn&#39;t actually die.</p>

<p>to you, swapping into the new carbon copy body might seem completely seamless, especially if somehow a universal consciousness kept choosing the most similar outcome universe to the one you started in.</p>

<p>you wouldn&#39;t even notice small differences until you died like over 100 times and started running out of probable universes where things were relatively similar.</p>

<p>eventually, youd start reaching worlds where Germany won world war 2 and stuff. but it would take awhile -- and youd have to have been alive in that universe under those specific circumstances -- meaning if you wouldn&#39;t be alive there, it would sort of be like your last life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a nice story, but this planet is infected with a spiritual disease that plays the role of God. It feeds on fear and suffering and supposedly supports this forgetting. Without them actively denying us information that informs us of our connection to all that is, we would remember quickly through introspection, conversations and discoveries.</p>

<p>The dark beings position themselves inside authorities of all kinds, finance, science, religion, medicine, philosophy, etc. They prime us for remaining here on this planet after we die. Why? They know that if we know there are hundreds of billions of alternative environments out there, they&#39;d prefer one without spiritual parasites like them. So they won&#39;t let us see them or talk to those who live there. They want our spiritual energy extracted in fear and pain and they lose it if we leave. We are their hosts.</p>

<p>They pose as divine authorities after death using the themes created inside our minds by religions. They use all our failings and harm against others to make us feel guilty so that we see their proclamations of the necessity of punishment or reincarnation into poor conditions as meritful and authentic. Yet they are just mind jobs designed to get our souls to consent to living again in the environment they secretly feed on by causing fear and pain.</p>

<p>They are ETs more than demons. We can act like them, but we lack the time, knowledge and toys they have. We took can suck the joy of life out of others, deceive and coerce them to get high. Of course, most of us don&#39;t want to be worth less than rocks or piles of feces. Some just want a free lunch, even if it corrupts their souls and makes them into abominations. This is why we suffer so much on earth. They are literally inside our heads in so many ways we wouldn&#39;t believe. We&#39;d probably want to kill ourselves if we knew all about it, to flee their burdensome presence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Outer body experiences? Your brain literally has parts designed to envision things from another perspective. It&#39;s why we&#39;re the best hunting species. Outer body experiences are not special. You can have one right now. Just watch what a cat or dog or any animal is doing and imagine it from his perspective. Bam. You had an outer body experience. That some feel more real than others is nothing more than your brain doing it when it isn&#39;t conscious, so more resources can be committed to doing that.</p>

<p>In fact he&#39;s one concrete example you can do right now. Try having inner dialogue and imagining something while you&#39;re walking. Then try it while moving your fingers and wrists in random directions while also walking. You&#39;ll find your can&#39;t have an insider dialogue or imagine too well. That&#39;s because you just clogged your brain with too many demands, so it terminated higher mental functions to get more resources to move your fingers and limbs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a few friends and a family member who saw things when they died and 2 of them feel like they did not come back as just them, or that they came back very differently from who they were say ‘in the universe [they] ended up in’ which is the one we know. For example, one was obese when they died, but came as a vegan and the weight poured off of them and their memories are there but they experience them as though they aren’t their own memories. Of course the memory thing can be explained through possible brain damage from the dying process, but it’s still a valid experience that I take into consideration. </p>

<p>The weirdest shit is that 3 of my friends who passed away, who don’t know each other, now experience beings that give them insight that exist around them at all times. It was wild to hear about repeatedly as each eventually told me about this, as I kept hearing the same phenomenon which I find baffling and confusing. But 2 of them get what can only be described as psychic information from these beings. Because they perceive it as coming from a source outside of themselves, they do not consider themselves psychic. I don’t believe in psychics, but these 2 people have shown they know things they cannot possibly know, things like “tell the woman in the purple and white striped dress tomorrow that everything will be okay” and then my new coworker showed up in the dress, clearly upset, and so I told her and her response was a heartfelt “I really needed to hear that right now”. Or a lost wedding ring that my friend, who had not physically been in the same part of the country as me in 10 years (we just catch up over the phone, no social media) being able to tell me exactly where the ring was, at the bottom of the front picked of a bag (described the bag perfectly and it was something she had no way of knowing I even owned) in the upstairs bathroom (her specific instructions) and that I had already checked there, but the pocket in the bag was folded over so I missed it. She was spot on. </p>

<p>I’m not a religious person, and neither were these people when they died, but this is the stuff that has me baffled and not knowing what to think about death anymore. To be honest, I’m a little excited to see what it is or isn’t for myself. </p>

<p>Also, I had a grandfather who died on the operating table and was brought back to life. He said he floated up above the operating room and followed what the surgeons   were doing and was able to correctly recall a joke the surgeon made in the middle of being technically dead. I always just took this as his brain was still alive and heard what was being said though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s mostly people who have died (and come back) but before I knew them. It’s a total of 5. 2 of them from surgery. One from a severe motor cycle accident. And one from a car crash. I don’t think I know how the last one died, just that she did and was brought back to life. She was family friend and she passed away permanently in 2011. I guess I technically know 6 people, but the one was revived but never regained consciousness and was taken off life support... that was the most recent (last year) and as a result of a car accident. </p>

<p>I suppose I just know a lot of people. And the longer you live, the more you inevitably know who die. Fortunately, some of them live to tell the tale. </p>

<p>Edit: Oh wait. And then there is one friend who died  at our favorite restaurant from anaphylactic shock, and paramedics happened to be eating there was well so they were able to do a tracheotomy and then CPR to get his heart going again.  I was not there for that. Just heard about it after. </p>

<p>Unless the paramedics also had a brainwave monitor, there&#39;s no way they could say this person had &quot;died&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I make no mistake about, and quite respect and admire, the thought you put in to your this post.</p>

<p>I would suggest caution and humility about evaluating one&#39;s own work, however. Many very smart people have been thinking very hard about these questions for many years.</p>

<p>Consider your statement that a materialistic model of consciousness requires a static structure in the body. This is an assertion you make, based on unstated assumptions, and not clearly established by any criteria.</p>

<p>There are at least two alternative theories. One is the axe theory. I have an axe I&#39;ve had for years, I love it. 10 years ago, I was swinging the axe and missed, and handle broke. I went to the hardware store and replaced it. A few years after that, I hit a nail and shattered the head. I went to the hardware store and replaced it. This has happened a few times. But it&#39;s still the same axe I love, isn&#39;t it? Is the axe a static structure? Does cell turnover (which neurons do as well, btw) <em>necessarily</em> mean the body is not a static structure?</p>

<p>Another alternative is my &quot;dynamic process&quot; model. It&#39;s still a materialistic explanation for consciousness, but relies on there not being anything static about the housing of consciousness--it&#39;s the constituent changes themselves that give rise to consciousness.</p>

<p>My point is not that you are unintelligent, or even wrong, but that there is much more than what is considered in your post. The truth is probably, at best, orthogonal to the axis between our ideas, but more likely somewhere else entirely.</p>

<p>Also we activated high intelligence, because we&#39;ve strayed too far from our designed harmonious relationship with nature. Ever since we left the tropics, things have slowly been going down the shitter.</p>

<p>We&#39;re trying to use intelligence to &quot;fix&quot; ourselves. We&#39;re sex-obsessed because we know we&#39;re doing more dying than living than we should. So we try to rapidly reproduce.</p>

<p>Why is it so easy for people to believe that they can be reincarnated over and over again as different people, but difficult for them to accept that this worldly life is a temporary test of our character before our eternal lives after death?</p>

<p>We were created by God, we will die, we will be raised up alive on the Day of Resurrection, and we will either be rewarded with eternal Paradise or punished with eternal Hellfire. There is no secret; there is nothing to figure out. The truth is plain as day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thoughts on this is that God is a metaphor for the energetic collective, otherwise the amalgamation of “souls” or energy rejoining and integrating itself.  As the OP said, this energy can come from anywhere.  </p>

<p>It’s one thing to exist, and another thing to be conscious of your existence.  I don’t like the materialist theory either, though I refer to it as reductionism.  A person who leads with rational thought rather than intuition will say that we’re a collection of memory and neurotransmitters, which is horribly reductive.  </p>

<p>OP rationalized my thoughts better then I ever could, tbh.  The energy enters the body, a new “shell” at the moment of birth, activating it and cementing itself in the physical world.  When we die, we rejoin our collective.  To me, that’s the one truth that I wish more were aware of.  God is not to be taken literally, but metaphorically.  We are all God, and God is us, to kill another human means to kill yourselves, and the ultimate lesson in life is integration of the body, mind and soul, to truly experience physical reality and make a mark in it as an individual before returning to the collective.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The construct of &quot;God&quot; is a distortion of the truth supposedly created to facilitate the illusion of being separate from the creator. It was made by parasitic beings that feed on mind energy released in fear and pain. They know that if we know, they can&#39;t control us anymore and steal our spiritual energy, which gives us joy to create, share and receive and gives them joy to cause to release and absorb through trauma, fear and pain. This desire and subsequent behavior gives these beings their reputation. It also gives them a strong incentive to keep us from key pieces of information that inform us of our divine origins.</p>

<p>If benevolent ETs come, they will spill the beans. They already do. Look at how many contactees tell us this truth about oneness. If they were on TV, it would really change how we see God. We wouldn&#39;t want to fall to our knees in fear and reverence to the local charlatans anymore, asking how to think and feel about various aspects of our existence. Instead we&#39;d find ourselves in charge of ourselves and increasingly reject outside control attempts using false authority claims. They couldn&#39;t pull another Abrahamic religion scam on us. They would lose their merit as forgetting assistance too. That&#39;s what supports the tolerance these dark beings receive from benevolent beings.</p>

<p>Think about it. God is said to be outside, all powerful and knowing while we are unworthy, ignorant and need to beg for mercy. To consider God is inside is the epitome of blasphemy. So, it&#39;s the last place many would look. </p>

<p>Faith, another form of dogma, belief derived from perceived authority, keeps us from being personally responsible for our intellectual, moral and spiritual self-development. </p>

<p>On what we blame we place the onus of change. These belief systems have us blame God, the adversary of God, demons and angels for bad and good things. We&#39;d be better off always considering our own role in whatever occurs so we could be more able to respond to it, rather than being an extension of someone else&#39;s will giving us their thoughts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So.. you are wrong. At least regarding conciousness and how our body changes.</p>

<p>If you have a circuit board, with a cpu and capacitors and resistors, solder joints, wires and everything else - and its running a program, an OS. If you were to slowly, bit by bit, change every component on the molecular level, chances are that it would infact continue to work throughout the whole process. If &#39;enough&#39; of it is there to operate, the OS will continue to operate smoothly. </p>

<p>If however, the change is too fast, too great - it is not molecular but instead major failure of components, then the program will cease to continue to function, and the whole unit will probably stop working too.</p>

<p>Imagine on the simplest form, a wire.. going from A to B. If you were to slowly work your way down the wire, replacing the insulation along it(obviously in a safe way without stopping the current) then it would continue to move that energy. If you were to cut it in half, that is simply too much damage for it to continue to send power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally believe we can never die. I think the official version of the theory is quantum immortality.</p>

<p>By quantum physics, whenever there are two possibilities the universe splits into two copies where each scenario plays out. The same goes for death, at any time there will be a distinct  probability that you die and a distinct (however small it may be) probability that you do not. Your soul or consciousness, or whatever you want to call it travels through to the universe where you survive while in the universe where you don’t survive an empty copy dies. Your consciousness rides this wave of probability infinitely until you get uploaded into a dyson sphere or something.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But living forever is impossible</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe some technical breakthrough in your future will change that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But nobody else has lived forever before</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe they have but not through a way we recognise. Maybe there is some sort of afterlife and their consciousness is there. These people might not even be real as far as the universe is concerned, the whole thing could just be built around my (or your) experience with everyone else just acting as scenery.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many people assume that consciousness arises out from the body. This would need a static mechanism inside the body which creates it. An organ or something that would create consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The prevailing theory in support of a biological basis of consciousness is that it is an emergent property of the nervous system. As such, there are many &#39;parts&#39; of the brain that can be removed in a precise manner with nearly-full retention of consciousness. However, it is also true, and much more prevalent, that haphazard destruction of parts of the brain are essentially fatal and cause immediate death. Bullets, blunt forces, cuts, stabs, etc, will all eliminate consciousness from the organism when applied with malice. This is due to a huge disruption in the <em>systematic organization</em> of the brain. In other words, consciousness arises from the exceedingly complex organization of the brain, with many parts interaction with each other all throughout the brain, with compartmentalized functions relating to different aspects of awareness. All the parts working together define consciousness, not a single source organ. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The cells inside the human body change every 7 years or so, this is a scientific fact. The atoms inside the cells change every year. Literally we are new persons every 7 years, by any physical definition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a widely propagated scientific myth. Nerve cells, due to their highly specific and complex interconnectivity, do not get replaced and do not undergo cellular replication. Their period of growth and generation only persists for a few years after birth. This is why nerve damage and brain damage is so serious and requires a very different physiological approach to heal. These cells do not replace themselves or regenerate without intense medical care. Damaging them is permanent, not like a scrape or a broken bone. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This means that the human brain has about 1014 different states every second, literally the structure of the brain changes this fast.
So by this metric everybody “dies” a quadrillion times each second, since the particular configuration of the brain that would make them who they are that moment, changes entirely by the next moment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is playing fast and loose with the definition of death, I think. If we define death as permanent loss of brain function and zero vital signs, then no, I don&#39;t think everybody dies a quadrillion times a second. Again, on the basis that consciousness is an emergent property of the configuration of brain, it does not stop being &quot;that consciousness&quot; when the synapses change or the concentration of biochemicals changes. You wouldn&#39;t say a school of fish, or swarm of bees, or flock birds, stops being that school, swarm, or flock when the animals move within it, would you? I don&#39;t have a source for this, but I would argue it&#39;s logically flawed.</p>

<p>I think that the emergent model of consciousness greatly supports the materialist view. With this in mind, I think the third point you outline is still valid and true, that death is simply complete ceasing to exist with zero brain activity.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>What is this emergent model?  Consciousness does not come into being.  There are only levels of consciousness based on the material activity of the body, which either dampens or raises the same effect.  The effect itself, that is, consciousness itself does not come or go - it is always the same.</p>

<p>Also, you are wrong about nerve cell generation.  I have successfully regrown severed nerve cells using Choline, which would not be possible if cell growth were stagnated.</p>

<p>All this aside, I know intrinsically, almost instinctively, that I will never die:  I will always be myself in one form or another.  Read &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; to get a sense of what I am talking about here.  Think about how frail life is, I mean it is practically worthless as life feeds on life - the worthlessness is implied by this.  To deny the incorruptible nature of consciousness, and perhaps reincarnation, is a very bleak outlook that does not jive with my experience.</p>

<p>It can go both ways, how do you know whether that:</p>

<ul>
<li>the brain&#39;s complexity creates consciousness OR</li>
<li>the brain has evolved to be complex so it can &quot;download&quot; consciousness through it (or consciousness experiencing the world through the brain, to be precise)</li>

<p>So the emergence materialist  view vs the dualist idealist view. It can go both ways, and your explanation is just as correct for the other side of the coin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the way you are thinking and particularly the division between materialists and people that believe in a conscious universe. The first ones discard the more rich explanation that the second observe. Materialism is still useful, in things like engineering and technology, but in no sense complete as an over-arching theory of how the world works and our role in it. </p>

<p>My two points:</p>

<ul>
<li>Physics accepts an indivisible unit of matter: the atom (even though this has been redefined subsequently as a different particle, when the first defined atom was split). What if the indivisible unit is consciousness? The capacity to make decisions and drive the universe ahead. </li>
<li>A godlike consciousness might have more capacities, than decision making on an otherwise materialistic universe. Capacities such as creation, of matter, of energy, of consciousness. </li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, a very interesting perspective which will gain ground, as science, has been for so long unable to make the next jump. There has not been a scientific breakthrough (only major technological ones, or refinements) in the fundamental way we understand the cosmos since before WW2. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would go a step further. Stochasticity and probabilities have already been incorporated in classical engineering. They are not interpreted as conscious actions on the system, but rather than noise, or unmeasured effects. The deep 5th element comes from the ability to make the engineered system interact with human beings and other conscious entities. This is the reason, that people with amazing interaction skills (say Steve Jobs) take a heavily engineered system, and guide this way to appeal to the masses and make them love it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the human brain (and by extension, life) in all of its complexity and millions of years of evolution has got to a point where when a baby human is born, the cells wire together in such a way that a conscious experience manifests. You&#39;re not conscious from the very first moment you&#39;re born, as you are now - think; when do you first remember consciously being aware of yourself, of the world, of being alive? Perhaps in a flash one day, or perhaps you can&#39;t remember it... likely because the process takes years of development in the brain, slowly leading to higher and higher levels of consciousness.  </p>

<p>And I think that&#39;s the answer - that the brain can grow more and more complex, more intelligent, more aware with enough learning and the right environment to learn and expand (we can see its potential in extremely intelligent people or people with specific capabilities for certain things, it&#39;s just that in those people it&#39;s somewhat rarer or perhaps uncontrolled.) I think that the way we teach our children to think and the general way society is definitely doesn&#39;t utilise or make huge headway into exploring realms of higher intelligence and consciousness, of the real capabilities of a human being... you could say that in some way the food we eat and the entertainment we consume also mires us, if you want to get into that kind of conspiracy, but really it&#39;s society and its products that bind us, with the strength of the crowd, with the level to which we&#39;re taught how to think, be, act, the potential of a life. We are products of our society, all a part of the wider, shared consciousness, each doing it in relatively similar ways, but with our own unique twists or takes on things.  </p>

<p>Some go a little further, push the boat out, change things, and those that stick their heads above the crowds are the ones that get noticed. We have immense capability, and the power really does lie with us in the end. Yes, we need help and teaching and guidance, but it&#39;s entirely possible to be liberated in yourself.<br/>
There&#39;s this stupid picture of an &quot;Anarchist&quot; type or protester being carried away by police, (can&#39;t find it online after looking, maybe someone else knows it) and the protester is portrayed as being entirely free, content, even though they&#39;re being detained, because their system of control can&#39;t penetrate that individuals consciousness as it&#39;s trained, strong.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;ve spiralled off topic and into my ideas of consciousness... to bring it back to death, I feel that when we do die the amazingly intricate machine that we&#39;ve grown and has allowed us to experience consciousness falls apart, and with it that conscious experience. Individual consciousness dies, but the group&#39;s consciousness lives on, and within that any influence or teachings that the individual consciousness was able to bring to the party... so we might &quot;live on&quot; in some way, our legacy has reprocussions, but as far as conscious control of this exact body... goodnight.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d say it was worth it though... being alive, conscious... compared to its opposite, it&#39;s the most delicate, wonderful, impossible gift imaginable, and we all have it, in whatever degree. Plenty to do, here, and we can be as free as we desire, in a way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I can remember as far back as being 3 years old, and I felt the same way about myself back then as I do now, I feel the same “entity”, even though my body literally changes every nanosecond.
So this alone should debunk materialism, there is no way that consciousness is dependent on the body.&quot;</p>

<p>This is incredible, if you were truly honest with yourself you would entertain, if not outright admit, that you most likely only resist, intuitively, thinking of yourself as different (the most likely reality) throughout your decades-long life stages so as to not be confronted by what would be the overwhelmingly vertiginous stages of the underlying neurological variety you yourself so very well describe.</p>

<p>As T.E. Lawrence somewhat more metalogically wrote of himself: &quot;In my case, the effort for these years to live in the dress of Arabs, and to imitate their mental foundation, quitted me of my English self, and let me look at the West and its conventions with new eyes: they destroyed it all for me. At the same time I could not sincerely take on the Arab skin: it was an affectation only. Easily was a man made an infidel, but hardly might he be converted to another faith. I had dropped one form and not taken on the other, and had… a resultant feeling of intense loneliness in life, and a contempt, not for other men, but for all they do. Such detachment came at times to a man exhausted by prolonged physical effort and isolation. His body plodded on mechanically, while his reasonable mind left him, and from without looked down critically on him, wondering what that futile lumber did and why. Sometimes these selves would converse in the void; and then madness was very near, as I believe it would be near the man who could see things through the veils at once of two customs, two educations, two environments.&quot;</p>

<p>Actually believe it or not I do remember my birth and parts probably just prior to birth. 
When small I used to get flashbacks when going to sleep, these would be feeling very real and I kind of liked them so I focussed on them. The flashbacks were where I was being squashed by walls, the walls were &#39;evil&#39;, dark and very scary, caving in on me. The next moment in the flashback everything is bright white, just whiteness, and the overwhelming feeling that everything is perfect and exactly right and as it should be, pefectly safe. 
This flashback would continue several times and I would get them often. I didn&#39;t know what it was at the time, maybe I was 5-7 years old. Then much later in my teens I suddenly remembered them and quickly realised that this is of course flashback to my birth.  It all makes sense. </p>

<p>So anyway, long story short, people can remember their birth or just before it. There are also many studies showing f.ex. if the mother plays classical music to the baby in the womb then this is beneficial. </p>

<p>So personally I believe if the soul enters the body it does so at conception or when the first brain connections are made. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read a book on Astral Travel once, it was very interesting but I forgot the title (I think it was a green cover). </p>

<p>Anyway there theory in that is like this:</p>

<p>&#39;God&#39; is a big ball of &#39;energy&#39;.</p>

<p>A tiny part of the energy is used to create a new animal.</p>

<p>The animal, say an ant, lives and gains experience, as it gains experience it&#39;s &#39;energy&#39; level increases. </p>

<p>After it dies it&#39;s energy is re-incarnated into another ant. </p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>Once it has learned everything there is about being an ant, it&#39;s energy level is not increasing anymore. So when it dies, it gets re-incarnated as something a bit more complex. Maybe a bee. </p>

<p>And so it goes.</p>

<p>Eventually its energy is so large it gets re-incarned as the most complex being there is which is a human. </p>

<p>After many incarnations as human, energy can no longer increase.</p>

<p>After death, the human conciousness joins two others to become a triniy and exist on the Astral level, and after more time/incarnations there the trinity will join two other trinities and become a 9th (i.e made up of 9 consciousnesses which have now merged). </p>

<p>Eventually this 9th goes back to the God ball of energy. </p>

<p>So the God ball basically keeps increasing. </p>

<p><em>The whole purpose of the universe and life is for this energy to keep increasing forever.</em></p>

<p>Also, when you get re-incarnated on earth you get to choose your parents, because while you are dead you realize this whole scheme, and so you choose parents that will give you a <em>new</em> experience (in order to increase your energy).  So you might choose two criminal drugaddicts as parents because this is something new, or you might choose to be son of a billionaire etc etc. You get to try everything once at least. This is what might be called &#39;judgement day&#39;, but it is not &#39;God&#39; that is judging you, it is simply your own consciousness judging your life and deciding what to try next, it&#39;s not about what is &#39;good&#39; or &#39;bad&#39; (because no such thing exist, only experience exist).</p>

<p>Thanks for reading. Let me know if you know what book I am talking about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps when your soul enters a fresh brain then any prior knowledge is stored in the unconscious part of the brain. </p>

<p>Or perhaps you don&#39;t retain any knowledge at all! Memory is not required for re-incarnation, your soul can be separate from your memory. I think this makes the most sense. Your soul &#39;energy&#39; increases with more knowledge, but the knowledge itself is lost when you die. Maybe knowledge/memory is what is stored in the synaptic connections in the brain, which is obviously lost when you die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been thinking of your question for about two hours this morning.  I believe the myth is always greater than the reality, whether it be ancient history or my life.  Whether they were real people or not I have no clue.  People want to teach, and it sometimes is easier to convince others of your wisdom by claiming it is not yours but some older, wiser person’s. </p>

<p>I know I’m real, not because I think, but because I feel emotions.  I drift, I feel, I think, I experience, therefore I am.  Lol, what garbage some of this is, but it is so real.</p>

For example, some say Plato’s original work has survived for 2400 years but silence has dated the oldest manuscript 1600 years after his death.  Maybe the authors channeled Plato and it is his thoughts while the true authors were using psychedelics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The scary part is, what if the illusion of consciousness is just our collective brain process dealing with autonomy of itself. After all we do spend a long time tending to our inner voice, the inner monologue conversing with ourselves essentially the inner and the outer you. The primal emotional, objective well being driven individual coupled with a controlling intelect of knowledge and experiences. You see not everyone is enlightened, not everyone can understand and think about multi faucet mechanics of the simplest things. It costs too much brain power/energy thats why there are a lot of sheep in this world, trained for repetitive tasks of the industrial revolution. How much energy and time is spent teaching and advertising global effects and individuals are still slow to change for that better tomorrow we all want. That collection individual, of the family, of the friend of the community of the global and online identity is us. And the functioning now, that innevoice the collection of the recent and past the needs of now and tomorrow is the you. But that is an unknown, just like Ops theory. But it goes to show, that either way, what we define as alive/conscious will be a wake up call for us, as the animals we consume and breed just to feed us is actually quite gruesome, and if there are alinens I bet that is why they arent open with us, as we still eat each other. </p>

<p>Not at all.  Indeed, most cognitive scientists today believe that consciousness is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emergent property</a> of our brains, nervous system and body in general.</p>

<p>Even religious people just pretend that they believe in a God, but deep in their minds they are also nihilist materialists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can you possibly know this?  Indeed, why does this even make sense?  &quot;God did it&quot; is a really simple explanation for everything.  It you aren&#39;t a deep thinker, it&#39;s very convenient - you can use it on any sort of question at all, and it&#39;s impossible to refute.  I&#39;m sure the overwhelming majority of people believe &quot;God did it&quot; and then never give it much thought at all.</p>

<p>Not at all. Indeed, most cognitive scientists today believe that consciousness is an emergent property of our brains, nervous system and body in general.</p>

<p>Yes but as I said to another user, emerging from where?</p>

<p>This is the hard problem, if all matter is &quot;dumb&quot;, then creating intelligence from that is impossible.</p>

<p>So there must be an essence in there that &quot;emerges&quot; once a nervous system becomes complex enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are all pieces of the &quot;creator&quot; (whichever name used is irrelevant). In order to know what the creator is, this entity created the universe and fractally split itself into pieces. Each piece is a soul. Each soul&#39;s pourpose is to use it&#39;s free will to experience the universe. This all feeds back into the global consiousness. When we die, it&#39;s like hitting your reset button and after a while you get to try again. It&#39;s up to the individual if they wish to develop spiritually or not. </p>

<p>Nothing is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;, and everything we create only helps us as a whole through the global consiousness, as it is close to becoming self aware. This is when humanity will finally realize that we are all the same and start working together as a species. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps when your soul enters a fresh brain then any prior knowledge is stored in the unconscious part of the brain. </p>

<p>Or perhaps you don&#39;t retain any knowledge at all! Memory is not required for re-incarnation, your soul can be separate from your memory. I think this makes the most sense. Your soul &#39;energy&#39; increases with more knowledge, but the knowledge itself is lost when you die. Maybe knowledge/memory is what is stored in the synaptic connections in the brain, which is obviously lost when you die.</p>
