       Bannon doesn't have policies, he's a journalist and a citizen not an elected political representative.

       Bannon did represent many good ideas in the Trump adminstration. That's why he had to go. I don't think you should be surprised. I'm only surprised the guy seems to sincerely be in favor of some good policies. I thought he was just playing the fake populism game to get people to like Trump.

       That said, Bannon is not a good person to look up to. You're right that a handful of his positions would be great for the administration to take on, but other people better than him have said the same good things he has and more. And they did it without the bad shit and without being branded a Nazi or whatever horrible thing the media decided he is.

       What's wrong with Bannon? Just because Stephen Colbert calls him racist doesn't mean he is. The only evidence is his ex-wife in court accused him of it. Of course that's more than enough for Democrats to jump on.

       There is literally nothing wrong with bannon . He's a great guy with some great ideas and great policies. Just because you don't like the color of his skin or the type of hair he has or the way he looks isn't a good  excuse

       Every politicians says either: I'll raise taxes on the rich, it will be good for everyone else; or: I'll cut taxes on the rich, it will be good for everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ineveitably if they win they all cut taxes on the rich. Who cares what he said he would about taxes? A politician and his promises are soon parted.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: you are also forgetting that the nominal tax rate is one thing, inevitably they add so many loopholes and clauses, the real tax rate ends up being much lower.
