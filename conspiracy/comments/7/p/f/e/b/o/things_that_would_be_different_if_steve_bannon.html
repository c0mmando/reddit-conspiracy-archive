<p>Hillary would be in jail</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/07/27/steve-bannon-wants-facebook-and-google-regulated-like-utilities/">The fcc would have expanded net neutrality to include facebook and google. Registering them as public utilities.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/04/kushner-and-bannon-battle-for-the-soul-of-the-trump-white-house/522213/">Trump never would have hired kushner. And by extension jeff sessions. So marijuana would still be legal</a></p>

<p>But you hate him because he&#39;s an old white guy and Stephen Colbert called him racist</p>

<p>Edit: its cery telling whats happened to this sub</p>

<p>It went from being against the rich and corruption to openly supporting them and the policies they want u to believe</p>

<p>This sub attacks anyone whos against the corruption</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bannon did represent many good ideas in the Trump adminstration. That&#39;s why he had to go. I don&#39;t think you should be surprised. I&#39;m only surprised the guy seems to sincerely be in favor of some good policies. I thought he was just playing the fake populism game to get people to like Trump.</p>

<p>That said, Bannon is not a good person to look up to. You&#39;re right that a handful of his positions would be great for the administration to take on, but other people better than him have said the same good things he has and more. And they did it without the bad shit and without being branded a Nazi or whatever horrible thing the media decided he is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every politicians says either: I&#39;ll raise taxes on the rich, it will be good for everyone else; or: I&#39;ll cut taxes on the rich, it will be good for everyone else.</p>

<p>Ineveitably if they win they all cut taxes on the rich. Who cares what he said he would about taxes? A politician and his promises are soon parted.</p>

<p>EDIT: you are also forgetting that the nominal tax rate is one thing, inevitably they add so many loopholes and clauses, the real tax rate ends up being much lower.</p>
