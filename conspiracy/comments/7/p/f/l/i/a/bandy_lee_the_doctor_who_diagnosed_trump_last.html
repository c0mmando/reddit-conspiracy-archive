Yet she was pushed by the media as an expert for the entire week and hailed as credible source who also met with the republican leadership on the hill. She didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Who picks up these people and who is pushing for them to get so much exposure? </p>

<p>Who is behind the effort to build them up?</p>

<p>I have two examples from top of my mind right now, this &quot;doc&quot; and the Cambridge librarian who declared Dr Seuss racist... these two ladies ended up being as disposable as toilet paper after their job was done. Are these people and probably others on some sort of list of potential sheep for the greater good in the resistance/deep state? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While you argue that the current status of her medical licenses disallows Lee from making public statement&#39;s regarding the president&#39;s mental health, something that Lee is claiming she is not attempting to diagnosis from afar, I believe that your, I&#39;m assuming, lack of formal legal education and entrance into the bar, disallow you from making statements regarding the legal definition of a coup in regards to article iv of the 25th amendment. I guess we just have to agree that we have differing view points. I do find it interesting, though, that the crux of your argument against Lee making her statements is simply in regards to her legal medical ability to do so with her licensing having expired and not in regards to the potential correctness of her statements nor to the issue if her statements have pushed the envelope of the Goldwater rule ethically too far.  </p>

<p>Google shows it in Queens, NY. Not too hard to find it if you search her name and &quot;New York Medical License&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You must be eligible to practice medicine in CT if you are a clinical professor in CT</p>

<p>Her employer has nothing to do with the article in the NY Times. She is a fully certified doctor in NY. If you have a problem with Yale having an assistant clinical professor that has a pending application, you should probably notify Yale and/or the medical licensing board. Her current profile on the CT government licensing verification website says: &quot;Are you actively involved in patient care? &quot;No&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I&#39;m guessing she taught a basic science related course at Yale</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not even... &quot;She has been teaching students studying to be public defenders and to become asylum attorneys at Yale Law School since 2003, and a Global Health Studies course of her design, “Violence: Causes and Cures,” since 2013. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which peers would that be?</p>

<p>Practicing without a license is a crime. Not a small one either so if you have proof, go for it.</p>

<p>You really ought to link some sources for either of those claims.</p>

<p>Anyway, in her own words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While we keep within the letter of the Goldwater rule – which prohibits psychiatrists from diagnosing public figures without a personal examination and without consent – there is still a lot that mental health professionals can tell before the public reaches awareness. These come from observations of a person’s patterns of responses, of media appearances over time, and from reports of those close to him. Indeed, we know far more about Trump in this regard than many, if not most, of our patients. Nevertheless, the personal health of a public figure is her private affair – until, that is, it becomes a threat to public health.</p>

<p>To make a diagnosis one needs all the relevant information – including, I believe, a personal interview. But to assess dangerousness, one only needs enough information to raise alarms. It is about the situation rather than the person. The same person may not be a danger in a different situation, while a diagnosis stays with the person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hm that&#39;s interesting. It&#39;s against the APA ethics code to diagnose a public figure that the professional had not examined personally. It&#39;s been dubbed the &quot;Goldwater Rule&quot; because of a similar situation in the 1964 election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a doctor, psychiatrist or psychologist calling an opinion a diagnosis when they haven&#39;t personally examined or even spoken to the subject is unethical no matter what you call it.  </p>

<p>Dr. Lee apparently interviewed Senators who have been in the same room with Trump.  A credible medical diagnosis cannot be made on such limited interaction.  Which is essentially zero interaction with the person sought to be diagnosed.  Her research is basically hearsay, aka gossip.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to <a href="http://www.kabc.com/2018/01/09/psychiatrist-warning-about-trumps-mental-state-admits-lincoln-roosevelt-also-concerning/">this article</a> citing her interview with Dr. Drew, she stopped short of making a diagnosis.  </p>

<p>She did contradict a statement she made in December regarding Trump&#39;s fitness to be president where she stated Trump&#39;s mental health was a national emergency and that Trump posed a danger to the human species.    </p>

<p>&quot;Dr. Lee insisted she was not attempting to diagnose President Trump’s mental health; but rather warning that his behavior and actions pose a direct and indirect threat to public health because he has shown violent tendencies.</p>

<p>This would seem to contradict her December statements that “Mr. Trump is showing signs of impairment that the average person could not see,” that “he is becoming very unstable very quickly,” and that “there is a need for neuropsychiatric evaluation that would demonstrate his capacity to serve.”</p>

<p>She also stated concerns regarding the relative mental fitness of Teddy Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln.</p>
