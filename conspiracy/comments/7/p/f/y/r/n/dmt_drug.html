        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>DMT is a drug that is illegal in a lot of countries. For instance, in the country where I live (the netherlands), it is classified as a list 1 drug. So this drug is really powerful and thus illegal.</p>

<p>The weird thing is. DMT is within our body. One of the most powerful drugs is actually found in our body. Why?(i dont know) Where? The pineal gland.</p>

<p>Wait? the pineal gland? Isn&#39;t that what all this third eye bullshit is all about?</p>

<p>Yes. And it might aswell be no bullshit.</p>

<p>DMT was used as medicine, curing severe addictions. But.. If it has benefits for us and if it can cure us, then why is it banned? I&#39;d say someone is trying to control us, or someone wants to make money out of it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, DMT has historically been prepared by various cultures for ritual and healing purposes. Even in ancient egypt, they (MOST LIKELY) used this drug. Altough it is not accepted by historians yet.</p>

<p>There is a lot of mystery around this drug, thats why i wanted to ask this subreddit.</p>

<p>Has anyone here used it? If yes, what is your experience with it? Can anyone tell me more about DMT?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard about DMT about 4 years ago the first time, and then I followed with enthusiasm the unbelievably similar descriptions of the people.</p>

<p>Until the moment I decided to try it myself, that was last year.</p>

<p>Since I didn&#39;t know anyone who had DMT or was able to get it. I made it myself with little effort, it was very simple.</p>

<p>The same day I smoked it twice, and never again after that, because it&#39;s scary and incredibly strong.</p>

<p>Everything you know, everything you believe to be, everything you perceive as reality is broken down into its components and put together in a completely new image.</p>

<p>I have a lot of experience with LSD and mushrooms, but what DMT did to me I was not prepared for it.
Don&#39;t get me wrong, it was good but also incredibly frightening, so much so that I have something like PTSD 
when I think about it.</p>

<p>To my trip:</p>

<p>I wanted to do everything right, so I made myself comfortable, started a Youtube video with Ambiente Sound which was about 90 min long, and set myself up to take three big hits out of my bong, which I had previously filled with ~ 50mg DMT.</p>

<p>I started My lighter took my first hit, and now I felt it, it was fast, it was very fast, and I immediately realized I would not be able to take another hit.
That was the first time DMT said to me,&quot; Surprise Bitch.&quot;</p>

<p>Then the journey began and I can&#39;t describe it better than this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scBY3cVyeyA">scene</a> from the film Contact, that was exactly what I experienced within seconds.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t explain the sound that accompanied all this with words, so it must sound when reality itself is torn apart.
The next thing I experienced is best described with the scene from the movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtTkcM9BfXM">Interstellar</a> but it looked different, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnh1aepYQAs">here</a> at 45 sec.</p>

<p>The second time the DMT said &quot; Surprise bitch&quot; to me.
I could now write 1 million words about what I have experienced and felt, but it wouldn&#39;t be enough to explain that.
Therefore here only briefly outlined, the journey lasted eons and I have lived all ages and every person that was, and still will be. I have seen the fabric from which reality is woven, and I could see the connection in everything.</p>

<p>That makes no sense to you?
Believe me, I can&#39;t explain it any better, I could only paraphrase it further.
When the journey was over, I looked at the YouTube video to see how long I was gone, and DMT told me the third time &quot; Surprise Bitch&quot;.</p>

<p>I was gone for 45min, and all my researches showed that the trip should take between 5 -15 minutes.</p>

<p>That was kind of scary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>50mg is a medium high dose, definitely not too much to take. Back when I messed with DMT I read everything I could about it and ended up with the impression I should shoot for 60mg. Did this a million times and so did everyone else I introduced to the drug. You might be thinking of 5-MEO-DMT which maxes out at around 15mg.</p>

<p>That&#39;s legit how I&#39;ve been describing it to people. Combine that scene with the scene from &quot;2001&quot; when Dave enters the vortex after he follows the new monolith.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My method was &quot;straight-to-base extraction&quot;.
That was so easy, you have to be careful not to do this accidentally.
;)</p>

<p>Water lye and plant material, are from time to time<br/>
together in a glass jar  .</p>

<p>But then you also accidentally poured lighter fluid into it, very light and slow shaking doesn&#39;t change it any more, but you can see the lighter fluid turns yellowish.</p>

<p>Well well, then you have to try to separate the lighter fuel from the water with a beepette.</p>

<p>You were  stupid,
and forgot where the bottle of lighter fluid was, so you put fhe lighter fluid in a casserole dish and pulled cellophane over it.
But what do you do then? </p>

<p>you were confused for a moment and put it in the freezer, but the next day you become aware of the mistake.</p>

<p>The lighter fuel must have gone bad overnight, because in the casserole dish are now yellowish-white crystals, you naturally want to save the fluid and pour it back into the water&#39;s lye and plant material mixture.</p>

<p>And it all starts all over again, as you can see it&#39;s dangerously simple, and you have to be very careful not to do it accidentally.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard the yellowish-white crystals are also good for something, but how to make them, you have to read a little bit more.</p>

<p>Here I just wanted to teach you not to pour lighter fuel into the water lye plant material mixture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had the opportunity to get a hold of 2 grams of DMT a couple years ago. I&#39;d read about it for years until I finally got my hands on some. Not knowing the reality of it, I did a lot of experimenting.</p>

<p>It came as a yellow/orange crystal powder, sort of like kief from pot. So I would take a tiny weed nug, and then sprinkle some DMT on it. The first time was only a couple little crystals over the top of a tiny nug. It was right after I had woken up that morning, I sat on the edge of my bed and took the rip.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed was a heightened visual ability. Everything seemed more vivid than normal. Then my point of view slowly began to elevate above my body. Next thing I know, I&#39;m look down at myself from a couple feet above and behind myself. I didn&#39;t feel any fear. It was oddly comfortable, and I felt very calm. I&#39;m not sure how long that lasted, but eventually I willed myself to float back down and it was over.</p>

<p>A couple days later, I went to a friends house and decided to try a little more. I was sitting at a kitchen table and sprinkled a small amount onto a bowl. It was significantly more than the first time, but still not very much. The taste reminded me of harsh plastic and old people. Not the people themselves, but how your grandparents house smells.</p>

<p>I held in the smoke for as long as I felt comfortable. All of a sudden all the walls of the house began to rapidly change color, like a strobe with alternating bright colors. No two walls were the same color at any point. After observing this for a short time, I felt like I was floating again. But this time it was my whole body, and the chair I was sitting on. I didn&#39;t leave my body, but my chair was now levitating several feet above the floor. This panicked me a little bit, because I didn&#39;t want to fall off the chair. Of course in reality the chair was on the floor, but I got off it quickly.</p>

<p>This same night, one of my friends had been drinking and wanted to try it. I told him I didn&#39;t know how it would interact with alcohol, but he was persistent about wanting to try. I gave him a very significant dose, since I assumed he may not get another chance to try it.</p>

<p>He took the rip while sitting on the couch. He closed his eyes for almost an entire minute. Without warning, his eyes shot open and were filled with fear. He jumped up from the couch and ran outside and vomited heavily into the bushes. When he got back inside, he had total amnesia of the event. My theory was that the DMT rejected him because of the alcohol. I feel it is something to be greatly respected and treated with reverence.</p>

<p>The last time I tried DMT was my attempt at a breakthrough dose. I had experienced ego death only once before, and that was through salvia. I&#39;ll never do salvia again though, because the lack of control frightens me.</p>

<p>I was in my parents garage where I had a sweet hang out spot set up to play xbox with my friends. I figured it was a good time to give a breakthrough dose a try because no one was home and my friend could babysit me while he played games. The trip only lasts around 10 minutes, so it&#39;s not a huge time commitment like acid or shrooms.</p>

<p>I poured the biggest pile of DMT I could onto the bowl and took a huge rip. As usual, I held the smoke in. I noticed kaleidoscopic patterns developing with my eyes open, so I figured I would go all the way and close them. It was like a kaleidoscope had merged with some sort of worm hole through space, and I was flying through it. I saw beings that were not human flying around me, and memories of friends and family were coming to my mind. I felt I was about to finally breakthrough, when something terrifying happened. </p>

<p>I felt everything begin to rumble like an earthquake. So I opened my eyes and was bombarded with an incredibly bright light. My sister had come home and walked into the garage and then opened the damn garage door. It scared the shit out of me. I was immediately kicked out of my trip, and had to come back to reality.</p>

<p>That was many years ago, but I am still waiting for another opportunity to arise where I can reconnect with DMT. It really is the most beautiful experience I&#39;ve had from a hallucinogenic drug.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, i might have stated it wrongly. Let me have another try:
DMT is ONLY found within the pineal gland. The gland that is known to produce melatonin and seratonin. 
In ancient times they thought that through the pineal gland, you could communicate with your higher self. They said the pineal gland was then known as the seat of the soul.</p>

<p>Whenever anyone is in a extreme stressful situation. Like when you are in a near-death experience. The pineal gland produces a shit ton of DMT. 
Ask anyone that has a near-death experience what they saw. Pretty interesting.</p>

<p>So i am going to ask you the same questions:
Have you ever used it? What is your opinion about it?</p>

<p>In humans? Maybe but it is found elsewhere in nature.</p>

<p>I know what DMT is, though I haven&#39;t taken it. Yes it&#39;s released near death when your body has exhausted all options.</p>

<p>As to the philosophical aspects, I can&#39;t comment. Many people report epiphany like feelings, would certainly be interesting to explore.</p>

<p>I recommend having a look at erowid if you haven&#39;t already!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rene Descartes called the pineal gland the bridge between soul and body. Also interesting to note when we die the pineal gland releases a shit ton of DMT. </p>

<p>At the bottom of every rabbit hole lies some harsh spiritual reality. Humans have been devoid of our spiritual capabilities for an incredibly long time. Nearly every facet of our society (even worse in the west) tries to shut down our spirituality. Our food calcifies all the glands in our bodies that are connected to each of the chakras. The media we consume is designed to keep us trapped in low frequency. Dogma is all too popular.</p>

<p>The change has arrived though. With the polar shift human frequencies are rising unprecedentedly. It&#39;s no coincidence conspiracies have hit mainstream and people everywhere are in an existential crisis. Revolutionary spirit is seen throughout the world (Trump, brexit, Catalonia, etc.). The difference is today&#39;s world since 2012 is incredible compared to the change from 2002-2012. It is exponential. Dark ages were necessary for our spiritual growth but the clock has turned from descension to ascension. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all the idea that DMT is produced in the pineal gland is a theory put forth by the author of &quot;the spirit molecule&quot; not a proven fact. I have read the book and while I think its is worth a read I would caution people not to take every line as science fact. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve done DMT quite a few times but its been almost a decade. I would suggest you look at this sight for things like trip reports and general information.   <a href="https://wiki.dmt-nexus.me">https://wiki.dmt-nexus.me</a></p>

<p>Is DMT a conspiracy? I can understand why people might consider aspects of it to be. If you subscribe to the whole pineal glad/third eye thing that is a rabbit hole you can go down. Its called the pineal gland because it literally looks like a pine cone. Check out all the pine cones present at the Vatican for example. Interestingly it was Rene Descartes who postulated the idea of the pineal gland being the &quot;seat of the soul&quot;. Because Descartes was a big deal in the catholic church that might be why they adopted some of this imagery.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=vatican+pine+cones&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;tbo=u&amp;amp;source=univ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiy9Iqb2M3YAhVO6GMKHQjkD3UQsAQIMg&amp;amp;biw=1355&amp;amp;bih=749">https://www.google.com/search?q=vatican+pine+cones&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;tbo=u&amp;amp;source=univ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiy9Iqb2M3YAhVO6GMKHQjkD3UQsAQIMg&amp;amp;biw=1355&amp;amp;bih=749</a></p>

<p>As for personal experiences well... I have &quot;talked&quot; to entities while under the influence of DMT and I would describe those experiences as some of the most profound of my life. Was it all just a dream generated by my brain or something more? That is a question I think a person can only answer for themselves.    </p>

<p>You can see this in the comments on this very thread like this one:
&quot;Also interesting to note when we die the pineal gland releases a shit ton of DMT.&quot;</p>

<p>These kind of matter of fact statements irk me because again we don&#39;t know for sure that DMT is produced in the pineal gland and we certainly don&#39;t know if when you die or dream it &quot;produces a shit ton of DMT&quot; and even if it did would that give rise to the same or similar kind of effect that say smoking it freebase does?... do you see what I am getting at here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes NDEs are very interesting... so are bigfoot sightings and alien abductions. I find all of these witness experiences interesting and I think they are worth talking about and studying. </p>

<p>As far as DMT and NDEs its an interesting potential explanation. Unfortunately there is no actual evidence to suggest they are related. they could be, but we don&#39;t know that and talking about it like its a fact is misleading.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i took LSD at a festival, like i had done every year as a one time thing vacation for the year, and i have experienced the effects of weak doses vs stronger doses, same with mushrooms.  </p>

<p>Higher doses of mushrooms gave me the &quot;i cant move, cause all i see is kaleidoscope shit&quot; but i hadnt seen any hard visuals like that from any LSD trip....until my last time taking LSD  </p>

<p>I took just 1 dose, but the guy said it was a big dose, which i figured was perfect for the day, but as soon as night hit and the light shows started, man o man i had demonic visuals no doubt.<br/>
One point i saw massive red hands over the crowd playing us all like puppets, and noticed more darker symbolism during this period than i ever had. So i figured i was done for the night, went back to my tent since i was not enjoying the trip, and just slept it away easily.  </p>

<p>But yea, wierd stuff. On mushrooms i had a mega intense trip where something kept telling me &quot;youre a leader no one wants to follow&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religions are a tool people use to construct a reality. We all do this in one way or another. My big take away from all my psychedelic experiences is that yes there are things we don&#39;t &quot;see&quot; in our day to day reality, but spending too much time and energy delving into those other places can be counter productive. We live in <em>this</em> world and the more removed you become from it the harder it becomes to make your way in it. Life is about lessons and piercing the veil is a bit like peaking at the test answers. That is not to say those experiences are without value, but don&#39;t lose yourself in the ether.   </p>

Your statement about peaking at the test answers resonates with my attitude towards DMT, after my two experiences. </p>

<p>IF: dmt is a part of what allows consciousness to enter and leave various realms of existence, then are we cheating nature by piercing this veil? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Using DMT is Sorcery (pharmakia).  These types of drugs are used in Occult practices to &quot;fill your chalice&quot;</p>

<p>When you use these drugs it opens you up more to the spiritual world.  The only spirits that interact with them are Lucfier&#39;s principalities and powers (devils).  The more you fit inside you the more power you get from Lucifer and the more deceived and lost you will become.  They will appear to be anything you want.  Aliens, dead relative, yourself form another dimension, literally anything.</p>

<p>Eventually these spiritual entities will begin to torment you because that&#39;s all they really want.  When that happens invoke the name the Lord Jesus Christ and see what happens.  They know he is their Lord and his very name has power over them.</p>

<p>Mar 5:2  And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, 
Mar 5:3  Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains: 
Mar 5:4  Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him. 
Mar 5:5  And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones. 
Mar 5:6  But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him, 
Mar 5:7  And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not. 
Mar 5:8  For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit. 
Mar 5:9  And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many. 
Mar 5:10  And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. 
Mar 5:11  Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding. 
Mar 5:12  And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. 
Mar 5:13  And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea. 
Mar 5:14  And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done. 
Mar 5:15  And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. </p>

<p>You can be saved by the grace of God through the sacrifice made by him as he manifested in the flesh as Jesus Christ.  Simply repent and believe his Gospel which is:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>It&#39;s really that simple.  He did everything for you.  There is nothing you can do yourself.  Just tell him the best way you know how that you repent of your unbelief and sinful nature and believe his gospel and he will quicken your spirit and make you alive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So simply believing is salvation?
I tend to believe that we do have to take action to become Christ (enlightened) ourselves.
 I do not want to say that you are wrong. Its just a feeling of mine..</p>

<p>From the bible ive never understood why there is jawheh AND jahovah. I also cant comprehend the 4th  commandment. Do not worship any other God -(which ofcourse tells that there are more)- for I am a JEALOUS God. But doesnt the 10th commandment tell that we should not be jealous?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, only your repentance and belief in what God did for you saves:</p>

<p>Eph 2:8  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 
Eph 2:9  Not of works, lest any man should boast. </p>

<p>There are gods (small g) but no other God.  The gods are Lucifer and his fallen angels.  One of Lucifer&#39;s titles is &quot;the god of this world.&quot;  He is given power here by God.</p>

<p>There is only one God who is Jesus Christ/I AM/jehovah.  He is the most high.  Just as we are all made of Body, Soul, and Spirit God has three parts.  Jesus Christ which is his Body (what we can understand), God the father (can be thought of as the Soul) and the Holy Spirit (spirit).  The reality is we cannot possibly comprehend God he is a great mystery to us.  That&#39;s why the Catholic trinity is not actually the truth (Godhead is the biblical term) and is a subtle deception because God is one being that we just cannot comprehend fully.</p>

<p>Col 2:6  As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: 
Col 2:7  Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. 
Col 2:8  Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. 
Col 2:9  For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. 
Col 2:10  And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power: </p>

<p>Joh 1:1  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 
Joh 1:2  The same was in the beginning with God. 
Joh 1:3  All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. </p>

<p>Joh 1:12  But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: 
Joh 1:13  Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. 
Joh 1:14  And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. </p>

<p>1Ti 3:16  And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I became a Gnostic for a short time before Jesus Christ saved me.  Luckily I was praying to God without really realizing it and he made it very clear who he was.  &quot;Seek and ye shall find&quot; is very true.</p>

<p>Gnosticism is just part of the Babylonian religion.  It can even appear to be very Christian.  Enoch, all the false Gospels (Thomas, Judas, etc) and the like are Gnostic text that are just plagiarizing the Bible.  It&#39;s just another deception Lucifer uses to distract lost souls from finding salvation through Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Modern science also has a ton of Gnosisim hidden in it.  Quantum theory, Theoretical astronomy and Physics is simply repackaged Babaloyonan Gnostsisim being re-fed to humans who have been deceived by false science over the last 500 years.  The magicians have taken off their wizard robes and put on lab coats.  The term &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&quot; is much more true than people know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But gnosticism preaches beautiful things. To become gnostic, to become christ. How can that possibly be work of the devil?
Recently ive heard about gnosticism and it connects with me in sort of a way. I was a christian, but hearing the gnostic stories really changes my belief.</p>

<p>I prayed and still pray to God for wisdom and this is what is popping up on my journey. Why would God allow something bad convincing a follower of him/her? Why would he show me this? I dont understand. What you say makes sense, ofcourse it does. But how can one be sure what is the truth? </p>

<p>Why are there so many religions, if only one of them is the truth?
Gnostics combine those religions in a way i get really attracted to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand where you are coming from.  This happens usually when you wander off the narrow path.  If you started reading Gnostic texts then you can be seduced by the lying spirits.  It comes down to this:</p>

<p>2Co 11:13  For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. 
2Co 11:14  And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. 
2Co 11:15  Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works. </p>

<p>Satan and his devils will seem very good and peaceful.  When the Antichrist comes he will likely appear to be a very marvelous wonderful friendly kind person as far as the world is concerned.  Lucifer used to be the most beautiful creation of God:</p>

<p>Eze 28:13  Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. 
Eze 28:14  Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. 
Eze 28:15  Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. 
Eze 28:16  By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. 
Eze 28:17  Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee. 
Eze 28:18  Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee. 
Eze 28:19  All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more. </p>

<p>Lucifer means the &quot;light bearer&quot; he WAS amazing and glorious but has fallen from pride.  He will look amazing to us if he so chooses!  He was a living spiritual instrument (think of his influence on the music industry)</p>

<p>Consider that perhaps the Lord has put me in your path for this very reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>To become gnostic, to become christ.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing: Gnostics actually teach a misrepresentation of what Christianity itself teaches.</p>

<p>The teaching of Gnosticism is that salvation comes by embracing hidden wisdom which the evil Demiurge wishes to conceal.  Namely, it claims that we are sparks of Divinity that come from the abstract Divine Pleroma.  Sophia saw compassion and gave us access to our full nature but it&#39;s up to us to use it as we see fit.  This is a religion of Apotheosis.  It claims that we&#39;re all secretly God and therefore whatever we do is actually just God&#39;s Will so let&#39;s use it for our benefit however we want.  It&#39;s wrong not because of the picture but because it swaps the primary actor with the recipient.</p>

<p>All forms of Christianity have some representation of a doctrine that the Eastern Orthodox call Theosis or &quot;divinization.&quot;  Catholicism teaches the Beatific Vision.  Protestantism teaches Justification and Sanctification.  But all of these are effective synonyms when understood at the basic level.  Theosis can be summarized in the provocative statement of St. Athanasius from the Third Century: &quot;God became man that man might become God.&quot;  More accurately, we do not become &quot;gods unto ourselves&quot; but rather it is the fact that <em>Christ lives in us through our faith</em> and we become partakers in God&#39;s own Nature through grace because of the Holy Spirit&#39;s work within us.  Through grace we become new creatures founded in Christ&#39;s own nature.</p>

<p>We are initially born as creatures which have been alienated from God by sin which has put our flawed temporal desires above the eternal truth of God.  The sin of Adam has caused our desires to be placed on a pedestal where we trust them more than we trust God.  God&#39;s mercy has caused Him to reveal Himself to us and we are created anew as a creature in Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit.  In Eastern Orthodoxy, they teach Ancestral sin but don&#39;t see it as a binding on human nature in the same way as we do in Western traditions.  In Western Christianity this is what we call Original Sin and it is understood as a major impediment to recognizing grace properly which must be overcome by God&#39;s work.  But either way, it is evident that the work of God by grace has been opposed in us by the devil who seeks to revert us back to fallen creatures acting without grace.</p>

<p>As I said, all the pieces are there in Gnosticism but the actor and recipient are inverted.  In Christianity, God is primary actor through grace and man is the representative of God.  Man&#39;s obedience is a reflection of God&#39;s image working within us.  In Gnosticism, man is the primary actor and God is the tool to be used for an occult benefit to make you better than other people who are ignorant of the secret because you&#39;re not a slave to the Plato&#39;s cave delusion anymore but know the &quot;true&quot; order of reality and can better serve your own desires.  The other difference here is that it&#39;s not the evil &quot;Creator of Matter&quot; (Demiurge) that is deceiving us so that he can exploit our Divinity, but a secondary spirit who is deceiving us to alienate us from God to harm us and undermine our relationship with God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read and study the King James Bible led by the Holy Spirit which I received by the grace of God through his finished work on the cross. He came to earth in the flesh as Jesus Christ and allowed himself to be sacrificed to wash away our sins with his blood (the lamb of God).</p>

<p>All you need to do to receive the Holy Spirit is repent of your current sinful state (we are all sinners, every single human and sin is just a thing God himself defines) and believe the Gospel which is:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>Once you have truly repented and believed the above in your heart you will be saved.  You can only be saved once you realize there is nothing you can do yourself.  No being a good person, no good works, no going to a church, no donating money, no nothing!  You can only trust in what Jesus Christ did for you.  Once you have done this he sends his Holy Spirit to dwell in you and teach you all things.  You will be able to actually understand the King James Bible as it is a living spiritual scripture and not just a book.  Your spirit will be quickened and you will be alive (spiritually) for the first time in your life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes every bit of it is literal.  After being saved I believe anything that contradicts it to be a deception. Coming at it from that angle makes it plain to see.  Here is an example:</p>

<p>Gen 1:16  And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. </p>

<p>Here God made two lights.  He didn&#39;t make one light and a rock to bounce the other off of.  Just this alone would mean NASA and every space agency is lying.  The entire cosmology the world teaches is also a deception.  I observe the moon with my telescope now and can clearly see it&#39;s a light and very close.  It&#39;s not even anything you can land on.  I also went and looked at NASA stuff and I can clearly see all the deception.  ISS uses green screen and Augmented reality.  Moon landings are laughable how fake they are.  You can use a magnifying glass and focus moonlight to cool objects just the opposite of the sun.  That makes no sense from a scientific standpoint but it makes perfect sense if the moon has it&#39;s own unique light.</p>

<p>So as you can see I take the King James Bible very literally now.  I know this may be where I lose you but it&#39;s part of my testimony.  NASA and space agencies are lying about everything.  They are all Masons (who worship the Light bearer) putting on a show for the world and the purpose of it is to hide the fact that the Bible is literally true.</p>

<p>Given the vastness of this conspiracy it means that nations are just an illusion.  They are all actually just working together to control us.  Media is all lies, science is full of lies.  Basically the entire world is set up as a Luciferian deception.  So do I think science could be faking how smart some of these animals are?  Absolutely.  There is no lie too big, and no lie too small.  This video kind of summarizes this:</p>

<p>You are on a conspiracy subreddit...   </p>

<p>In a thread about the most potent and challenging psychedelic (the etymology of the word mind-psyche, expanding-delia)...</p>

<p>You are spouting extremely vague scriptures from a literal &quot;version&quot;(king James) of a &#39;holy scripture&#39; that is full of inaccuracies and malice, with no intention of considering you might be wrong. </p>

<p>You are probably insulating your own &quot;salvation&quot; and props to you if that&#39;s working out for you but do it quietly, you&#39;re not saving anyone you&#39;re just like all those other loud obnoxious street preachers.

    <div class="md"><p>Your right, I&#39;m at the end of the rabbit hole just telling the truth.  There is nowhere else for me to go.  I have had plenty of experience with psychedelics as well while I was lost.  I&#39;m speaking from experience.  There are many types of hearts some are fertile ground to have the word of God planted.  Some are hardened and cannot possibly hear.  Some have a chance but Lucifer steals it away.  I have no idea what kind of heart you have but all I&#39;m doing is attempting to plant a seed or water one that has already been planted.  Perhaps your heart is hardened.  Perhaps not.  Either way, are others that will see the truth in what I say.  Even if only one person in 20 years of online preaching found the truth it would be worth it.  That is +1 eternal soul snatched away from Lucifer.  You have no idea how precious that is.  Every single conspiracy in the world ties back to attempting to hide God from people.  This is the rabbit hole that helped me find God so I&#39;m simply giving my testimony and experience.  I am no more loud or quiet than anyone else as these are just my words manifested as light coming into your eyes on a screen.</p>

<p>Mat 13:18  Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. 
Mat 13:19  When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side. 
Mat 13:20  But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; 
Mat 13:21  Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. 
Mat 13:22  He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. 
Mat 13:23  But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>what if &#39;God&#39; actually isn&#39;t god and can truly be defeated by supposed mortals?</p>

<p>what if Lucifer had a really good reason for rebelling? </p>

<p>like what if there were some kind of primordial space beings that gained access to some kind of immense power, making it seem as if they were gods, the most powerful among them eventually becoming the supreme god and relegating all others under his command?</p>

<p>Lucifer could&#39;ve just been an independent who wanted the universe to continue without false gods, false hope and slavery of lesser beings (which would include himself, as lesser to the strongest)</p>

<p>how can people trust what the bible says? How old it is doesn&#39;t fucking matter. in fact, older books are probably more likely to contain lies and inaccuracies. and I&#39;m not talking about to their source material -- I&#39;m talking about the people who wrote them at the time intentionally putting in false details to mislead the peasantry and lower priesthood ranks.</p>

<p>how can people trust the bible compiled by the council of nicea in rome in which what constituted Christianity was defined, and outlawed any differing opinions?</p>

<p>its interesting to me, how one second the most powerful nation on earth at the time was hunting Christians to the brink of extinction -- then suddenly, its the official state religion after the current emperor claimed to see magical visions in the sky.</p>

<p>I&#39;m calling bullshit on that. People on the streets were scared because the government had been hunting their neighbors like dogs. they didn&#39;t know why -- maybe they heard it was some dangerous cult or something -- but over time, it became obvious they actually WERENT a dangerous cult necessarily.</p>

<p>probably bred fear into people, and it was probably lowering moral severely as well as cutting down on the workforce and costing unnecessary expenditures of wealth and manpower hunting down people, who for the most part, were probably uneducated dirt farmers who couldn&#39;t read.</p>

<p>the simplest thing to do would be &#39;legalize&#39; the religion in name only, sanitize anything dangerous or truly secret from the religion -- whatever got those original followers killed is NOT in the fucking bible. anything it says is lies -- because the government that did the killing was the same government that decided which books made it into the bible.</p>

<p>and this was pre-schism, so this affects eastern orthodoxy as well. it affects every branch of Christianity/Catholicism from the very beginning.</p>

<p>if your going to judge a tree by its fruits, then just looking at the catholic church and the early church history at the end of rome tells you directly in no uncertain terms they are as bad as the snake in eden. worse even.</p>

<p>the fruit is rotten and fetid, covered in mold and maggots.
there is no way I can trust the bible itself.</p>

<p>do I think there was someone named Yeshua who said some serious shit to people in Rome and Judea? yeah. I think the guy realized that the governments and temples were setting up cartels and manipulating people to serve their own ends.</p>

<p>personally my belief is Jesus was a radical revolutionary who inevitably would&#39;ve led to a violent revolt and the end of mystery schools, state-control of universities (and also the high-universities contained in mystery schools abolished) and some level of true self government the likes of which the world has never seen.</p>

<p>I think Rome killed him not ONLY because the Pharisees told on him, but because he threatened both empires. I also think Rome had seen what happened with Judea -- and how their followers stayed with them creating a powerful state until the end -- even after decades of slavery, separation, torture, etc.</p>

<p>the jews had something Rome didn&#39;t -- ideology. something that bound people to their empire long after the original empire had fallen, causing them to rebuild, and regenerate it so long as semi-centralized sources of power existed within them.</p>

<p>if people believe enough, they will carry on the teachings themselves until they find those remaining power-centers and willfully fall in line to heed the master&#39;s call.</p>

<p>I think Rome had realized the power of religion, and by the time Nicea happened and Christianity made the official state religion (which by the way, ended a long history of almost entirely freedom of religion), had decided to instead of killing the dangerous terrorist group, since most of the significant intellectuals had already been killed or imprisoned, just legalize the basic entry level stuff so the ignorant common folk keep working and don&#39;t have to die.</p>

<p>Rome got their religion, after ancient libraries had been burnt by &#39;accident&#39; by them during war, then the empire crumbles but the faith remains. the faith that would employ orgies, lord over excessive wealth, hurt and torture people especially scientists, use underhanded deals to appear as gods, and destroyed thousands of years of ancient history through their faithful explorers who cared only for wealth and power.</p>

<p>I think the people who got together to make Christianity mainstream, like everything else that is mainstream ever in all history, was corrupted by whatever dark entities exist in this world from the very beginning.</p>

<p>even if the entities being encountered on drugs, assuming they are real, are evil, this does not necessitate that all of them are.</p>

<p>in fact, Id say, if they exist, hearing their side of the story is quite important for someone who wasn&#39;t alive to experience things from the uppermost societal caste at the time.</p>

<p>perhaps their side is only so seductive because its true, or contains more truth to it.</p>

<p>My position has always been that of ultimate selfishness. I trust nobody and obey/heed no loyalties or contracts until I&#39;m assured the outcome is favorable to me. otherwise I betray and my oath has no value. I will lie to your face to obtain the information I need to make my decisions, and then act on that resulting information, any handshakes or signatures before that don&#39;t count.</p>

<p>so I trust nobody, nothing. let alone potential interdimensional beings of unknown origin.</p>

<p>but I don&#39;t trust them any more or less than the people who wrote the bible. for all I know, those elves were whispering the words into their ears the entire time.</p>

<p>I just wouldn&#39;t trust either side being presented to you to be telling the truth. what if that whole statement about &quot;appearing as an angel of light&quot; was just a huge joke -- because god himself, of the bible, was actually satan appearing as an angel of light at the beginning?</p>

<p>I could continue this line of questioning and reasoning. but I think ive gone far enough.</p>

<p>there is no way to know, and no way to trust. I don&#39;t think the image of &#39;god&#39; people have in their mind about something you pray to that gives a fuck about you individually is just wacky. if that was the case, there would&#39;ve been an intervention by now.</p>

<p>its not. what we would consider to be good is not winning. so perhaps the universal constant idea of good is actually evil? perhaps dark and light have been turned on their heads and redefined as each other.</p>

<p>the only way to try and learn these answers is to risk corruption from openness -- this doesn&#39;t mean nobody will ever succeed at uncovering such a truth, and it doesn&#39;t mean its any less worthwhile.</p>

<p>blind faith is a foolish thing indeed. faith alone is not, but blind faith, or faith without any reasoning or openness to challenge, is incredibly stupid -- because if you&#39;ve been mislead from the beginning there is no way to find out, no opposing voices from the beginning times to hear out arguments from. no first hand witnesses left alive.</p>

<p>just words on a page, written by men, likely with more selfish intent than they would let on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had several breakthrough experiences, but this is the most profound one. Before the trip I set the intention for an healing experience (I suffered from aches from walking with crutches for a year and a half, mainly back, shoulder and hip) I ate 5 grams of mushrooms (better safe than sorry) and on the peak I started smoking DMT. </p>

<p>Before I new it, I was immersed in a landscape of swirling fractals,  trough the swirling, mostly green fractals I saw some entities popping up and disappearing. As they stayed longer in the fractal whirlwind I could see they where jesters, observing me and playfully popping in and out of my fractal world. 
Then a portal opened and I got sucked into a void and out of my body. At first it was completely dark around me, then more and more pulsating energy starting to emerge around me, small lights where floating around that looked like fireflies in slow motion nearby and stars further away, the lights where white, cyan and indigo and all around me. </p>

<p>Suddenly out of the lights I saw entities manifesting, as they became brighter and brighter I could see five machine elves floating (staying at the same location) around me, each with a different look and a different character. At this point I still had no body and I had a 360 degree view around me. Suddenly they started sending waves of love / energy to me from all five directions, where the five streams collided my body was reconstructed but this time a much lighter body, I was made of light and able to move around. As I was moving around I noticed the lights had disapeared and I was now in what seemed like a dense tropical forest, but there was no up and down, no ground or sky, it was more immersive and very beautiful, a bit Avatar like. Suddenly the oldest and wisest looking machine elf approached me and stopped at arm length distance, he stared at me for what felt like a couple of minutes <a href="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3b6ea7c94d1f907a4ac091e87965b502-c">https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3b6ea7c94d1f907a4ac091e87965b502-c</a> (this is somewhat of a resemblance of what he looked like) It felt like being read. I knew, he knew everything about me, there was no communication with him. </p>

<p>As he backed off to his place in the circle, the smallest and most playful machine elf approached me and hugged me, I was shocked that I could feel a real physical hug from this creature (I still was aware that I had smoked DMT). As he hugged me, I asked, why do I still suffer so much pain? I thought I could go on with life right now... He said: &quot;because you&#39;re going to learn something because of it.&quot; Then everything started fading away, I wanted to hug the little guy a bit longer, but it was time for me to go back to my own dimension. </p>

<p>Now almost a year later I healed my body with Qi gong, and practice it everyday, it also learned me how to cope with being an empath and use it as a gift, instead as the curse that it used to be (ok, and can still be from time to time). </p>

I had never heard of anything like it before at this point in time...I described them to my friend then as evil mechanical keebler elves...but even that couldn&#39;t explain them really. The ones in my trip could levitate. They could read my mind and let it be known (telepathically) that they were here at all times even though I can&#39;t see them.

    <div class="md"><p>I just looked up the term &#39;machine elves&#39;</p>

<p>what if the reason this is so commonly viewed by people across the board is because its actually not entities but a visualization of how exactly your brain communicates and gains information?</p>

<p>by this, I mean like, a dualistic version of the mind where the mind isn&#39;t necessarily fully part of the body, but also is at the same time. therefore, the elves seen could actually just be information transmitting from your higher consciousness to your lower consciousness, visualized in a way which would make sense to you on drugs (warped semi-humanoid beings using communications)</p>

<p>the &#39;jumping in and out of your body&#39; and transmitting information from afar made me think of this. perhaps your brain is just visualizing how it operates and you become conscious of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought about that too, the experience feels as real as it can get. So I wondered for while in awe after the trip was over, did I just met real entities in another dimension or are the entities a manifestation of my higher self? (actually I&#39;m still wondering, my Mulder says &quot;yes&quot; my Scully says &quot;No&quot;, well oké, Scully wouldn&#39;t believe in a higher self but I&#39;m starting to ramble) Maybe my higher self knows certain life experiences in advance and trough the drug I can make contact with it and it informs me in the form of the elves. </p>

<p>On a good dose of mushrooms I often have conversations with some form of intelligence (although not in the form of an entity, more a guiding energy) that I see as a manifestation of my higher self, it guides me trough the trip and gives me directions and solutions for problems in life. It could be that the elves are a more extreme version of communication with my higher self and is more able to transcend information across time and space. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always considered it conversations with myself and therefore, never saw any &#39;beings&#39; that I was speaking with. I do the same thing sober, go on long monologues discussing things with myself in my mind.</p>

<p>it could be I just never took enough hallucinogens because I didn&#39;t have enough money to get large quantities.</p>

<p>but it also could be because I&#39;m aware of whats going on at a lower level, so my mind doesn&#39;t have to interpret it in funny ways, that perhaps I simply accept that its just all me, but that its still good enough to have the same spiritual experience people describe that way.</p>

<p>I understand the feelings of mysticism quite well, although honestly, I think its just part of being high. but I still enjoy the inner dialogue in a lot of ways.</p>

<p>sometimes it can go off handle if you lose your cool, and you can start believing in traumas that never existed or happened at all though. like, the first time I was on LSD I became convinced I was being drugged with LSD regularly as a child, which I&#39;m pretty positive isn&#39;t true -- but it was enough to set me off on a paranoid bad trip for a few hours. although honestly, it being my first time and the sensation of being in an elevator is really what set it off.</p>

<p>but in some cases, I know the dialogue isn&#39;t exactly true -- such as in that case.</p>

<p>in other cases, its pretty vague and not really something you can prove or disprove, kind of like a fortune teller. You can&#39;t prove or disprove the idea that, if you ask yourself &quot;why must I go through this pain&quot; with the answer being &quot;Learn something from it&quot; - this statement cannot be proven one way or the other.</p>

<p>I think it has value, and sometimes, it offers new and different insights. is it better? are these insights always correct? Id assume probably not.</p>

<p>IME hallucinogens get a lot of the deep feelings out from under the surface, the complicated, low level feelings we aren&#39;t aware of on a day-to-day basis as adults, sort of like children.</p>

<p>but the higher level, complex thoughts -- I Cant imagine trying to do serious work while tripping. Id never be able to do engineering, programming, or chemistry high on hallucinogens, or try to repair a car or anything. Even carrying on detailed conversations is hard because one minute the thought is there, the next its just gone.</p>

<p>making a e cigarette coils and wicking the thing was hard enough lol. My point being, I think we are sort of crippling some higher functioning in a way, but at the same time getting more detailed lower level consciousness. but I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>I do know that if you search yourself really hard while sober you can actually notice a hint of &quot;the feeling&quot; of shrooms or LSD all the time. its just buried so deeply and so weak that you don&#39;t notice it, and its far milder/less powerful. and I don&#39;t mean high, I just mean that giddy, queasy kind of lovey feeling. its always there with you, you just don&#39;t notice it and it mostly gets filtered out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never used it, but since I live in Brazil and Ayahuasca is legal for religious purposes, I know a lot of people who have, including relatives like cousins and aunts. What i find most interesting is the changes these people make in their lifes after the experience, like dropping a long time job to start a new college or stop the use of other drugs. </p>

<p>I highlight that its use is way more productive with the help of a guide or &quot;shaman&quot; , who  in our primitive civilizations had a major role in peoples life, teaching the way to those corners of our brain and soul.</p>

<p>Those &quot;shamans&quot; were in many cultures also a medic figure, and were repesented with figures of ladders, simbolizing a connection between our realm and the supperior one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. Sometimes it&#39;s something simple,  everyone in the room will see the same color &quot;filter&quot;, as in everything is normal and then all of a sudden the ether turns pink or orange,  like a glow. A few years ago I did multiple journeys consecutively.  On the first night, Mother Aya introduced herself to me while I was laying in the yard looking at the stars.  She appeared on my left side,  in the form of a tree with a pink glow. The tree reached up into an infinite sky. She extended her branches to me and invited me to be cradled, and also let me know that anytime I wasn&#39;t feeling supported in life,  she would forever be by my side,  cradling me when I leaned in. The following three nights (and still to this day!), she was by my side as I sat,  wandered and played outside. After the conclusion of ceremonies I was chatting with others and sharing our experiences.  Before I told this story,  someone mentioned being on the balcony,  and seeing a tree, that reached up into infinity,  running around on the lawn. That one was pretty interesting.  </p>

<p>The astral projection one happened when I was sitting in a living room,  next to someone I hadn&#39;t met until that evening. It was also my first ayahuasca experience. I felt very present, I knew I was in a friend&#39;s house, yet when I looked up at the ceiling I saw a domed,  stone structure decorated with black symbols that were reminiscent of an ancient language of which I am not familiar. The person sitting next to me was touching my arm,  and &quot;removing&quot; things from my body. We did not speak. The following morning I mentioned that I felt as though I had traveled to ancient Egypt, and motioned towards the person that was next to me.  He just nodded and said,  &quot;yeah,  we were in a tomb,  burying some shit&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not used it but from what i gathered, i have had an endogenous experience, i went over many descriptions of dmt trips and for the most part they share that little something. Interestingly, you also find it in people who meditate describing nirvana, i&#39;m pretty confident it&#39;s the same experience. That little something is that you can&#39;t quite describe your experience with words when you return, your perception changes so much during the trip it doesn&#39;t even feel like 3d space anymore, hell you&#39;re not even sure you&#39;re seeing with your eyes, it&#39;s just... so incredibly different. And no, i don&#39;t know how or why it happened, i wish i did for i would go there very often despite not having the the mental endurance required to elevate myself to nirvana on demand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done a lot so can answer questions if you like.</p>

<p>I want to make this clear though: The most popular book about DMT is where the idea that DMT is released when you die comes from. This book was written by Rick Strassman, who does have a PhD from Stanford (good credentials.) In the book he specifically states that this is basically one of his shower thoughts about DMT. This has gotten passed along over the year to basically state that this is a fact proven by scientists. Maybe it&#39;s true, maybe it&#39;s not, but understand that this is no way a proven fact.</p>

<p>It&#39;s too easy to just say that&#39;s what happens when you die and basically use DMT to explain everything. You turn the drug into a religion. It&#39;s all belief that you have become convinced is fact.</p>

<p>On the other side of the coin, it is like a religious experience. That is why so many are willing to buy right into that claim as fact.</p>

<p>People say LSD can not truly be described, you have to experience all of it to get it. DMT is the equivalent of that for people who have done acid.</p>

<p>A funny story about DMT that explains it a bit, and takes place at the house of Joe Rogan: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzfDtyDk9XE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzfDtyDk9XE</a></p>

Ketamine is similar in the sense that you disassociate with your eyes closed, but the visions and thoughts seem more mechanical to me. DMT felt more &quot;warm,&quot; perhaps due to the body high. I have never encountered any other entities on Ketamine, but always have (with sufficient dosage) on DMT. I have encountered nothing but beauty and love with DMT. I have gone further out on Ketamine, to the point of full disassociation and complete loss on self awareness and identity. Perhaps I had anesthetized myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think religions are the only ones with dogma. Every world view has its version of truth and subscribing to a world view comes with built in assumptions. Its impossible to escape from these things. Kind of like how Mckenna talked about cultural operating systems. </p>

<p>So in that regard psychedelics can be helpful to wash away some of those pre-programmed ideas we all carry with us.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones is generally quite unknown where I live (the Netherlands). But I heard of them from Terence mcKenna  (who&#39;s well known within the &quot;psychedelic community&quot;) years before I got my hands on some DMT. I&#39;ve only met them once though, in this experience, the others where very different from this one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not who you asked but once I traveled through a tube made up of light I awoke on what seemed like an operating table being observed by a group of shadow figures who I could tell were very happy I was there . When it was time to go back an entity that to me looked like a Totem carving told me it was time to go and put a mask over my face . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i took LSD at a festival, like i had done every year as a one time thing vacation for the year, and i have experienced the effects of weak doses vs stronger doses, same with mushrooms.  </p>

<p>Higher doses of mushrooms gave me the &quot;i cant move, cause all i see is kaleidoscope shit&quot; but i hadnt seen any hard visuals like that from any LSD trip....until my last time taking LSD  </p>

<p>I took just 1 dose, but the guy said it was a big dose, which i figured was perfect for the day, but as soon as night hit and the light shows started, man o man i had demonic visuals no doubt.<br/>
One point i saw massive red hands over the crowd playing us all like puppets, and noticed more darker symbolism during this period than i ever had. So i figured i was done for the night, went back to my tent since i was not enjoying the trip, and just slept it away easily.  </p>

<p>But yea, wierd stuff. On mushrooms i had a mega intense trip where something kept telling me &quot;youre a leader no one wants to follow&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read and study the King James Bible led by the Holy Spirit which I received by the grace of God through his finished work on the cross. He came to earth in the flesh as Jesus Christ and allowed himself to be sacrificed to wash away our sins with his blood (the lamb of God).</p>

<p>All you need to do to receive the Holy Spirit is repent of your current sinful state (we are all sinners, every single human and sin is just a thing God himself defines) and believe the Gospel which is:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>Once you have truly repented and believed the above in your heart you will be saved.  You can only be saved once you realize there is nothing you can do yourself.  No being a good person, no good works, no going to a church, no donating money, no nothing!  You can only trust in what Jesus Christ did for you.  Once you have done this he sends his Holy Spirit to dwell in you and teach you all things.  You will be able to actually understand the King James Bible as it is a living spiritual scripture and not just a book.  Your spirit will be quickened and you will be alive (spiritually) for the first time in your life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DMT being something produced when you die is a belief that has been twisted into a fact by some people: it&#39;s become a religion itself. The believers have pushed dogma onto DMT. On the other side, there is also some hidden truth in Christianity. Someone just attached the church to Christianity and that pushed dogma onto it.</p>
