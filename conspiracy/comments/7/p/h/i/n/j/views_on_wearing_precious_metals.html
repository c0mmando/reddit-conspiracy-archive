       I was wondering what this sub's thoughts were on wearing precious metals and jewelry. To me it seems many ancient civilizations wore a lot of jewelry and as the world "modernized" less and less are seen wearing jewelry. I understand the cost to purchase jewelry is high and seen as a luxury, but why and how did we get to that point?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only the metals, but also the "precious" stones. Not sure if any of you have delved into this or if it is worth looking into.

       Jewelry is stupid.  Metals are useful materials that we should make the most of.  That's my view.

       Enforced scarcity is what gives them value I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why those that have them, tend to hoard them.

       tucked away, much of it as jewelry. I doubt we're ever going back to a gold standard, but I wonder what effect this gold hoarding would have should the global economy have some sort of a major shift.

       I love silver, Sterling. I wear a hand made sterling silver necklace from India, and a hand made sterling silver ring from Ireland. The only jewelry that I feel has "spoken" to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find gold pretentious and gawdy as an ornament, I see it as it is meant to distract onlookers. Silver not so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not believe in precious stones as more than what they are, beautiful to look at with some more than others.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do have quite a few stones from obsidion to tigers eye to turquoise, rose quartz and jade. And an amethyst geode. Shits pretty to look at.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think I might turn the geode in to a paraphernalia apparatus. Now THAT would be beautiful.

       Same.

       The first rock I found that interested me was a huge, at least softball size, Amber. Like straight out of Jurassic Park. I was mesmerized. I let it be known and it was "confiscated". I was crushed, but had an ever longing gaze for a beautiful stone. My favorite now is a blue agate; about a third of it quartz, deep blue ridging I found and had polished. When I used to play poker it was my card protector. No ones allowed to touch it.

       As soon as I could walk I would "Adopt" pretty stones. I found a huge amethyst in my back garden and my mind was blown. My mind was further blown when I discovered fossils and spent many hours with my geologists hammer.

       I've read most of the replies. I'm looking more for the benefits/effects of wearing these metals and stones on our bodies. I don't believe ancient civilizations such as the mayans and african tribes wore jewelry purely due to "shiny and pretty". media always seems to dumb down previous civilizations, but we know that these people were smart and had goals/strategies for their people.
      </p>
      <p>
       the comments also lend into the narrative that jewelry is goddy and "humbled, respectable" type people don't wear it, or that it is a feminine thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       the way metals react to our skin was on my mind the other day and i thought this might be a good discussion here.

       Gold enhances the functioning of the upper chakras (third eye, throat and heart) and silver activates the root chakra and possibly the other two lower chakras. The gold should be pure or 22k to be able to feel it. Only a gram or two is needed to feel the effects, but the more the merrier. Cannabis and yoga make the affects of gold of silver even stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do some yoga, smoke some pot, and put a small gold coin or gold bar (you can get 2.5 gram gold bars on eBay for about $125) and you should be able to feel it. Do it on a full moon and eat some strong edibles and you will really feel it.  Meditate while lying down in the dark with gold on your third eye, throats chakra and heart chakra and you will be unfit a treat.
      </p>

       There is a reason why Indians horde gold in their temples and homes, and it's not because it's pretty to look at.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gold captures the essence of stars when they die and explode into the universe. Silver has some connection to the moon, but I'm not sure of the mechanics of how it works.

       Thank you, this is the type of comment I was looking for. I recently received a pure gold necklace and it feels so good for some reason. It's like i notice something being on my skin, it's not irritating, but instead pleasant feeling.

       This is what led me into starting this convo, to see how others react to wearing different types of metals and stones.

       Sadhguru discussed his wife's passing, and mentioned how the metal also holds your consiousness in place. It acts like a small anchor for the soul or something.

       Gold and silver are more powerful than we realize. The Egyptians, I believe, had an understanding of how it works, so you might want to scan Egyptology books for some clues.
