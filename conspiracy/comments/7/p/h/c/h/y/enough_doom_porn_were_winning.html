<p>How do you define trust at a low?</p>

<p>&quot;Americans&#39; trust and confidence in the mass media &quot;to report the news fully, accurately and fairly&quot; has dropped to its lowest level in Gallup polling history, with 32% saying they have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media.

<p>I&#39;m super anti-Trump, but sometimes the Trump shills on here mistake that to mean I&#39;m pro-media or pro-CNN.  I think 24 hour news networks are a plague.  I think when you have to sell ad space and the only way to get more viewers than last month is to sensationalize bullshit, that&#39;s what you do, and so we get a lot of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgm3_jzcNm4">this kind of nonsense</a>.  </p>

<p>I think Trump was dead on the money with his fake news claims, except he beat that dead horse until it came back to life and attacked him.  Now every time he claims fake news, it&#39;s almost a confirmation that whatever he&#39;s talking about is mostly, if not completely, true.  That&#39;s what happens when you trade your character for attention.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the mainstream media isn&#39;t independent or free. It&#39;s all owned by the same six mega corporations and entirely controlled by big money interests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back when I was young, 4 decades ago, we had access to 3 broadcast networks (plus PBS which had no news program at the time) and two local papers. Now, living in the same place, I have access to 7 broadcast networks, plus cable networks, plus the same two local newspapers plus home delivery of at least 2 national newspapers, plus NPR, plus hundreds of sources over the internet. No, they&#39;re not all owned by the same six mega corporations, though some are.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The ones that just make up stories, like truepundit.com, are fake news. Then there are propaganda outlets like Breitbart.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, &quot;mainstream media&quot; means any media that tries to be nonpartisan and has actual reporters that go out and gather information. The alternatives to that are complete shit. Trying to get rid of the mainstream media and have people consume the &quot;alternative media&quot; is like telling the people of Flint that there water is bad, so they should just drink sewage.</p>

<li><p>Trump, the person you were obviously referring to. And sorry I forgot what your comment said when I wrote that and got it mixed up with someone else who messaged me. I meant to say that all of the mainstream media is owned by oligarchs, not some of it.</p></li>
<li><p>Regardless of your perception, control over the mainstream media has been greatly consolidated over the last few decades. Your variety and choice in mainstream media hasn&#39;t increased, it has decreased. Only the illusion of choice has increased. And the only voice you&#39;re hearing through all of those outlets is the voice of a small group of oligarchs who want you to believe and do whatever will best serve their interests.</p></li>
<li><p>All modern news has a propagandistic angle. The fact that you recognize it in Breitbart is a good start, but not very impressive, seeing as that&#39;s the dominant view in our culture right now. I&#39;ll be impressed once you start seeing the lies and spin and propaganda in the mainstream media like you see it in Breitbart. Because believe me, it&#39;s there and there&#39;s just as much of it. You&#39;re just not awake to it yet.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a good post, I didn&#39;t see it before</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve been researching for 20 years. And in twenty years I have never seen society so split on what truth is. Every group is in firm belief the other groups are misinformed sheep.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t help but think of KGB defector Yuri Bezmenov when he warned the US that they were being infiltrated with communists who would gain control of the institutions over the next generation and described what it was like while Russia was being ideologically taken over. He said things like, they would circulate so much disinformation that eventually no one would know what was real and what wasn&#39;t. That you could put the irrefutable truth right in front of someone&#39;s eyes and they would be so demoralized and disoriented that they wouldn&#39;t recognize it. </p>

<p>I think we, as a society right now, are experiencing the disorientation he describes. We have sub groups of people living their own worlds with their own realities and they all think the people in the other groups are crazy or stupid because they&#39;re so invested in their own interpretation of reality and all the interpretations are mutually exclusive. Hardly anyone can see eye to eye on anything because they&#39;re not even occupying the same universe.</p>

<p>Hard to say whether this is organic or part of an intentional psy op. I lean toward believing the latter because, well, I&#39;m a conspiracy theorist lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s the President. He&#39;s either an oligarch, or he has no power and is controlled by one.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy">Oligarchy is not wealth, oligarchy is power.</a>. It comes from the Greek words for &#39;few&#39; and &#39;to rule or to command&#39;. It&#39;s a power structure controlled by a small number of people. You don&#39;t have to be rich to be an oligarch, it&#39;s just easy to be one if you&#39;re rich, and you&#39;ll become rich by being one.</p>

<p>Trump and members of his family have jobs in high levels of government. He is by definition an oligarch. The only way he wouldn&#39;t be if he has no control and no power and no rule and no command.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not dignifying your strategy of tension with a response. Instead, I&#39;m going to talk about how we are soon going to enter a new golden age of economic development and rising of the human spirit as pent-up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7i0eet/lets_talk_about_suppressed_technology/?st=jc9fkdmg&amp;amp;sh=a9c4f2a7">technological advances</a> are finally implemented:</p>

<p>&quot;Here are a few technologies that you can verify with mainstream science that are not being implemented in spite of the incredible benefits they would offer:</p>

<h1>Molten Salt Reactors</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.zmescience.com/ecology/what-is-molten-salt-reactor-424343/">Molten Salt Reactors</a> are superior to conventional nuclear reactors in almost every way. They cannot melt down due to safety features inherent to their design. If they overheat, the fuel melts a plug simply falls into a holding tank and cools down, without any human input.</p>

<p>They produce far less waste than conventional designs, and may even be able to turn old nuclear waste back into fuel, thus reducing the net nuclear waste in the world. With scaling, costs of 1-2 cents per kilowatt hour, are achievable, making them the cheapest form of electricity currently available.</p>

<p>Molten Salt Reactors have been a viable technology since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten-Salt_Reactor_Experiment">1960s</a> when the United States ran a test reactor for several years. By all accounts, the test was a successful proof of concept.</p>

<h1>Cheap, Safe Access to Space</h1>

<p>Currently it costs thousands of dollars to send one pound of payload to space on a rocket. At this cost, economic opportunities in space, such as asteroid mining or space-based solar power are not viable.</p>

<p>However, we have many ways of deploying payloads that are both cheaper and safer. There were many viable ideas for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_propulsion">nuclear propulsion</a> that would have produced much better thrust than liquid fuel rockets and removed the constant risk of explosions.</p>

<p>There are other ways to access space that don&#39;t involve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-rocket_spacelaunch">rockets</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator">Space Elevator</a> remains difficult, but there are materials being developed (nanotubes and graphene) that are strong enough to support the long tether.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t necessary, however, because we have designs to access space with current materials technology. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1MAg0UAAHg">Launch Loop</a> is a large ground-based launcher that can safely send payloads into space for a tiny fraction of the cost of rockets. An <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMbI6sk-62E">Orbital Ring</a> is a form of space elevator that can send payloads to low earth orbit (no strong materials required) and then launch them out into space using maglev technology.</p>

<p>There are many feasible ideas along these lines. Reducing the cost of sending a payload into space by 99% or more, they would open the door to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/09/the-potential-100-trillion-market-for-space-mining/">trillions of dollars</a> in economic productivity through asteroid mining.</p>

<p>Solar panels produce far more electricity in space with no cloud cover or night time, and this solves the current base load problems (not running at night) with solar. The ability to put solar panels into space could result in electricity generated for less than one cent per kilowatt hour, or nearly free energy.</p>

<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>There are many other verifiably suppressed technologies, such as anti-aging therapies, wellness-based medicine, hydrological engineering, vacuum rail, and so on. The problem isn&#39;t the lack of viable technologies. The problem is that we haven&#39;t risen up and <em>demanded</em> the future that we deserve.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with space elevators is the gravitational and centripetal force.  You can&#39;t just build a ladder to space, every foot up needs a counter-weight on the other end.  Not only are you dealing with three hundred thousand feet up, you&#39;re also dealing with another three hundred thousand feet out.  That&#39;s a lot of weight that needs to get managed.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible but not with anything we know today.  Also, it begs the question, why do we need to get in to space so badly?  It would be pretty f@#$ing cool though.</p>

<p>I always felt like Thorium reactors were so good it was stupid not to replace everything with them.  I guess the idea is that it&#39;s hard to invest $100m in something largely untested, but nuclear fallout is actually bad and a possible consequence from using Uranium, and Thorium has absolutely nothing like that.  </p>

<p>I guess the problem is getting someone to pony up the cash.  Someone tried to argue it&#39;ll never happen because weapons grade uranium is a byproduct of nuclear power, but that would be true of every non-nuclear power source and we still build solar and wind farms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re probably thinking of the space elevator out to geosynchronous, which requires the long cables and counterweights. I&#39;m talking about an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMbI6sk-62E">orbital ring</a>, which doesn&#39;t require the long cables or counterweights, and has been technologically viable since the 1980s when <a href="http://www.orionsarm.com/fm_store/OrbitalRings-I.pdf">Paul Birch</a>&#39;s work was published.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There are already Thorium reactors running, with both China and India planning to invest heavily in the technology in coming decades. The only thing holding us back is the regulators, which is really a function of the oligarchy&#39;s hatred of energy production because it leads to economic growth and a growing class of people with time to learn and think for themselves.</p>

<p>Look into the British royal family&#39;s involvement in setting up the radical environmental movement.</p>

<p>8 hours is the time of my last post, not the time of my last login. Not really sure how it matters. I often have months between posts, and also have several different accounts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you are lying claiming that I want to ban people for their opinions rather than their tactics?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. I just find it worrying that you want to ban people who talk about politics, yet at the same time say the oligarchs (defined as &#39;a small group of people having control of a country&#39;) are losing. Do you not see the contradiction there? I don&#39;t feel what I said was a lie, but up to you if you want to see it that way.</p>

<p>There may well be. I&#39;m not coordinating with anyone. At the same time, this isn&#39;t where I come to be positive, because conspiracies aren&#39;t happy things.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That sounds a lot like recommending banning people for talking about politics. It&#39;s not irrelevant to talk about politics if the discussion is about oligarchs. I&#39;m not even sure how you could talk about oligarchy without mentioning politics.</p>

<p>I do get the point you are trying to make. <a href="https://cryptome.org/2012/07/gent-forum-spies.htm">Forum sliding, topic dilution, anger trolling</a> and many many other tactics are employed by companies, governments, and oligarchs of every country. </p>

<p>But this post is in a sub-thread of the main thread you created, and you replied to it. Had you ignored it, it might have only been one comment with 0 replies. You helped create the discussion about it, and helped derail it yourself by refusing to accept you might be wrong. </p>

<p>The more you go against the hivemind (which exists in every subreddit and every community, online and offline, regardless of the number of shills), the more disagreeing comments you get from individuals with their own minds not associated to any group. </p>

<p>Really, if you wanted to come to a happy place to talk about how &quot;we&#39;re winning&quot;, this isn&#39;t the place for it. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a place where people come to talk about what&#39;s wrong with the world, not about what&#39;s right about it. A well researched, well sourced post about how &quot;we&#39;re winning&quot;, but the media and the government and the online world is pretending we&#39;re not for some nefarious reason would fit in this sub. Saying &quot;we&#39;re winning&quot; and attacking anyone who disagrees as a sock puppet or attack bot just doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>&quot;17. Change the subject. Usually in connection with one of the other ploys listed here, find a way to side-track the discussion with abrasive or controversial comments in hopes of turning attention to a new, more manageable topic. This works especially well with companions who can &#39;argue&#39; with you over the new topic and polarize the discussion arena in order to avoid discussing more key issues.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m wary of futurology because it became the new default subreddit post-r/technology. And the reason technology fell out of favor was in part because of how many people got angry at the blatant astroturfing which took place post-Snowden disclosures. Not only were those stories stifled pretty fast, but then they started censoring anything related to Wikileaks and net neutrality under the guise that it wasn&#39;t &quot;technology-related.&quot; Control was regained, but by then, futurology became the new thing.</p>

<p>And what came with futurology? IIRC, it was creepily pro-transhumanism and advocated staunchly for things most people in this subreddit should be pretty concerned about: merging with machines and going waaaay beyond microchipping/receiving the alleged mark of the beast. It&#39;s propaganda of a darker kind over there.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been around the Reddit block for quite a few years now--other old-timers should also be able to confirm a lot of this. </p>

<p>Fear drives most people into trusting the oligarchy:</p>

<p>&quot;The strategy of tension is a method of social control involving a series of covert attacks upon a population, intended to promote stress and fear amongst them.

<p>I agree to an extent... but I think the average person is less likely to give a fuck about the world as long as they have their necessities such as: shelter, food, etc. As long as people have their soma, which comes in many different forms, <strong>even positive thoughts and feelings</strong>, they&#39;re not really going to give a fuck about what&#39;s happening in the outside world.</p>

<p>This all hinges on how you define &quot;controlling a population.&quot; Fair government that makes people&#39;s lives better stops them from trying to hang the oligarchs, but so does controlled opposition, propaganda, and the like.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you know whether your hope is false or not?</p>

<p>Facts that I listed in the OP.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are you suggesting people should be censored because they&#39;re not sharing the same sentiments of optimism as you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s simply not what I said. I said that people who are here to disrupt the conversation with disinformation tactics need to be removed. The sidebar has some good reading on how they do this, and it&#39;s really easy to spot once you get familiar with their methods.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are you more likely to realize how to fix the problem with your head in the clouds?</p>

<p>I am not saying to have your head in the clouds. I have a history full of discussion on how bad the world is, who is in control, and other facts. The conversation cannot end there.</p>

<p>At the top level, it&#39;s European nobility particularly centered around the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4FijRtAteU">House of Windsor</a>, leaders of major <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/137798/important-wikileaks-revelation-isnt-hillary-clinton">commercial</a> and central banks, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL11E33A6AEEB2674F">secret societies</a>, and the Vatican. </p>

<p>The next level is the think tanks, judges, heads of corporations, generals, top academics, and subordinate levels of the secret societies (something like the head of a state&#39;s masonic lodge).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes. But he is also implementing major changes that are disrupting the status quo and draining some members of the swamp, which is why he has gotten so much pushback.</p>

I always laugh and tell my kids we&#39;ll just eat the bastards if they try to starve us out. There&#39;s a huge flaw in their thinking that they can collapse society and eventually we&#39;ll beg them to take over. Say they do create this ultimate turmoil and take off to their bug-out places to wait things out. Surely they&#39;ll take their own little contingency of bodyguards or mercenary armies to protect them. But what then stops their guards from just killing them and taking what they have? You can&#39;t just take control, you have to maintain it. And I don&#39;t think there are enough of them to do that. What&#39;s the estimate of those at the top of their pyramid--8,000 to 8,500 people at most? And somehow they&#39;ll be able to control the entire world&#39;s population? Not unless they have every single person brainwashed. I don&#39;t see that happening as more people are waking up all the time. </p>

<hr/>

<p>A judge has ordered a status conference hearing into a lawsuit submitted by a woman who claims Donald Trump raped her when she was 13-years-old in 1994.</p>

<p>Federal Judge Ronnie Abrams has ordered the hearing for 16 December in a New York court. She has asked for both sides to provide information to assist the Court in advancing the case to settlement or trial.</p>

<p>What does the lawsuit allege?</p>

<p>In the lawsuit the plaintiff, identified by the pseudonym Jane Doe, alleges Mr Trump &quot;initiated sexual contact&quot; with her at four different parties when she was 13.</p>

<p>At the fourth encounter, she alleges he tied her to a bed &quot;then proceeded to forcibly rape&quot; her. </p>

<p>She says she was lured to the parties, held by billionaire-paedophile Jeffrey Epstein - who is also a defendant in the case - &quot;by promises of money and a modeling career&quot;.</p>

<p>At the top level, it&#39;s European nobility particularly centered around the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4FijRtAteU">House of Windsor</a>, leaders of major <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/137798/important-wikileaks-revelation-isnt-hillary-clinton">commercial</a> and central banks, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL11E33A6AEEB2674F">secret societies</a>, and the Vatican. </p>

<p>The next level is the think tanks, judges, heads of corporations, generals, top academics, intelligence agencies, and subordinate levels of the secret societies (something like the head of a state&#39;s masonic lodge).</p>

<p>Hopefully it will be replaced with a meritocracy, but that depends on us.</p>

<p>Yes. The link on the House of Windsor shows the indirect financial control and control of policy making through think tanks. </p>

<p>Another area to look into is secret societies. Freemasonry is loyal to the British Crown and dominates banking as well as intelligence (along with the Masonic religion of Mormonism). Ask yourself, why is London still a major center of finance?</p>

<p>If you want to know how we ended up this way, Carroll Quigley&#39;s Anglo American Establishment and Tragedy and Hope are a good explanation of the period of 1890-1960 or so. Creation of the Federal Reserve, Round Table discussion groups to supplant the elected government, takeover of key industries by robber barons, and so on.</p>

<p>Before that, you can read Freedom Intensifies&#39; explanation of the origins of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2z1r9s/cmv_people_who_fly_confederate_flags_are_either/cpf0gv1/">US Civil War</a>, or <a href="https://archive.org/details/presentattemptto01mors">Samuel Morse</a>&#39;s contemporary expose on the role of British Intelligence in fomenting the war.</p>

<p>Before that, I recommend <a href="https://archive.org/details/HowTheNationWasWonAmericasUntoldStory1630-1754">How the Nation was won</a> which details the battles between the oligarchical (British) and republican (American colonist) factions that led to the founding of the United States.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disagree</p>

<p>These developments may rally more people to the cause, but to what end? So we can get mown down by militarized police or incarcerated for thought crimes? It would take a ridiculous majority to bring down the power structure that has been emboldened by their outrageously lopsided resources including all the law enforcement, courts, etc etc.</p>

<p>Not to mention the entire planet&#39;s financial system! The only possible break in the clouds is supplanting central banks with crypto but they probably have that wrapped up as well, and are possibly even behind the crypto.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you this much, I keep my head down. Not because I&#39;m compliant but because I&#39;m afraid, due to all the above and more. And not so much for myself, but because I have kids. I don&#39;t speak out much. I no longer try to convert anyone. I&#39;m posting on an alternate account. Because I don&#39;t have the tools to fight against this and no one is really on my side, even here.</p>

<p>It’s hard to see the evils of the world and not be moved, if one is empathetic and good. Humanity has survived because of it. Righteous anger is being fomented, and to have and to embolden such an emotion is to act. But one does not always have the power to act. One must “ride the tiger”, so to speak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I need to hear this, thanks. And you&#39;re right, and it does help somewhat from both an emotional and rational standpoint.</p>

<p>But if the righteous prevail at this point I suspect it will be because the wicked fell victim to their own folly or maybe an act-of-God-type intervention of unforeseen circumstance, chaos, or straight-up dimensional transcendence. </p>

<p>The channels for even small actions are choked, as we know, and we are thankful to even have a &quot;safe&quot; place in here to discuss it. We may have more information than our idealogical forebears, but we are not going to be mistaken for any other great (successful) revolutionary movements of a simpler age. We aren&#39;t their equals and these are not those times. </p>

<p>On one hand we mostly won&#39;t get off our asses, whether from fear or apathy (see my comment above). On the other hand we are so easily divided and conquered because the enemy has done an impressive job of camouflaging their identities and actions that we can never agree what we were organizing for.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m preparing my kids for anything it&#39;s plain old survival, through awareness and knowledge. That&#39;s my biological imperative and one I&#39;d rather see than a noble crusade that ends in death or conversion, as all failed crusades must.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t share your view that the people would be unable to successfully resist the government through force, nor the view that they would even fight the people if ordered to do so.

<p>No. I doubt that 10% of US military would attack their citizens without provocation if ordered to do so. More likely the military would support a revolution than put it down.</p>

The ensuing chaos is being and will be further leveraged by the oligarchs to sew distrust about our fellow citizens and further exploit everyone involved. Just because people hear a plurality of views doesn’t make them more open minded. It’s a problem, and I’m not overly optimistic about the outcome right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dunno.</p>

<p>The mind of mankind is scattered on a plethora of things, with many of its contstructs sabotaging each-other. Basically, I think mankind lacks clear goals. And these goals need to come bottom-up, not the other way around because only this way the majority of people could stand for common goals as an act of free will. Though, I suspect that we have not evolved to that level yet and it would take at least 100 more years.</p>

<p>The idea emerged right after a summer school with science and engineering students from around the world. Our team (~40) worked successfully without leaders, we acted as one and helped each-other out without needing coordination. While I have seen something similar before with a student project, I would not have even considered it possible to reach that stage in just a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Although I&#39;ve seen prototypes of it working with carefully selected people, I think mankind as a whole needs to achieve unity like this. Regular mass meditation is probably one way to accelerate the process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Food and shelter for children goes without saying, mankind dies out without it. However, just on its own, it&#39;s not really motivating for mankind. Hierarchy of needs is good, but different people are on different levels. I think it would be the best if all the levels were taken care of. In other words, I think there should be very ambitious, if not near-impossible plans that are split down into smaller and smaller dependencies. The fact that children need food and shelter, would stem from a higher-level goal that is utterly impossible to reach otherwise.</p>

<p>SkiDoo is functional - sure. But golden or covered in diamonds because it&#39;s rare and makes one&#39;s wealth stick out - not sure how that would benefit the recipient or mankind. Would be a nice monument for the consumerism disease (people too weak to put up against corporate mass manipulation). Actually, this brings up morale and values, which should also be defined for mankind .. by mankind itself. Modern social networks have highlighted what a speed and efficiency we can easily achieve in the propagation of idols.</p>

<p>Err .. back towards the topic. I wanted to rant about the education system that is still mostly based on teaching discipline not independent problem solving. Many treat kids as if they were small and dumb. However, they&#39;re the next iteration and instead of taking them as rivals, we ought to give them everything that they need to evolve past the previous generations as efficiently as possible. Our school system is based on the principle: &quot;it&#39;s been proven to work for over 300 or 400 years, so it must be good&quot;. No, the school system has to be the <em>most</em> progressive system out there, because the evolution of the upcoming generations is and will always have to be far ahead of the rest of mankind. Teaching (or perhaps rather supervision?) should be the most esteemed and rewarded job that there is.</p>

<p>In personal experience from student projects, highschool students or even kids from primary school outperform graduates by a large margin. And in order to get them involved, there must be enough ambition without the age boundary of the society (but I&#39;m just ::insert_number:: and haven&#39;t studied this field before, would I be of any use?).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While some of what you said is true and relevant, there is still much to be jerking off our doom and gloom cocks to. </p>

<p>Alternative media is exploding in popularity, but it is being led by blatant misinformation no better or worse than MSM.</p>

<p>Information about healthy lifestyle alternatives to mainstream pharmacology and medicine is more widely available, but it&#39;s of poor quality and is still largely suppressed and unacknowledged as valuable to experts and policy makers.</p>

<p>Perverts and pedophiles in Hollywood are being exposed, but the overall network of pedophilia remains rampant. Look to the U.K. for an example of a nightmare and failure of accountability in this regard. </p>

<p>Establishment politicians are retiring, sure, but not in numbers that are out of the ordinary or indicative of a widespread fear of being exposed for wrong doing.</p>

<p>More people realize there is a corrupt oligarchy behind the surface power structure, this is true. Great. Now what? Is anyone going to do anything? I seriously, seriously doubt it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Trump&#39;s presidency is all the confirmation you need that people will continue to support the status quo out of ignorance on both sides of the aisle, no matter what the rhetoric, because <em>human beings are easily manipulated</em>. We will keep this up until we blindly march off the edge of the cliff to our deaths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>id recommend ppl meditate more and practice the golden rule, share information openly and honestly.</p>

<p>here are some good movements and technologies that we need to push for</p>

<ol>
<li><p>blockchain- decentralized and publicly available ledger. how about all govt info on public spending and legislation becomes publically available? decentralized social media servers using blockchain. </p></li>
<li><p>open source software- a bunch of developers contributing to software projects openly. big successes with some open source projects like linux and many others. Coding languages are almost close to human syntax like with Python.
THERE IS ONLY ONE RIGHT WAY TO BRING AI TO LIFE AND IT IS OPEN SOURCE, ACCESSIBLE TO ALL</p></li>
<li><p>Political media shift to twitter and other platforms. Twitter can be a dirty place, but now political dialogue is easily to everyone in real time. politicans also get feedback from comments.</p></li>
<li><p>Revealing of backengineered black project technologies -These will start to surface. We need to demand FULL DISCLOSURE and nothing less.
fuck the national security argument. We can handle the truth and will become stronger and more united from hearing it.</p></li>
<li><p>follow the pedos and satanists, then find their master, and their master&#39;s master, and so on recursively until we get to the root of the rot. Only then will we truly be free. The truth will set us free.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>/better prepare for some tumultuous weather with extreme natural disasters this year.</p>

<p>sidenote:  im not a climate denier, but fuck that overpoliticized expression. Reminds me of the &#39;you sayin you dont support our troops?&#39; argument used for iraq. </p>

<p>fact: solar weather effects earth weather. 
check the solar weather</p>

<p><a href="http://www.solarham.net">www.solarham.net</a></p>

<p>other factors besides human carbon emissions there are other forces effecting the weather and planet  (HAARP , underground nuke testing,and Gaia effect)</p>

<p>the NE US saw a taste this winter, expect volcanoes, earthquakes, and hurricanes, typhoons in Asia, maybe tsunamis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. You&#39;re interpreting the calm before the storm as permanent safety or victory. Famous last words. Right now you are experiencing a tremendous amount of hubris. Their are several crises emerging. It&#39;s not time for a victory lap but rather hard work to hedge against disaster. </p>

<p>And Pedophiles arent getting caught. Hollywood casting couches are being exposed and every public person that grabbed a titty or tried to make out with a girl awkwardly is being shamed. The networks are still regarded as a right wing conspiracy which makes them safer in their sick efforts. Could you imagine liberals actually making rape jokes, but now they do as long as it&#39;s a jab towards alex jones or pizzagate. Amazing. Every drunk college chick is not a lier but mountains of circumstantial evidence surrounding global networks of pedophils isnt taken seriously. Meanwhile they are going to fucking run JOE BIDEN in 2020 with Michelle Obama as his vice. Can you imagine? The same fucking peds in the same fucking white house! Theyre already calling them Jobama. ***<strong><em>BARF</em></strong>***</p>

<p>The worst thing though is the economy. Right wingers are actually so delusional that they are claiming the same economy that they were calling a bubble is now rock solid. Trump is the number one offender. There are all these clips of him on campaign calling the economy a bubble and critiquing quantitative easing and also perhaps putting too much emphasis on China. But now Trump is putting his brand on the economy and claiming he is the reason that the stocks are up. Yet the dollar is about to fucking collapse. Or at the very least slowly trickle down until it&#39;s worth very little. The missing trillions from the economy should give you a clue. </p>

<p>Watch Peter Shciff break down Trump&#39;s hypocrisy with regards to the economy:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsvud_CTRuk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsvud_CTRuk</a></p>

<p>And there&#39;s so many other bad things happening. Communism is now being taken seriously by ignorant and entitled millennials. Racism is being promoted as the solution to racism. Just take a pulse of the general bullshit that fills 90 percent of this subreddit. Even if it&#39;s a vocal minority there is still enough of them to be a problem. Also Europe is about to become a fucking shithole. It&#39;s on it&#39;s way to become America tier in terms of violence but will probably sink even lower. And the ratio of attractive women to non attractive women and men in Europe is decreasing vastly. </p>

<p>But here is the worst part. It&#39;s the authoritarian collectivists in this sub. They think the problem is <em>Trump</em> or <em>Obama</em> or whoever else, NOT AUTHORITY. They just think the right person should get into office and everything will get better. Or worse, that we need an authoritarian ethno state or communist revolution. Both ideas are equally horrible and rich people hatred far outpaces racism. More people justify violence towards rich people than they do other races. And they would never get that kind of revolution. What we will get though inevitably is a totalitarian, globalist, social democratic, police state. That or WW3 and the elites get to hang out in their bunkers and repopulate the earth because mostly women are invited to those things. </p>

I&#39;m afraid that Trump, instead of eroding confidence in our public institutions, reinforced their delusion that Obama AND EVEN Bush weren&#39;t that bad. Remember when all those libs on twitter were saying bush was a sweetie when he condemned trump and said the <em>right words.</em> On r/politics i have been seeing more obama apologists than ever, despite him not even lifting a fucking finger to try and stop the drug war which imprisons more black people than anything else.

<p>[pushes glasses up nose] Don&#39;t make me laugh. So you will concede that &quot;corrupted&quot; authority is a problem? Well we know that &quot;absolute power corrupts absolutely&quot; so if it isn&#39;t oligarchs that authority is beholden to it will be some other faction. Or.. idḱ.. THEMSELVES. How exactly are you going to stop politicians from taking bribes?
 You do realize if you make it illegal then they are going to do it anyways. You might have an easier time stopping people from using narcotics yet no one is able to do that. </p>

<p>Are you going to say direct democracy now? Look what&#39;s happening with the witch hunts emerging in our culture that tries to swallow up as many people as possible to entertain millennial&#39;s hunger for mass shaming and authoritarian violence against condemned individuals. Do you know where the phrase &quot;Off with their heads!&quot; came from? The <em>proletariat</em> executed so many people in the town square during the french revolution with guillotines, that it became hacky in comedy to mock them by saying &quot;Off with zeir heads&quot; in a french accent. And can you imagine they are executing so many people publicly that it inspires inventors to come up with more efficient ways of doing this?</p>

<p>Yes the <em>proletariat</em> sound like a fun group to be ruled by! Mankind&#39;s own demons haunting us through <em>deferment of responsibility.</em> Remember what George Carlin said, &quot;Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups.&quot; You think the average person is smart? You wanna give these people; and by &quot;these people&quot; i mean the lowest common denominator in society, the ones with most of the voting power, <em>absolute power?</em> You don&#39;t think absolute power can corrupt on a mass scale? Hahahahaha! Don&#39;t make me laugh! </p>

<p>You&#39;ve just admitted <em>authority</em> is the real problem. The <em>&quot;oligarchy&quot;</em> as you call them but you&#39;re probably including random ass billionaires, is a diverse group with diverse interests and some just want to be left alone to build spaceships or snort cocaine with hookers. Why the fuck would they be a problem if they just leave people alone because they have no <em>apparatus</em> in place to take advantage of to commit sanctioned violence with ie a <em>state?</em> If violence is agreed upon to be forbidden even by mass groups of people or political authority and the only thing which can be defended against with violence, via the NAP or Non Aggression Principle; how the fuck are these oligarchs going to magically ruin your life? Property rights? </p>

<p>You do realize the proteliare (or whatever they&#39;re called) can pool their resources together <em>voluntarily</em> right? You do realize that property rights are agreed upon and have limits. Do you think the first person that lands on Mars can claim Mars as his own? You think Mars is going to be Musk world? I think not! And when people start moving there in droves they will come up with fairer property agreements while overlooking what Musk said or fighting him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s the matter? Cat got your tongue? Just admit I am right. Your oligarchy conspiracy theory is misplaced anger. You should be mad at the system which allows people to tell others what to do unfairly. Someone making vast amounts of <em>stuff</em> but leaving everyone else alone is not a problem. Unless of course you let your jealousy convince you that theft, especially sanctioned theft by our authoritarian collectivist system, is ethical. But you already said that you don&#39;t appreciate the authority when they take bribes from &quot;ogliarchs.&quot; You think someone that is focused on building spaceships like Musk is going to appreciate a bunch of entitled millennials stealing his stuff? That&#39;s a nietzschean matter of perspective. </p>

<p>And even so the billionaires, old money, and even high millionaires will get out before the protieliefart (or whatever how it&#39;s spelled) gets near their capital. The bolsheveks robbed the Russian middle class while most of the real king types gtfo.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an accurate description of what an authoritarian collectivist &quot;revolution&quot; (chimp out) looks like: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Y5rtw">https://imgur.com/a/Y5rtw</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you a hint. In America it would look like hordes of Mexicans, Trailerparkers, and Black people spilling out of their ghettos and demanding room and board in your parent&#39;s comfortable middle class mcmansion home and access to all the &quot;stuff&quot; they have. Even <em>wealth redistribution</em> via Universal basic income will lower the value of the Dollar and pretty soon the great heist you pulled has no effect. After a while (like 5-10 years) labor and goods end up costing a fuckton more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have a seed, to be sure. The first real good one for long time.</p>

<p>But a lot can happen to a seed before it sprouts, grows, towers, and bears fruit. We have reason to hope but certainly not to celebrate.</p>

<p>And we are not. Fucking. Winning. The only real victory is starting to realize we dime have to lie to ourselves about how much we&#39;ve been losing.</p>

<p>We&#39;re the poorest generation in over half a century, our upset and &quot;awareness&quot; of police brutality, corporate unimpeachability, and political corruption has resulted in zero progress.</p>

<p>Right now America is having a great time being upset at Trump, and has forgotten that we were robbed of Bernie. If in four years we get another Obama the majority progressive left will congratulate itself for is victory while a new right-centrist neoliberal &quot;Democrat&quot; keeps the wars going, doesn&#39;t touch the status quo of corporate payoffs or political corruption... The only difference between them and a George W. will be balancing the budget while selling is out to kill brown people on the other side of the world to clear turf for a few corporate buddies.</p>

<p>Remember that &quot;good&quot; is the enemy of great! We make a few strides and congratulate ourselves, and we&#39;ve already lost. The 1% own half the resources... They can bend markets, and our minds to their will.</p>

<p>Net neutrality rollback is a direct result of cord cutting, as a perfect example. The people spoke up and said &quot;we&#39;re going to spend more wisely.&quot; Netflix said &quot;we&#39;re going to help them.&quot; And big telecom turned right around and pulled enough strings to privatize the entire internet. The end goal is a &quot;shared data plan&quot; with data caps for everything bundled together. Internet, TV, phone... Every device. Overages are going to be insane, but you can&quot;fast lane&quot; some subscribed services for an extra fee... This is planned for about two years out (a Reddit user in the industry spilled the beans... I can look it up or if someone else wants to link it).</p>

<p>In just two years, biz/gov buddies can turn a free internet back into cable.</p>

<p>Do not for a fucking minute think we are making traction here. We are not.</p>

<p>We are only waking up. We are like a junkie that realizes they have a problem. Or, more accurately, we&#39;re like someone in an abusive relationship that finally realizes it&#39;s not their fault and it&#39;s time to leave. Only they&#39;re realizing this in a cabin in the woods in a snowstorm in the winter....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be careful what you assume. </p>

<p>I happen to agree with you. And nothing I said suggested that I &quot;buy into&quot; the illusion of executive power in this country.</p>

<p>I just pulled my examples from that because they&#39;re out there and easy to demonstrate.</p>

<p>The deep state is opportunistic to be sure. There are so many angles here. They work though the president where they can. They don&#39;t where they don&#39;t have to. Trump is likely privy to all sorts of limited hangouts and counterintel on their behalf.</p>

<p>Any fleeting moves of his against the deep state are only more distractions. They may even throw him a bone. It&#39;ll keep up the illusion we&#39;ve gotten somewhere and muddy the waters to &quot;who&#39;s really progressive here.&quot;</p>

<p>Trump is a stooge, ultimately. But he&#39;s a bold stooge. And the fact that he&#39;s impressionable means that he&#39;s working for several agendas without even knowing it. It&#39;s great for the deep state because all of this deep agenda can be hidden behind his lunacy. And of course regular old crooked Republicans are getting their mileage out of him too.</p>

<p>And of course Bernie knows not to try to be a Kennedy. He knows what goes on... They already beat him up before the convention. But we need him, ultimately. The danger is that after Trump, we&#39;ll get another crooked Democrat in office peddling their brand of snake oil instead, having the decency to at least not brag about their corruption, and we&#39;ll think we&#39;ve won. Another era of neroliberal warmongering (as opposed to neoconservative warmongering). We need to get away from all of it.</p>

<p>There&#39;s always room for further progress. Even though we&#39;re doing well, even though the Information Age is pushing us into a new era of humanity, there is still a lot of issues for us to work on. For example, we might be on track to ending cannabis prohibition across the country, and that would be great, but what about all of the slaves imprisoned over other non-violent drug offenses? What about the guy who just likes LSD? What about the heroin addict? Even if we achieve the goal of ending cannabis prohibition that&#39;s not the end of our problems, just like how ending the system of legal chattel slavery didn&#39;t resolve race or class inequalities that the system of slavery helped establish. They might have ended chattel slavery over 150 years ago, but there is still slavery in other forms today. </p>

<p>We&#39;re &quot;winning&quot; in as much as this is a &quot;game&quot; which can be &quot;won&quot;, but we shouldn&#39;t rest on our laurels either. We can&#39;t be complacent just because we&#39;ve made some progress, we need to use that progress to inspire us to keep going even further. </p>

<p>And they would be right. Unless you were a black person in the south, the next few decades would see your standard of living double and the ideals of the American System spread across the world.</p>

<p>Yeah, they were. My point wasn&#39;t &quot;ending slavery didn&#39;t help&quot;, it obviously made a big difference.

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s not something easy or painless to switch to. If we&#39;re more concerned with how we get paid than how we are helping the tribe we will have inefficient and wasteful systems. I&#39;m not talking about carrying a wheelbarrow full of trade goods everywhere we go. I&#39;m talking about entirely rethinking our economy&#39;s foundations. The goal is people working together more or less voluntarily rather than a nation of petty tyrants and shirking scammers. Maybe it&#39;s not possible after a century of capitalist propaganda. We have become hypnotized by money.</p>

<p>A gift economy can work on a small scale in a community. Can it come back? &quot;Ah, thanks for lunch, let&#39;s go fix your barn together. Then I need to help Katie with that open source coding project. I noticed Jake hasn&#39;t been helping out, I&#39;m not going to invite him to our events until he gets his shit together.&quot; There can be incentives without bosses and cash. Natural human interaction without a corrupting system.</p>

<p>Before we get going talking about endgame Utopias and exact details let&#39;s just consider the indoctrination that has to be undone.</p>

<p>If we must have currency, then it must be stable. No interest, possibly no inflation. Usury is creating perceived value out of thin air. Real value is what makes us smile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s good to be balanced. I think also it&#39;s too early to say that &#39;we&#39; are winning. The trouble with being too hopeful is that it causes people to go along with the status quo, thinking that maybe since things are happening now, that we can let our guard down, and that we don&#39;t have to do much in order to make the world better. This is what is happening with q in my opinion. It is a narrative that is being spun to give people a false sense of trust in the government. And it&#39;s a good example about how perceptual imbalance can be used as a weapon against us. </p>

<p>To elaborate, i think it may be the case that the propagandists who direct public opinion are evolving their tactics. Instead of using fear to keep people from stepping out of line, they take a cue from apocalyptic religions, seeing that if people think a savior is coming, they will sit back knowing they have won and do really nothing of substance in their personal surroundings to improve things. Just as Christians are totally ambivalent to the destruction of our biosphere - they are going to be raptured anyway before the tribulation, and it&#39;s inevitable that the earth will become desolate as told in prophecy. So as long as they feel that they are saved, and are storing up their treasures in heaven, the planet itself can just get fucked. And that&#39;s not to mention the ascension to the 5th dimension. </p>

<p>I think that the qanon drain the swamp narrative parallels this. It doesn&#39;t ask us to question the fundamental framework of our society, it only promises to fix things for us. We can behave as we always have, but soon we will be free again, just by trusting in the government to cure itself of corruption.</p>

<p>I think that it may be true that a lot of people are in fact, waking up to the darkness that we are mired in. However I firmly believe that the solution lies with us individually choosing to take action in our own neighborhoods, and doing the hard work of parsing through our individual programming and biases, seeking truth above all, asking the hard questions and divorcing ourselves from our belief systems and pleasant delusions.</p>

<p>Fear may be the mind killer, but hope can also be a powerful opiate. </p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like someone created the pre-tribulation rapture theology out of nowhere in the 19th century in order to justify ecological destruction, as well as provide a support base for Zionism amongst Christians? Oh wait, that&#39;s totally what happened with that scumbag Scofield.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea i have looked into that somewhat, i don&#39;t know much about Mr. Scofield but I do know that the revelation doctrine that most Christians in America follow, is called &quot;futurism&quot; and was created in the mid 1500&#39;s by the jesuits to distract from the fact that the Roman church is named openly as basically the antichrist. I am also aware that the jesuit infiltration of Protestant Christianity has been ongoing for centuries and is all but compete. It is why basically all &#39;Christians&#39; now are 501c3 Satanists who protest nothing and have no idea or care for their own history.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love for something good to come of all of this, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible when the fundamental problem is our acquiescence to slavery - which is none other than government itself. As long as we rely on it to save us from the problems that it created in the first place, the outcome is not going to be good.</p>

<p>I think people are blinded by the narrative and aren&#39;t looking at the full reality of the situation. Which isn&#39;t unusual, it&#39;s just what we&#39;ve always done. Only now there&#39;s less of an excuse for it, as we have enormous amounts of information available to us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Futurism isn&#39;t necessarily a problem, that is a doctrine that Christians have held since the beginning, and most believe in at least a partial future fulfillment of Revelation. It&#39;s the idea that everything is doomed to get worse until the tribulation happens, at which point Christians will be whisked away to safety. It&#39;s a way to effectively keep Christians from trying to fix things, since it will never get better, and they will be safe when things really get bad.</p>

<p>The Roman Church is certainly part of the Mystery Babylon system (particularly the Jesuits), but it&#39;s important to see the other parts, particularly Freemasonry. Remember, Mystery Babyon is the mother of <em>all</em> harlots (false religions), but the Roman Church is only responsible for some false religion, meaning it alone cannot be Mystery Babylon.</p>

<p>In fact, the Roman Church is a lot less important than it used to be, as their power base has eroded significantly since the middle ages, and the power of the Jesuits has declined as their blackmail based on hearing the confessions of the powerful is no longer very important.</p>

<p>He&#39;s pro-Israel, but it&#39;s becoming debatable as to whether that is the same as Zionism, or whether he is trying to bring Israel out of the stone age and turn them into a force for good. You may want to look into the oligarchy&#39;s abandonment of Israel in recent years (Kissinger, in particular).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post! Very true.</p>

<p>Us &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; are slowly but surely being vindicated. There are still some crazy theories out there that give us a bad name. But many of the popular and substantiated theories are being proven true... I love hearing when my parents tell me about some shady shit they just heard on Facebook and I remind them that I told them about it 3 years ago and they thought I was nuts lol. </p>

<p>The sheeple are slowly opening their eyes and are questioning things that don&#39;t sound right. </p>

<p>Throughout this entire past US election I stayed optimistic, no matter what was happening, because my thought was that it really didn&#39;t matter who won... There were a lot of truth bombs and redpills being handed out. I knew we were seeing a big turning point in public trust in government, intelligence, and the MSM. Bernie, Assange, Snowden, and many other activists were exposing things that many of us have been saying for years.</p>

<p>Like you said, it&#39;s time to positively embrace this shift and help it gain more steam... The last thing we want to do is get complacent and watch the veil fall back over everyone&#39;s eyes. </p>

<p>We should all keep questioning things and spreading any information that contradicts the narratives. Im a moderate and support Trump, but he cannot be immune. We need to keep him honest and keep pressure on him to hold people to account. If he is caught up in this, we need to call him out. We need to promote candidates of all political parties that are interested in seeking truth, justice, and transparency. Trump is bipartison, he loves to make deals... He is not a hardcore Republican like everyone wants you to think. He wants good people that will do what&#39;s best for America, no matter what party their from. </p>

<p>Another thing we can do is support, upvote, retweet, and &quot;like&quot; all the posts from influential people who question the official narratives.</p>

<p>Last, we should figure out a way to unify everyone in this fight. We shouldn&#39;t be blaming each other for these problems... It&#39;s time to fight the real fight against shady corporations, wealthy political donors, and corrupt government officials (civilian and military). Stop the personal attacks on people who don&#39;t share your beliefs, have a productive debate and find agreement somewhere. The last thing that power hungry and greedy leaders want is a unified citizenry. They want us divided and fighting amongst ourselves while they rake in more power and profit at our expense.</p>
