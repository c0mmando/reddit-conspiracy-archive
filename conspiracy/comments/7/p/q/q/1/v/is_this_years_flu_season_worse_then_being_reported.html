    <div class="md"><p>Brit here. Yeah, people are dying in corridors in hospitals but that&#39;s due to the Prime Minister lying and saying the country was prepared for the winter when reality, they were not in the slightest. The money isn&#39;t there and the staff are overworked and demoralised. </p>

<p>As for the flu season, it&#39;s to be expected at this time of year but complicated by 2 different strains hitting the population at the same time. I&#39;m currently laid up in bed with the flu (which they identified as a &quot;common winter virus&quot; when I went to the local walk in centre convinced I had a chest infection) and it&#39;s a nasty chesty thing that has caused me no end of problems, reset my natural body clock and messed me up. I didn&#39;t get the flu shot as I don&#39;t fit into the demographic of people who should. I know plenty of people who should get it though and who haven&#39;t. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the same all over the country but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me. The people I know who chose not to get it said it&#39;s because they couldn&#39;t be bothered or because they don&#39;t think they get the benefit from doing so, is they get sick anyway. If this is the case all over the country then I guess the lack of uptake on the shot combined with the unusually warm weather is probably a contributing factor to the high flu figures this month. Personally I think all the fuss over this so called Aussie flu is just to try to panic people into getting the shot. I remember seeing last year that a new strain of the norovirus (winter vomiting flu) had emerged and that went strangely quiet. It&#39;s funny that it shares the exact same symptoms as Aussie flu and attacks the population every winter...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For anyone worried about this, I will repeat what I previously said.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Pauling">Linus Pauling</a>, one of only 4 people to have ever been awarded 2 Nobel prizes (his scientific Nobel is in chemistry), spent a large part of his life studying the effects of Vitamin C, what he calls “megavitamin” therapy, and its near-miraculous healing power. </p>

<p>See his 2004 book, <em>Healing Cancer: Complementary Vitamin &amp; Drug Treatments</em>, or his 1987 book <em>How to Live Longer and Feel Better</em> in particular.</p>

<p>Per this particular thread, I can also mention his 1977 book <em>Vitamin C, the Common Cold and the Flu</em>.</p>

<p>And again, realize who this man is. </p>

<p>Look also into liposomal vitamin C (a way to increase one’s intake of the nutrient). </p>

<p>This is probably one of the biggest medical discoveries of our time. The reason nobody speaks about it (and indeed the reason it is suppressed) is because ascorbic acid cannot be patented and is extremely easy &amp; cheap to produce. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Most ailments are a function of oxidative stress. Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) is (one of?) the most potent antioxidants we know. It is really that simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would not venture giving advice on this one, sorry. There is no sodium in pure vitamin C, it is only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen (C6H8O6). It is true however that if you take more vitamin C than your body needs, it will be excreted through the kidneys (end up in the urine, and possibly cause benign diarrhea if the dose is even higher).</p>

<p>It is probably best to follow the advice of your doctor on this one. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a longstanding belief among the mainstream medical community that vitamin C increases risk of kidney stones. &quot;Reports of kidney stone formation associated with excess ascorbic acid intake are limited to individuals with renal disease&quot;. Reviews state that &quot;data from epidemiological studies do not support an association between excess ascorbic acid intake and kidney stone formation in apparently healthy individuals&quot;, although one large, multi-year trial did report a nearly two-fold increase in kidney stones in men who regularly consumed a vitamin C supplement. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, with dietary excesses not absorbed, and excesses in the blood rapidly excreted in the urine, so it exhibits remarkably low acute toxicity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in the UK and I rarely catch the flu even if other people have it...yet a few months ago I was struck down by a pretty nasty case of the flu. My housemate caught it from his workplace, I ended up getting it a day later. I found out that most of my immediate family members also caught it but they live in completely different parts of the country.</p>

<p>The symptoms were pretty awful, though I overcame them. The throwing up only lasted a day, the sneezing lasted about four days but the coughing lasted almost a fortnight. That proved to be the worst part since it affected my sleep immensely.</p>

<p>Ginger tea seemed to help a lot, though. As did frequent baths/showers. </p>

<p>A month after the illness ended I felt like I was catching it again though that proved to be nothing more than a scare. Now that it seems to be making the rounds again, though, I&#39;m super wary. I don&#39;t feel as though the UK is prepared for  dealing with the flu - people are stubborn or pressured into going to work even when they should not be exposing other people to their germs.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not unusual to board a train or a bus here and find multiple people coughing or sneezing. It&#39;s definitely weird how quickly it spreads, though. I avoid most cases of flu as mentioned earlier so I only tend to get one every 2-3 years...so I tend to see it as a sign of a really, really invasive strain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I picked it up in class around mid-October. Then I went out of town and picked up a different strain I&#39;m still fighting. The first was pretty bad but out of flues I&#39;ve had in the past a walk in the park. This time I got sick as hell, felt better for a day, and then was slammed twice as hard for a couple more. The coughing is unbelievable, the mucus is so thick it doesn&#39;t want to come up. I&#39;ve shit violently all week.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if vaccinating is part of what&#39;s creating super flu, like extreme sanitizing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get free flu vax because I&#39;m asthmatic, same goes for elderly, children and pregnant women. They bombard me letters and text messages EVERY YEAR reminding me to get flu shot. I used to suffer horribly with flu, chest infections and tonsillitis monthly. As a kid I was pumped with antibiotics, shots, drugs and steroids constantly. Also a shitty diet. Years back I stopped flu vaccines, stopped taking antibiotics, switched to whole food plant based diet and I also spiritually grew a lot and dealt with depression/anxiety naturally. I haven&#39;t had the flu since, haven&#39;t been hospitialised with asthma, no chest infection, barely even a cold. In fact the only sickness I had last year was food poisoning. </p>

<p>If you live a healthy life (I mean in all areas) you will generally be healthy. </p>
