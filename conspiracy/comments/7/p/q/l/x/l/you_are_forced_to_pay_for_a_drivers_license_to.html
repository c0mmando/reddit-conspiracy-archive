       And this is just one example of how much control they have over us. We are the cattle. They profit off of me and you. Is this what we want? Is this what we want for our children? Is this what we want for our children's children? How far are we going to allow this hand of corruption to extend before any of us say enough is enough. It doesn't matter whether you believe 911 was an inside job, sandy hook was a hoax, vaccines are bad, or the fluoride in the water is killing us all. What matters is that our first step should be to stand together as a collective group and say enough is enough! No single person no matter how powerful can drain the swamp, it is only us, we the people, who can drain the swamp. Until we can all stand together and put our differences aside for just a moment, they will have total control and it is only us to blame, not George Soros, not Donald Trump, and not Hillary Clinton. We let this happen.

       at one time in the US, most people lived in concentrated urban areas, and very few lived in rural areas (those who live in rural areas worked the land and stayed there)
      </p>
      <p>
       then the introduction of cars made it possible and convenient for more people to move away from cities and into "suburbs", some of which have no public transportation or walkable resources, even though such areas are unsustainable
      </p>
      <p>
       but no one is forced to live far from resources when high-density areas still exist (though some have distaste for them), and while cars are nice to have, very few people are forced to have them. also, in the past people walked more and further.

       80.7% of americans live in urban areas, and most urban areas have public transportation. hardly a niche situation

       I don't understand... What alex is saying is completely true. Some employers even subsidize public transportation/biking. Some people I know have commuter bikes, biking 45min to and from work rain, shine, snow. Bus transit is really easy also. Having a car is pure convenience unless you in butt f*** nowhere or terrible transit cities like Detroit.

       Well the other side of these “taxes” and “fees”, in all practicality, money that goes towards DMV practice/employees, money that goes to the state highway funds, IT, money that goes to misc. social programs, etc. it’s not like someone’s lining their pockets are with DMV fees... if they’re trying to game the system, they’re probably going to do it as the board members of Walmart or any other big corporation...

       I think what we're saying is having a car is convenient in maybe urban centers but not necessary. An extreme example of this is New York, where it's actually more of an inconvenience to own a car. If you live near work or have other means to get to and from work, a car isn't necessary.

       That's what Alex was referring to dimwit... trying to be polite to help your dumb ass understand, but Jesus Christ are you dense. Not everything is a fucking conspiracy. Sometimes, if you look at the bigger picture you can see that even though shit sucks, it's just simply the matter of it being the best system we have. Not everything is built or the way it is to line the pockets of some mysterious 1%er (which btw is a fucking retarded line of thinking because people move in and out of the 1% ALL THE TIME) keeping their boot down on us plebes from reaching better conditions for our living.

       Some people have cars and some people don't. If you have a car it takes man power to keep track hence fees...

       Let me spell it out for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       "80.7% of americans live in urban areas, and most urban areas have public transportation. hardly a niche situation"
      </p>
      <p>
       Urban is simply a descriptor same as rural. The easiest way to quantitatively classify an area as urban or not is based on population density (or household density). This is a spectrum from high-density to low-density, where we usually think of high-density as urban, low-density as rural, and the middle of the spectrum as suburban.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here, Alex is saying if you fall within 80.7% of the population you really don't NEED a car because of available public transit systems. If you fall outside of this %, living outside of urban areas it was their CHOICE to do so, with the exception of very poor people who might have been pushed out of the urban city centers. This is the population we should be concerned about, but that's another issue. If you have chosen to live outside the urban center and live in suburban areas, you have lower rents thus making a car more affordable than someone who might live in the urban center. But this does NOT mean that public transportation is not available even if you live outside of the urban/city center and you live instead in the more suburban areas of the city or even in the rural areas of the city.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there is higher population, you get better, more consistent and more frequent public transit options making it less necessary sometimes even a hassle to own a car. For example, 56% of New York City's households don't own a car. Did you know in some areas of New York people BUY parking spaces like they do a home? It's because of the density of the city. 26% of households in Detroit, a very large and completely desecrated city with urban planning that was built on the concept of cars with large city blocks, do not own cars.
      </p>
      <p>
       In conclusion, having a car is a luxury, meaning it's convenience oriented. If you live in an area with little to no public transit, you're more than likely living in a more rural area which means living costs will be significantly lower, and your opportunity cost for owning a car might outweigh not owning a car and it might be beneficial to invest in a car.
      </p>
      <p>
       "No it wasn't. Alex's agrument was urban. By his logic I live in a urban area and his logic doesn't apply"
      </p>
      <p>
       To explain again, even if you live outside of the urban city center, there are still public transit options. Sure someone might have to walk longer, wait for the bus longer, etc. but again I'll reiterate, owning a car has a convenience factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Now research why the system is the way it is and how it plays into the large system."
      </p>
      <p>
       The "system" is the way it is, because that's what it has come to be. It's a work in progress, it's not as if some nefarious 1% decided this is how we should live. Cultural, social, technological, medicinal  advances have changed and shaped our recent history to what it is. Sure, I can believe there's powers at play that have slowed our advancement, but there hasn't been a better system for this size of population. If you can outline something better, I think we're ALL ears.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Tell more about how the city isn't "urban" thus not applying to his logic. Also please explain to me the difference between city transportation and urban"
      </p>
      <p>
       Cities are a gradation of urban to suburban to rural. Some are purely rural, some purely urban or any combination of all. His comment says "urban areas." He's not saying urban isn't a city and that logic is just stupid, because you're using the words wrong.

      <p>
       I never once denied that public transportation existed. You thinking that solves anything especially when you used New York as an example. Legit you go from decent public transportation to non existent. So the need for a car grows the further you get away. This isn't that hard. You sound shelter or a "tough guy".
      </p>
      <p>
       How often do you use public transportation?

       Look you ignorant twat, I grew up using public transit going to and from school because both my parents worked 6-5 every weekday and most times weekends, to make a better life for our family. They worked hard to INVEST in a vehicle so they can shuttle themselves to and from work and would take less than than taking public transit. Again, they had to INVEST for CONVENIENCE. This convenience allowed them to have more time to go to work, spend with me, etc. It was not a requirement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life is tough, the goal is to work hard and gain GENERATIONAL WEALTH so you children or grand children don't have to spend/waste time going in public transit, if it's a burden. Some people start out poor, that's fine, so you gotta bite your lip and work your ass off so your kids have opportunities you never did.
      </p>

       You're still spitting out the same nonsense and can't shut your ego off for a second to listen to literally everyone on this thread telling you you're an idiot. Grow up or grow a pair.

       Just the metro, no school transport.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not meant to be a sob story. It’s just to illustrate people don’t need a car, because where you come from everyone lives in the lap of luxury. It seems that in your world view everyone absolutely needs a car to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your attitude shouldn’t be a shock I️ guess, ignorant of poverty, to think everyone has a car, that if they don’t, they are somehow unable to function in the world... I’m happy for you that you’ve had such a comfortable life, I have faith though, in the future, you’ll learn of those people you’ve completely left out in your world view.

If you can’t take the simple step to question your own simplified and childish world view, and you’re not willing to listen to someone who might contribute to expand your simplified understanding of how the world works, then you might as well not comment until you look into the topic yourself and be able back it up with some effort rather than one line retorts that does nothing to push the conversation.

       You clearly have no argument. Plenty of people with jobs and kids don’t drive.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be less convenient (although you may be forgetting about fueling up, servicing, the licensing and registration process, insurance, oh yeah and actually having to drive instead of being driven as in public transport), but then I guess the convenience is what you’re choosing to pay for and so there is no conspiracy, you’ve just chosen expensive convenience over cheap freedom from the shit mentioned in OP.

       I would bet every dollar I have that somebody in your town who lives near you and works near you gets by in life just fine without a car.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that he does and you don’t comes down to choices. You have chosen convenience and subservience to the government. Your mate down the road has chosen inconvenience and freedom from the woes discussed in OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you feel you have made the right choice, you have no reason to cry like you are. If you feel like you have made the wrong choice, you also have no reason to cry.

       This is true, and it's why the Obama Care (ACA) mandate was/is a much better example of control.  The fact you were mandated to purchase a product from a private institution or be fined for being alive was mind blowing.

       yes-- imo if you are being forced to do or have something by the federal government, it should be illegal to also make you pay for it. if the government can't afford to pay for it, then they should not force people to have it

       It's economic fascism, but people don't want to see it that way because they got expensive insurance that covers pre-existing conditions (which isn't insurance by definition).

       What I don't get is why the fuck we have insurance in the first place. We need some overhaul in the medical industry, with patents, malpractice laws. We could bring down the cost to treat people and charge appropriately. Our medical industry is hyper inflated. The real reason we still have insurance companies is so they can continue to over charge for care.

       I think it is an obsolete model. It's role is to only hinder the ease of treatment. The cost of which has hyper inflated not just procedures but medications as well.

       Ok. How would that work for things like roads? You would contribute only to the maintenance of roads you drive on? Would we install gates at every intersection and road entrance to keep freeloaders off the roads they didn't pay for? Seems a bit complicated.

       So we make every road a toll road and implement some sort of ez pass system that charges the vehicle everytime they drive on a road? Do we care about a uniform standard of maintenance for the roads? Does it cost the same to drive down each road or can the prices be set via other factors? If road a has 500 vehicles drive on it a day and generates x amount of revenue and road b only gets a 150 vehicles driving on it a day generating less revenue, do the vehicles who need road b pay more for the access to the road in order to maintain it since there are less vehicles using the road or does the quality of maintenance on road b suffer in comparison to road a because of the limited funds its use bring in?

       Like how private colleges are more affordable than public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or how the private library system is better than the public library system
      </p>
      <p>
       Or how FedEx is cheaper than the Post Office.
      </p>
      <p>
       And how UPS sends all your letters for cheaper than the Post Office sends mail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or how much better private roads are than the public highways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please. Not everything is better to just be done by a private company. Companies and corporations are by definition, only looking for a profit. They are looking to serve you, at best, second to turning a profit. In some cases that's fine, restaurants, for instance, fight for your approval and money. So we get some great service there.
      </p>
      <p>
       But libraries... there's NO MONEY in loaning anyone and everyone free books and other media. None. No money. No way to make that profitable. So we all pay a few bucks in taxes that go to libraries, and that keeps them funded, stocked, and staffed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not all black and white, public versus private. They're are benefits to each.

       Lol. For all the public services you listed you are only taking into account the cost to the consumer. This is of course after tax. I am talking gross cost, which is obviously what matters.

       And I love how you say “we all just pay a few bucks tax” to keep libraries open, as though this is a fair system.

       Never use libraries? Couple of bucks. 
Use libraries every day? Couple of bucks.

       Im going to come to your house and do a shitty job of moeing your lawn and washing your windows. Half the grass will be cut lower than the rest. I may edge or I may leave it. Ill even kill some of your grass and leave soap suds on the windows.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will then send you a letter demanding payment that is 5 times higher than market rate. You will have to pay me a retainer fee of $75 once a year and pass a test demonstrating you know how to fertilize your lawn.
      </p>
      <p>
       After all this if you don't pay me I will send an undertrained and over egod group of men with guns to your home to put you in a cage and sell off your shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       By your logic all of this is perfectly legal and reasonable as long as I call myself government.

       For good reason. If we can guarantee no loss of life with driverless cars why wouldnt we subsidize that and keep encouraging people, who are terrible at driving, to drive?

       I agree that, just like now, that people 'terrible at driving' should pay a higher premium.  However, if I have a clean record with no history of accidents or violations, I would hope that my premium will not be raised just because I choose to drive my own vehicle in an era of driverless cars.  But, bet me, it will happen regardless, in an effort to take yet more control and sovereignty from citizens.

       How is it taking anything from you? You can still use a vehicle to go anywhere you want to, and even with a clean record, you are statistically orders of magnitude more likely to hurt somebody else than a driverless car. There is literally no reason for people to drive once the infrastructure and affordable means exist for everybody to have one.

       "literally no reason for people to drive"....speak for yourself, please. I love driving and having full control of my vehicle. And I do not feel I will be alone in wanting to continue to operate and control my own vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, as far as what is being taken from me in my hypothesized-scenario, it will take more of my money to continue to do the exact same thing I am doing now: drive my own car.  That's all I'm saying...they will use driverless cars to charge those who want to maintain control higher premiums, regardless of driving record.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of technology renders less and less control and responsibility over ourselves and our lives as human beings.  If you don't see the viable concern with this premise, then I implore you to think a bit more critically about the trade-offs between state-mandated "security" and individual self-reliance.

       You realize how fallacious that argument is right? Nobody NEEDS to drive, if we have a means of transportation that is as efficient or better and is orders of magnitude safer than the current one there is literally no logical reason to fight against it.

       There's a few holes in this to list. I'm not saying you're wrong, but you're only looking at this from one side. I'll name two for example:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Drivers license shows you comprehend at least basic driver/road laws for driving. I'd much rather drive with people that know than people that might not know. You can't trust everyone to do their own
         <em>
          independent
         </em>
         research on driving laws.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Road taxes are unavoidable. Unfortunately, nothing in the world is free. So, road taxes are way to pay for the roads. If we didn't pay them, our roads would be riddled with potholes or they would be non-existent. Or suppose we didn't have to pay them, and the money came from somewhere else. There would be another (or multiple) government-provided services that would have their funding slashed or dropped.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Taxes aren't meant to be bad. It's meant to raise revenue for the country, so we can all have a decent life. We don't experience that here because the US has it's priorities completely out of order.

       I agree with your comment for the most part and it's very hard to argue the 2nd point you made. Your first point though isn't all that strong I feel because you could apply that to almost anything. It's the government telling everyone that it's for "safety". And all this improvement of safety comes at a cost and that cost is our freedom.

       You're right. It could apply to other things that government claim is for your "safety." I guess I'm most comfortable with relinquishing that freedom because I view driving a car as life and death. You're taking your life into your own hands and other lives, too. One mistake could be very fatal, so I will begrudgingly get a license and be thankful others have them, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although, I do have to say, it's bs how you can get a $150 ticket, in the state of SC, for not updating your address information on your license.

       If the license proves we have basic road comprehension why do we have to pay for this license year after year. Why not take the test…pay for the license and be done with it?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing about the drivers test…written or driven that proves anyone is competent to be on the road in all the various conditions and situations that can arise…nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can get a license at 16 and never be retested again UNLESS you prove (through tickets/accidents) you are inept. Why couldn't the same measuring stick be applied right from the beginning?
      </p>
      <p>
       A driver's license is mainly a method of control. Nothing more. I can be charged with a "crime" for simply not having my license on me when I'm driving. Why? Does it contain some magical properties that improve my driving?
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as road taxes…how about auto manufacturers having to pay the lion's share of them. Or Amazon who wouldn't be able to make billions delivering their products without them? They benefit more than most by our road system. Neither of them would have a business were it not for OUR roads.
      </p>
      <p>
       Citizens pay for the infrastructure and corporations benefit. Externalization, it's called.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally taxes don't raise revenue. Taxes pay interest on the debts we owe to private banks from whom we borrow the money, at interest, to pay for our infrastructure.

       From personal experience from a lot of people I know, they value their car than almost everything. Alot of them have an existential crisis when their car is damaged. So TPTB sure do a good job making millions value specific objects they identify with to further distract them.

       I have no idea what your first sentence is supposed to mean.

       I think “maning” is supposed to be “manning”, but other than that I’m lost.

       Can you find me the government link that explains how the gov allows banks to create all new currency by lending it into existence (at compounding interest) instead of spending it into existence, interest free, through the treasury?
      </p>
      <p>
       No? You can't find that link? Weird. It's not like the gov to mislead or lie to us.

       Haha....I don't know how many people you've killed with a vehicle, but I'm flawless, dawg, and yes, self-reliant.  You bet your ass I will drive my own car if I want to. Try and stop me. Nice logic, though.
