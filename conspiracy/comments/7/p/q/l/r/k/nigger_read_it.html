       “Nigger!”  shouts a man dressed in muddied boots, weathered pants, and a stain shirt.
      </p>
      <p>
       A black man sitting at the bus stop rises up.
      </p>
      <p>
       With a calm demeanor he begins to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Let your heart be at peace, I see no nigger here.
No sir there is no nigger here indeed. Nor do you see a proud black man before you. What you see is but a man. The foundation of my strength does not come from the color of my skin. So I wont be so easily provoked. Because if I were to build myself up on the basis of my skin color that would cause for a weak foundation. One so easily controlled. One that gives way to emotion. But i’ve built myself up knowing that I am a man. More so than that I am human. This you can’t take way from me. No. But I have fought for your right to call me a nigger and I’d do so again. For if it gives you reprieve to  express that vitriol then please do so. Because I am no nigger and can never be one. That word has no power over me. I’ve never thought for a second I could be a nigger. Never knew a man who thought himself one either.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The man who shouted nigger. Has paused but for a moment,  he moves his mouth to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the black  man continues.
      </p>
      <p>
       “You see, all those that build themselves up on the basis of skin, white, black or brown are weak individuals. They can be controlled and pressed. Push to react a certain way. Because they have to protect the foundation that they’ve built up. They will be hard pressed to recognize that you can’t really build on top of that foundation, because you’ve got to constantly defend it.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “My parents told me I should be proud to be black, they too didn’t understand that my sense of pride came from within. Not because I was born with this skin. I was shunned from other black kids that thought I acted too white .I never knew what that meant. SO I told them I am who I am, what you see is skin. You don’t see me for who I really am.”
      </p>
      <p>
       He takes his seat at the bus stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       The man who shouted nigger begins to walk again. His eyes bloodshot, and the smell of liquor off his breath. He with teary eye’s says “Niggger” , he falls to his knees.
      </p>
      <p>
       (What you don’t know about the man shouting nigger is his wife was beaten and raped by 4 black men. For some gang initiation. His wife didn’t survive. So the hate in his heart grew. But the man before him was no nigger this he knew. )
      </p>
      <p>
       He begins to weep.
      </p>
      <p>
       The man who spoke from the bus stop rises once more. He offers his hand to the man weeping. He brings him up to the bus stop bench. Embraces the man with a strong arm around his shoulder. Allows the man to cry. There they sit in silence, with the balling of a drunken man. He never knew the back story of the man who exclaimed nigger. But he didn’t need it.
      </p>
      <p>
       He saw a hurt individual who only knew how to express his pain through words. Was it wrong to express that pain? No.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I wrote this because I think there is conspiracy to not only divide us but for us to some how be afraid of words. To allow words to have power over us. The topic at hand isn't something that should be censored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Freedom of expression in all of its glory should be embraced. Aye if you got hate in your heart then out with it. If you must call me names to rid yourself of that hate then so be it.

       I'd like to say that I'm not a black man. I am mixed race cuban, white (Scottish, i believe)  Born in the United States of America. That makes me 100 percent American. But before any of that I am human first. Whatever that means.  I think race and identifying with it and building yourself up on that basis is something that is very detrimental to society.

       Nah pretty spot on.. I guess this where your going to use propaganda and ignore the way blacks have been treated then use IQ to prove your point.

       Fair enough, it's either acknowledge youve been lied to continue to usher in the cultural genocide of "whites/europeans" but either or blacks are going to be here till the end. White people are playing themselves at this point.

       Either the point is that black people are more likely to be poor, poor districts are more likely to be undereducated, and artificial measurements of intelligence like IQ should not be used.

       If you are basing your beliefs on what someone is saying about what would probably happen if every black person took an iq test, you're putting loads of faith in assumptions and more than that, you're hoping that somehow if it's all true it makes you surperior to a ton of people.  If you need someone to look down on to feel better then you need to first be at peace with yourself.  Get over your self loathing somehow, go do something good and worth doing.  Because when you are truly at peace with yourself,  you won't need a race to look down upon.

       A halmark feature of the modern domesticated man is the delegation of personal authority to others.  Instead of working out a neighbor dispute, they call the police.  If someone is too noisy in a theatre instead of asking the person to please quiet down they call staff.  Revolving doors stop, and they wait instead of just pushing the door.  Something needs fixing on the car or around the house, they call the repair man instead of trying to do it themselves.

       I have an inalienable right to self expression.  I do not advocate or call for violence (outside of self-defence or defence of family from an imminent threat).  Therefore, no entity has any authority to tell me what words I can and cannot use.  But, there are idiots who haven't the ability to build a context-appropriate vocabulary- that is a different topic

       Words only have the effect intended when the recipient is weak. If you know who you are, are confident in yourself, and truly find inner peace, those words become not insulting but a cry for help from their speaker.

       You can find those who are "awake" simply by observing an exchange such as this.  These days that's how I find the people I want in my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, I would also want to invite the speaker into my life.  Why?  He listened. That tells me he is waking up.

       What you don't get, is if he isn't allowed to say that shit to my face, he will go and plot with his buddies. The hate becomes more compartmentalized, hidden from society until it gets to a boiling point and have an all out race war.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you don't get is that their ideology is weak and can be countered with strong argument. What you don't get is by allowing freedom of speech to reign true. It ensures that we all have the right to express ourselves. So the price of that freedom is to tolerate things you might not want to hear.

       No it is because I can walk in others shoes, that I put this up. I won't hold back my words to stave off sensitive feelings. I want to harden those individuals to the reality of life. Words have no power over you nor I, though we give power to words. WE allow them sway. Why oh why is it this way. Words may move mountains indeed, they can incite revolution. They can cause tyranny. Words are powerful. But what words we give power and how that power can be used is ultimately up to the individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand full well how words can be harbinger of sadness, on how they can put a frown my face. But think for a moment why is it words can incite such feelings in me. Is it because I believe there is truth to the words. If i renounce those truths, and see no reflection of myself in those words then they could not harm me.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want me to not share this great ability. Oh if you would walk in my shoes for but a moment.  You would see, I only try to bridge the gap between you and me.

       Not how the real world works.  I am white and have been called this by both friend and foe.  I go places where I am the minority all the time.  I will hear that word perhaps hundreds of times before I leave.  If I let one slip, all hell might break loose.  To me, it is about respect primarily with context also being important.  But I know everyone does not think that way.  To me, it is disrespectful to use it so much in my presence.  But again, not everyone thinks that way.  Respect should go both ways, but in this case it often doesn't.  So the context is that I am white and I have no business saying that word and if I do say it in certain company, then I better be ready for what could be coming to me.  Like it or not, that is the context.  Plain and simple.

       Look at you giving this word power. Though I understand your perspective. Now imagine if you could just say that world and everyone of color that was around you didn't react in any kind of way.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if it the response you got was nothing of agitation. No reaction at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because all the black individuals that you are around realize that the word nigger. Has no reflection of themselves in it. That they won't give power to the word by reacting to it, because they could never imagine being a nigger. What is a nigger who knows it certainly isn't a black man. A nigger to me is just a word. I wish this could be true to all. So I will try my best to fight the ideology that it is cool to keep that word. To identity with it.

       Your own ideology makes that word have bad connotations. DO you see black people or just people. I wonder. DO you like that one group can say a word but another can't? Isn't that odd. One word has so much power. But it is taboo. A word. Think about that. If I say nigger and elicits no response guess what happens to the power of that word. It becomes null. If everyone is okay to say nigger then guess what nigger becomes nothing but a word. If I put no emotional power in the word it holds no sway over me. It holds no sway over anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you react to the word, it shows me that you allow that word to have power over you. I could predict how you react if I were to push further.  I could make you a menacing fool if one single word pushes you one the edge.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what we can no longer allow to happen, it is what is causing further divide. I want people to find strength not in the color of their skin, but from within. I don't want proud black men walking around or proud white men walking around and the only reason they are proud is because they were born black or white.
      </p>
      <p>
       What kind of pride is that. They can find nothing else in themselves to be prideful for. So they have to use their own skin color to give them self worth. It is laughable. It is appalling. It is sad. It is maddening. I will not go along with the agenda. Not any more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such is the time to speak out and speak loud. Renounce the propaganda. Let Freedom ring. Let MLK's dream ring true. Tolerate those with hate. Rise above it. For those filled with hate watch as it has no affect on you. Then you can flip the switch and watch them become the menacing fools.

       I'm pretty white, but I've got enough minority in me that I tan up real nice when I get some sun. I don't use that word out of respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if some white power asshole or some gangbanger piece of shit gets in my face and I know the one word that will get him upset is that specific word, can I use it?
      </p>
      <p>
       The black community reappropriated it but then the sjw movement got ahold of it and used it like a fascist tool to co-opt people to their way of thinking or else face potentially violent life changing reprisals,over using a fucking word. The backlash was so huge the country elected Trump despite the fact Bannon was attached to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was coming up if a white kid called a black kid that word there might have been a fist fight. Now it holds so much weight that just using that word carries the risk of destroying both peoples lives even if a black kid calls another black kid that on a fucking school playground or let's it slip while a little drunk at a party for Christ's sake.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's not hate speech then what's the fucking real problem? If it is hate speech lets hear it and let someone's own words shine a light on themselves.

       Op wrote a short story and used the shock factor of a powerful word to make a point about getting along with fellow humans despite our different experiences. I've seen a lot of other media use that word's shock factor for no other reason than to be tough or street or angsty or unnecessarily provocative and they've won fucking awards for it.

       Well, yes they won awards for it because they are helping give power to the word. My attempt with this is to remove that power. To acknowledge that it has no power. To relegate the word to it's proper place.

       You had this story, but then failed miserably with your explanation. People who go around saying shit don't suddenly become less hateful-it doesn't make them "get the racism out." Free speech is great, but being a shithead is still being a shithead.

       Oh but it does keep the racism out in the open not hidden from society. Do you think that if we ban a word and bar its use that it removes hate? Or does it hid that hate from society. Are we to pretend it doesn't exist?
      </p>
      <p>
       You misunderstand, I say let them spew the hate for all to hear. We can combat the ideology of hate. With the ideology of love and compassion. With our words we can battle the hate filled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free speech is great, and the price of free speech is hearing things we don't want to hear. Shit heads will still be shit heads.
