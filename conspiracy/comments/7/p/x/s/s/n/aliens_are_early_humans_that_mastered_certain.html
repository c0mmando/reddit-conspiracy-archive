       Hi, first time posting here but I've been lurking for a while. This post was inspired by Revelations of the Pyramids that I saw posted here by u/axolotl_peyotl and watched today.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7oqwc1/the_revelation_of_the_pyramids_2010_featured/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I thoroughly enjoyed the documentary. It was very well made, well researched and utilised access to academics to, not necesaarily, prove a point, but indicate inconsistencies and innaccuracies in terms of what we know, or at least have been told, about the Ancient Egyptians.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it, that can be done thoroughly in the comment section, but basically the massive trove of mathematical coincidences in the Great Pyramid's geometry, the materials they used to build with and the supposed tools at their disposal ca. 2500BC make it seem unlikely that it was done as has been proposed i.e. using barges to carry granite blocks in excess of 100s of tonnes and then hauling them up ramps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on how far technology has come along in a couple of hundred years in the Modern Era I see no reason why an ancient civilisation, like the Egyptians, could not have made every advance we have a few thousand years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to include free energy in this discussion because I think it exists based on my experiences looking at the sky and seeing stuff flying around that definitely wasn't a conventional aircraft.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the Egyptians and other ancient civilisations mastered the technologies we have (including free energy) and even a lot we have no idea about and then fucked off into space to see what was going on out there. Maybe these are the pilots of at least some of the advanced craft that visit us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there are plenty of theories out there. I'd like to hear them. Supporting information would also be great, interviews, inconsistencies in historic or scientific reports that you've come across, even assumptions, as long as they are logical and based off some sort of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have at it.

       That's supposedly the same thing that happened to the population of Mars according to CIA Remote Viewing experiments... They knew the cataclysm was coming and most of them left to explore for new planets to inhabit while the rest stayed behind to die from climate change.

       Sweet cheers. I'm pretty sure Ingo Swann did this or a similar remote viewing on Mars. He's a contemporary of Jacques Vallee, a UFO hunter and theorist (and the guy Spielberg based his main character on in Close Encounters).

       Ingo Swann trained the military remote viewers at one point.  I have read a book by Ingo and he has a very interesting writing style as well as very interesting material in his book.  First book I ever read about remote viewing was by Paul Smith, one of the army remote viewers.  I wrote a little bit about it in my blog here (
       <a href="https://fosvis.wordpress.com/reading-the-enemys-mind/">
        https://fosvis.wordpress.com/reading-the-enemys-mind/
       </a>
       ).  I recommend checking out Ingo Swann's book (
       <a href="https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/penetration.ingo_swann.pdf">
        https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/penetration.ingo_swann.pdf
       </a>
       ).  That book was so interesting to me that I read it in one day.  I read that book
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       I read the book by Paul Smith... so seeing that in Smith's book Ingo is said to be very accomplished in his remote viewing abilities, reading Ingo's book and seeing what he wrote about and experienced was mind blowing.  Who knows if he was telling the truth in that book, but if he was, then all I have to say is wow.

       It's an interesting theory because the evidence for their discovery of advanced technology would be buried on Mars where we really haven't explored much rather than Earth where we have already explored ancient ruins extensively. Visiting spacecraft may not leave much evidence of their technology behind, but we see indications that advanced technology was
       <em>
        used
       </em>
       to construct megalithic structures.

       I think civilizations like Egypt and  the Mesopotamian societies may have possibly derived some of their masterful understanding of the natural world from previous civilizations we know nothing about, and perhaps those civilizations were as advanced or more advanced than we are now. It's improbable, but possible I suppose. I don't think Egyptians had spaceships and free energy, but perhaps they knew about flying vehicles and electricity. I think it'd be more likely that they knew about geometry and the technology they implored because of ancient knowledge that managed to trickle down from a more advanced civilization before them. That civilization could have been as advanced as the west in the 18th century, or perhaps only as advanced as the roman empire, or maybe, although less likely, as advanced as we are now or well beyond that point. Who knows. We have so little to go off of with this theory, that it is little more than wild speculation, but I'm certainly open to the possibility. It would only make sense for human civilization to arise in the past prior to some of the many natural disasters that could have nearly wiped them out.

       Imo you are right on about a roman empire level civilization from before the Younger Dryas event. In my opinion on the coast of the Indian sea/persian Gulf somewhere. That's why you get the Indus valley civilisation, Sumer/fertile crescent civilizations and some probably colonized upper Egypt via the Red sea and Gulf of Suez, then expanded towards the coast and the Nile delta as population grew. All the oldest egyptian cities and pyramids are inland in the Egypt/ethiopia border area, not on the coast by Cairo or Alexandria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also IMO, the place to find the origin civilization is somewhere on the bottom of the sea not far from the Indus delta, ie coast of pakistan and india.

       I like to think that if a small group (maybe a few hundred) 'martians' escaped earth, they could only do so on a space craft with limited resources. So they land here and survive with their knowledge of mars etc for what, three/four generations before their stories start to be twisted, mis-remembered and oops all of a sudden you have the makings of religion and all of those thousands of tales from thousands of civilizations.

       I Believe in evolution, but i can't understand (somebody smarter than me please explain) why we lost our monkey feet and tails? Like, when would they not come in handy?

       That's true, generational distortion of facts don't take long.
Monkey hands and feet become a hindrance when you're sprinting across open plain. That's also the theory why we evolved into upright creatures.

       See, i have heard that before that human feet were good for running across plains. But, did all humans go around pretending to be Usain Bolt of early man? Didn't some humans stay in jungle/forest environments?

       Why not evolve to run on all fours if we needed to sprint about fast?

       Yeah the jungle dwelling folk certainly threw me off a bit. Monkey feet would be better for that, tails too. The four legged thing though, if we were quadrupedal then we wouldn't have hands like we do (hands that are really good for manipulating small objects). And if our front limbs were legs with functioning hands then there would be too high a risk of damaging them if they were used for movement (I reckon).

       I believe there are missing pieces to the theory of evolution as well. If life is merely about survival, why evolve towards more complexity. Basic life forms are far more resilient to environmental changes than large mammals. Why not stay small and flexible. Why create languages, morals, and religions? Do they help with the survival of our species? If survival is the only goal, we should be like xenomorphs from the movie Alien; they're deadly killer that could spawn easily.

       12,000 years is a long time. And robbery is real. There are a few "Egyptologists" who are more like gatekeepers and who have in the past been known to deface and defile ancient sites and tombs to hide the truth behind ancient civilizations and maintain the mainstream theory on Egypt. It's been theorised that some of these Egyptologist families belong to secret societies.
       <br/>
       Have a look up of the Dendera light hieroglyph as a good piece of evidence for Egyptians using electricity via wires. I personally think ancient Egyptians were quite advanced in science, though not exactly as we do science in some respects. They could have gone down a different path and put their attention and focus on different technologies. Sound resonance and light/laser tech for example. Could be applied very well in structural engineering, transport, and medicine, to suggest a few.

       Basically what I posted above... Our culture is not too old, and we're closing in fast at breaking into the ability of coding our own genome, and building anything we want from organic structures. We're not there yet, but imagine if there were people like use here say 100,000 years ago. Whatever their culture became, it would appear incredibly alien to us, even if they were from Earth. So alien in fact to our understanding, that I theorize that, there are ancient people's around us, and shamans and priests have talked with them over the millennia. But the information on where to look is kept SUPER secret. Like if you find out even a tiny bit, it's a kill you, and everyone you ever knew, type secret.

       That for is is completely unknowable. There are hints in all religions, but there is so much disinfo, it's hard to know where to start.
      </p>
      <p>
       To begin with, the secrecy of the older religions, and their treasures libraries closed to the public, is a HUGE red flag that there is some super serious info that is not being shared with the public.

       Wow, super dark. But maybe the secret literature held by religions is secret not because it has any groundbreaking information regarding the true nature of reality but because it is all random confusing nonsense that completely discredits the narrative of their scripture or just documents detailing terrible things done in the name of their religion.

       They wouldn't hold it so closely or take it so seriously. I think that they would have no trouble destroying documents that details atrocities and anything that defames their scripture.
      </p>
      <p>
       From their behavior it seems clear they are hiding something that they think is important for us not to know, possibly the truth about our history. Whatever that may be. For reasons such as to keep us under control in their psuedo reality of the dollar, oil, debt, and power. The knowledge they keep implies free energy, which would destroy the system of greed and control if given to the slaves. It may also reveal our true purpose, and why we are here. That is the knowledge that would free our minds, and that is why they hold it so close, because us being free is not part of their plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are guarding the knowledge... why? because knowledge is power, and guard it jealously because they they want to keep their power. It's simple, and pretty obviously what is going on.

       Mayhaps they went the same way we are now, by developing organic technology, and liquid crystal storage media.

       There could be ancient people of Earth all around us, and all we have left, are legends about old beings that live one with nature. Sooo many legends referencing the idea that, we are not alone. Even the Bible says something along the lines of, do not draw or discuss things, viewed below the sea, or in the heavens. Which is an obvious information control program.

       How does the quote about technology, and comparatively primitive people?

      <p>
       "Technology of any decent level, appears as magic, to those unfamiliar to it's nature."

       I feel like you have to know nothing about egyptian history to believe these theories. So a super advanced civ took 100’s of years and many many many failed attempts at the basic pyramid structure before they figured it out?? They had the power to magically move big rocks but lacked basic construction knowledge? They had to start with big piles of dirt then ziggurats to figure it out? Just because YOU PERSONALLY don’t understand something doesn’t mean there’s a conspiracy around it.

       No one said they lacked basic construction knowledge because they clearly didn't. But the Great pyramid isn't basic construction, the documentary explains how it's an incredibly complex feat of engineering and that the tools modern historians claim were used were likely insufficient. There are other coincidences and inconsistencies pointed out by the documentary as well as a heap more that aren't in the documentary. The aim of my post was to get a discussion going so if you've got something constructive to add to kill the theory or push it in a new direction then go for it.

       I think the ancients had help from what they were told/believed  were gods from another world (aliens to us) that were actually fallen angels acting as gods. Would explain all the nearly inhuman structures found all over the world.

       Some people might call them angels, that makes it more religious than scientific but they equate to the same thing. Angel just means messenger after all.
You reckon the Egyptians would probably have had help rather than figuring it out for themselves?

       Sure.

       The book of Enoch is a text written by a man named Enoch who is mentioned in the bible as one of Noahs relatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       The book of enoch mentions many things that happened in the times pre flood
(pre flood because he is an ancestor of Noah) and in one of the sections, Enoch explains how there were fallen angels (he names 'Watchers') that came to earth to teach humans things that God never intended us to know (ex. abortion, astrology, etc.)

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that I am basing my personal theory only on The Book of Enoch and you have to also remember because, although Enoch the man is mentioned in the Bible multiple times, his book is not included in the bible, so it is important not to view it as a religious (christian) text but as a historical text.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do some research, watch some videos about it.  It is really a fascinating text and I think that these 'Watchers' might be the influence that was received by the ancient civilizations.

       The fact the book of Enoch is not in the Bible, yet is referenced multiple times makes me highly suspicious. Maybe it was hitting too close to the truth. It really seems like there's a cover up of the Nephilim, who are mentioned in Genesis 6 as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Enoch is alleged to be the only human to not experience a death from this realm, as God took him straight to heaven.

       According to certain communications the alien race (they themselves speak of being from Venus, so no fallen angels or anything) that built the Pyramids did so, because they themselves received help of a similar kind when they were at our stage of evolution, so they thought why not be of service to people of earth and provide them with Pyramids for initiation and healing purposes. They themselves however had a much more peaceful population on their planet and some of Earth's people perverted their teachings to gain power over others instead of using it to be a service to mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
       After realising their mistake they left and decided to change their way of helping to observing earth and providing an informational channel which is available via meditation to the seeker.

       They are fallen angles as in Demons.  Their sole purpose in life is to please Satan and pull God's children away from God. If they said who they really were, people would know that the opposite exists and be more susceptible to reject them.  Satan and his angels best and favorite tool is deception.

       I reckon they had help from some of the humans left over with advanced knowledge from the previous advanced human civilization(s) that existed before the cataclysmic disaster of the younger dryas period.
       <br/>
       Like imagine if some huge cataclysmic disaster happened today and some modern day engineers/scientists who had survived passed on their knowledge to some of the other survivors like some African tribesmen, as they would then also mutually pass on knowledge back to the scientists of how to survive off the land. Over a very long time an exchange of information like that could be misinterpreted as aliens/gods coming to teach of magical ways.

       Have a read into some of the work of Graham Hancock if you yet haven't. He researches this exact topic and has been writing about ancient civilizations for 30 odd years now.
       <br/>
       I do think aliens are real and they're here on earth, but I don't think they have a very direct role with humanity really. I've done plenty of research myself into aliens and even seen a couple ufos, but it appears as though they're taking more of a bystander role in our human development. At least in this human epoch. Who knows, they very well could have had a more direct communication with the ancient human civilizations before the collapse, but it doesn't appear (in my personal opinion, at least) that they've had much direct contact with humans en masse over the last ~12,000 years.

       I think governments have been back engineering alien tech from crashed craft since the mid/late 1940s. I don't think that any governments are secretly in direct contact with alien species. I would
       <em>
        speculate
       </em>
       that there may be
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       people at the tops of some super secret societies/secret elite bloodlines who may be in contact with some other small groups of other alien species (though that ventures into breakaway civilization territory, so it remains speculative on my part to suggest any more), but I believe that the general majority of humans - even within rogue military elements - are not in contact with aliens.
       <br/>
       I do believe that there is a small minority of regular people who are in contact with the odd individual or small groups of aliens through "abductions" and such. But more like how some humans keep tabs on certain individual animals, like sharks and whales, for scientific research. Though obviously they would have a bit more direct communication with each other, as both humans and aliens are similar enough in conscious self-awareness to be able to communicate, whereas sharks and humans aren't similar enough in that respect to communicate. But I reckon of those individuals most of them can't exactly call up the aliens. The aliens just turn up when the aliens decide. Unless the particular human has developed their consciousness enough to project it out (psychically, essentially) so as to directly communicate. But I think then even they would be a very small minority of individuals within the small minority of humans who get "abducted" (note: I only put that in quotation marks because I don't really like the negative connotations that come with the word 'abduction').

I'd also recommend the documentary "Unacknowledged" by Dr Steven Greer, which is on Netflix, for further info into the subject. I've been fascinated by aliens since I was a child, so I've done loads of research into it, and I still continue to. I can't claim to know much in regards to the larger picture and many specifics (I realise that in that respect of the bigger picture I truly know fuck all), but I've certainly done enough research to know a fair bit more than the average normie, haha.

       I've seen Unacknowledged. It was dead good. Though from hanging out in r/UFOs I've heard that Steven Greer is a somewhat polarising and contentious figure.

       Indeed, the stuff he addresses can be quite polarising. Take it with a grain of salt definitely, as you should do with anything to be honest, but I believe he's definitely at least onto a decent theory. If you're curious toward the consciousness aspect of it I'd recommend reading into Nassim Haramein and his theory on the
       <a href="/r/holofractal">
        /r/holofractal
       </a>
       subreddit. Also I would always recommend reading the CIA paper "Analysis and assessment of the gateway process". It directly address the whole aspect of protecting consciousness from the holographic universe perspective. You could also watch the video on YouTube "Itzhak Bentov - from atom to cosmos", or even better read some of his books: "stalking the wild pendulum" and "a brief tour of higher consciousness".
       <br/>
       Sorry if I'm overloading with info haha, I'm just quite passionate about the topic.

       Came here to write exactly this. The fallen angels and the nephilim (giants) could have built the pyramids. It would explain how those massive rocks were moved around. 3 or 4 giants would have no problem moving one of those stones.

       How about instead of aliens, angels, or gods... We are discussing beings beings in a higher dimension then we are. So we trade with them for information.

       Trying to remember the video I watched from the early aughts on the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guy was talking about human sacrifice en masse to higher dimensional beings, in trade for blood magic type abilities, or something along that line.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also points out that the term city, comes from cite, which has some kind of connotation of rape or sacrifice.
      </p>
      <p>
       My mother raised me to hear truth with my heart, so much of what this guy discussed rang close to true.

       .. will try to hunt down this guys video, but honestly it's been years since I last saw it.

       Edit: I remember one of the points made, was about the magic being used against humankind. One of the main rules for it is, you must tell your victim what you are doing, before you do it.

       I suppose potentially yes, but it's like asking us to be in the body of a pixel. Sure it would be interesting on some levels, but the lack of input you are used to, would borderline on insanity

       OK, so what if something like a DMT breakthrough is a method of communicating with other beings like this? From what I've heard the DMT machine elves kind of fit the bill and if the effects of the chemical were longer than the stated 20-60 minutes then madness would probably occur inhabiting a world like what the breakthrough world is supposed to be like.

       I've sampled a few myself, and I find ayausca to be the most extreme form of diving into another reality. So extreme in fact, there is generally quite a but of retching, as your body reorients to the new sense experience.

       I can't believe the bullshit we teach in schools.
      </p>
      <p>
       After spending the last 2ish years learning about ancient Egypt I've come to the conclusion there has to be something being covered up. The fact we still tell people that they dragged so many of those stones into place in only 20 years should show that. I don't remember the exact math off the top of my head but it was wicked small mere minutes per block
      </p>
      <p>
       And they dragged these things across miles of desert from the quarries too? Please.
      </p>
      <p>
       Me and the missus have been meaning to watch this documentary the past few days hopefully we will have some time tonight. She's not big into conspiracy stuff in a larger scale but she's down the rabbit hole on Egypt

       The mass of the Great Pyramid is estimated at 6 million tonnes, 800 tonnes every day for twenty years. With 8000 slaves it would be 220 pounds a day per slave. It's not exactly farfetched considering modern egyptologists estimate an average of at least 25000 slaves were working at the site at any time.

       Ancient writers like Erodotus wrote about a hundred thousand slaves, so modern egyptologists are mainly lowering historical accounts seeing them as an exaggeration. Minimal number is around 7000 workers to move and work the stones alone, but they must have been surely more because not all workers were in their prime, and because to organize such mass of people you need police, cooks, medical staff, engineers and so on.

       Duh, to store grain, obviously. The grain was all used up to feed the worker. So, they made it a tomb for the retard king who ordered it built in the first place, after the palace coup to depose him for spending all the countries wealth in this meaningless endeavour.

       The hilarious thing about the grain storage idea is how ineffective it would be.  They're clearly masters of their craft, yet we're expected to believe they're too stupid know how little storage room there is in the pyramid, and how inefficient it is at storing grain vs. say a big fucking rectangular bin.

       It was a block every 80 seconds or something like that which if they were using ancient tools and methods then they'd have to be some hench motherfuckers like the Engineers from Prometheus.
Either it didn't take twenty years or the Ancient Egyptians were way advanced or they had some help from who knows what. I just don't know which.

       Depends how many blocks one team can do, the bigger the pyramid the longer it would take to move one block to where it needs to be hence in order for a block to be placed every 80 seconds over time you would need more teams to achieve this average. Unless when construction started the teams could lay a block every 3 seconds and by the end of construction every 3 minutes averaging at 1/80s.

       Since it's a pyramid most of blocks will be in the bottom layers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom 10% have 27% of the stones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Half way up the pyramid you have already 80% of the stones completed.

       There's also a theory that the stone isn't stone but a geopolymer similar to concrete. Not sure I believe it but it is an interesting theory.

       It's good to always remember two things.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         History is written by the victor/information suppressionist.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         All of science is based off of theory and tests. EVERYTHING is open yo debate, and new theory, depending on facts and info available.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Much of science is based rather loosely in proven fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of my favorite theories about Egypt, is that the major names in the Bible, were all in Egypt. Names were altered and two separate histories created to make us think they were not one and the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also interesting is the idea that there were not slaves in Egypt that built the pyramids, but skilled Craftsman. Yes, there was likely some kind of caste system, and passing of skilled trade within a family. Today, we couldn't get a company to build a similar pyramid, with similar supposed technology if we tried.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there is NO true theory, on how the pyramids were made. Just many bad ones, full of assumptions, and holes.

       There is one I can rec though. The story of Ramayana. It doesnt really seem to be about high tech but instead suggests that there may have been more then sapient homonid species on earth at the same time.

       Theres also some old chineese mythological tales that seem to collaborate this. Cant remember its name, but theres one that also features a monkey king and his army.

       The monkey king myth is about a monkey demon going through trials to become an enlightened being like Buddha; it is not related to any technologically advanced past.

       Ancient Chinese kingdoms did, however, regard their founding ancestors from the age of their version of The Great Flood as highly advanced people. One of the details I remember is a man going to the god realm to steal a pile of magical dirt that could multiply indefinitely. The people then used the dirt to build walls that could grow forever to ward against flood water. These are supposedly the same people who created Chinese written words, the only writing system created independently from Sumeria, Egypt, and Maya.

       I get what youre saying,but I didnt really bring up his story because it was about high tech,but because its a second hint from way back when that there may have been other sapient species.

       Vedic theology iirc states that there have been six or so cycles of humanity, eacch with its very high technrise and subsequent fall. There’s also mentions of sky chariots and what we might call lasers and fusion technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have to be super careful not to apply a modern lens of interpretation to the texts, though. Just like us moderns, ancients were prefectly capable of making fantastical stories up.

       That's a good point. I've often wondered about how much economic metal there will be in old landfill sites in the future. Maybe they were the first civilisation to reach a circular economy where the waste was used for something else and the waste from that process was used for something else etc etc.

       Yes but is it not better to allow evidence (or lack of) to lead the way in forming a confident understanding of history as opposed to explaining away the lack of  evidence /ancient garbage to un-falsify a presumably testable hypothesis?

       There are many other homo sapiens like our closest ibilis.  Short and thick build but there are people walking around today who could pass for one.

       One of the ideas of Graham Hancock that stuck with me was how it’s not a far fetched idea that there was an ancient advanced civilization coexisting with hunter gatherer tribes. Think about it, it’s happening right now/recently. There are people in the Amazon and in Africa that haven’t seen other people or only were discovered recently. Plus all of the ancient structures underwater kind of makes you think about what was lost when sea levels rose 12000 years ago..

       Well... the sphinx is puzzling.  It seems like it may be much older, but not sure the pyramids necessarily are.  There have been ancient writings talking about the construction process.  Its likely that they had much more advanced machining techniques and tools which have been forgotten.  Relatively recent research has even found evidence of the internal ramp and open corners which were used to bring the blocks up.

       How old is the Sphinx supposed to be?
To be fair I imagine the ramp would come in useful regardless of what methods you were using to build.

       Not sure we can know but there is reason to think perhaps 7,000 BC or so... some point back nearly 800,000 years.  Mostly based on water erosion evidence and star alignments.  There isn't a lot to go on unfortunately.

       Have geologists/material scientists done studies? I think there would be a lot data required to verify anything in terms of that as you would  have to have numbers about change in precipitation levels that far back. For that you'd need temperature and local environment data for local climate through time. It'd be a nightmare. Star alignments I know nothing about. Is there something you can point me towards for this?

       Yes, there has been a lot of study of geological data.  But as I said, it just isn't proof.  I don't know how it would be proven unless some sort of historical records or time travel.  If you search, there is abundant information.

       If you have access to various academic portals you can pretty easily verify the geological data... but as for whether it really proves anything about the age of the sphinx is the main debate.

       I remember seeing a show on tv about the astronomical aspects of the pyramids.

       Unfortunately, its been so long ago,I cant remember the name of it or which channel it was on.

       If you keep searching for info on the astronomy, youll eventually stumble across it.

       I’ve read through most of the comments on this topic and I’m very excited to see this topic getting some attention. Of all the information posted I wanted to share a piece of information that’s pertaining to the possibility of how I think they moved these massive block stones across the the desert. This video will completely open your eyes and give you a new perspective on how much we still don’t know. If you find time to look at some of his other work you will not be disappointed.

       What’s funny about this is, astral projectors have confirmed beings on the other planets in space. There was also a war on the moon, the holes were not caused by meteors but bombs.
