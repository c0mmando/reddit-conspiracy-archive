       I think this is the greatest cover-up, or "conspiracy" of all time, in that who we are as people and where we come from has been hidden from us. My personal experiences with DMT have changed my life dramatically and lead me on an intellectual exploration to understand who we are and who we could become as a people.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of other people are having similar experiences right now and are called to write books, produce art, and make visual media about DMT. This guy is one of the better independent producers, in my opinion. It's only a half hour; worth watching:

       Yeah, I hear you on that. And the more you know the more you know how much you don't know. For me DMT opened up new worlds, or new realms, a new enjoyment of life that comes from authentic spiritual exploration, most of which can't be put into words, though art is a useful medium. I close my eyes at night and amazing landscapes and sensations are accessible to me.

       The "thing" that is unknowable to the mind is the knowing/awareness/consciousness with which the content of mind and experiences of the senses are known. The mind knows only objects or things, the underlying formless invisible reality sometimes called consciousness is knoweable only to itself which we luckily are.

       Here are some quotes from the ancient vedic books:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Reality (Truth) is ONE: the wise call It by various names. (Rig Veda)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Brahman is Consciousness." Sanskrit: prajnanam brahma. (Aitareya Upanishad 3.1.3)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The Self (the Soul) is Brahman."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The human body is the temple of God.
One who kindles the light of awareness within
gets true light.
The sacred flame of your inner shrine
is constantly bright.
The experience of unity
is the fulfillment of human endeavors.
The mysteries of life are revealed.
(Rig Veda)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Of everything he is the inmost Self.
He is the truth; he is the Self supreme.
(Chandogya Upanishad)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The highest Self, all endless bliss,
the unconditioned limitless consciousness,
being realized, whether through the great texts,
or through Yoga, in all experience whateverâ€”
let one lose himself in the ecstasy of Realization,
for he has forever lost all touch
with bondage of every description.
(Svarajyasiddhi)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Bright but hidden, the Self dwells in the heart.
Everything that moves, breathes, opens, and closes
Lives in the Self. He is the source of love
And may be known through love but not through thought.
He is the goal of life. (Mundaka Upanishad)

       OK, I hear you; thanks for caring. We might differ on the definition of mind, is all. I like to use the Rupert Sheldrake definition, that the mind is separate from the brain, extends beyond the brain, and is intricately tied to a greater "overmind," which DMT taps us right into. But that might be semantics. Great quotes.

       Have you read much Carl Jung? He describes three separate part of the mind. The Conscious animal mind of this time, the eternal spirit, and the shared subconscious. Though I've never used it, from what I can gather DMT allows you to pull back to your eternal soul, and experience the subconscious mind of the universe. What are your thoughts on this?

       I believe that when Jung went on a o writing the red book he was getting closer and closer to hidden truths, he did some sort of deep meditation, it is said not only that he had visions but also strange happenings occured while he was writing it.

       I actually recently started that book, it's written from the perspective of his ego talking to the "spirit of this time", or ego, and his soul. His soul gave him one of my favorite quotes
      </p>
      <p>
       "Do you believe, man of this time, that laughter is lower than worship? Where is your measure, false measurer? The sum of life decides in laughter and worship, not your judgement."

       He was deeply interested in Kundalini meditation, Christian Gnosticism, and likely many other sources of ancient wisdom. Very interesting guy

       Yes, I just bought a book called Archetypes and The Collective Unconscious. I was impressed how his footnotes are from alchemists, sometimes even obscure occult books, love how Jung used to really dig deep into ancient knowledge. I want to read the red book but apparently is too expensive, reminds me a little of Philip Dick's Exagenesis.

       Mind can have many different definitions so I will say the same thing in this way: That which is known can never know that which knows.

       We say "I see, I hear, I experience." This I if we trace it back in our experience not through thoughts but through awareness will reveal its nature. This is why God said "I am that I am" when asked for his name. I am is the awareness of being aware, the knowing of being. Of course the reality that these words like I am and awareness refer to is entirely non conceptual and cant be imagined or labeled accurately.

"You cannot see That which is the Seer of seeing; you cannot hear That which is the Hearer of hearing; you cannot think of That which is the Thinker of thought; you cannot know That which is the Knower of knowledge. This is your Self, that is within all; everything else but This is perishable."

       Ah thank you! That helped me completely get what you're saying! Damn. I'm really keen to get onto reading the Vedas and further Hindu texts and transcripts. I've only relatively recently started getting into Hinduism but I feel that it already resonates so well with me.

       Maybe. When I had a "breakthrough" I forgot that I existed for several minutes. Pretty positive experience, although that initial rush is daunting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't buy the whole "entities waiting for you in another dimension" angle of dmt though. It affects people's brains in a similar way, they see similar things, and the power of suggestion causes their brain to see the "machine elves" whether or not they're actually there.

       That's what a lot of people get the first time. You probably are doing it kind of wrong, though that said, DMT breakthroughs are so insanely intense that you don't necessarily get an examination of yourself, though a lot of people do some major self-examining when they come down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going for a DMT breakthrough is pretty unique in the realm of drugs. You only have a real short time period- I estimate 45 seconds- to get as much DMT into you as humanly possible. Your mindset going in is hugely important, of course. I think not combining it with alcohol is the most important thing; I tell people to not even drink the night before (shamans say to take a week to two weeks off of alcohol and even caffeine before doing ayahuasca). Minimizing caffeine or pretty much any other drugs besides maybe weed is really key. I would always meditate beforehand. And then really importantly, take humongous hits, like the biggest you can take, and hold them in for a solid ten count. It's not like smoking weed. You need to get a lot in you real fast. If you're trying to breakthrough, take three or even four huge hits. But that's the only chance you get; you can't smoke more an hour later and go further. It's definitely a practice, and I was likely to have almost unlimited DMT available to me for a while, so I really worked at it, but that's basically it. Most people don't get nearly enough of it into their lungs fast enough to break through. Terence McKenna was really both inspirational and informative on this subject, as I imagine you know, but here's the talk of his I often reference:

       I'll tell you this because I know you'll believe me if you've been doing this type of exploration. You can get your body to replicate somehow perfectly dosed amounts of DMT through deep meditation with binaural audio beats. This allows you to travel out of your body (controllable) to different realms. Read Robert Monroe's Journeys Out of the Body to get an idea of what you can do.

       I've successfully performed this feat 5 times or so in the six months I've been trying. I could actually feel the crystal in my pineal gland activate piezoelectrically right before the last time I left my body and traveled through solid objects and out of the physical universe to Locale 2 as Robert puts it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gist of it is to lay down and meditate with the right binaural beats going. It can take anywhere from an hour to a few minutes to get the intense vibes going in your body through total relaxation and quiet of mind.

       interesting... I was definitely drinking at the time.. and had been, consistently for a long time prior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlikely that I'll come across DMT again for awhile but, if I do, I'll approach it from a more spiritual angle.. rather than the 'i'm drunk, i'll try anything' one:)

       DMT is described at being jolted into the astral for a short time. Ayahuasca on the other hand is described as a prolonged, gradual ascension to the astral. It is very hard to get however and many recommend a guide. They have ayahuasca tours in Peru.

       I actually recently started that book, it's written from the perspective of his ego talking to the "spirit of this time", or ego, and his soul. His soul gave him one of my favorite quotes

      <p>
       "Do you believe, man of this time, that laughter is lower than worship? Where is your measure, false measurer? The sum of life decides in laughter and worship, not your judgement."

       He was deeply interested in Kundalini meditation, Christian Gnosticism, and likely many other sources of ancient wisdom. Very interesting guy
