       Sounds like Herman Rosenblat on his fake Holocaust survivor story he made thousands of dollars off of - in his mind, it was real to him and if people agree with it, its real to them, too.  So make up shit, get paid, don't let facts get in the way.

       This is the result of a degenerating culture in which generations of children have never been taught critical thinking skills. For some fool like Wolff to even suggest this way of thinking means he doesn't believe critical thinking even exists en masse in this country anymore.

       It's an admission that some of the quotes are bullshit. He's stood by the fact that everything said is accurately quoted. When you're quoting the Trump White House, you have to know that half of what's said is bullshit.

       You think the book is only about Bannon said? You know, there's a big world out there outside of what the media tells you. Try turning off the news and reading a book or something.

       People don't usually release proof of everything in these types of books. I don't think people should assume it's all true. That said, no one is even denying they said this stuff. So, why are people assuming they didn't?

       This guy ain't a whistleblower lol. He didn't interview anyone in the cabinet. He even admits that he knew a lot of what he was told were lies anyways. I'm not even a Trump supporter and this book just reeks.

       My point isn't this specific book. All politicians have negative press. The thing we should be debating is the push for government censorship/review of information in the major news networks. The ability to self-publish on the unrestricted internet or if building your own damn printing press will soon be outlawed. About the push for revealing sources or prosecution against (let alone the murder) of whistle-blowers and journalists. People who speak up at public meetings being arrested. Tweets being reported as news and if that's now a more liberated form of a press release/conference. There's an attack on experts, people who have spent years of education and experience in fields, being silenced or dismissed by anecdotes or obvious illegal means. What does it mean to report anymore, especially when we have legislators that campaign on an issue and vote the opposite?

       I'm not, I just see you make idiotic comments all the time. I've commented on your posts 3 times in total. If you seriously think it's acceptable to use 9 year olds as erotic clothes models, nothing you say is of any relevance.

       I don't know how many times I need to explain to you that I expanded the conversation on drag. I made no comment on the validity of the ad campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I'm not having children and wouldn't want public photos/presence of my kid. But if I did have a kid who wanted to do drag (and that's completely different from expressing being transgender, as others also conflated), you bet your ass I'd be sewing costumes and in constant supervision. The kid is not performing burlesque. How is a stage kid, in plays or ballet, different from drag? Yes, there's some drag artists that are hypersexualized, and not doing classic routines, but that's a conversation about feminism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not engaging in dialogue with you again, unless you change your clearly manipulative and disrespectful agenda. Toodles.

      <p>
       Auditorium/studio goes dark.  Then America the Beautiful starts playing as backlights behind the stage slowly turn up to reveal Trump's silouhette...and someone standing next to him.  Still in shadow, no one knows who it is.  Then Trump starts as the music fades with a rant about the media.  Then slowly the spotlights facing them turn on as Trump announces the guest host for the night....JULIAN ASSANGE and the crowd goes wild both in attendance and at home.

       He's being called out as a liar, if he had tapes he would have already played them. We'll never hear the tapes. Because they don't exist. Every time the tapes are brought up he is shifty and nervous and changes the subject. The actions of a man with something to hide.

       I'll wait for the libel case, where Trump will have to go on record claiming such facts are not true. Until then, so much of the book has cooberated, I'm going to take it at face value, and it be one person's view on how the administration runs.

       You think the book is only about Bannon said? You know, there's a big world out there outside of what the media tells you. Try turning off the news and reading a book or something.

      <p>
       Maybe even this book, because it's not true or untrue until you read and see if it feels true!

       I don't know how many times I need to explain to you that I expanded the conversation on drag. I made no comment on the validity of the ad campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I'm not having children and wouldn't want public photos/presence of my kid. But if I did have a kid who wanted to do drag (and that's completely different from expressing being transgender, as others also conflated), you bet your ass I'd be sewing costumes and in constant supervision. The kid is not performing burlesque. How is a stage kid, in plays or ballet, different from drag? Yes, there's some drag artists that are hypersexualized, and not doing classic routines, but that's a conversation about feminism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not engaging in dialogue with you again, unless you change your clearly manipulative and disrespectful agenda. Toodles.
