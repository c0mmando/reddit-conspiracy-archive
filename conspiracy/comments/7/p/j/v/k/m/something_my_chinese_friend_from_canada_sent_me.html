        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">100</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-01-10 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/raydasian.html">raydasian</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Seriously? If anything, ancient India is sorely UNDERRATED.</p>

<p>I mean, <em>I’m an ethnic Chinese living in Canada.</em> But when I was growing up in Canada, I knew jackshit about India. Besides maybe curry.</p>

<p>I mean, people here have a vague understanding of Chinese history but they have NO idea about Indian history. For example, most people know that the Middle Kingdom is how China referred to herself but how many people know about <em>Bharat?</em> How many know about even the Guptas? People know that China was famous for ceramics and tea but how many people know about <em>ancient India’s achievements in metallurgy?</em> People k now about the Great Wall, but how many know about the <em>great temples of southern India?</em></p>

<p>This is partly due to the lackluster historical records that ancient Indians kept and also partly because <em>modern Indians have a tendency to look down upon their ancient heritage and view western ideas and ideals as superior.</em> China also has this problem but not nearly to the same extent.</p>

<p>The discovery that the <em>earth is spherical</em> is credited to the Greek philosopher Aristotle, who was born in 384 BCE. However, very few people know that a man from ancient India established the idea of “spherical earth” during the 8th-9th century BCE. <em>The man was called Yajnavalkya</em> who first discovered that the earth is round. He was the first to <em>propose the heliocentric system of the planets</em>. In his work Shatapatha Brahmana, he proposed that the earth and the other planets move around the sun. He also <em>calculated the period of one year as 365.24675 days. This is only 6 minutes longer than the current established time of 365.24220 days</em>.</p>

<p>Take the example of Kung Fu. The whole world knows about the martial art called Kung Fu. The person who founded <em>Kung Fu was none other than a prince of the Pallava dynasty from Kanchipuram</em>, Tamil Nadu who visited China during the 5th century CE. He became the 28th patriarch of Buddhism and <em>established the Shaolin temple</em> and founded the martial art which became world famous today. That prince was called Bodhidharma.</p>

<p>But how many people know about that Kung Fu and Shaolin was founded by an Indian?</p>

<p>Precisely, if Indians are unaware of their heritage, why should they expect that someone else will know about their history and achievement?</p>

<p>The achievements of ancient Indians are lost in obscurity. India’s ancestors had invented many ways which eased the basic life of a common man. These inventions may seem primitive today, but we can’t ignore the fact that these were revolutionary achievements during their era.</p>

<p>The Indus Valley civilization is <em>known for the broad and the sanitized drainage system</em> which was no less than a miracle during those ancient times. But how many people know that the ancient <em>Indians from Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) were the first to invent a flush toilet?</em></p>

<p>The people around the world use rulers to measure everything. How many people know that <em>Indus Valley Civi lization was the first to invent the rulers?</em> A ruler has been found at Lothal which is 4400 years old. Not only this, the people of IVC were <em>the first to invent buttons</em>. The world knows that the Chinese discovered the art of weaving silk dresses. How many people know that <em>IVC people were the first to weave dresses made of cottons?</em></p>

<p>The ancient Indians were <em>first to invent the weighing scales.</em> Archaeologists have discovered weighs and scales from the excavation sites of Harappa, Mohenjodaro, Lothal etc. These scales were extensively used for trading.</p>

<p>Ancient India has given <em>Yoga to the world- which is widely practiced almost all over the world to keep people fit and fine.</em> Models, supermodels, film stars, athletes, etc. regularly attends Yoga session to keep themselves fit.</p>

<p><em>Aryabhatta, Brahmagupta and Bhaskaracharya</em> were the three eminent mathematicians from ancient India who established the <em>concept of zero as a mathematical value in different eras.</em> Brahmagupta was the first to invent a symbol for the value “shunya” (zero). </p>

<p>Bhaskaracharya was the <em>first to use it as algebra.</em> The oldest inscription of zero can be found at the <em>Chaturbhuj temple in Gwalior fort.</em></p>

<p>Ancient Indians were pioneers in the <em>field of chemistry</em> too. The person who first invented the <em>“atomic theory” was none other than Acharya Kanad from ancient India</em>. He explained the atomic theory using terms like “Anu”(atom) and “Paramanu”(nucleus).</p>

<p>Ancient Indians were advanced in <em>medical science</em> too. The great physician of the time, Sage Shusrut was the first to carry out different surgeries which included plastic surgery and cataract surgery. His works are composed in his book called Shusrut Samhita (The works of Shusrut). The world hardly knows about <em>Charak, the great specialist in medicine from ancient India</em>. He was the first physician to establish the problems and medicinal treaties in fields like <em>physiology, embryology, digestion, sexual disease, immunity, etc.</em> His works on Ayurveda is composed as a book called Charak Samhita (The works of Charak).</p>

<p>The Chera dynasty of Tamil Nadu invented the idea of <em>producing finest steel by heating black magnetite ore along with carbon</em>. The mixture was kept in a crucible and heated in charcoal furnace. The Wootz Steel originated from India, but today, is popular as Damascus Steel.</p>

<p>India’s monuments are grand and are probably, the only way others recognize the importance of ancient Indian civilization. India’s gigantic monuments bear the testimony of the greatness of ancient India.</p>

<p>This is the <em>Kailash Temple. It is a megalith</em> which was constructed by cutting out a single rock- a mountain. The whole mountain was cut from the top to carve out the temple campus.</p>

<p>This is <em>Dwarka, the grand and mysterious city submerged in the Arabian sea on the extreme west of India.</em> The submerged heritage is no less than a treasure bearing the pride of Indian race!</p>

<p>This is <em>Khajuraho, the marvel where the rocks</em> has taken the form. The best of our monuments are not built on soft rocks like marble. Our ancestors carved out even the hardest of the rocks to give it a beauty.</p>

<p>The grandest and largest temple in India- <em>Brihadeshwara</em> temple. Breathtaking, isn’t it?</p>

<p>India is the land of grandest temples and breathtaking architectures. The heritage of India can’t be encapsulated within a small answer! To end the answer with, I will now share my personal favorite- <em>The Sun Temple of Konark!</em></p>

<p>The main structure of the temple was partially destroyed by invaders like Kalapahad- a military general of the medieval period. Later, the prime structure totally collapsed when British stored gunpowder inside the structure and it caught fire accidentally.</p>

<p>Even though the main temple is gone, the amount of what left is still breathtaking by every means. Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore wrote about Konark- <em>“here the language of stone surpasses the language of man.</em>”</p>

<p>The whole temple was designed like a huge chariot of Sun God having 24 wheels pulled by 7 horses. Each wheel had 8 major spokes denoting 1 prahar (Hindu time period of 3 hours). There was a huge magnet at the top of the temple which used to keep the idol of the Sun deity suspended in the air due to magnetic arrangement.</p>

<p>Still think, that ancient India is overrated?</p>

<p>Ancient India was a hub of culture and technology and the absolute capital of world spirituality. I could talk about India for hours. India is many things but OVERRATED is definitely not one of them.</p>

<p>The megalithic cities that sit off the coast.</p>

<p>I believe there is even an episode of Ancient Aliens where they discuss an Indian inventing a flying machine centuries prior to Da Vinci (Show is shit, but they use a lot of good sources)</p>

<p>Much of the information that survived for a good portion of time was lost in the fires at Alexandria.</p>

<p>That show is what happens when you stretch out material for 10 seasons :p</p>

<p>There is good info there, but there just isn&#39;t enough to make as many episodes as they have without throwing in a little BS to fill up time.</p>

<p>At least we got Giorgio Tsoukalos out of it ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>one of my favorite quotes/stories for describing the universe (come check out r/holofractal) is Indra&#39;s net:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Far away in the heavenly abode of the great god Indra, there is a wonderful net which has been hung by some cunning artificer in such a manner that it stretches out infinitely in all directions. In accordance with the extravagant tastes of deities, the artificer has hung a single glittering jewel in each &quot;eye&quot; of the net, and since the net itself is infinite in dimension, the jewels are infinite in number. There hang the jewels, glittering &quot;like&quot; stars in the first magnitude, a wonderful sight to behold. If we now arbitrarily select one of these jewels for inspection and look closely at it, we will discover that in its polished surface there are reflected all the other jewels in the net, infinite in number. Not only that, but each of the jewels reflected in this one jewel is also reflecting all the other jewels, so that there is an infinite reflecting process occurring.[5]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, I highly recommend people read Herman Hesse&#39;s Siddhartha, a book that &quot;deals with the spiritual journey of self-discovery of a man named Siddhartha during the time of the Gautama Buddha.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ancient India is <em>fascinating</em>. You were right to bring all of this up, my only complaint is I had to google up all the things you were talking about. </p>

<p>We also have the Vedas, and all of the space war legend stuff that I am particularly interested in. India holds a lot  of ancient mysteries and legends, it is a huge gaping hole of information in world history. I have always wondered why that is, and your explanation that the natives think their history is lame compared to the West helps a little, but still is hard to understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ancient India may be underrated but part of the reason is that many attempts have been made to over rate ancient India,  and those claims have been discredited.</p>

<p>Relative to ancient China,  I would take the Chinese culture and history as equally important any day of the week.    China also has a great deal more home grown elements and continuity to their history,   and doesn&#39;t have the history of ridiculous claims that India has.</p>

<p>The mythology of both cultures needs to be sorted out by discerning students,   but it seems the Chinese are more willing to do so.    Just look at what you are claiming about Bodhidharma,  which is most certainly mythological.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, OP.</p>

<p>There is so much to say about Indian culture. I think one of their greatest achievements is how knew to put they figured out that it&#39;s all about Consciousness. They realized so early on the limitations of the intellect and foolishness of a holding materialistic world view. They are also very big on direct experience(of mystical truths) as opposed to intellectualizing it or simply taking it on faith - that&#39;s why there are so many practices or as some would call technologies that they developed(Different forms of yoga, meditation) in order to achieve high levels of consciousness. My guess would be that India has a very long history, maybe the longest out of all of the civilizations that still exist(if you look at the phenotypes, they really do look like a mixture of every race). They have gone through every phase from the nature worshipping, to the empire building, to the technological and scientific, and finally they have settled at spirituality. From the outside, we may see a third world country where people like to shit out in the streets but there is definitely more going on there than what meets the eye. I would love to visit India someday and experience it for myself.</p>

<p>And let&#39;s not forget about how amazing the food is. If you haven&#39;t tried it, I highly recommend you yelp a local indian spot and have a night out with your friends.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the problem of farmers commiting suicide, the endless call center scams, the villages with the prostitute gods, the outlawed but still practiced class based society - &#39;the untouchables?&#39; the brick factories that take families hostage and the arranged marriages and disowning of family members who have affairs hence the female romance private investigators, and the huge grey market economy where upon the government recently just canceled the most common currency denomination overnight which lead to people getting murdered in line ups to the bank.</p>

<p>India is an incredibly vast and diverse country though with an incredible past--theres literally more megaliths there they&#39;ve pretty much forgot about than anywhere else. Their tech industry is pretty big and cool, and their crazy program to feed every student lunch or whatever was revolutionary and has been copied even in first world countries. The design of the crazy 3 story kitchens they use for it is pretty intense too. </p>

<p>Also uighur culture in Xinjiang and tibetan culture. All of those are in China. Although Freud usually gets the credit, tibetan buddhists knew about the unconscious mind centuries earlier.</p>

<p>India has such a rich tradition of spiritual traditions. To this day you have millionaire yogis and prophets because people have such strong faith. I really admire a culture that with such a rich tradition of introspection and self understanding. </p>

China has a multiple millennia long reputation of completely fabricating their history as well as their &quot;discoveries&quot; and &quot;inventions&quot;. Just look at where they were positioned on the spice trade route. They had access to pretty much the connection point to all the smart shit the world had to offer. Also look at how they claim to have invented gun powder/black powder but yet never progressed it to anything other than fireworks. While almost he moment the Europeans got it they invented all kinds of different weapons.</p>

<p>That said even if it does flare up, India doesn&#39;t have many nukes while China can glass all of India so I think India would have to submit at some point. Pakistan would probably join in while the US, Russia and Israel would stay silent since they&#39;d take China&#39;s trade and manufacturing over India any day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a a bit late, but Indian here and a huge bunch of us knows about this but we disregard our own history because thanks to the British rule, the western ideas and philosophies have more weight. 
Indians love to appease to western ideologies and people. And honestly, when you try to bring to light that &quot;oh. India did this long back&quot; we face backlash from a lot of people by the same statement of &quot;you people shit on the streets&quot; although not entirely false, but they are also victim of history. 
Like, Brahmagupta had already derived the Pell&#39;s equation but nobody seems to care about that. Or for that matter recently, the very popular ram sethu bridge connecting India and Sri Lanka was discovered and confirmed to be man made is called as &quot;Adams bridge&quot; because apparently some Adam discovered it. The bridge was in our ancient texts of Ramayana and we have been saying this for years but disregarded again. 
Being the &quot;3rd world country&quot; nobody likes to take us seriously. It&#39;s like this narrative is being pushed upon us and the whole world?
A lot of Indians even think that taking or using the ancient Indian methods is radical of us and we are somehow displaying a Hindu superiority.
And it would be really nice of people to know that Hinduism is a philosophy and not a religion. 
I don&#39;t really care about what the world thinks of us, but I would like that at least Indians would stop disregarding their own culture and history. </p>
