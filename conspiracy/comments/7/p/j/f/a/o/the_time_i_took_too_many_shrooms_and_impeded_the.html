       So, funny story
      </p>
      <p>
       Back on Election Day 2016 my super controlling, straight-edge girlfriend was out of town and so, naturally, I took the opportunity to have some illegal fun. Wanted to trip by myself; took way too many shrooms.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was pretty upset about pizzagate and other shenanigans and was def in a wacky state of mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I grabbed my guy fawkes mask, put on a black hoodie and some black pants, taped a white sign with a massive “SLAVE” caption on it, and traversed around my city getting into all kinds of adventures.
      </p>
      <p>
       I started off at the library, when people there got freaked out, I went to Walmart, then CVS (looking for some water, but I freaked the lady’s at the counter out so I just went thirsty).
      </p>
      <p>
       I ended up realizing that the place I could have the most impact was at the local community college, so, I set up shop in the park at the college and posted up for about three hours. People immediately were pretty interested in what I was doing; taking pictures, laughing, asking me deep philosophical questions. I tuned most of it out; I was trippin’ balls and blasting music; I brought a clipboard that said “I will not be voting today” and had about 200-250 college kids sign it; most of them seeming genuinely inspired; mostly because they had witnessed the campus police try to reason with me, then threaten me, then remove me from campus. The way they did this was supppper shady, and they did it in front of a ton of protesting college kids who were saying I had every right to be there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I told them, all I wanted to do was sit there and meditate (I lied) and they kinda were allowing it, watching me the whole time. In fact, all day cops had been following me acting like I was a terrorist, so I walked miles and miles down streets with both my hands in the air.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a pretty crazy experience; I felt like my silent protest had done some good even if I had scared a few people; I’m glad I did. I wanted them to realize that we are in a scary situation: i mean, Trump? Clinton? You’re kidding me.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, most of those kids were gonna vote Hilary. You’re welcome, Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m sure I’ll get flak from the politically minded people, but I just thought I’d share; it was an experience that really did prove that one person can make an impact. Before they removed me, about 5-6 college kids had decided to come sit next to me in silence during my silent protest, they didn’t say anything, didn’t mock me, didn’t laugh. They just gave me a nod, as if they knew and understood what I was trying to do. We attracted a lot of attention and it made the local news. The cops kept trying to get me to identify myself; I would just raise my arms and say “I am not here to cause any problems”
      </p>
      <p>
       People stuck up for me. It was one of the most beautiful experiences I’ve ever had.
      </p>
      <p>
       Restored my faith in young people.

       Lol I'm just sayin man... freak outs aren't a good idea in a full face mask. Pretty sure that's some kind of illegal. I ate my mushrooms and had to admit to half the house that i was playing head games with everyone. I'm no better than the op i guess. Just don't think freedom is worth risking.

       Once was enough. Also, prison elitism? I'll never understand that one.

       if you're not enjoying your right to protest or have a public freak out, what's the point? Kinda means they've already taken your freedom.

       That's alright man. I'm just me. I think it's funny pointing out the flaws of elitist attitudes.

       Best things about mushrooms, to me, is that they remind me that my view isn't any better or worse than anyone else's, except as it applies to my own experience.

       i see that. Just showing up to random forums and diminishing someone else's experience. Touting your pride in having been to jail. Not running you at all. I'd never have guessed you had issues.

       Hmmm you seem to have missed my entire point by having your head down trying to dig at the tiny details for cracks. I'm not playing an elitist/narcissistic card here. I'm telling the op he's an idiot and an asshole for putting on a full face mask while tripping dick on shrooms and then proceeding to wonder around a federal campus. Why in any God's name you choose yo do some dumb ass mental acrobatics to tear me apart instead seeing the obvious beyond me. And it speaks ill of your character. Not mine. You too sir appear to be an asshat.

       No, I see your point.

       You've got better things to do while tripping. 
(Like fuck with your friends without them knowing, then gain a sense of humility by admitting it)

       And to downplay someone else's experience who you don't know.

       You’re right, I was just considering the scene when he “crawled through a river of shit and lived to tell the tale”

       That’s kind of what I have experienced by reading this gentlemen’s comments.

      <p>
       I agree. I don’t understand why he/she/it/ is so entangled in my choices while tripping. I mean hell, I once stopped my brother from committing murder/suicide while he was on LSD, I feel like I’m a pretty good guy while tripping lol. I was completely professional during this experience in the OP. I tend to have a good center of gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that any of that matters to tripping elitists who don’t understand the point of tripping in the first place.

       Mother fucker you don't do a freak out in a fucking full face mask! That's fucking stupid. You want to stand on a soapbox and shout that's perfectly legal. It is however criminal to be in a full mask on any government property. Guess what, that university campus? Yeah federal land. That asshole IS indeed very lucky he didn't get hurt.

       You got lucky my boy. I've been through scenarios like that and they almost always ended in someone going to jail. I'm telling you this because i know it's true. The best advice you're going to receive in regards to this is not to do it again. Next time take some god finders or blue meanies and find god. No one out there gives a shit. And you aren't going to wake anyone who hasn't got an alarm clock set already.

       And all I'm reading is justification for pure stupidity. You did not change the world with a crazy mushroom trip. You were an idiot for putting the mask on and going out. Much less going out blasted to begin with! Those are personal experiences. You have bo right to forcefully assimilate others into your trip. Positive or otherwise. Cops don't particularly like having fully masked tripping assholes fucking about in public and quite frankly if they had tazed and detained you then you sure as shit would have deserved it. And thia is coming from a professional psychocosmonaut. You sir are a disgrace to Soma. End of discussion.

       Mother fucker you don't do a freak out in a fucking full face mask! That's fucking stupid. You want to stand on a soapbox and shout that's perfectly legal. It is however criminal to be in a full mask on any government property. Guess what, that university campus? Yeah federal land. That asshole IS indeed very lucky he didn't get hurt. This is about NOT making shroomers look like irresponsible idiots.
