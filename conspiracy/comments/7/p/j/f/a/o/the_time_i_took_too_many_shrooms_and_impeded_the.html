        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, funny story</p>

<p>Back on Election Day 2016 my super controlling, straight-edge girlfriend was out of town and so, naturally, I took the opportunity to have some illegal fun. Wanted to trip by myself; took way too many shrooms. </p>

<p>I was pretty upset about pizzagate and other shenanigans and was def in a wacky state of mind. </p>

<p>So, I grabbed my guy fawkes mask, put on a black hoodie and some black pants, taped a white sign with a massive “SLAVE” caption on it, and traversed around my city getting into all kinds of adventures. </p>

<p>I started off at the library, when people there got freaked out, I went to Walmart, then CVS (looking for some water, but I freaked the lady’s at the counter out so I just went thirsty). </p>

<p>I ended up realizing that the place I could have the most impact was at the local community college, so, I set up shop in the park at the college and posted up for about three hours. People immediately were pretty interested in what I was doing; taking pictures, laughing, asking me deep philosophical questions. I tuned most of it out; I was trippin’ balls and blasting music; I brought a clipboard that said “I will not be voting today” and had about 200-250 college kids sign it; most of them seeming genuinely inspired; mostly because they had witnessed the campus police try to reason with me, then threaten me, then remove me from campus. The way they did this was supppper shady, and they did it in front of a ton of protesting college kids who were saying I had every right to be there. </p>

<p>I told them, all I wanted to do was sit there and meditate (I lied) and they kinda were allowing it, watching me the whole time. In fact, all day cops had been following me acting like I was a terrorist, so I walked miles and miles down streets with both my hands in the air.  </p>

<p>It was a pretty crazy experience; I felt like my silent protest had done some good even if I had scared a few people; I’m glad I did. I wanted them to realize that we are in a scary situation: i mean, Trump? Clinton? You’re kidding me. </p>

<p>So, most of those kids were gonna vote Hilary. You’re welcome, Trump. </p>

<p>I’m sure I’ll get flak from the politically minded people, but I just thought I’d share; it was an experience that really did prove that one person can make an impact. Before they removed me, about 5-6 college kids had decided to come sit next to me in silence during my silent protest, they didn’t say anything, didn’t mock me, didn’t laugh. They just gave me a nod, as if they knew and understood what I was trying to do. We attracted a lot of attention and it made the local news. The cops kept trying to get me to identify myself; I would just raise my arms and say “I am not here to cause any problems”</p>

<p>People stuck up for me. It was one of the most beautiful experiences I’ve ever had. </p>

<p>Restored my faith in young people.</p>

Much less going out blasted to begin with! Those are personal experiences. You have bo right to forcefully assimilate others into your trip. Positive or otherwise. Cops don&#39;t particularly like having fully masked tripping assholes fucking about in public and quite frankly if they had tazed and detained you then you sure as shit would have deserved it.
