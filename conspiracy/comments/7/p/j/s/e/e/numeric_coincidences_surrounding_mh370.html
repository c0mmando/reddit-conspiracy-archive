<p>Having to throw in a random -1 to make it fit kinda makes it less impressive, but that said the other numbers are indeed interesting. If this is all true, then what we probably saw with MH370 was a ritual mass sacrifice...these numbers don&#39;t just happen. And they don&#39;t just happen so the plane can be captured and used for other purposes. </p>

<p>I never claimed it was your idea of &#39;proper numerology&#39; whatever you think that might be.   </p>

<p>Why do you think Wolfram alpha explicitly states 4560 divides into 37<sup>4-1</sup> then?</p>

<p>the -1 figures strongly in the mathematics that I described above.  Euler&#39;s relationship also figures with -1.   e<sup>i*p</sup> - 1</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it’s a way of reducing 4560. It’s a power of a prime plus one, it’s an easy way of representing the number. It is significant, but if the flight were any number of different days before or after 9/11 (also a random number) then you could still find another number that would somehow work 37 into it.</p>

<p>you&#39;re wrong.  the equation was presented to me as describing the number 4560 by wolfram alpha.   I didn&#39;t search for an equation, only information about the significance of the number.</p>

<p>Finding it connected to 37<sup>4</sup> is significant and that the relationship shown in wolfram alpha yields 411 is also significant.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll ask again.   Why does Wolfram Alpha describe 4560  in terms of 37<sup>4</sup> - 1 ?  Why are other numbers described the same way?<br/>
Why is this even an entry in wolfram alpha?   you won&#39;t answer.. fine.</p>

<p>The fact remains that every other number in your post has some significance, but the -1 doesn’t.  And hey, if I were such a dishonest manipulator would I really have said earlier that it is perhaps because there was one plane?</p>

<p>Whenever you see someone mocking numerology, they always start adding or subtracting random numbers that have nothing to do with the narrative. That’s what makes “poor numerology”, when the numbers don’t actually all fit into the picture.</p>

<p>In saying this I am not degrading you, I’m just pointing out a weak spot in your numerology. It happens with numerology. Like I said (and have said the whole time despite your accusation that I haven’t), it’s still a cool coincidence. It’s just flawed in that one way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wolfram Alpha isn’t claiming there’s any numerological significance to the -1 though. It’s just a number.</p>

<p>It’s like if the flight number was 16 and it was 3 hours long and you said look 16 is (3+1)<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>But 16 is 4<sup>2.</sup></p>

<p>That’s what this is</p>

<p>I get that you don&#39;t understand what wolfram alpha puts in the binomial number column.  would you stop being an idiot in public about it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How could you possibly think this when the essence of my last few comments with you here have been about Wolfram Alpha?</p>

<p>Come to think of it, the power of 4 is also extraneous, unless there were 4 pilots or something? Why is it to the power of 4 and not 6?</p>

<p>Also, it isn&#39;t in the binomial column, it&#39;s in the properties column, where Wolfram lists a bunch of random (and sometimes useful for calculations) properties about a number. It is a binomial in that it is X - Y.</p>

<p>The thing is, you could have picked a variety of other dates, passengers, days after 9/11 (also a random date tbh), and phone number, and you would have been able to find some simplification of that number which worked out.</p>

<p>But at least in those cases 9/11 is kind of an important date and 411 is a well known number. The power of 4 and subtracting 1 are totally random.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to throw a little snarky zinger back at you but at this point I honestly don&#39;t know why this is so hard for you to see. Do you think I&#39;m attacking your theory or something? As I&#39;ve said multiple times before, it&#39;s an interesting coincidence.</p>

<p>But why minus one?</p>

<p>And now I have to ask, why to the power of 4? Was it a 4 hour flight or something?</p>

<p>you don&#39;t see how one might find it annoying how you continuously ignore the information in the thread.  </p>

<p>there are 4 prominent 37&#39;s.   37<sup>4-1</sup> is the kind of number used in binomial number theory.   wolfram alpha notes it because it is notable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While 37<sup>4</sup> - 1 isn&#39;t the kind of number used in binomial theorem, it is a binomial polynomial in that it has two parts (the 37<sup>4</sup> and the 1).</p>

<p>I do see how the 4 is important, actually! As you&#39;ve said, there are 4 prominent 37s.</p>

<p>How about the 1?</p>

<p>The math isn’t at issue here. All of the math checks out! The shoehorned -1 doesn’t.</p>
