<p>My theory, how ever, is that they are pushing the theory that it is just disinfo not because the earth is actually flat or to discredit other theories, but because of the paper trail that flat earth brings. </p>

<p>Although there is no proof of flat earth, many of the videos you watch will show blatant lies that the government has fed to the public for years.  </p>

<p>Flat earth theory was one of the conspiracies that opened my mind.  Not because it made me believe the earth was flat, but it made me realize how much has been lied to us for so long. </p>

<p>Anyone else feel this way? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s kind of my point.  I think people shut it down so quickly just because they don&#39;t believe it, but if people would actually do some research on the topics, they might find something out that they didn&#39;t know before.  And that&#39;s kind of why I think the people commenting &quot;flat earth is to discredit other theories&quot; could possibly being pushed onto this subreddit by outside forces.  They receive disproportionately more upvotes then any other comments on the threads as well. </p>

<p>I agree with you. Were it not for Flat Earth (which is to me an obvious load of nonsense) I would not have taken the time to look into the official story of astrophysics, which is how I learned about the Cavendish experiment.</p>

<p>For those with functioning brains, the <a href="https://www.johnlebon.com/key-topics/cavendish-experiment/">Cavendish experiment</a> will blow your mind. &#39;Science&#39; truly believes you can determine the mass of the moon using heavy balls in a shed here on earth. I am not joking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought about this the other night while watching ISS fakery videos. A great deal of the ISS hoax stuff is from flat earth youtube channels. Why? I see no reason why the ISS hoax stuff should be soley under the purview of the flat earth community, and yet they seem to be the only people talking about it that I&#39;ve seen. I don&#39;t think the earth is flat but I do think there is something to the ISS stuff.</p>

<p>I am thankful for the flat earth community for being willing to entertain things that sound so outlandish. They really stiumulate the imagination and give you something to think about. This is a good thing.</p>

<p>What do you think I should look at to convince myself that there might be someone to FE ?
I&#39;m open minded enough to at least look into it. Preferably I&#39;d like to know what the globe rebuttal is and why their rebuttal is wrong. Also, what difference would it make if we&#39;re lied to about the shape? Is the shape important at all or is it a gateway for something bigger like unexplored land or something the elites don&#39;t want us to know exist?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does sometimes lead to weird stuff.
Hole in North pole 1968 photo? Might that suggest the hollow Earth theory or something hidden on the north/south pole (censorship)?</p>

<p>I do think NASA is full of shit sometimes, like the Moon landings footage, and something
is weird about the international space station (weird fade editing, thought it was supposed to be live?). Doesn&#39;t mean I automatically think space is fake 
but maybe we can&#39;t go past a certain point, due to radiation or something?
Also weird that some astronaut couldn&#39;t do an experiment live
and had to record it....an experiment involving a metal ball unnaturally going around a spherical track?</p>

<p>I entertain whatever, doesn&#39;t phase me. But I don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; anything without a certain level of circumstantial evidence/reasoning at minimum. I haven&#39;t seen a flat or spherical Earth from an astronomical distance with my own eyes (and shitty composites don&#39;t do it for me) but my current position has to be the boring default theory for now (bumpy spherical).</p>

<p>I saw a pro-FE video showing a disappeared boat (on the horizon)
reappearing when zooming in. I don&#39;t have the optics knowledge to know
for SURE what that proves. (Like does the angle affect it? Can this happen on both models or require a new Earth shape model?) </p>

<p>There was a YT video of a rocket suddenly stopping (acceleration stopped very quickly)
so I don&#39;t know how to explain that but it might reveal some truth, not necessarily &quot;the firmament&quot;
but something at least. Or maybe just a boring explanation, dunno.</p>

<p>A part of me secretly wants FE stuff to be true....like there&#39;s an easy way out of the hell hole.
I think you&#39;re right that it can open the gateway to surprising truths.
But also to disinfo which we need to be careful of.
Even if nothing, it&#39;s sort of entertaining, no?</p>

<p>We shouldn&#39;t be afraid to entertain any idea but don&#39;t let shills
call you a flat Earther for questioning something about space, geography, NASA or whatever might have
hidden secrets. There&#39;s some interesting FE videos that might have a grain of truth or a whole bowl of truth.</p>

<p>The claims that the globe Earth is a freemason or Jesuit conspiracy, intrigues me. But it&#39;s not enough for me
to say &quot;AHA!&quot; because that might be oversimplifying things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me get this straight —</p>

<p>You are saying that the Flat Earth conspiracy is so heavily argued because it is a de facto ‘gateway drug’ of conspiracy theorists, not because of it’s truth or authenticity, but because it opens the door for people to be “red-pilled?”</p>

<p>I...can actually believe this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In debate class one exercise was to try to take a completely ridiculous stance that most would think indefensible. Then the challenge is to come up with a bunch of loopholes, arguments, and strange points that try to back your side, like flat earth. The whole “conspiracy” seems like just that, an exercise. Except that people have fallen for it like it’s true. Lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can’t prove the earth is flat. But I can prove that NASA lies. ISS footage is fake. Moon footage is fake. A lot of images from NASA  are CGI. All other countries have fake space footage to. I trust nothing that comes from proven liars. I can also prove that it is physically possible to see further over the ocean than the 8 inch per mile squared curve can allow. This is a very common thing..... I don’t believe the sun is any where near as far away as they say. It’s just not probable given our observations. The moon does not look like I reflects light. It looks like a self illuminating object. It is warmer in the shade of the moon light than in direct light. Only slightly but still it’s very interesting.Flat is not  100% provable but it is a fair conclusion when you start to look at what’s actually going on. The earth that we live on is not what we have been told. That much I have proven to myself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re mistaken because my knee jerk reaction upon hearing the theory for the first time (in the wild, right before the posts started here) was that it was a psyop. The older CT crowd has seen these a bunch over the years and this just feels like more of the same. </p>

<p>Of course part of my bias is in regards to where it was coming from too. If anyone I&#39;ve ever met is a disinfo agent, it&#39;s that guy. Always ahead of the exact theories that I would consider disinfo, has a repetitive history of organizing local CT groups and then calling everyone in them disinfo agents and scattering the group, worked for msm, .... the list of reasons goes on and on... </p>

<p>Others coming to the same conclusions about how FE info has been spread doesn&#39;t make me think that they are an unnatural reaction at all imo.</p>
