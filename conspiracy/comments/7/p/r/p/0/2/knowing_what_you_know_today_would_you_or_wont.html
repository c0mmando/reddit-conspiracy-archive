       I personally have gone from pro vaccine to on the fence.   I have asked myself if I had a kid tomorrow would I vaccinate the child and if so, would I go with the standard vaccine schedule or request a different approach  (i.e., delayed immunizations, reduced dosage, etc...)?
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is I honestly don't know what I would do and I was wondering what your approach to vaccinations you would take if you had a new born tomorrow?
      </p>
      <p>
       Please consider the honest answer as it would relate to your own child and not some community or social standard.  Also, present your best evidence to support your position.

       My concerns are what are the effects on infant/toddler development from today's recommended dosages.  One of the things that generated concerns about vaccines was the significant differences in dosage from pre 1986 vs now (
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act">
        https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the fear of liability was set aside, it appears the vaccinations are driven by profit motive rather than safety standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have wonder if there is a chart that contrasts profits from vaccinations to the number of autism cases.

       Well, there have been zero studies on the long term effects of all the vaccines on the schedule combined. And you're right, you are no longer permitted to sue vaccine manufacturers directly, you must go through a "vaccine court."
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as autism, there are new studies that show that aluminum travels to the brain. Aluminum adjuvants are used in vaccines in order to increase immune response.
      </p>
      <p>
       "What actually happens is a type of immune cell called a macrophage (MF) ingests (called “phagocytosis”) the AANs. Eating foreign material is a primary function of MFs. When MFs detect bacteria or debris, the MFs eat it, and destroy it with enzymes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that AANs are not digested by the MF enzymes. Consequently, the AANs remain inside the MFs for a long time. The AANs can persist for years. MFs that consume the AANs become highly contaminated with aluminum, and spread the aluminum wherever they go. And they go everywhere in the body.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MFs travel across the blood brain barrier (BBB) when there is inflammation in the brain. The MFs, once loaded with AANs, act like a Trojan Horse and carry the AANs into the brain. This is harmful, because the brain is very sensitive to aluminum."

       "On the basis of previous reports showing alum neurotoxic effects in CD1 mice, an additional experiment was done, and showed early brain translocation at day 45 of alum injected subcutaneously at 200 μg Al/kg. This study confirms the striking biopersistence of alum. It points out an unexpectedly delayed diffusion of the adjuvant in lymph nodes and spleen of CD1 mice, and suggests the importance of mouse strain, route of administration, and doses, for future studies focusing on the potential toxic effects of aluminum-based adjuvants."

       Now technically, autism is a label given for a conglomeration of symptoms. There's no lab test for it. It's a diagnosis based on a set of behaviors and neurological symptoms.
      </p>
      <p>
       They've found very high levels of aluminum in the brains of patients with autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       ". The aluminium content of brain tissue in autism was consistently high. The mean (standard deviation) aluminium content across all 5 individuals for each lobe were 3.82(5.42), 2.30(2.00), 2.79(4.05) and 3.82(5.17) μg/g dry wt. for the occipital, frontal, temporal and parietal lobes respectively. These are some of the highest values for aluminium in human brain tissue yet recorded and one has to question why, for example, the aluminium content of the occipital lobe of a 15 year old boy would be 8.74 (11.59) μg/g dry wt.? Aluminium-selective fluorescence microscopy was used to identify aluminium in brain tissue in 10 donors. While aluminium was imaged associated with neurones it appeared to be present intracellularly in microglia-like cells and other inflammatory non-neuronal cells in the meninges, vasculature, grey and white matter. The pre-eminence of intracellular aluminium associated with non-neuronal cells was a standout observation in autism brain tissue and may offer clues as to both the origin of the brain aluminium as well as a putative role in autism spectrum disorder."

      </p>
      <p>
       The question is, is there a "safe" level of aluminum? In my opinion, that would vary highly among individuals. Are there certain genetic factors that predispose a child to be unable to detoxify heavy metals as well as other children? Could that be why some children develop autism, and other do not? There's just no way to know, as there is nowhere near enough research into this subject, as first they would have to admit there was a correlation between vaccines and "autism."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why if you choose to vaccinate, I'd wait until your child was older, and do one at a time. I'd also leave out any of the newer ones, and do the basics.
      </p>

       Also, this will likely lessen the risk of SIDS. Plenty more links within this article.
      </p>
      <p>
       "his is by no means the first report in the medical literature linking hexavalent vaccines to SIDS. A quick search on pubmed.gov will reveal quite a few others, dating back to an initial 2006 report published in the journal Vaccine titled, “Unexplained cases of sudden infant death shortly after hexavalent vaccination,” concluding after post-mortem autopsies that these were cases of “possibly fatal complications after application of hexavalent vaccines.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2011, a study was published in Statistics in Medicine titled “A modified self-controlled case series method to examine association between multidose vaccinations and death,” found that based on the review of 300 unexplained sudden unexpected deaths (uSUD) following either penta- or hexavalent, “a 16-fold risk increase after the 4th dose could be detected with a power of at least 90 per cent,” and “A general 2-fold risk increase after vaccination could be detected with a power of 80 per cent."

       Corporate and regulatory corruption has been the source of my concerns.  Research the science behind the vaccination industry has only supported my concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
       In principle I support the benefits of vaccination, but it seems profits and the shield from liability has led the industry to negated protecting the children.

       Bite the bullet and get the full Vax panel. Anything fucked up happens to my kids, to the adoption center they go. I don't have the means to provide 24hr care to a severely physical/mentally disabled child. 90% of families don't for that matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being frightened out of having kids is no way to live your life. Also, not vaxxing your kids is an irresponsible and unfair decision for you to make for them.

       Who is the one that made that distinction? the government. They can rebrand it as euthanasia/assisted suicide if they want, but you 100% should be able to terminate your (alive) infant child in the event of severe mental disability.

       I think that people should space out the Vax schedule. No reasons to get 14 shots in one day. Take them over several weeks and trips, just a couple at a time. From the research I've done the only solid evidence of vaccines fucking kids up always accompanies a battery of shots all in one day. Their immune systems just get overwhelmed.

       It's a lot honestly. And it's traumatizing for kids too...14 sharp pricks on a tiny body that doesn't even really know what pain
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       , let alone how to cope with it? Besides, if your child isn't in school or daycare (so pre-3 y/o basically) the shots aren't really necessary yet anyways. The issue comes with socialization but again, that is years after the current schedule would have them immunized.

       100% yes.

       The risk of those supposed side effects is very minor.  IMO better to risk those than the diseases Vaccines are meant to prevent.

       I would 100% choose to have an Autistic Child over having them have to spend their lives in a an Iron Lung due to Polio.

       It seems to be the younger generation that are more on the antivax side.  Don't hear to many grandparents or really anyone 60+ being against Vaccines, being they lived at a time where Vaccines were not common and they knew people who died from those diseases.

       I grew up with pictures and stories about families members who passed away from Polio as children.

       Polio is eradicated. You might as well get a shot for the Black Plague too. It makes no difference whether or not you get it because you won't be able to get it from anyone unless you travel to third world countries. Though I am against vaccinations I ultimately would have to comply with the bare minimum so that my kids would be able to go to school.

       It was only "eradicated" by crafty bookkeeping.  They changed the diagnosis criteria for polio after the vaccine came out.  It went from immediate diagnosis, to requiring you to have it for
       <em>
        Sixty
       </em>
       days, before they'd call it polio.  And when polio cases still lingered, they simply called it something else.  Transverse Myelitis.  Menengitis.  A couple others I can't recall.  It was a brazen scam.

       I was shocked when I heard that most strains of polio are innocuous, and there's a good chance a person could've gotten polio and their immune system fought it off naturally because the symptoms are like the common cold.

       That is not true.  One just has to have contact with some one who has had contact...and so on and so on.   One can get a disease with ever having to visit the location.

      <p>
       Having known people who have died because they were not Vaccinated my stance on it makes perfect sense.  I also have a friend who due to not being vaccinated got sick and ended up being Sterile thanks to it.

       Even if there really was a link between Autism and Vaccines I would still make the same decision as the risk is worth it.

       Having lost families members to disease that now have vaccines it makes perfect sense to be pro-vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also have a friend who did not get his full Vaccines and got sick in high school.  He is Now Sterile and is in therapy because of it.  He comes from a cultural background that values and places a lot of emphasis on having kids.  Not a real man if you do not have a lot kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at the numbers and the risks involved I would choose Vaccines every time.  The Risk vs Reward is all in the favour of Vaccines.  Even if one were to believe the majority of the negative about them...they positives far outweigh the negatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes I would go for the full panel for my children.

       well it's obvious how that would play out.  the anti-vax group would select for resistance.  the vax group wouldn't.

       Thank you. Yes, I know it isn't my fault. And I'm not saying vaccines caused it either. But I do think that vaccines played a part in it. I don't think the cause is one particular thing, but rather a combination of things.

       This is so much more nuanced of an issue than "will you or won't you vaccinate your child?"
      </p>
      <p>
       First, which vaccine? One with an illness as serious as polio, or something far more frivolous like the roto virus?
      </p>
      <p>
       So okay, let's take polio: where is polio still an active threat? What type of polio strain are we talking? How is that particularly dangerous strain passed to others? Is that a likelihood in one's present location? Has polio been eradicated and if so, where and how? Now let's look at the vaccine: is there a risk one can contract the condition through the vaccine itself? What are the other potential side effects of the vaccine? What is the statistical likelihood of those effects happening? Can I trust those facts and figures presented, or might there be a history of suppressing said effects? What is the vaccine's efficacy in the first place? How can I be sure of that, if the likelihood of exposure to polio is low in the first place? If the mom is breastfeeding, does
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       affect the vaccine's efficacy as well? Given that it does for most cases, then should the mother not breastfeed, or do
       <em>
        those
       </em>
       benefits outweigh that of the vaccines? Are there other potential side effects that can't be measured, like an overall weakened immune system? With vaccines that aren't polio-based, are some people immune to the condition anyway? Are there any possible benefits to getting the strain and having one's body naturally fight it off? Doesn't a vaccine do that to anyway (ie, introduce a weakened strain to build up immunity against more potent strains)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines are a shitty game of probability. Everybody's weights and inputs are different, and each vaccine warrants its own consideration. Some may go for all; some for some; some for none.

       My main concern isn't necessarily the vaccines it's the number of shots for any reason. Vaccination or blood draws for lab test. So I'll take combination vaccines to draw down the number of pricks.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for 20+ vaccines the first month, that is unheard of. Who uses that schedule? Here is the standard schedule. Note that many are boosters.

       The current vaccines are not based on rigorous science, instead they are only backed up by a paradigm which is fast crumbling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone of those vaccines is simply a shot in the dark, nobody really knows what they are doing inside us and Big Pharma actively avoid funding the most obvious and basic studies of all, they are scared of what the outcome might be, that should be enough reason to put anyone of vaccines, if the industry itself has no confidence in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       After many years of research one can only view vaccines as child abuse, any informed parent would move country rather than have their child poisoned by a vaccine.

       Your first link is to vaccine theory and does not discuss the level of testing for safety and efficacy involved, which is bad with efficacy and appalling for safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       The AAFP link is just a pro-vaccine narrative written in a vaccine marketing department, which ignores the fact that the necessary studies haven’t been performed.

       While it is good to remove mercury from vaccines, unfortunately many have aluminium in and other toxic ingredients.

       I did read them, you have misunderstood what's being discussed here, we are not talking about theory but about how thorough the research is, how well designed studies are, not all studies are equal.  Vaccine safety studies don't even use real placebos, instead they use active placebos, such as other vaccines.  That is a poor study design.  Also they don't give much of a time window for vaccine damage to show up, an autoimmune disease induced by the vaccine could appear one month after vaccination, but nobody is looking for this in the trials, so it is not tracked.

       I would ask them to watch the presentations given by the independent experts at the vaccine safety conference, most pro vaccine doctors will be unaware of the realities of the industry, they live in a paradigm built of marketing information, which they have been led to believe is based on rigorous science.

       And if it was someone who I knew feels like they know better, who will never spend time researching, the only chance is a quick powerful red pill, like the 2 minute video below from a professor who is an expert on aluminum, there's a chance it will open their mind within the small window of opportunity which they give you, depends how brainwashed they are.

       I have old parents and there’s 18 years between my brother and I.. When he was about 15 months, he got meningitis and has been severely disabled by this. He needs 24/7 care, he’s on a ton of meds for things like seizures, and virtually no motor skills, nor can he talk. Since there’s been a lot of things in the new the last few years about vaccines, my mom has wondered if those have had anything to do with his condition, maybe not necessarily with the meningitis... I’m really not sure. But I have noticed that after he gets a yearly flu shot (his doctor obvi requires bc $$), he has a larger surge in amount of daily seizures for almost a week after. He typically has 3-8 a day but I was witnessing 15-20, some small and some in clusters. I’m starting to wonder myself if anything could be related.
