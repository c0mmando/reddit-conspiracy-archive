       I think it was during the first quarter.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was apparently about mothers, yet was very oddly focused on demographics. A kid with with a prosthetic, a little girl with a hijab, an obviously gay kid in an ice skating uniform. The list goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really have a problem with it, but the focus was extremely odd for the context of the commercial. Which wasn't even mentioned until the very end of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I've gotten quite a few similar responses, so to save the anyone else time, it's a common commercial. I don't watch tv very often, so I haven't seen the ad before. Which is likely why it came off weird.

       It didn't really seem to be anything. The end was of a girl at the olympics, but the text at the end was along the lines of thanking mothers. It just seemed odd. I seriously have no clue what it was really about though. It just came off weird in its presentation. I don't see why diversity would be the forefront of a commercial like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty on the fence though. I could be looking too deep into something not really worth it. I haven't seen it again either. So I don't want to have too strong an opinion without a second look.

       It was made by Procter and Gamble and the end of the commercial had a bunch of logos of some of their largest brands - like Bounty, which I remember specifically. It's one of those commercials that doesn't push any of their items specifically but instead try to foster warm feelings towards the brands/company.

       I guess I need to edit my op as I keep getting the same responses. I don't really watch tv. So I never see commercials. Thanks for your input anyways! I'll happily admit I looked further into it than I should. I don't really see much stuff like that. Which may be why it came off so oddly.

       This is a Proctor and Gamble commercial for the 2018 winter Olympics.  It's not really weird in the context of the commercial.  The whole point is that the rest of the world might see a kid in a hijab and a gay kid and a kid with a prosthetic leg and a black poor kid etc., but their mothers see their kids as having the potential to do anything, including making it to the Olympics.

       "How dare a commercial air with a diverse view of the population, everyone should look like me!"
      </p>
      <p>
       FWIW, it was a Proctor and Gamble commercial. They run these "thank you, mom" commercials for every olympic/paralympic season. The people in them are meant to represent actual olympic athletes.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this one:
      </p>
      <p>
       A black girl who sees only white faces among the athletes on her wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       A "gay" figure skater who is being beat up.
      </p>
      <p>
       A poor (white, male) kid being mocked for not having fancy equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
       A figure skater wearing a hijab
      </p>
      <p>
       A kid with a prosthetic being pushed aside by his classmates
      </p>
      <p>
       An Asian girl cutting off her long hair.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, they air these globally every Olympics, and they tend to hit a bunch of "demographics" because they want to reach everyone. I'm sorry to break it to you OP, but white, male, and able-bodied is a pretty small minority in the world population.

       I would contend that it is a fallacy because most of the characters are not based on real people.  And even if some of them are real people, they are attributing emotions that may or may not have actually existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all emotional manipulation.

       What, no. Logos, ethos and pathos work in conjunction. Some people will respond better to facts, while others will respond to the speaker or emotion. Trump absolutely worked on ethos and pathos, and got elected, while Hillary had absolutely no credibility as a speaker, even if she had more convincing statistics.

       TIL finding a commercial weird makes me a bigot. In all seriousness though. I very rarely watch tv, which would explain why I haven't seen any of their commercials before. Thanks for the assumptions though. I'll go and check my privilege now. /s

       yes, finding a commercial weird because it includes people who don't look like you makes you bigoted.

       As soon as I saw it, I literally
       <em>
        knew
       </em>
       it would be posted about here. And raged about by conservative Twitter/reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, the commercial just came off to me like one of the first of many, many sweet-but-cheesy commercials major brands will be putting out during the Olympics, trying to show how much they care and/or how inclusive they are (and want the country/word to be), in the spirit of the global games.
      </p>
      <p>
       This one, paid for by Procter and Gamble (if I remember correctly) was at least less overtly hypocritical than a lot of these commercials will be (e.g. Nestle commercials showing how much they care about newborns while being responsible for starving newborns and poor[er] families in developing countries, Chik-Fil-A commercials about all coming together that conveniently leave out the company's strict anti-gay views, etc).

       It looks as though you may have spelled "Chick-fil-A" incorrectly. No worries, it happens to the best of us!

       Yeah, I've gotten a lot of the same responses. I don't really watch tv, so I can't say I've seen any of their commercials until now. Sometimes you look deeeper in stuff that really isn't meant to be I suppose.

       True. This is why I don't like tv though. It's near impossible to tell motive anymore. You can't really tell if a company is actually worthwhile. Or just pandering to whatever is socially relevant.

       Of course it's usually the latter. Gotta maximize profits.

       Honestly, Chick-fil-a is the best fast food restaurant customer service experience in America. To me, it proves that it really starts from the top down and is a real shining example in a world of increasingly shitty customer service. Top notch employees and it really stands out in Memphis, Tn
