        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think it was during the first quarter. </p>

<p>It was apparently about mothers, yet was very oddly focused on demographics. A kid with with a prosthetic, a little girl with a hijab, an obviously gay kid in an ice skating uniform. The list goes on.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really have a problem with it, but the focus was extremely odd for the context of the commercial. Which wasn&#39;t even mentioned until the very end of it.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;ve gotten quite a few similar responses, so to save the anyone else time, it&#39;s a common commercial. I don&#39;t watch tv very often, so I haven&#39;t seen the ad before. Which is likely why it came off weird. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It didn&#39;t really seem to be anything. The end was of a girl at the olympics, but the text at the end was along the lines of thanking mothers. It just seemed odd. I seriously have no clue what it was really about though. It just came off weird in its presentation. I don&#39;t see why diversity would be the forefront of a commercial like that. </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty on the fence though. I could be looking too deep into something not really worth it. I haven&#39;t seen it again either. So I don&#39;t want to have too strong an opinion without a second look.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;How dare a commercial air with a diverse view of the population, everyone should look like me!&quot;</p>

<p>FWIW, it was a Proctor and Gamble commercial. They run these &quot;thank you, mom&quot; commercials for every olympic/paralympic season. The people in them are meant to represent actual olympic athletes. </p>

<p>In this one:</p>

<p>A black girl who sees only white faces among the athletes on her wall.</p>

<p>A &quot;gay&quot; figure skater who is being beat up.</p>

<p>A poor (white, male) kid being mocked for not having fancy equipment.</p>

<p>A figure skater wearing a hijab</p>

<p>A kid with a prosthetic being pushed aside by his classmates</p>

<p>An Asian girl cutting off her long hair. </p>

<p>Again, they air these globally every Olympics, and they tend to hit a bunch of &quot;demographics&quot; because they want to reach everyone. I&#39;m sorry to break it to you OP, but white, male, and able-bodied is a pretty small minority in the world population.</p>

<p>TIL finding a commercial weird makes me a bigot. In all seriousness though. I very rarely watch tv, which would explain why I haven&#39;t seen any of their commercials before. Thanks for the assumptions though. I&#39;ll go and check my privilege now. /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As soon as I saw it, I literally <em>knew</em> it would be posted about here. And raged about by conservative Twitter/reddit.</p>

<p>Personally, the commercial just came off to me like one of the first of many, many sweet-but-cheesy commercials major brands will be putting out during the Olympics, trying to show how much they care and/or how inclusive they are (and want the country/word to be), in the spirit of the global games. </p>

<p>This one, paid for by Procter and Gamble (if I remember correctly) was at least less overtly hypocritical than a lot of these commercials will be (e.g. Nestle commercials showing how much they care about newborns while being responsible for starving newborns and poor[er] families in developing countries, Chik-Fil-A commercials about all coming together that conveniently leave out the company&#39;s strict anti-gay views, etc).</p>
