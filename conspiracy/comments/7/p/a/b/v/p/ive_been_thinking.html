       It's always seemed like a no-brainer to protect the environment first so we can guarantee resources for a long, long time. Is it possible that the elite know it's all going to be over anyway soon and are just getting all they can out of the planet while it lasts?

       The point is to create an environmental crisis that will give them more control. This, coupled with population reduction via war and famine, both caused by these same environmental crises, will allow them to emerge in the post-crisis world as absolute masters, with technological answers to their own manufactured environmental crises brought about by AI and automation.

       Not sure if you mean them or me. I believe in climate change, but I think the Elites benefit from not doing a goddamn thing about it until its too late. They will wait until the worst is inevitable or has already happened before they reveal the technology necessary to fix it.

       People are split on this one. Some say the elites are devastating the planet to turn it into a post-apocalyptic, transhumanist hellscape. Others claim that the elites are using environmental preservation to excuse population control measures, kinda like Hunger Games. This is based on the Georgia Guidestones, for example. 
Still others think that the Annunaki are “anti-terraforming” earth to make it more habitable for them as they try to cross the dimensional plane. So... take your pick.

       There are two kinds of skeptics. The first are those who act like a stick in the mud, and demand that
       <em>
        the whole damned world
       </em>
       come to them, and demonstrate to them (the skeptic) why they should even believe in the first place. They won't give an inch.
      </p>
      <p>
       These skeptics
       <em>
        shouldn't
       </em>
       be popular. Most of them are trolls, many are are straight-up jerks. And the core reason is because they act
       <em>
        entitled
       </em>
       to the understandings that those in this world have worked hard to achieve
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the other kind of skeptic, the kind who doesn't necessarily believe, but wants to understand. They're not convinced, but they're generally curious. Genuinely curious. They're willing to set aside their preconceived notions, put in a little (or a lot) of work on their end, and/or commit to the supreme intellectual feat: holding two contradictory ideas in their head at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those skeptics are and should be welcomed in any community pursuing alternate perspectives on anything. Unfortunately, there are few of them.

       If you’ve spent any amount of time on this board with an open mind, you would be familiar with the basic information that forms the ground of this perspective. And you wouldn’t simply be demanding evidence, you’d be wanting to engage in discussion. So I think the first type.

       It’s not about your ask for evidence. It’s about your attitude and your willingness and desire to hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly you haven’t been red-pilled in any sense on anything. It’s a painful, difficult, saddening, effortful experience. People on this board have been through that. No one can put you through it but you. And until you go through it, no one can reach you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you want others to cross that chasm to you. You
       <em>
        demand
       </em>
       it. And you act entitled to it. No one with any perspective on anything owes you a thing. Even if you ask for it. Even if you demand it. And nonetheless, it doesn’t work that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you really want to understand, you will. And no one will do it for you but you.
      </p>
      <p>
       So mock the users here all you want. It doesn’t change anything. But it deprives you of the understanding that maybe, secretly, you want. But who knows.

       1) What do you think the end goal of all these massive deceptions must be?

       2) Why do you need others to be your research assistant and provide you with the evidence? Clearly you’re capable of researching on your own.

       1) Ok so you don’t believe in any sort of collapse or depopulation scenarios? (Personally I think the farm works too well for that, but I won’t rule it out.)
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Yeah I get that. But I thought you were asking
       <em>
        me
       </em>
       for evidence of depopulation scenarios. Clearly you’re informed enough to find it yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) I get that too. But it’s all in the approach. Do you want to know the actual truth or validate your viewpoint? There’s a big difference between the two.

       According to LPG-C there is a massive ongoing coverup of the impending "crossing" of Planet X, which will bring catastrophic damage over about a decade or so. So maybe since they know about it they are simply building out their underground bases / cities and focusing on that knowing that our destruction of the environment will be significantly dampened by the impending destruction of large swaths of the population?

       It's because they discovered an uninhabited continent the size of north America beyond the ice wall surrounding us.

      <p>
       Admiral Byrd went on 3 expeditions to Antarctica and found the continent and the firmament.

       Then a couple years later NASA was formed and we went to "space" to hide the firmament.

       Maybe they were given an end of times date a long time ago. The whole system is designed to push for technologies which will allow them the leave the planet and thrive in space before that date. Everything is manipulated so the eletes can become a space race, the rest of us are just their tools to do so? Maybe not?

       Yeah, could be as simple as deep deep down we don't have the capacity to not be selfish and think outside of our own life span - perhaps it's imbedded in us to just work to thrive on purely selfish means. Why does sum1 addicted to cigarettes still smoke when being diagnosed with lung cancer? Why do we wage war? We're just animals pretending to know stuff. Fuck eat die. Greed, selfishness and giving zerofucks. Perhaps?

       To be honest a lot of the enviromental destruction happens on a grass roots level. Sadly it isn't the elites forcing people to hunt for bushmeat or clear rainforrest for farming or illegally fish. Sure the elites of the world are also destroying it but everyone holds responsibility for our planet.

       If you’ve spent any amount of time on this board with an open mind, you would be familiar with the basic information that forms the ground of this perspective. And you wouldn’t simply be demanding evidence, you’d be wanting to engage in discussion. So I think the first type.
