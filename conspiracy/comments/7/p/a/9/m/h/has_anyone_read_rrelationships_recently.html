    <div class="md"><p>Social degeneracy – generally understood to be the undermining of gender roles, the nuclear family, and love/romance/procreative human sexuality, plus the depiction of graphic violence in the media – is promoted by groups like the Tavistock Institute, Soros&#39; Open Society Foundation, and other organizations that can be tied to the spread of cultural Marxism. </p>

<p>The theory is that if you can successfully undermine these pillars of Western society, you can collapse it from within, and replace it with allegiance to the state.</p>

<p>In practice, by appealing to people&#39;s worse natures (which we <em>all</em> share), and normalizing deviant behavior, you weaken individuals from within themselves, and their ability to form meaningful, nurturing relationships with others. This isolates the individual from support by a social structure, and makes them susceptible to states like learned helplessness and then depression, requiring medication that impacts cognitive function. </p>

<p>All of this is a relentless assault on individual sovereignty, because a core aspect of our sovereignty is knowing the dark, but <em>choosing the light</em>.  So yes we all have a social/sexual/relational dark side. And it&#39;s imperative that we all experience it, so we know what it does to our souls to indulge in it.</p>

<p>The problem is, this &quot;dark side indulgence&quot; is being promoted as normal. It&#39;s being encouraged at younger and younger ages, making it harder and harder to break free from it. </p>

<p>Weak people are then more easily ruled, and put up less of a resistance. </p>

<p>tl;dr - It&#39;s an NWO plot, to destroy us as individuals from within.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, your belief that something is &quot;stupid&quot; without putting in any time to research or understand it actually makes you ignorant. Your words don&#39;t hurt me at all.

    <div class="md"><p>I never used the word &quot;healthy.&quot; Nor is it my position to &quot;justify&quot; anything.</p>

<p>I did use the words &quot;love&quot; and &quot;romance&quot; in conjunction with &quot;procreative&quot;, so take your pick of those. But I do feel that straight families in urban areas are being actively discouraged from having children by cultural memes and economic hardships.</p>

<p>This issue goes way beyond LGBT, by the way. It&#39;s about cheap, casual sex, divorced from meaning or connection, as well as love and romance. See: Tinder.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/08/tinder-hook-up-culture-end-of-dating">https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/08/tinder-hook-up-culture-end-of-dating</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s about families and relationships broken apart because partners (of any persuasion) are unable to commit to a single sex partner, in part because they&#39;ve become accustomed to the aforementioned casual sex. Possibly also because they&#39;re on antidepressants. So they&#39;re unable to put in the hard work to form the meaningful emotional, intellectual, and spiritual bonds (read: trust) with their own partner that lead to lifelong sexual satisfaction. Nor does our culture encourage us in that direction in any way.</p>

<p>You can fall into this trap whether you&#39;re gay or straight. It doesn&#39;t matter. Because as I&#39;ve said, this isn&#39;t about any one group being more or less &quot;deviant&quot; than the other. This is about the shared human shadow – greed, lust, gluttony, etc. – being propagated as &quot;normal&quot; when it isn&#39;t. It is our dark side. OUR dark side, and in that I include myself.</p>

<p>As for the &quot;nuclear&quot; family, it&#39;s my firm belief based on experience that children grow up the most successful in two-parent households with a masculine and feminine influence, mirroring the masculine and feminine part of our own natures. That can be two women, two men, or a man and a woman. So long as the &quot;toughness&quot; / &quot;tenderness&quot; balance exists to cultivate both aspects of our nature.</p>

<p>Breaking up families into single-parent households, however it&#39;s accomplished, leads to weaker individuals with less understanding of themselves, less cultivation of their inner qualities, more stressed parents, illness, fast food, and all kinds of societal ill health that leads to an emotionally-depleted, weakened populace. That&#39;s the goal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I agree with most of it, aldo most part I&#39;ll need to research for myself (as in the parts where you take your personal belief/experience). </p>

<p>In no way I think tho that there&#39;s anything related between &#39;spiritual bond&#39; and &#39;trust&#39;, if you were trying to not sound religious and bible-following you did well, if not then I definitely agree with most of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a word in the English language that describes my beliefs. I&#39;m not &quot;religious&quot; as I don&#39;t associate with any denomination. And &quot;spiritual&quot; is too broad and wishy-washy of a term. But I am &quot;religious&quot; in the sense that I have a system of belief that <em>binds my being together</em>, which is based on the Latin root &quot;ligare&quot; (edit: &quot;to bind&quot;) and not being Christian or any other faith.</p>

<p>However, I should point out that just because someone thumps a bible doesn&#39;t automatically make them wrong. The world&#39;s great wisdom traditions all have important things to say about the importance of home and family, as well as our inner battles with our better and worse natures. Modern psychology has a lot to say about this, as well, and that&#39;s where I base most of my beliefs.</p>

<p>Regarding &quot;spiritual bond&quot; and &quot;trust&quot;, can we agree that trust is the ground that a true spiritual bond forms from? Because that&#39;s along the lines of what I was trying to say. But you can also take everything I said about emotional/intellectual/spiritual bonds and wrap it all up in a bow called &quot;trust&quot; as well. And I think trust is the very essence of fulfilling sex.</p>

<p>Well, <em>&quot;spiritual&quot; is too broad and wishy-washy of a term</em>. I don&#39;t find anything <em>real</em> as spiritual in any way, since spiritual is correlated to soul (which is very likely not real).</p>

<p>Ha! Fair play. But I did differentiate “spiritual” from “intellectual” and “emotional” aspects of our being, so it’s a bit less vague. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Try chewing on this statement: Material reality is a spiritual fact. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(which is very likely not real)</p>

<p>No one can <em>prove</em> the existence of a soul to you. But if you sincerely desire to experience the reality of your soul, and put in true effort to do so, you will. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I agree, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s only about doing with one person tho.</p>

<p>There are degrees of trust. To truly collapse your being into another while making love, and allow them to collapse into you, requires a supreme amount of trust. Maybe you can do that with more than one person, but in my experience reaching those points (or close to them) I don’t want to. </p>

<p>Even that aside, again our culture doesn’t teach us that. It teaches cheap and easy surface fulfillment, and says lifetime pair bonding is stodgy because sex gets <em>soooo boring.</em> This is what plays on our lesser natures, rather than our greater natures to work hard for valuable things, like how deep we can open ourselves up to another, and be a safe place for them to open up to us, more and more. </p>

<p>Two parent households are a huge boost for kids in our current world, I agree. I&#39;m not too sure on the whole masculine/feminine thing, seems like 2 well rounded people would be the best option as children have no idea of these concepts for many years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your reply. Unfortunately, contained within some of your responses is an indication that these social engineering techniques have been at least partially successful in impacting you. (No judgment here. It took me months of being away from the US in order to see the impact these ideas had on <em>me</em> and confront them.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think mental health is getting better thanks to cleaning up the environment and increasing social services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree strongly with this. Whether or not you believe in anthropogenic global warming / climate change, our environment is being polluted constantly with plastics, EM radiation, antibiotics in meat &amp; fish, geoengineering techniques (chemtrails, etc.), not to mention light and noise pollution, the pollution of our psyches by technological distraction, constant media / advertising exposure, vaccines, etc. Plus industrial waste, deforestation, particulates. The environment is most definitely <em>not</em> being cleaned up on any large scale.</p>

<p>Also, mental health is declining quite precipitously. Research growth in depression, social anxiety disorder, and more. Or just head over to r/me_irl. ;)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This isn&#39;t a modern thing, it is what humans have always done</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed. Cheap, casual sex is part of our biological programming. It&#39;s fun. People like it. </p>

<p>HOWEVER, when it&#39;s over-encouraged by technology and culture, and people overindulge that &quot;meaningless sex&quot; part of their brains and libidos, it has negative effects on the “<em>meaningful</em> sex&quot; side of our psychology. In other words, too much of a good thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marriage and love are both social constructs designed to keep property in a family or make little slave kids to work a farm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is sadly very, very wrong. State-sanctioned marriage MAY be a social construct, but lifelong pair bonding is a deep part of human psychology. And to say that love is a social construct? Truly I am sad for you. </p>

<p>What indicates to me that cultural Marxism / the Tavistock mind virus has had its way with you is that you link love to an economic oppression argument. Love is a fundamental facet not only of the human being, but the Universe. MAYBE the romantic aspect of love is overemphasized to sell things (“MARRY AND REPRODUCE”) but that doesn’t make it any less real and vital of a part of us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not too sure on the whole masculine/feminine thing, seems like 2 well rounded people would be the best option as children have no idea of these concepts for many years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kids have no ideas of these concepts, and nor do many adults. But whether we understand them or not, we <em>feel</em> them from a young age. If one parent is strict, the other parent is generally more nurturing. That’s the masculine/feminine dynamic at work, though the child wouldn’t know to call it that. And that’s why 2-parent households (among many other reasons) are superior to one parent, because those dynamics get to be balanced in the home, and thus they tend to balance more easily in the developing mind(s) raised in those households.</p>

<p>“Well-rounded” is a good way of putting it too, though a bit less specific.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This seems like a consequence of capitalism and companies wanting more and more time and work from workers rather than a secret society taking over the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s both. But this is the totality of the war on us. It’s not just cultural, it’s economic. It is a full-on assault on the individual from every conceivable angle. Believe me, once you see it, if you ever see it, you’ll be simultaneously horrified, disgusted, saddened, angered, and also quite a bit impressed about how impeccable this system is.</p>

<p>Or you can watch the scene in The Matrix where Morpheus shows Neo the Matrix, and kinda get a small vicarious sense.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading so far, and for the good discussion. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This reply comes across as pretty nonsensical to me. But if you want to live in a way where you consistently choose your weaker, darker aspects to express in your thoughts, words, and actions, you can do that. Anyone can. See how it works for you. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the world is not black and white, and a healthy dose of skepticism will go a long way.i understand that when you go down the rabbit hole its hard to get back out, but its for the better.spending too much time in your own thoughts and taking so many things for granted will skew your world view immensely</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn’t say anything about turning anyone gay. I’m talking about being over-sexualized and toxically promiscuous. Ever watch TV or the movies? And with a little research you can find countless articles in the mainstream media about childless couples, selling that lifestyle. So you don’t have to trust me. But you are capable of listening. </p>

<p>But that’s the thing, I don’t think you come here to check yourself. You come here to validate your worldview. I mean, you’re not alone in that. We all suffer from cognitive bias and cognitive dissonance aversion syndrome. Just don’t pretend you’re doing something you’re not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I just got banned for giving some pretty sound advice. </p>

<p>I said &quot; </p>

<p>Fuck someone else then when she confronts you about it &quot; oops, sorry darling, I was drunk &quot; And see how that goes down &quot; </p>

<p>The post was titled </p>

<p>&quot; Wife (44F) of 9 years keeps buying expensive things and using the excuse that she was &#39;drunk&#39; and that she is sorry. She recently used this excuse, except I know she wasn&#39;t actually drunk. How do I confront her about these lies? &quot;</p>

<p>Pretty good advice if you ask me. Yet the moderators claimed this wasnt helpful ( how the fuck they would know ) so I&#39;m banned.  </p>

<p>I think OP&#39;s on to something.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  I don&#39;t have examples to past things, sadly.  But also sadly these seemed to be people looking for some kind of support or explanation and actual people experiencing an emotional crisis.  </p>

<p>Look at the subreddit right now.  It is people who already solved their own issue in their original post by just explaining it.   It just used to seem like a lot of hurting folks, and now it seems like it&#39;s written by wordsmiths or people who actually have the intelligence to solve this issue on their own.  Like it&#39;s someone educated in solving this problem.  And pretty suddenly, at that.  Like it was people who needed a hand, and now it seems like false victims.  </p>
