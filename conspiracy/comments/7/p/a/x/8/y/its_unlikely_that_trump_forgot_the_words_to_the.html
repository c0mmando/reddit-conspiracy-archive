        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Watching the game last night, it was obvious that Trump stopped singing the anthem for long segments, but I don&#39;t think that the criticism that he doesn&#39;t know it is fair. He&#39;s heard it 100s of times in the year he&#39;s been president, I would bet, and he played it at every rally during the election. </p>

<p>Instead, I think he just got distracted and forgot to sing for times. Watching him he kept moving and looking around. He would randomly smile/look excited when he looked at the crowd, then start singing again on the next big note. (Glen Beck made a similar argument today).</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t think the president is mentally ill, just disinterested/bored in the work of being president, and has an incredibly short attention span (the reason he often seems to lose his way in interviews and repeats himself).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let’s get two things straight. What we know, for a fact, football players are taking the field and taking a knee. They are entirely empowered to do so - that doesn’t mean it’s not disrespectful - it is and I’m glad president Trump called them out. He never said they had no right to - just uncalled for and highlights the babies they are. Unwilling to put honor above self interest. Two, conjecture is all that this is regarding Trump and the anthem. Who. Cares. Of the two one we know for certain. Even if we knew the other for certain, it doesn’t by default suggest POTUS doesn’t care about the country. </p>

<p>Call it what you will but Trump is beating his opponents at their own game bc he’s not playing their stupid little game. He and the administration are exploiting every weakness in each situation and they are doing it brilliantly. Something Washington isn’t privy to. It’s comical. To a point where people are trying to nail POTUS to a cross based on the reading of his lips. Listen to how ridiculous that is.</p>

<p>Open your mind to the idea that you’re being played and what the media tells you is increasingly wrong and at least twisted to meet the narrative. It doesn’t have to be this hard. Find the good in everything you encounter - life becomes much easier. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are just stupid &quot;slow news day&quot; stories you see once in a while.   So instead of reporting on American bumblebees becoming too fat to mate, they chose to talk about Trump, because ratings. If you hadn&#39;t noticed, any given POTUS usually dominates the news cycle.  And when you have one as odd and non-traditional as Trump, that&#39;s to be expected.  Also, his administration can&#39;t seem to stop leaking to the press for some reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mmmmk. Let me get this right....not knowing every word of the national anthem means you don’t respect the flag? </p>

<p>The bigger deal is the fact we have people running around making this an issue. A lot must be going well if this is a headline - we all know this president can’t sneeze without being disrespected. You should care about that. If you don’t, care about our president being repeatedly disrespected, you lack respect for the flag too - just saying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did I accuse him of not respecting the flag? Read it again, because your comment makes zero sense as a reply to my own comment. Let me clarify - Calling out others for disrespecting something, but not knowing it yourself is a bit hypocritical, don&#39;t you think? The REAL bigger deal is that EVERY POTUS is put under a microscope and criticized to no end by the media, especially by the media that leans towards the opposing party of that particular President.  But the difference with Trump is he brings most of that on himself with his own behavior and antics. And please don&#39;t try to turn it around on me with that last sentence, lol.  It won&#39;t work.  Because Trump, the Flag, and the Constitution, are NOT one in the same.  They are completely seperate.  The flag and the Constitution was here long before Trump was in office, and granted he doesn&#39;t spark a nuclear holocaust that wipes us all off the map with his constant bickering with North Korea, it will be here long after he leaves the office.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where are you getting your responses from?
Who said grace and lyric awareness are prerequisites to being an effective leader?
Because I certainly didn&#39;t.....
I just  basically said that it&#39;s funny and hypocritical how he calls out NFL players for disrespecting something that he doesn&#39;t seem to fully know the words to.
And I know Trump is trolling... That&#39;s basically one of the biggest things that he&#39;s known for even prior to his presidency.
But it&#39;s not some genius strategy like his supporters try to make it seem and Trump is going to come out with some masterful twist like a prime M. Night Shyamalan flick...
That&#39;s just the behavior he himself knows best and gravitates towards whenever faced with any doubt or opposition.
And honestly it&#39;s no different than the bait and switch tactics that politicians have always used.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely nothing but it is still incredibly disrespectful to those who have served and/or lost their lives for the flag - at the very least. Let’s call the jester a statement of character. A lot like the football player who said “f*ck Trump” walking to the locker room during the Alabama game last night. You show me a country that doesn’t have problems and I will have a different response. We have it good, really good - we have so many reasons to be grateful for the liberties we have. No view means nothing without perspective, something that seems to be missing all of a sudden - no country is perfect, including the US. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. Because you have known all of the words for your adult life - bullshit. You probably still don’t - I know I didn’t know every single word until this nonsensical headline. I sure the heck have a love for this country and would love to see a more productive, united people. We don’t get there by worrying and focusing a great deal of time on conjecture which is exactly what this is. As I said earlier, if there is room for this junk, things must be going well bc this is a distraction. How about those tax cuts though? Whoa - pretty great seeing companies using it as an opportunity to compensate their workforce. Guess we should ignore that though, right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do the tax cuts have to do with anything? How about all the jobs these mega corps are cutting. And woah a 1,000 dollar bonus. Big fucking deal. </p>

<p>If Kaep can’t kneel, that orange fuck should know the words by heart. </p>

<p>And I do know them because I went through my public school indoctrination. </p>

<p>I hate this country and what it stands for. Killing the poor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you hate this country, there is absolutely nothing that states you must stay. You do realize between TWO companies, only TWO that I am intimately familiar with, are putting well over $200M dollars into the pockets of employees due to the tax reform. Oh, and this doesn’t include increasing the minimum pay for the lowest paid employees - exactly what so many wanted. $1,000 seemed to matter when discussing healthcare. Now it doesn’t. I just don’t get it.</p>

<p>“Public school indoctrination”. So you also take the bait hook, line, sinker. So did I until I realized what was actually the most important. Ever consider there are people who dont give a crap the small things like lyrics because they are focused on the more important things, like people? Like relationships? Like making a difference in a meaningful way? I know I have considered it and much rather focus on the things that matter. That’s why tax cuts have to do with this - it matters. You’ll see. </p>
