<p>When we had net neutrality was it enforced, or was the US govt picking winners &amp; losers. Answer: we never had a properly enforced net neutrality. The govt was still picking winners &amp; losers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/19/10794288/netflix-t-mobile-binge-on-net-neutrality-zero-rating">https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/19/10794288/netflix-t-mobile-binge-on-net-neutrality-zero-rating</a></p>

<p>What would breaking up monopolies/duopolies like Comcast &amp; TWC do: it would create more &amp; better options for consumers.</p>

<p>We decided to break up Bell in &#39;82. Maybe we decide to breakup these ISPs in 2018.</p>

<p>Internet bills will be cheaper, and I don&#39;t think streaming sites such as Netflix would have a hike on their price because consumers would react badly. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can&#39;t be serious. Business have historically raised their prices when minimum wages go up or taxes increase. Any time there are more expenses to account for there will be people looking to recover the losses. If businesses try recuperate by adjusting prices because they had to pay their own employees more or pay taxes to the government, what in the world makes you think that they won&#39;t raise prices when a big ISP shakes them down? If anything they&#39;ll place a banner on top of their site explaining why costs went up unless they sign a favorable agreement with an ISP that could prevent them from doing so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also all of the negative aspects of NN that you probably know of for consumers are essentially mute because this ruling allows new ISPs to become successful and make their services better. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Care to elaborate? How was NN bad for comsumers?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Competition is the best form of innovation and companies will spring up to provide completely free and equal internet if the need arises. This ruling takes money away from mega corps and gives it to starting ISP companies, increasing competition and eventually our internet availability and internet prices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is flat our wrong. You&#39;re telling me ISPs lobbied to create competition for themselves? They poured in money to create competitors? Come on. The barrier of entry is going to become more difficult once these ISPs are able to compete with &quot;open&quot; Internet start-ups because they don&#39;t have to disclose that they throttle or filter content. NN required ISPs that represented themselves as unfiltered and open to follow a set of guidelines while preventing ISPs that did not adhere those requirements to present themselves as such. It was a form of transparency that is now repealed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The libertarian fantasy is corporations and the rich run roughshod over the country with no government oversight and regulations and the free market will sort the &quot;bad corporations&quot; out from the &quot;good corporations&quot; via the private sector and popular opinion. It makes zero sense. Now it would make sense if workplaces were true democratic institutions and the workers owned the businesses and the corporations. But then that would be a form of anarchism, which I actually advocate for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right the solution to a corporate take over of a government department is not to give that corporation more power. Libertarianism falls flat on its face when it is applied to the current economy because it assumes a fair playing field, which we do not have. Not all government regulation is bad. Government regulation designed to protect consumers is what we need more of, and sadly that is the kind of legislation that no longer occurs in the US because its been taken over by corporations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our government has devolved to a point where corporations don&#39;t even hide the fact that they have have taken over regulation agencies. They gloat in front of the American people, laughing about how stupid they think they all are. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK8a3yZDVUM">Ajit Pai&#39;s victory video</a> left me sick to my stomach because of his disdain for the American people. Its fucking insulting. Ajit Pai: Hey Americans, you are all fucking stupid. Now go watch some more cat videos and shut the fuck up.</p>

<p>You are right that NN didn&#39;t go far enough and it wasn&#39;t properly enforced, but that doesn&#39;t mean the solution is to dismantle it. Unfortunately, until we address the root of the problem: corporate take over of government agencies, we will never have solutions that work for us. Its sad that most Republicans have been fed this lie that the solution to a corporate takeover of the government is to give more power to the corporations. Libertarianism falls flat on its face when it is applied to the actual American economy, because the only way it works is if the playing field is level, which it is not and never has been. Not all gov&#39;t regulation is bad. Regulation that protects consumers against corporate interests can be good, but sadly we no longer have this kind of legislation because of how much power corporations have on our politicians. I for one hope that people continue to scream and shout and flip out about NN to compel the politicians to put in place more permanent legislation that evens the playing field and ensures that we are protected as consumers. These assholes need to know that if they keep shoving this shit in our faces, eventually we are going to fight back.</p>

<p>In regards to being a Trump supporter, I know it sucks getting duped, I went through the same thing after believing Obama&#39;s lies in my young 20s. But we need more former Trump supporters to open their eyes and start revolting against his policies, and holding him accountable for his blatant lies. I told every single one of my liberal friends how shitty Obama was for years, they didn&#39;t want to hear it but I kept showing them facts that they could not dispute. Its hard to get people to shed their affinity for certain political leaders, but facts I&#39;ve found to be the best power of persuasion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, you described one group of libertarianism when saying no government, that&#39;s anarchocapitalism.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, that&#39;s taking it too far.  Power should be given back to the states, why would you want to centralize all the power when you could have 50 science experiments running all at the same time so each could pick the parts that work in each experiment and do away with the parts that don&#39;t, and also give people a choice on where they live that best fits their ideas.</p>

<p>Second, youre advocating for a governing agency like OSHA, which does do some good things but also gets in the way of growth for companies as well.  With a proper litigation process in place, those workers, who really arent working anywhere by force anyways, can sue for a safer work environment if it comes to that.</p>

<p>Third, I will never understand the level of ignorance that pops up everytime someone describes these ideas as some sort of &quot;utopia.&quot;  The only people I see using that word are the ones that dont understand the philosophy.  There is no utopia.  There is only the idea that everyone is given the chance to both succeed or fail in direct proportion to the effort and will they put forth, without any artificial barriers.</p>

<p>I disagree. Republicans didn&#39;t cheat progressives in 2016. Democrats cheated (and <em>defrauded</em>) progressives. That makes Democrats less progressive, especially considering democracy is the only thing progressives have to enact a progressive agenda.</p>

<p>&quot;The 2016 court decision upholding the rules was a Pyrrhic victory for the net neutrality movement. In short, the decision revealed that the 2015 Open Internet Order provides no meaningful net neutrality protections–it allows ISPs to block and throttle content. As the judges who upheld the Order said, “The Order…specifies that an ISP remains ‘free to offer ‘edited’ services’ without becoming subject to the rule’s requirements.”&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh no, my argument makes sense if you&#39;re a mature adult who functions in society. See, for the vast majority of choices you don&#39;t really get to have the thing you really want and have to put thought into your decision, or what you&#39;d call choosing &quot;strategically&quot;. </p>

<p>Like, I want a high end computer that doesn&#39;t overheat and  costs &lt;$1K. unfortunately that thing doesn&#39;t really exist. So I have to decide if I&#39;m willing to spend more money or willing to compromise with a cheaper build. </p>

<p>For important decisions, we&#39;re even more incentive to make hard choices rather then put it off. If I have cancer and have to choose what treatment I want, what I really want is one that doesn&#39;t cost money and has the highest chance of keeping me alive. Unfortunately the only choices I have are an expensive mix of chemo/surgery/and radiation, Or I have faith healing. What I don&#39;t have is the chance to wait for a better option to pop up and save me. I have to make the choice of living in debt (which sucks) or dying (double sucks) </p>

<p>When the people vote on an election they never get their first choice (a hypothetical genius that holds all of the voters core values and maybe can see into the future). So they vote for whomever has a chance of winning and also holds more of their values then anyone else who has a chance of winning. </p>

<p>tldr: voting strategically  not only is people choosing, it&#39;s a part of everyday life you pampered child. </p>
