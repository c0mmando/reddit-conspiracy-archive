<p>If someone could get into the prison to see Adam Katschke (or find out if he&#39;s been advised not to speak to anyone-- which would be info all in itself), I would personally donate $ toward your gas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t even know that there was a prison out there. You think I could give them a call and just try and setup an appointment/ talk to him. I feel like there&#39;s a way inmates schedule appointments and I&#39;d know if I&#39;d be able to talk to him If I made one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure how far Caliente is from Vegas. It may be far. However, I can try to check into where this Katschke guy was sent to prison (he was sentenced to 12-24 months in January 2017.... So, I&#39;m thinking he&#39;s probably still there). Definitely would be easier to interview him in prison. So, depending on where he is (and if LE has gotten involved with this dude), he may be able to add you to an approved list of visitors. Now that his name has been circulating, I don&#39;t know how easy it would be. There are particular days you can visit. If it&#39;s anything like regular jail, it&#39;s according to last name. Let me see if I can find out where he is. Let me just say this, if you get on his approved list, and have the balls to actually go see him (I don&#39;t know if I could do it-- not because he&#39;s a criminal but mostly because I suck at talking to ppl I don&#39;t know) I would definitely applaud you for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. So... bad news. Or, perhaps good news? Depending on how far you&#39;re willing to go with this.</p>

<p>Looks as if Adam Katschke was paroled in June and is currently serving the rest of his sentence on Home Confinement, according to NDOC Inmate Search. It&#39;s possible I could find his address. But, I would not fault you whatsoever if you didn&#39;t want to drive all the way out there just for him to tell you to leave. It&#39;s pretty ridiculous he&#39;s out after only 5 months. But, I suppose I&#39;d rather him pay for his own ankle monitor and home system than the taxpayers have another inmate on their balance sheet. If you&#39;re serious about doing this, I&#39;d suggest contacting Jake Morphonios at The End Times News Report on YouTube. If you know who Katschke is then I&#39;m assuming you probably know about Jake. I bet you anything he knows where Katschke is and he could tell you if he himself has tried getting in touch with him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am familiar with Jake. I enjoy a fair bit of his content. Ill get in touch and see if he can get me an address. Sounds interesting. If I can&#39;t get a lead he&#39;ll be out when I&#39;m home over summer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome. If you find out anything of note (or even if you don&#39;t), I&#39;d be interested to hear your experience-- even if he just hangs up on you or slams the door in your face. LOL just taking a video or audio recording would be very interesting. I&#39;m not sure if NV is a 2 party consent state regarding recorded calls but if you don&#39;t doc yourself I doubt Katschke would ever find out. Anything else you may find during this current trip... photos whatever would be much appreciated. I&#39;ve noticed we&#39;ve had sparse posts and when we do, not more than 10 comments. </p>
