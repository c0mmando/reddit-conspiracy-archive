        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is about rebranding those of us who ask hard questions about powerful groups, and some ideas on communication.</p>

<p>Conspiracies are generally crimes. Gangsters working together to infliltrate / blackmail / bribe government agencies is somehow seen as a fantasy? It&#39;s how mafias operate. If people studied black markets they might see some connections.</p>

<p>Supposedly the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; was coined by the CIA as a preventative psyop. It seems to work. So let&#39;s change the frame.</p>

<p>Say someone laughs dismissively after you mention an idea. Say something like, &quot;if you put in some serious research time, you can come back and laugh at these absurd ideas.&quot; People that are ignorant about a subject often feel no hesitation to act like they know all about it. It&#39;s hollow posturing they have been trained to do as a reflex. If someone is rude enough to laugh in your face, call you stupid, or engage in gaslighting by saying you&#39;re crazy, it says something about them not you. If they want to mock you, just ask how much they really know about the topic. Where did they get their information? </p>

<p>Maintain the frame. You can ask them if they believe everything they see on the news. Chances are they will say their favorite news is reliable and the others mess up or lie. How do they know that if they don&#39;t check other sources? That can be the start of a conversation on reliability of information and who decides what the facts supposedly are. Really it almost all goes back to six corporate giants and their intelligence agency handlers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always point out that it&#39;s all just considered &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; right until you need to write a paper for history class.</p>

<p>Like, we take as 100% gospel that certain Roman dictators did what they did a thousand years ago and all agree on it, but anytime I reference something with film, witness or other evidence there&#39;s always some dude nitpicking every little detail and ends with no real point being made by them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This a new tactic that I have noticed from my friends on the Left. I have a journalism degree, I believe good journalism is investigative. I spend my time reading a lot of investigative journalism and independent media and forming my own opinions. Do I have direct proof that Seth Rich was murdered by someone connected to the DNC? No. But would I bet money on it? Yes. And you are right that everyone that dismisses these things as &quot;conspiracy theories are people that have not bothered to research it themselves in the slightest. I can&#39;t tell you how many people have told me that pizzagate was a story Alex Jones made up.  Apparently, in order for something to not be considered a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; it needs to have been picked up by the Huffington Post or CNN. Not only that, but the same people that have gaslit me and implied that I was crazy for &quot;believing things that haven&#39;t been proven&quot; are the same exact people who will automatically assume an account of being groped 3 decades ago is truth and never shut about how Trump somehow colluded with Russia to steal the election despite no direct evidence of it after a year. </p>

<p>Why not? Just because information is coming from a YouTube video, that doesn&#39;t automatically mean it&#39;s a bad or unreliable source. In this day and age, with all this technology we have,  it&#39;s awesome and convenient to be able to go online and watch videos about a particular subject instead of having to drive to the library and research it there like in the past. I admit, there&#39;s some poor, shitty documentaries out there that don&#39;t do the conspiracy community any favors, but there still plenty of good and informative videos out there</p>

    <div class="md"><p>90% of everything is crap - Sturgeon&#39;s law</p>

<p>Going from a controlled to a wild marketplace of ideas has had big consequences. There&#39;s more opportunity to learn factual things, but so much noise that it&#39;s more difficult. That is a long conversation all on it&#39;s own.</p>

<p>I want the biggest haystack with the most needles as an option. In practice the straw is scattered all over the ground and the searchers are brawling. Fortunately we have needle finding groups to help us, lol.</p>

<p>I have always seen hostility and derision towards opponents of power and independent  investigations. The ones staying hidden shine a light on the more deceitful, deranged, or controlled. Take Joe Rogan, he is very persuasive and bright. His information comes across as accurate. Yet his tattoos identity him as an occultist, probably in some Freemason linked tradition. He is a famous celebrity with wealth and a big platform. So what do we make of his shows? I take each guest as they come. You can tell the truth all day long, even as a counter culture figure, as long as you lie about or conceal specific topics you can be allowed an audience. With all the conflicting data, insider revelations get lost. Alex Jones says he comes from a family of high level Freemasons then asks us to trust his network as one stop shopping for conspiracy news. Okay. Well some shit Jones does is important, like the Bohemian Grove video. Other stuff is ludicrous.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a tactic: Take a factual item the corporate media conceals. Say, Hillary Clinton gets seizures. Undeniable if you watch tape. Mix that fact with something ludicrous, Clinton is sick so she must be Reptilian. Proven disinfo next to proven fact. It confuses people and makes proving a case even harder.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take a known liar&#39;s word at face value, ok fine. Is every single claim they say false? Clearly not. Most people lie and make mistakes daily about small things, yet we still trust them enough to do business with them. So instead of brushing aside claims without looking, suspend belief until you know more. </p>

<p>Try and find out where the ideas first came from. I started out thinking it would be easy to debunk pizzagate, but I wanted to have more than &quot;crazies and trolls from 4Chan&quot; which is case closed for most people. I found Alefantis&#39;s social media filled with horrific images and &quot;jokes.&quot; I believe he is the frontman Majestic Ape for the pedophile themed band Heavy Breathing. One video literally has him asking in a thought bubble, &quot;am I a pedophile?&quot; His stage chatter is about molesting and killing children and babies. That was just the start. I figured if everyone was covering for this guy who is telling us he is a predator, something is going on. Then I discover the roots of this thing tie into what I have been studying a long time. It&#39;s triggered a self education process that covers dozens of linked subjects. </p>

<p>I went through hell to get closer to the truth. So when people say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; I can respect that. If they come at us like, &quot;imma skeptic, two websites said debunked&quot; that&#39;s just sad. </p>
