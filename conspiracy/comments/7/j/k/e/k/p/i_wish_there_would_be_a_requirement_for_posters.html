<p>This way, if someone cares to challenge, the poster has a chance to explain what the conspiracy angle is.</p>

<p>Why do it this way? Because it&#39;s voluntary and it still puts some responsibility on to the people for the content they post.</p>

<p>Because that leads to downvotes, which leads to crap posts about &#39;shills&#39;.  I&#39;ve been getting really hacked off recently with people posting vague nonsense, and then getting the hump when it gets downvoted.  Or the posts about watching the &#39;new&#39; queue because &#39;bots&#39; are downvoting everything.</p>

<p>Yeah... most people aren&#39;t posting that stuff cause they know most of those won&#39;t be of any interest to this board... information overload. If it ain&#39;t a screenshot or a youtube video you&#39;d better have a sensational title cause people here don&#39;t read senate reports and shit like that just cause someone posted it... I mean I do... but I go thru federalregister for all that info. </p>

<p>And in response to this, which I&#39;m hesitant to do because you&#39;ll just continue on this non-sequitar instead of actually defending your original statement, no one is being told they have to give their opinion on the piece, they&#39;re being told to give a summation of why the piece belongs on r/conspiracy and hopefully starting some organic discussion based on the reason they decided it should be posted here. This does not hamper discussion in any way, it actually removes one of the paths towards forum sliding and also removes the ability to just spam links and memes with no input from the posters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a term that originally had a different meaning when it was first coined.  Then the media picked it up and pushed it to mean basically anyone who supported Trump or had conservative views was part of this &quot;new&quot; radical group called the alt-right.  Now it is used online or in the media to dismiss or throw shade on anyone who supports Trump or has conservative views.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I gather it was pretty much synonymous with white supremacy.  Which is what gives it its negative connotation. Now when they call basically every Trump supporter or conservative a alt-righter they are basically saying any conservative or Trump supporter is also a white supremacist as if they are mutually inclusive.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Unless the issues are actually racist themselves, it doesn&#39;t matter if white supremacists want the same thing.  Just because racists or white supremacists generally aren&#39;t the best of people does not make them inherently wrong about anything and everything.  Just because you may agree on certain policies doesn&#39;t make them racist policies by association.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And not all Trump supporters are alt-right, but all alt-right folks are Trump supporters.</p>

<p>Would you agree with that statement?</p>

<p>I can agree that that statement is meaningless even if it was possible to somehow prove as true even though you and I both know it isn&#39;t.  Do you personally know all the alt-right folks?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Adding nice sounding rules that are blatantly used to selectively enforce opinions and ban &quot;wrongthink&quot; is truly the &quot;Reddit way&quot;. And by that I mean Reddit is literally a full blown shilling operation.</p>

<p>The obsessive and phony hand wringing that gets pushed by shills across Reddit about adding more and more rules is just the standard MO of how to subvert and control discussion.</p>

<p>The OP&#39;s suggestion is especially ridiculous, given that the whole purpose of the site is built around functionality that is supposed to give the people the power to determine what is a good submission or not, via votes.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>focused on issues similar to what white supremacists push. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unless the issues are actually racist themselves, it doesn&#39;t matter if white supremacists want the same thing.  Just because racists or white supremacists generally aren&#39;t the best of people does not make them inherently wrong about anything and everything.  Just because you may agree on certain policies doesn&#39;t make them racist policies by association.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And not all Trump supporters are alt-right, but all alt-right folks are Trump supporters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Would you agree with that statement?</p>

<p>I can agree that that statement is meaningless even if it was possible to somehow prove as true even though you and I both know it isn&#39;t.  Do you personally know all the alt-right folks?</p>
