       LOL!  What exactly is your "good fight"?  Literally 90% of your posts are paranoid meltdowns about "MUH SHILLS".

       Once again though, it doesn't appear to matter to the moderation team on this sub when people violate the shill accusation rule.  But a negative headline about a pervert creep like Moore is enough for a thread deletion.  Sounds legit...

       Yep, it's a favorite pastime of mine to bash Trump (1) because he's a senile dipshit who embarrasses the country on a daily basis and (2) it really grinds the gears of certain "conspiracy theorists" here with a mysterious devotion to the federal government.

       As for Podesta, I'll defend anyone who has been falsely accused of harming children.  And until the PizzaParty crew can produce any direct evidence showing that he's raped/murdered kids, I will continue to do so.

       No, the title was editorialized to accuse everyone who supported Moore of being a pedophile or a pedophile sympathizer.

       I've explained it before and I'll do so again for your benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Posts in the #1 spot on the sub get
       <em>
        exponentially
       </em>
       more views and exposure than even the #2 spot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, posts that hit #1 receive
       <em>
        exponentially
       </em>
       higher standards of moderation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we deleted
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       misleading or sensational post on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , this sub would be a graveyard.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not our job...that's
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       jobs.
       <em>
        You
       </em>
       have the power to upvote and downvote and contribute to what gets seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I let
       <em>
        dozens
       </em>
       of misleading posts stay up on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Because they are ruthlessly downvoted to oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The users do a far better job of this kind of moderation than the entire mod team.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is the #1 spot different?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because that position can give serious exposure (and traffic), it's the most vulnerable when it comes to vote manipulation and forum sliding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, posts in the #1 spot are held to much higher levels of scrutiny, hence why only the #1 spot sometimes receives flairs that you don't see anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, editorialized and misleading titles in the #1 spot are given harsher standards of moderation.

      <p>

       The current #1 post suggests that a surgeon was killed for "exposing Clinton Foundation corruption in Haiti," but the man in question has no recorded statements where he criticizes the Clintons or their foundation. Why hasn't that been removed for being misleading, fabricated, and sensationalist?

       You're right, that's a shit post that should be removed.

       The main difference is that the Roy Moore post got 50k views and received almost
       <em>
        3 dozen
       </em>
       reports before I removed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Clinton post only now received it's first report.

       I've been so preoccupied with the "fallout" from removing the Roy Moore post that I hadn't seen what it was replaced by.

       Absolutely, this is becoming a

       This thread isn't about James Alefantis. It's about Roy More.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sit down right here and let Pappy tell ye a story. You see, Ol' Roy had an itch that ladies his age juuusst couldn't scratch. So Ol' Roy got it in his head to go 'round Alabama and start talkin' to the young ladies. All sorts of 'em. He'd meet 'em in malls, outside of custody hearings, or maybe even at cheerleading practice. Wheeew boy, he sure loved them cheerleaders! He even built up quite a reputation for it in some places. They even kept files on 'em in the mall! But don't be too quick to condemn the man. That's just how it was in Alabama back in those days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizza Gate has no real evidence to speak of. It has no alleged victims. No one has come forward about Pizza Gate. James Alefantis hasn't been accused by anyone but neckbeards on the internet.

        So... you're claiming that this sub supports Roy Moore?

       So... You're saying you support pedophelia, and would have even voted for Roy Moore if given the chance?

       I'm not sure where you got the idea that I support pedophilia, but my question to axolotl_peyotl is quite logical.
      </p>
      <p>
       He says that the deleted post accuses Moore supporters of supporting pedophilia, and that it associates the sub with supporting pedophilia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I see it, that argument only makes sense with the unspoken premise that this sub's members support Moore.

       It definitely couldn't have anything to do with this being based on unfounded accusations within the thread purposefully defacing the sub, definitely couldn't be the polar opposite of what you've suggested. Perfect logic. I mean if it were true that this sub supports pedophilia they would have left it up after all.

       Because that is the consensus of personal opinions here given the information.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a clear difference between a personal opinion and a smear campaign against an entire sub.  One you can debate and the other is a pointless attack on a thing/group.  We're not the police, we're not an official organization.  You can't say people here aren't allowed to think that Pedoesta is a pedo.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can think the entirety of r/conspiracy supports pedophilia but that would be about the most ridiculous thing to claim and basically is just a waste of time and space on a place that deserves a real talk instead of a bullshit witch hunt to attack a mod.

       No, no.  You asked why people would think Pedoesta was a pedo.  Some people hold that opinion.

       copying from another comment:

      <p>
       Posts in the #1 spot on the sub get
       <em>
        exponentially
       </em>
       more views and exposure than even the #2 spot.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how reddit works, and I shouldn't have to explain that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, posts that hit #1 receive
       <em>
        exponentially
       </em>
       higher standards of moderation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we deleted
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       misleading or sensational post on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , this sub would be a graveyard.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not our job...that's
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       jobs.
       <em>
        You
       </em>
       have the power to upvote and downvote and contribute to what gets seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I let
       <em>
        dozens
       </em>
       of misleading posts stay up on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Because they are ruthlessly downvoted to oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The users do a far better job of this kind of moderation than the entire mod team.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is the #1 spot different?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because that position can give serious exposure (and traffic), it's the most vulnerable when it comes to vote manipulation and forum sliding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, posts in the #1 spot are held to much higher levels of scrutiny, hence why only the #1 spot sometimes receives flairs that you don't see anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, editorialized and misleading titles in the #1 spot are given harsher standards of moderation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you should read the rest of the comments ITT.

       Hmm, perhaps because Moore had eight different people come forward and accuse him of being a disgusting pedophile.  Like eight, real-life human beings who testified that they were victims of his abuse.  This is the major element, i.e. actual evidence, that is missing from your Pizza investigations.

       No, I meant independent verification that "cum panda" is a niche of child pornography and that "panda head" caters to it. Of course, if you search for "cum panda" and "James Alefantis" you're going to get hits but that's not providing a source. It's bit sad that such a basic premise needs to be explained.

       James Alefantis own behaviors online are what lead people to learn about "cum panda" and to document this behavior. theres plenty of different and independent sources for you to choose from, as provided in the google search link.

       Could you show us an actual source for the existence of the "Panda Head" publication, or evidence for "cum panda" being a genre of child pornography? Hopefully a better source than a wiki page that cites "according to some."

       In other words, you have no independent verification that what you are claiming is true and you can't point me to any. That pretty much sums up the whole of pizzagate – one person makes up a bullshit claim, another swallows it whole without question and repeats it, and so on and so on, and then they just cite each other as corroboration.

       I don’t think cum panda is child porn.

       Exactly - Manipulate the narrative to use the trends as they were as a platform to push back with an otherwise irrelevant subject. Yeah, Moore is getting accused of pedophilia - Guess the difference between him and Podesta? He's actually being held accountable and facing consequences rather than having the entire cabal rush to defend him.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's getting his, unfortunately the statutes of limitations don't apply - I certainly wish they did, but given this there is a not a whole lot of conversation to be had in regards to him. What's to dig up or discuss at this point? People still talk about Hillary because she has not been given this level of scrutiny to her actions, deliberately.
      </p>
      <p>
       This entire last 2 weeks has been a reverse psyop to hijack the concerns of the community and weaponize them against narratives they do not approve.

       Julian Assange was once the "far left" by most accounts, but then things started to change. He started retweeting establishment Republican politicians and website, while releasing only information exposing Democrats. People started to question the changes.
      </p>

       Then, it came out that he was secretly working with the Republican campaign, not only on strategy and document sharing, but also suggested that Donald Trump should not "concede" the election if he loses. That's some serious intervention for the "far right" as most would call it, and very calculated as he told the campaign that he needed to maintain the appearance of transparency and objectivity.
      </p>
      <p>
       At that point, it was clear that something changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line: "far left" credentials don't automatically last forever.

       I had a bit of libertarian in me early in life. First, I shed the economic libertarianism because it just didn't make sense. It was harder to shed the social libertarianism, but I dropped that too when I realized that property rights could be used to discriminate.

       I post anti-Trump conspiracies with equal fervor, they just never get as much attention.

       The conspiracy theorist has always tended to reject authority, and this includes the government and the MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that the MSM has aligned itself against the government, the conspiracy theorist is being compelled to choose a side, when he's always known that this was a false dichotomy.

       During the Senate race, allegations of sexual misconduct were made against him.[4] Three women stated that he had sexually assaulted them when they were teenagers, including one who was 14 at the time.[5] Moore acknowledged that he may have approached and dated teenagers, but denied that any of the girls were underage or that he had sexually assaulted anyone.

       Oh that's cute. A semantic argument. I'll just go with child molester so you can't use that "he's not a pedophile" defense. Do you remember the day you woke up and decided it was going to be the day you defended a child molester? Why?

       so its a mere matter of "semantics" that we are not supposed to call Bill Clinton a rapist, because he technically hasn't been prosecuted yet?
      </p>
      <p>
       just as you dismissed allegations of blackmailed-pedophiles in government when PG scandal broke, because of the suspicious timing around an election?
      </p>
      <p>
       PG is still alive and well. lets watch and see what happens to these allegations against Roy Moore
      </p>
      <p>
       i suspect they will eventually go the way of the "rape" lawsuit that dogged Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein just before the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       the Friday after Trump won the election, NPR mentioned the lawsuit had been dropped

       That's a lot of words you just put in my mouth. I didn't say anything about Clinton. I was talking about Roy Moore. It's nice that you convict some people that have been accused and then completely dismiss others. Funny how you do that straight down party lines. I never would've guessed that from your username.

       Just as irrelevant as your other question. I seriously don’t understand your logic here. He was accused of being relations with teenagers while being in his thirties. What two fourteen year olds do or when I had sex with someone matters no at all.

       I cant really answer this without knowing the specific posts to which you're referring. I agree it is an issue as there are clearly partisan actors on both sides. However, that's not my overall experience with this sub, and I am certainly not feeling overwhelmed by right talking points at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       With regard to the Roy Moore post, I havent been able to reach my own conclusion about his allegations because of both sides of partisan actors that I mentioned. Moore's politics were toxic enough in my opinion to where I couldnt support the man regardless of these scandals, but its evident to me that those that are genuinely interested from asking questions are being discouraged from doing so.

       Why?

      <p>
       You never delete any of the bullshit Podesta spam that's posted here by other Trump worshippers. Are you so partisan that you will censor conversations about your god emperor's paedophile friends just to protect the deep state's ability to rape kids?
      </p>
      <p>
       There was already a mod in that thread earlier selectively censoring people to try and make this subreddit a safe space for trumpets to ignore child abuse when its 'their side'.

       It seems like you've given up even attempting to pretend that you're not just trying to turn this place into r/the_dumbfuck 2.0.

      <p>
       How are the subscribers supposed to trust the moderation here when you do things like this, without explanation, and they so consistently align with the goals and intentions of the establishment/deep state/government?
      </p>
      <p>
       This place has become the perfect epitome of limited hangout since Trump's snowflake army began turning this into their establishment loving circlejerk.

       I'm a little confused as to why you'd do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like the accusations and evidence against him was pretty damning - multiple victims came forward with accusations, mall security had to be on the lookout for him, the sheriff at the time said they had to keep him away from high school cheerleaders, multiple residents of his town said it was an open secret he had a thing for teenage girls. And while I know wapo isn't exactly a preferred news source here, I do think it speaks volumes that when somebody came forward with false allegations, they were called out on it. Then his own denial was basically that he just didn't remember, but if he did do something like that, he would have asked for their parent's permission first.
      </p>
      <p>
       If pedos being protected by those in power is going to be a major focus of this sub, I don't understand why the president and party in power backing somebody who very likely pursued under aged girls isn't a good fit, but Feldmen/Weinstein/Franken is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could you please explain the logic behind this decision? I'm having a tough time following it right now.

       The thread is not a conspiracy. There is absolutely no context or content.  There are other subs to submit news posts/politics posts that don't contain a conspiracy.  If the OP wanted to form a conspiracy out of the information, they could have, but instead it was a low-effort sheet post.

       How is it not conspiracy when pedophiles in power have been the reigning theme of this sub for a year?
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=pedophile&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;t=year">
        Here's a look at some of the pedophile topics

       that have been here recently. This should be a glorious celebration then, as a pedophile was kept out of office. It seems

       The conspiracy with this story is the timing of the allegations. It's no surprise the allegations started when he was running for reelection and after it was too late to get a replacement.

       It makes me wonder if the allegations would've come out if that wasn't the case

       Pizzagate is not the same as dating a 16 year old.... Stop trying to conflate the issues. They are both issues, but of varying severity. Toddlers and Infants being raped and murdered is not the same as an old man picking up a willing teenager. Both are gross, but one is more so.

       This is kind of sad to me though. The ONLY reason anyone has targeted Moore's pedophilia is to get him to lose the race in Alabama. That is all. I would love for your post to be true, but let me give you an idea of what is going to happen. The Moore case is going to be DROPPED, why? Because there is not and has not ever been enough evidence to charge him. Seriously, there is more evidence of the existence of pizza gate than there is of Moore being and serial pedophile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, the "democrats" did nothing here involving pedophiles. They DID obey the propaganda that has been pushed over last month though. Which means Sessions has to go back to Bama and the special investigation is halted. This is the true main goal, not to stop pedophilia, but to slow an investigation, and it MAKES ME SICK. So many people road out this Moore thing while pizza gate investigators have literally had their lives threatened by James Alefantis himself, and nothing has come of it. I truly implore people to take the time to learn about pizza gate. Start with Ben Swann's report which got him fired and blacklisted. (They even made him delete his social media!)
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want to restate this one more time. In no way do I support pedophilia or Roy Moore, but I've been around long enough to KNOW this case will be dropped. Just wait and see, and once it's dropped, I would like people to look inward and ask if they were a tool for someone's agenda in the days leading up to this election. Here's a hint: Roy Moore's election has a lot to do with stopping Sessions and his investigation.

       No there isn't. Not a single pizzagate victim has come forward. Moore's victim have. And to top it off, Moore is not even denying it. His "defense" was that he asked permission from the victims mothers.

       This case is similar in a lot of ways to the Michael Jackson case. There are a lot of bells and whistles going on, even victims coming forward, but in the end Moore will be found not guilty. (Though there will not be a trial, that much is certain.) Like I said, all of this hasn't been about any of the victims; just Moore's seat. This case will continue to be about that, and now that Moore is out, it will be completely dropped and forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, it makes me sick to see this shit going on. If Roy even is a pedophile, just think about how long people have sat on that info... Three decades!! That should be the first red flag that all of this theatre isn't about justice... He's going to get off Scott free, but Jeff Session's investigation has been slowed, so that's all that matters to TPTB.
      </p>
      <p>
       I implore that you check out Ben Swann's video about Pizzagate. They tried to remove it from the web for a reason. There is so much more evidence thing James Alefantis and David Brock to something malicious than there is in the Moore case; it's breathtaking. Especially after you find out about Alefantis' death threats towards a known PG youtuber and then consider how Swann was almost completely removed as a presence from the internet at the same time...

       That is certain - in Alabama, there are no longer statute of limitations for child sex crimes
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       . Unfortunately, this only applies to crimes committed before 1985. Since Moore's accusations are from the 70s, there
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a statute of limitations and it has expired.
       <a href="http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/11/roy_moore_could_alabama_senate_1.html">

       There is more evidence of Pizzagate than Roy Moore?!? I have family in Gadsden and it is a well known fact that he is someone to keep your kids from. There are many, many people that have come forward with these allegations, absolutely zero from Pizzagate. And as for "charges" against Moore, he can't be charged with a crime based off of the laws in Alabama. The statute of limitations is in place for any crime prior to 1985 I believe.
And as for Ben Swann, his bosses at the network he worked for made him shut those down and suspended him for a week. Once he realized his professional career was about to die, he took everything down. He chose to do that instead of commit career suicide.

       Wtf are you on about.. Roy Moore was never banned from any malls nor was he banned from the highschool.  The mall manager says there is no record of such a ban and he doesnt recall him every being kicked out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cop was accused him of being banned from the highschool/cheerleaders etc had to admit it was just "rumors". She cant provide any evidence her allegation is true.

       The yearbook had 2 different color inks and two different sets of handwriting.. they added his name in and the extra annotations.

      <p>
       How can you even consider the evidence credible when its been tainted by the very party making the accusations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the yearkbook was authentic(which it isnt) it doesnt prove he's a pedophile. It would only prove he was in a restaurant signing a girl yearbook, nothing more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every piece of evidence used against him has been thoroughly debunked. The mall banning, the highschool ban, the yearkbook. Nothing can be corroborated. On the contrary you have evidence to prove otherwise..

       No it hasn’t.  Another girl who he said he never met provided a note he wrote her congratulating her on graduating high school and the Moore campaign jumped from “he never met her” to “well this doesn’t prove he tried to fuck her.. it just proves he’s a friend of their family!”  So why is he lying about ever meeting these people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it’s worth noting that the only reason the yearbook girl admitted to signing the the date and location is because a handwriting expert looked at the book and said the note and signature appear legit but the date and place are written by somebody else.  So a handwriting expert said that Moore did sign it.  Yet Moore said he didn’t and never even met her... even though he also admitted he frequented the diner this girl worked at.  I guess 35 year old men write notes to so many teenagers that it’s hard to recall doing that?

       A handwriting expert hired by Gloria Allred? Do we know who he or she is? Was it an independent third party? I think not..

       The other notes dont match his handwriting either! Any idiot comparing the two will notice immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       The yearbook changes color after Roy. Gloria Allred and her client added his last name and everything else after that. That is a textbook forgery according to the law. The yearkbook is sham.

       What about the second girl with the note?  The one who Roy Moore didn't ever meet until the note came out and then suddenly they changed their tune to "well this is only evidence that he's a friend of the family."  So if he's a friend of the family then he did meet the girl so why did he lie about it?  What's the point in lying if you have nothing to cover up?  Moore, himself, when he was on Hannity's show, couldn't even deny that he was pursuing high school girls when he was in his 30s.  The best he could do was say that he never went after a girl without asking for the mother's permission first.  To ignore this shit and handwave it away is silly.  If Moore was a democrat there's no way people who say "fake news" about Moore's accusers would be saying that.  If he was a democrat everyone who supported Moore would be supporting the accusers.  It's partisan hack shit.

       Why did he lie about knowing this girl?  And yeah.. even if it is legal what the hell is a 35 year old man doing trying to pursue a relationship with a 16 year old girl?  And if he's doing that why is it so hard to believe he also was trying to pursue relationships with other teenaged girls as young as 14?  That's why he lied about knowing this girl.  Because if people believe he was interested in a 16 year old girl then it's much more likely that the other girls also aren't lying.

       Who was eager to dismiss it? The problem was that any critical examination of the evidence we were provided resulting in heavy-duty backlash and the overwhelming presence in any thread about it insisted the mainstream narrative was to be swallowed whole or you were a "victim blamer" or a "pedo" or "alt right".

       Isn't the nature of the pizza 'topic' such that it's impossible to find evidence? It's all code words and misdirection right? That is a conspiracy theorists playground. If something doesn't make sense it's not because it is literally nonsense it's because 'we need to look deeper'.

       I believe there is enough evidence to qualify for a legal investigation. As far as victims, the Moore allegations took 40 years to come about. I'm not expecting trafficked and abused children to be picking up the phone and calling the FBI and the press anytime soon.

       That story has been debunked. He was the own in the 80s, Roy Moore was a kiddie diddler in the 70s. The mall cop would be much more likely to know who was on the list.

       There was not credible evidence, only a smear campaign by Breitbart. With 9 victims and over 30 sources confirming those victims stories, the evidence was overwhelming. He had a clear pattern of victimizing young teenage girls. We have multiple love letters, and mall cops and family members of the victims all corroborating it.

       If you don't think there is credible evidence of Pizzagate, I fear it is you that is blinded by political and tribal leanings. I specifically set out to debunk PG because I thought it sounded ludicrous- and, as I'm sure you know, didn't start looking into it until after the election, in which I voted for Johnson- so you are way off base as for your summation of my motives.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Moore- I don't give a shit about him. I haven't defended anything he has done and I don't share his politics. I've only shared my personal experience, cited prevailing laws, questioned the yearbook and its inscribed date of December(that makes no sense) and asked people if their issue was the age difference or the consent laws and tried to clear up the "pedophile" term. That is discussion, not defence- and, apparently it is something completely foreign to the team that was here to shill this topic. Not once could I get a normal discussion going- every time I asked a question I was pummeled with replies and user name mentions insinuating that I, too, must be a pedophile.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think everyone here should be aware of the larger conspiracy here- that there is an obvious and organized effort in this sub to push the MSM narrative wholesale at all costs.

       I'm talking about Roy Moore, why do you want to deflect to PizzaGate? I do find some PG emails suspicious, but so far we have no victims never-mind all of the corroborating physical evidence like the multiple love notes to his teen victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you apologize for pedos Roy Moore and push PG shows your tribalism. Where as I am interested in both conspiracies.

       Every single time I see someone say something like this, they're projecting a flaw that they have too. I look at their post history, already knowing what I'll find. 100% of the time it's someone who either only ever comments about pedophiles in the "other" political party or they defend the accused members of their "own" political party. You're as predictable as the rest have been.

       It's easy to notice and condemn other people's blind spots- much harder to acknowledge and reflect on your own.

       You do understand that the age of consent in Alabama is 16, not 18, yes?
      </p>
      <p>
       And you do understand that if a 15 year old’s parents give permission, that it means no law was broken, yes?
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not, AT ALL, agree with a 30 year old man dating a 16 year old. My point being, that is legal in Alabama. And if she was 15 at the time, and her parents gave permission, then that’s legal, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, technically, a pedophile is someone who preys on prepubescent children. I believe the proper term we are looking for here is “herbophile”.

       Then the rest of your post is pointless. If you agree that 30-somethings shouldn't be pursuing 16-year-olds, that's kind of that, isn't it? What's the point of hand-wringing about it technically being legal? You agree his actions were wrong. That's all that needs to be said.

      <p>
       How many people have accused him.

      <p>
       It means kidding, a joke ,pulling your leg.

      <p>
       Should I screen shot it and post it or do you know how to scroll up to the post?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would point out that you are calling me a retard when you failed to comprehend a few simple lines of text. Some would say that you are the retard, not me though , I wouldn’t attack other users of the sub. I wouldn’t want to get banned.

       Sidenote: It's not a hoax, it's a big theory that's got quite a bit of evidence going for it. Due to its circumstancial nature it's not very easy to fully prove or debunk, so remains an enticing theory worth a read.

       It's ridiculous to call it a hoax when there are confirmed emails between the Podesta bros talking about Crowley-esque Spirit Cooking, and TP referencing a torture chamber when he has an underground vault below his house.

       Never have I ever seen such a vehement response to a conspiracy theory from the media like we did with pizzagate. If I had a nickel for every time someone said it was a debunked theory without actually providing any debunking I would have a lot of fucking nickels.

       “Anybody who wants can read my memoirs and find out that [my work] is far away from Satanism,” she said. (The book was just released this week, she noted, and it’s doing well on Amazon.) “My work is really more about spirituality and not anything else,” she continued. “I’ve been doing my work for so long, and this is a misunderstanding.”

       It's more questions like
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was the entire commercial block that comet pizza is on owned by the Saudis and why was the property essentially given away and who was it given to?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just explain the fucking handkerchief would ya Podesta? There's no way around that one being so weird so just address it and tell us what it's about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why all the sexually explicit art and social media posts? Especially the ones with children in them or depicting child torture and other grotesque acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did you say being around a bunch of small children makes you wired Tony? Why are kids in a pool considered "entertainment"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where was Laura Silsby taking those kids? Did they have parents? Where have other kids been taken by groups like Silsbys before?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is James Alefantis one of the most powerful men in DC? Is Alefantis his last or middle name? Does he come from money?
      </p>
      <p>
       What other tenants make up the commercial space around comet pizza?
      </p>
      <p>
       The comet pizza shooter, what was he up to a month or so prior to the shooting? Whatever happened with that incident? What does his father do?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do witnesses of the shooting say things like "there was a family that came into our restaurant from Comet ping pong and they hadn't heard anything but the managers at comet ping pong told them to leave and I guess they came here"

       </a>
       direct quote from this video. Two witnesses who said they never saw a gun and never heard shots despite being across the street. And they said the people from ping pong hadn't heard anything either. What about the guy who tweeted the only photo (at the time) of the shooter who angrily tweeted when he said the media was falsely reporting that shots were fired?
      </p>
      <p>
       These are just a few questions and it doesn't even scrape the surface.

       You can debate the theory of you want, it's debatable. But the evidence upon which it is theorised is well documented and you can't really dispute it's existence.

       I can dispute it’s status as evidence of what it’s being used to accuse people of. It’s incumbent on anyone who believes the theory to prove that this evidence actually proves what they’re claiming

       Allow me to construct an analogy so that maybe we can reach some kind of understanding because I think we may be both misunderstanding each other. Say our town well dried up, say I and my friends already dislike the town mayor. I say, and my friends agree: The well drying up is proof that the mayor is corrupt, surely he has
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       to do with this
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, no one can dispute that the well has actually dried, but whether or not it's actually proof of the mayor's wrongdoing has already been decided by me and my friends who dislike said mayor.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point being: It's pointless to say "The evidence cannot be disputed" because we're not disputing the evidence one side is putting forward, we're disputing whether or not the evidence actually
       <strong>
        proves
       </strong>
       what is being claimed based off the evidence. I think that if we were to actually discuss the semantics of this I would have to ask you to provide what evidence is being theorized upon.

       So pizzagate is a hoax because it implicates some democrats or why would you say that?  I'm not big into pizzagate but I definitely would not dismiss it as a hoax as there are really no grounds to do so other than blind faith.  The person(s) indicated in pizzagate are "actual child predators" just as much a Moore is as neither have been convicted.  Now I'm not saying Moore isn't a pedo but I'm not saying Podesta isn't either.  You can't state that Moore is a pedo as a matter of fact and Pizzagate is a hoax.  That's just your biases at work convincing you that this pedo problem is somehow partisan and you are on the side with the "good guys".  There are shitty horrible people in power on both sides of the isle.  I think it is absolutely silly that this has devolved into a pissing match on which team is shittier.

       Maybe because the post was filled with spammers and outsiders shitting all over this sub and it’s users? Maybe because there wasn’t a shred of constructive dialogue in that comment section? Or perhaps because it was obvious to anyone with a brain that that post was being shilled with the purpose of shitting all over this sub? Or the fact that anyone asking any question that went against the narrative of the post was immediately downvoted and shilled into oblivion?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or how about the comment with 500+ upvotes basically saying every user of this sub is a pedo supporter? Can you not see how dangerous of a precedent that sets and how it puts this sub in jeopardy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or how fucking nefarious it was that that post instantly hit the front page and garnered thousands of upvotes? Certainly not something organic, and certainly not how posts rise in this sub. To any REGULAR user here, it was obvious that post and it’s comment section served one purpose; to shit all over this sub. Fucking evidenced by the fact that those TMoR children have already linked to this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you can fuck right off with your “muh hoax” bullshit. If you’d spent any time actually digging and researching pizzagate, you’d realize there is something there.
      </p>
      <p>
       But alas, your comment history goes back all of 5 days, and your main interests seem to be basketball and soccer. So what exactly did you go and delete before you decided to come in here with a divisive, incendiary comment like “pizzagate is a hoax”. My hunch is you may have had a history in TMoR, or r/politics that you scrubbed. Either way, you hid

        something
       </em>
       before deciding to come in here and rouse the rabble. I’m not accusing of you of shit, I’m just saying it’s fishy as fuck that your comment history goes back all of 5 days, and then you come in here being quite divisive. Explain yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also find it fucking
       <em>
        hilarious
       </em>
       that the users here are being labeled as pedo sympathizers WHEN WE ARE THE ONES WHO BROUGHT UP PIZZAGATE AND PEDOGATE. Yet folks like you come in here and call pizzagate a hoax ... so tell me, who are the real pedo sympathizers? Us? Or the people who come in here calling pizzagate and pedogate a hoax?

       Bring on the downvotes, God knows the brigade will latch on to this comment in no time. That Soros money goes a long way on the interwebs, those rats have a nose for this shit and will probably be shitting all over the sub in this thread before midday.

       I keep asking for proof - allegations are one thing but every single article that mentions this guy are literally "accused pedophile" or "accused sexual predator". It's almost as though one cannot be considered innocent because the media forces a particular perspective.

       Dating 18 year olds is a far cry from being a child predator.

       The yearbook entry wasn't forged, and Fox already retracted that story. The date was added by her at the bottom, but the signature was real and actually directly matched a signature that a different Moore accuser turned over.

       Wrong. She never admitted to it being forged. She said she added more information to the existing signature. These are two different things and you're being dishonest to suggest otherwise. There was

        Wrong. She never admitted to it being forged. She said she added more information to the existing signature. These are two different things and you're being dishonest to suggest otherwise. There was never an admission of forgery.

       If you originally say Moore wrote the whole thing, then that is forgery by definition. She said exactly that in the first press conference.

       Stop conflating this with sexual assault of minors. They are not the same. One is creepy, one is very illegal.

       Moore himself said on Sean Hannity that he "didn't dispute" claims that he dated 16-year-olds. If you actually cared about the truth - and it's fairly clear you don't, as long as the truth taints the guy you're bending over backwards to defend - you could take two seconds on Google to verify that.

       Normally it would be removed in 5 minutes for rule 10. Instead the mods got involved in arguments and started banning and deleting comments.

       40+ upvotes for a lie?
      </p>
      <p>
       Two options:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         You're lazy and you didn't check the
         <em>
          public
         </em>
         mod log that shows that in fact, at the time of your comment, I hadn't banned a
         <em>
          single
         </em>
         user from this thread.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You knew that and you deliberately lied to slander me and push a narrative.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Both options reflect poorly on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you offered no proof of your lie, and not a single person has responded to your comment (yet upvoted it 40+ times), I would hasten to suggest that the voting in this thread is being heavily manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       FTR, since you wrote this comment, I've banned a
       <em>
        single
       </em>
       user who was spamming accusations of me being a pedophile all over this sub and
       <a href="/r/undelete">

       I honestly thought this mod was somewhat neutral, albeit with strong libertarian leanings. Now I am not so sure. I called him out the other day on using the term "ALL MSM is FAKE NEWS" because lets be frank thats a fucking Donald Trump talking point. And I was tired of the conversation in this sub getting reduced down to the lowest common dominator instead of mods encouraging and facilitating critical thinking and nuanced discussion. I'm pretty sure he used an alternate account to argue with me about it and finally gave up when it was clear that he wasn't going to get me to concede on my initial criticism. I honestly thought the shake-down of the mod team a few months ago was a good thing, because Fly Tape was a partisan idiot, now I am not so sure.

       What does the phrasing matter? The phenomenon has been occuring for decades. Chomsky documented it in Manufacturing Consent in the 80s. Just because someone uses the terminology that is flavor of the month doesn't make it any less true

       The phrase is too simplistic and it discourages critical thinking. It is also a Donald Trump talking point, so like it or not, when you use it, people associate you with him. You don't get to control how others perceive your messages. It is up to you to convey your messages in a way that leads people to perceive it accurately.

       I think Donald Trump has been successful at latching on to things to make him seem like he is part of the counter-culture or the counter-elite. When in reality its all just a big facade. Using this statement is catering to a specific group of people, and it alienates another group of people. We need to encourage critical thinking, not mob-mentality knee-jerk reactions. And using a Donald Trump catch phrase does the opposite. Like it or not, he took that phrase and you will be associated with him when you use it.

       Also, WTF happened to the Roy Moore post and why was it removed from the front page?

       I don't get why Republicans are even pissed. Even if this means a Blue Midterm nothing will change. Last time they had power all they did was pass a conservative healthcare plan that was pro-business. And then the GOP even gets to look good doing what they do best, stalling.

       Mods working hand in hand with shills. You'll see them banning and deleting and flagging other people's reasonable posts but when you get something that is apolitcal, well, look at the count, 9K votes, as if that is not suspicious as fuck.

       Despite breaking Rule 10, this post will stay up and remain locked, with the following explanation:
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods have decided to remove
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7jgfye/roy_moore_has_lost_no_matter_what_your_political/">
        OP's linked post
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The "misleading" flair concerns the editorialized title, in which OP felt it necessary to accuse a significant number of people of being pedophilia sympathizers.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, comments with 500/600+ upvotes were excoriating the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       community.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of opportunities to discuss the election in Alabama on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , the removal of a single (rule-breaking) thread won't stop anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       To clarify, as the sub continues to grow, the #1 post has a potential to reach the front page of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       . When that occurs, it's important that it's a post with integrity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Posts that hit #1 receive exponentially higher exposure, and therefore much higher standards of moderation. This is why only the #1 spot sometimes receives flairs that you don't see anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no reason the mod team should be expected to police
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       post.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's up to the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       users to determine what's worthy of discussion by the power of the up/downvote.

       Never have I ever seen such a vehement response to a conspiracy theory from the media like we did with pizzagate. If I had a nickel for every time someone said it was a debunked theory without actually providing any debunking I would have a lot of fucking nickels.

       James Alefantis own behaviors online are what lead people to learn about "cum panda" and to document this behavior. theres plenty of different and independent sources for you to choose from, as provided in the google search link.

       This thread isn't about James Alefantis. It's about Roy More.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sit down right here and let Pappy tell ye a story. You see, Ol' Roy had an itch that ladies his age juuusst couldn't scratch. So Ol' Roy got it in his head to go 'round Alabama and start talkin' to the young ladies. All sorts of 'em. He'd meet 'em in malls, outside of custody hearings, or maybe even at cheerleading practice. Wheeew boy, he sure loved them cheerleaders! He even built up quite a reputation for it in some places. They even kept files on 'em in the mall! But don't be too quick to condemn the man. That's just how it was in Alabama back in those days.

       Pizza Gate has no real evidence to speak of. It has no alleged victims. No one has come forward about Pizza Gate. James Alefantis hasn't been accused by anyone but neckbeards on the internet.

       This case is similar in a lot of ways to the Michael Jackson case. There are a lot of bells and whistles going on, even victims coming forward, but in the end Moore will be found not guilty. (Though there will not be a trial, that much is certain.) Like I said, all of this hasn't been about any of the victims; just Moore's seat. This case will continue to be about that, and now that Moore is out, it will be completely dropped and forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, it makes me sick to see this shit going on. If Roy even is a pedophile, just think about how long people have sat on that info... Three decades!! That should be the first red flag that all of this theatre isn't about justice... He's going to get off Scott free, but Jeff Session's investigation has been slowed, so that's all that matters to TPTB.

       I implore that you check out Ben Swann's video about Pizzagate. They tried to remove it from the web for a reason. There is so much more evidence thing James Alefantis and David Brock to something malicious than there is in the Moore case; it's breathtaking. Especially after you find out about Alefantis' death threats towards a known PG youtuber and then consider how Swann was almost completely removed as a presence from the internet at the same time...

       What about the second girl with the note?  The one who Roy Moore didn't ever meet until the note came out and then suddenly they changed their tune to "well this is only evidence that he's a friend of the family."  So if he's a friend of the family then he did meet the girl so why did he lie about it?  What's the point in lying if you have nothing to cover up?  Moore, himself, when he was on Hannity's show, couldn't even deny that he was pursuing high school girls when he was in his 30s.  The best he could do was say that he never went after a girl without asking for the mother's permission first.  To ignore this shit and handwave it away is silly.  If Moore was a democrat there's no way people who say "fake news" about Moore's accusers would be saying that.  If he was a democrat everyone who supported Moore would be supporting the accusers.  It's partisan hack shit.
