<p>so this is analogous to a virgin describing sex to someone who has actually had sex?</p>

<p>obviously this person has not had a religious experience, or else they would not assume everyone who has had one is delusional </p>

<p>would you mind explaining the symbolism of the symbols on the back of a one dollar federal reserve note? </p>

<p>I&#39;m sincerely curious what you think of the symbols </p>

<p>Basically, people want to see the world as ordered instead of chaotic so they make up a powerful figure that&#39;s controlling things behind the scenes in order to make the world seem more ordered and controlled. For some people, this is &quot;God&quot;. For other people, it&#39;s the Illuminati.</p>

<p>so, in all of your time spent in school, it never occurred to you that the periodic table of elements had an interesting order to it?</p>

<p>do you think the &quot;order&quot; outlined in the periodic table of elements is &quot;made up&quot; by knuckle-dragging illiterates? </p>

<p>or is the periodic table of elements actually a real, scientifically observable phenomena?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy</a></p>

<p>the creature doubts the existence of his creator. how quaint </p>

<p>not sure why you don&#39;t believe in the existence of the illuminati</p>

Why is there minutes of TS audio from Apollo 11 after they landed? Why have numerous people come forward and stated Neil and Buzz encountered craft on the surface? Why did Neil and Buzz perform a masonic ceremony on the surface?</p>

<p>firefighters can only get about 20 minutes out a bottle of air in 2017, and those bottles of air are heavy and require exertion just to carry the weight of them, which in turn lowers the length of time you can use the air in the bottle </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well you see, during the height of the vietnam war, it became evident to our leaders that it was of the utmost importance to precisely measure the distance to the moon </p>

<p>it was a matter of national security to put reflectors on the moon, so that the distance could be measured with a laser</p>

<p>never mind the fact that MIT had been measuring the distance to the moon with a laser since 1962, with no need for a reflector</p>

<p>so they would have us believe that we have the technology to have a laser track a reflector that is so small that you can&#39;t even see it with a telescope, </p>

<p>and that in spite of such precise tracking technology, the reflector was still necessary </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure you understand the point of retro reflectors. The reflector spits back a hundred times as much light as the surface of the moon does. So saying something like &quot;it&#39;s ridiculous to think they can track a reflector but not the moon&quot; just shows that you don&#39;t understand how they work. It is literally a hundred times easier to get a signal off those reflectors than it is to get one off a part of the surface of the moon. </p>

<p>So yes, the moon&#39;s distance was measured with a laser prior to the moon landing, but the signal from diffuse reflection is so minute that it&#39;s not possible to get good accuracy. Retro reflectors increased reflectivity and by doing so also increased the accuracy of measurements. They also allowed facilities with less powerful lasers to do the same experiment. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not even that difficult to do. My university has one. If you point the laser at one of the reflectors, you get a huge signal back. If you point the laser at any other spot on the moon, you get nothing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>there is no plausible reason for retro reflectors. MIT had been successfully measuring the distance to the moon with a laser without the use of any artificial reflector since 1962 </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment</a></p>

<p>and before the invention of the laser, astronomers ha pretty much already measured the distance to the moon, for all practical purposes. </p>

<p>according to the literature about the laser measurements, the ground underneath the laser moves up and down with the tide</p>

<p>presumably making measurements about as accurate as if you were set up on the high seas </p>

<p>contrary to media spin at the time, measuring the distance to the moon down to a gnats ass was not actually a matter of urgent national security. </p>

<p>bear in mind that the backdrop to the Apollo moon landing distraction was the USA getting defeated in the Viet Nam War</p>

<p>the problem with your fabricated narrative about your university bouncing a laser off of a reflector, is that there are no reflectors on the moon, because no man has ever set foot on the moon</p>

And as you can see there are also some alterations given by the +/- so if dedicated scienctists are still not 100% sure how fast it expands then you ask us?</p>

The idea of a moon base is maybe not the worst idea, but i think in time there will possibly new developments regarding efficiency of space ship/rocket drives, which then when the project of a moon base is finished only bring very small effort in contrast to the money spent.</p>

<p>At least i think, we have some more problems here on earth to solve. Scientific exploring of the space via satellites, unmmaned space ships and huge telescopes is okay, but well we still have a few major problems here on earth to solve (climate change, growth and feeding of world population, the always growing waste of our consuming culture, etc.). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both scenarios seems possible. I just lean a little more on the it happened but was fudged. Those flag photos for example. Could be that the &quot;copy/pasted&quot; between two negatives/prints...so it&#39;s really a &quot;moon flag&quot; but not where it originally was. Just my 2 cents. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong. Russia currently participates in ISS fakery. Blowing the whistle about the Apollo hoax would have had no benefit, as it would have been promoted and dismissed as wartime Communist propaganda. It would have been far more beneficial to blackmail the US, which they did. </p>

<p>BTW. all those people that went into the Stasi prisons would say you&#39;re joking too.</p>

<p>Also all those deputy wars also happened because cold war was real.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s time for you to open your eyes and increasing the bandwith of your narrative a little bit. Keeps me wondering all the time, why you conspiracy theorists always stay focussed on the US solely and then make some worldwide conspiracies out of this stuff.

<p>lets say you were driving uphill at 25MPH, and you killed the engine, </p>

<p>would you expect to &quot;coast&quot; uphill for another 200 miles, without consuming any fuel?</p>

<p>in your car, is more fuel efficient to burn fuel at a constant rate by using cruise control, or to take control of the accelerator and vary the speed?</p>

<p>Instead, what you should do is calculate the energy density of the fuel in a booster, and compare to the necessary gravitational potential energy you&#39;d have to overcome. You&#39;ll find that there&#39;s plenty.</p>

<p>so, as the potential energy increases, the kinetic energy decreases? that sounds reasonable</p>
