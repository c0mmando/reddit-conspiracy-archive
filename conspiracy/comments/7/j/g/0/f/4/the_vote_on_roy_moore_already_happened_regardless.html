       You raise some good points. What gets lost nowadays(especially in the age of zero tolerance) is context. Context is everything.

       Jerry Seinfeld was in his 30s and dated a girl who was 17 or 18. It sounded creepy at the time but they got married and are still together many years later.

       It was the Clinton machine that mastered projection and started lining up the women against every political opponent.
       <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2017/11/roy_moore_gets_the_herman_cain_treatment.html">
        Moore’s accusers issue the boilerplate caveat that if the charges are true, he should exit the public stage immediately in shame and certainly that is true. Then they quickly throw him under the guilty-as-charged bus that just ran over his presumption of innocence.

       It's all by design and it's all so painfully obvious. As I say in real life, no one is going to change their mind about their politics due to conversation. That goes doubly so for some random shit on the internet.

       That’s the thing that really says to me this is all a setup. If these women were truly assaulted or harmed in any way, these stories/ accusations would have come out a long time ago. The same with other allegations against various political opponents. It’s all so very apparent, I surprised more people aren’t noticing the pattern.

       He never married that girl.  He dated her until she was 21, and then they split.

      <p>
       His current wife was 28 when they married, he was 45.  So really the same difference in age, but there is something about getting close to the magic age of thirty that makes the age difference less creepy to most people.

       Corfman was 14, she's the only one who alleged that he got physical with her while she was under age.  As for the story "falling apart", it's down to a Breitbart article that claims three errors in reporting by WaPo that they spin to mean it discredits the whole story.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         One is that WaPo reported she was at the courthouse at 14 when she met Moore while her mother was there for a custody hearing.  The result of that hearing was such that her mother gave up custody to her father and had 12 days to comply with the custody agreement. Her father lived further away from Gadsden, so this means the abuse likely occurred within that 12 day period.  Not impossible, although Breitbart seems to believe two "dates" within 12 days isn't possible or is somehow unlikely.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The other was that Corfman says she called from her "bedroom phone" but her mother, who is 71 now, claims she didn't have a phone in the room.  Doesn't negate anything about Moore's actions, and could be a misremembered fact by either Corfman or her mother.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Breitbart takes issue with the fact that Corfman said she met Moore when he, "picked her up around the corner from her house in Gadsden", but Breitbart looked at a map and it wasn't literally around one corner, but about a mile away and across a street.  So, picking fights with common phrasing.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Wendy Miller was 14 when he first "met" her while she was working as a Santa's Helper in the mall, and then like a real creep, he waited two years until he started hitting on her.  Her mother wised up to his and wouldn't let her see him.

       My biggest complaint about all of this is the timing. 1 month before a special election to give the Republicans extra power and this pops up. With no evidence. From 40 years ago. From questionable people. Seems too perfect.

       The timing is absolutely because he was running for Senate.  When you hit the national stage, that's when people dig into your past, they'll find your shit.  This isn't a new phenomenon.

       Wrong. WaPo was down there covering the race because it has national implications. Nobody outside of the state cared when he was running to be a judge. Despite that, the local media had heard rumors for years.

       And on an even smaller scale, he was known around his hometown as a creepy lecherous dude.  The stories of the local sheriff knowing who he he was, stories of the mall keeping an eye out for him.  That's insane behavior and not just a nice Christian man going on old timey dates with young ladies.

       Don't try to be logical or reason with these people. You will get nothing except PEDO/TRUMP/MOORE...YOU!!!

       It's a defined strategy and they aren't going to stray from the script. You can't reason with unconditional hate.

       You're seeing them throw everything at the wall that they have. They are fighting for literal survival at this point lest their crimes come to light.

       For a subreddit that really hammers hard on anti-pedophilia, once again, comes an impassioned defense of a child molester.
      </p>
      <p>
       You won't believe it, but here's
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/woman-says-roy-moore-initiated-sexual-encounter-when-she-was-14-he-was-32/2017/11/09/1f495878-c293-11e7-afe9-4f60b5a6c4a0_story.html">
        one woman's account
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me highlight the part that bothers me.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Leigh Corfman says
        <strong>
         she was 14 years old
        </strong>
        when an older man approached her outside a courtroom in Etowah County, Ala. She was sitting on a wooden bench with her mother, they both recall, when the man introduced himself as Roy Moore.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Okay, so your claim of 16 doesn't hold up.  Let's have another highlight:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        drove her about 30 minutes to his
        <strong>
         home in the woods
        </strong>
        , told her how pretty she was and
        <strong>
         kissed her
        </strong>
        . On a second visit, she says, *
        <em>
         he took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes. He touched her over her bra and underpants, she says, and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear. *
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Gross, but maybe she liked it?  As you claim, he had the permission of her parents and it was consensual.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “I wanted it over with — I wanted out,” she remembers thinking. “Please just get this over with. Whatever this is, just get it over.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Doesn't sound like explicit permission.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's another winner:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Wendy Miller
        <strong>
         says she was 14
        </strong>
        and working as a Santa’s helper at the Gadsden Mall when Moore first approached her, and
        <strong>
         16 when he asked her on dates
        </strong>
        , which her mother forbade.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That was nice of him, to wait two years before he started asking her to hang out.  What a gentleman.
      </p>
      <p>
       And before you try and say she's an actor, or a Dem party plant or just some libcuck who's out to destroy a good Republican man:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Corfman, 53, who works as a customer service representative at a payday loan business, says
        <strong>
         she has voted for Republicans in the past three presidential elections, including for Donald Trump in 2016
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But why did she did this now and not any time in the last billion years since this happened?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        She says she thought of confronting Moore personally for years, and almost came forward publicly during his first campaign for state Supreme Court in 2000, but decided against it. Her two children were still in school then and she worried about how it would affect them. She also was concerned that her background — three divorces and a messy financial history — might undermine her credibility.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So she almost did, but didn't think it would be heard before now.  National stage changed that, more people listening.  Less of a concern for her children, as they are older.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, tell me how this isn't a problem, he's a good dude, and that's just how you found dates back then, then make sure to be absolutely blind rage furious the next time a Democrat does something you can feel sanctimonious about.

       Wow. You make a good point.  Everything you posted is vile.  No doubt.
       <br/>
       Now, tell me how it has anything to do with my OP? You're making the case, "hey dude, it happened to a 14 year old."  Based on what?  That a few people claim "THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED, I SWEAR".  So what?  Is what you posted, if it happened at all, wrong?  Absolutely.  How does that make someone a pedophile?  Read the title.  It's about how everyone has labeled Moore a pedophile.

       Are you kidding me?  He went out on a "date" with a girl two years below the age of consent, the "date" consisted of a drive to his house where he groped her until she demanded he stop.  Then he drove her home.

       What ever happened to dinner and a movie?  Also, I think it MIGHT BE illegal to molest someone under the age of consent.  Ask one of these PizzaGate professionals on this sub, they know a lot about the age of consent.

       Youre spot on my friend. Most dont want to admit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And thank you for recognizing the objectivity of this sub. Others use it as slander but I agree, this sub is about people who think. conspiracy = hypothesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway back to what youre saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Elvis Presley married Priscilla at 14?
      </p>
      <p>
       It was far more acceptable to date younger women back then. And oddly more 'damaging'.  Why it changed? I think the feminist movement is in competition with this framework. Those in power are harmed. I digress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why more damaging then than now?
      </p>

       Teenagers were more innocent. It was still acceptable but an older man could more aptly take advantage of a younger woman.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not at all today. Women and men are much more sophisticated, as well the stigma about premarital sex is basically gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is 100% not pedophilia. It is Ephebophilia - attraction to 15-19 year olds. Given the popularity of 'teen' in porn searches its a natural urge. An 18 year old male or female looks far better than a 50 year old. They look better b/c they are better mates, more likely to be healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today who is the more dangerous partner? A 45 year old or a 19 year old?  Also there is a lot of sexism involved. If its an 18 year old woman with a 40 year old shes a victim. If its an 18 year old male then hes a hero.  This implies that 18 year old women are weaker and more susceptible to ... whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, it is a form of bigotry regarding legal adults. (not illegal)  If two legal adults, regardless of age, choose to be with one another why shouldnt they?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can shoot and kill for your country, vote, smoke, drive, have children, have a dangerous job like coal mining, murder and be sentenced like an adult but intercourse is beyond that persons rational decision to have intercourse if it involves a person X years older.

       Invariably the objection is based in morality and no discernible articulable harm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Opposition to blacks dating whites is based in morality. Objections to homosexuality is based in morality. None of them have discernible articulable harms.

       If a 30 year old just so happened to be in love with a 16 year old, that's creepy. If a 30 year old seemingly seeks out teenagers ,exclusively to "search for his soul mate", that's predatory.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, you should tell a 30 year old to fuck off if he said he was in love with your 16 year old daughter. Most parents would. My mom would have whooped his ass.

       Fucking, thank you. The defense of this bullshit is insane. It might not be illegal, but if you have a 14-16 year old daughter and some 30+ year old motherfucker is creeping on her at the mall, or her school, or where ever, that's disgusting.

       You've got the OP, who claims that Moore was just going on nice old time dates with these girls. You've got another poster commenting on how ebhebophilia isn't bad, don't worry about it, it's natural, like that somehow excuses the law.

       It's because they've got a personal stake in this argument. Women their own age won't fuck them so they seek out girls whose brains aren't fully developed and want to look mature among their peers. The girls in my school who dated guys out of high school thought the guys wanted them because they were "mature" for their age. No. The older guy is mentally and emotionally stunted. They have more in common with a teenager, they can't keep up with women their own age and they can't manipulate them. Can you imagine being a 30 year old guy and one of your friends shows up to a party with a 16 year old? Can you imagine how your ~30 year old girlfriend would feel? My mom switch would flip on and I'd ask that girl if she needed help or something. It's absolutely ridiculous to imagine a 30 year old dating a 16 year old. It's disgusting. It's a gross feeling when this kind of thing happens.

       Spot on about the girls who dated older guys. Same shit happened when an older guy wanted to hang out with high school kids, he'd give you weed and booze and you'd be like, "This cool older guy thinks we're cool!"
      </p>
      <p>
       But he's actually just a gross old creep who can't handle people his own age, so he preys on young boys and girls. It's disgusting.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also explains why these girls didn't say anything way back then, they thought it was flattering. An nice older guy was into them when their own self esteem was at an all time low going through puberty, etc. I bet that feels great.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you get older, you wise up, you see dudes hanging out at the mall looking for girls who are young and you realize what's going on.

       See, you saw the same thing as I did in high school. It's more common here in AL for 30 year olds to creep on 16 year olds than it is for a 16 year old to date a 30 year old.
      </p>
      <p>
       I look at my husband and I'm like, he has nothing in common with a 16 year old, most people our age don't. His friends and family would ask him what the hell was wrong with him if he was with a 16 year old girl.  We see them as annoying kids who should get off our damn lawn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like you said, some girls and boys are flattered when they're given attention by adults and thinking an adult sees them as mature enough to fraternize with does give them a self esteem boost. That's the very nature of grooming.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's predatory, it's gross. The "it's natural to be attracted to a teen" argument is so weak. We're not cavemen having babies at 14 and dying at 30. It's just a transparent way for perverts to make themselves feel normal. I can't imagine the constant inner conflict.

       This whole thing has been a silly distraction.
The dude's not a pedophile that we know of based on any accusations even if they were true which we don't know either. It happened 30 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       The girls all are post pubescent. That means he is not a pedophile of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any guy will tell you they have seen an attractive girl and then backed off because they learned she was younger than they thought. They didn't stop finding her attractive, but they are aware that she is very unlikely mature enough. Unless she is an actual pre pubescent child or looks like one they don't back off thinking they are a pedophile.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people spreading that message are really stretching the term, same as they did fascist/nazi. Luckily this time it kind of bites them in the and and splits the sect of the left because there are parts of the left that actually defend real instances of pedophilia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Roy Moore maybe hit on teens when he was 30 thirty years ago, and maybe not. I wouldn't support him because he is a nutty evangelicon. The other guy sucked too. This whole push though is dumb and incorrect. Thirty and 40 years ago it was less taboo than the last 5 years when Anthony Weiner did the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's crazy how the media and black and white extreme thinking has been pushed and fomented more division.
      </p>
      <p>
       Save the label of pedophile for the actual pedophiles, there are plenty of them out there.
