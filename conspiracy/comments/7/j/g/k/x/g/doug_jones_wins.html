<p>I thought for sure Roy Moore had it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct.</p>

<p>People are too comfortable and until they stop having food on the table, there won&#39;t be any changes.</p>

<p>The other problem is that the US is too big. Germany turning into Nazi Germany wasn&#39;t that impossible, because Germany is about the size of Texas. But you&#39;d need tens of thousands of people to care of business to pull a revolution off here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you truly want change, you have to get rid of the politicians and the media. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve already seen how powerless the president is without backing from his party. It doesn&#39;t matter what he does - they are trying to screw him over and the people voted him in legitimately, so they are basically saying no to the people. And we&#39;ve seen what happens when outsiders run for the house/senate, which would help him - they assassinate his character and do everything they can to make sure he doesn&#39;t success.</p>

<p>The media controls the people. They are literally convincing people that boys can be girls, all white people are racist, people from other countries have more rights than us citizens do, amongst other things. </p>

<p>The only way you could fix this under the current system is martial law. The military would be the law and can suspend habeas corpus. And the problem is by doing that, you&#39;d be going against what America is all about - destroying freedom of speech and knocking off legally elected people.</p>

<p>The US is headed to it&#39;s own destruction right now.</p>

<p>Second, since the all Repubican federal government, Congress, the Presidency, and the U.S. Supreme Court, and you know for a fact that was stolen, the all Republican government doesn&#39;t need martial law to deploy law enforcement any way they choose to do so. </p>

<p>I&#39;m as ambivalent towards martial law as the next conspiracy buff, but people should be able to express their points of view here. That&#39;s the whole point.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The voting machines in a totally red state like Alabama re controlled by the people in Roy Moore&#39;s party so it would be very odd if that is a claim.  </p>

<p>I do half expect there tob be precincts s close there are requests for recounts and wouldn&#39;t be surprised if &quot;uncounted ballots are found.&quot;</p>

<p>Remember the 2010 Wisconsin election . . . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you truly want change, you have to get rid of the politicians and the media. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve already seen how powerless the president is without backing from his party. It doesn&#39;t matter what he does - they are trying to screw him over and the people voted him in legitimately, so they are basically saying no to the people. And we&#39;ve seen what happens when outsiders run for the house/senate, which would help him - they assassinate his character and do everything they can to make sure he doesn&#39;t success.</p>

<p>The media controls the people. They are literally convincing people that boys can be girls, all white people are racist, people from other countries have more rights than us citizens do, amongst other things. </p>

<p>The only way you could fix this under the current system is martial law. The military would be the law and can suspend habeas corpus. And the problem is by doing that, you&#39;d be going against what America is all about - destroying freedom of speech and knocking off legally elected people.</p>

<p>The US is headed to it&#39;s own destruction right now.</p>
