       Holy fuck.

      <p>
       I thought for sure Roy Moore had it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I should be relieved that
       <em>
        more than half of Alabama doesn't want a pedohile in office
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       But for some reason I feel uneasy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just that I distrust democrats. I trust republicans less. But Trump I have some trust for, at least that he is the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

       Just look at T_D. It’s already started. They’re blaming everyone but the shitty candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soros, bussing voters, Strange, McConnell, Allred etc. they can’t understand the fact that ignoring the alleged sexual misconduct most people don’t want someone who has done half the shit Moore has representing them. Kinda hard to win an election when you say nobody but white males should be able to vote.

       Lol these are the kind of things that were brought up by democrats when Trump won. I don't think that was a concern over there and no one questioned the results when it was in their favor.

       Those tactics work. It also helped that Roy Moore was a bad candidate. I have no idea if any of those allegations are true.

       Next up the democrats will win the primaries and take back the House then impeach Trump and convict him in the senate.

       Yeah pretty much. The only question that matters is: are the American people prepared to do what is necessary? The answer right now is no. And it has been no for quite some time. Until that changes, Roy Moore losing or the primaries or Russiagate or any of this crap is just utterly meaningless and a huge distraction.

       The other problem is that the US is too big. Germany turning into Nazi Germany wasn't that impossible, because Germany is about the size of Texas. But you'd need tens of thousands of people to care of business to pull a revolution off here.

       Which is why the elites approach of incremental change towards a scientific dictatorship is more or less infallible. It should have been stopped ten twenty thirty etc years ago and people keep adapting to the change and slowly and slowly accepting one less right here and a new tax there and mass surveillance there etc.

       If you truly want change, you have to get rid of the politicians and the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've already seen how powerless the president is without backing from his party. It doesn't matter what he does - they are trying to screw him over and the people voted him in legitimately, so they are basically saying no to the people. And we've seen what happens when outsiders run for the house/senate, which would help him - they assassinate his character and do everything they can to make sure he doesn't success.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media controls the people. They are literally convincing people that boys can be girls, all white people are racist, people from other countries have more rights than us citizens do, amongst other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way you could fix this under the current system is martial law. The military would be the law and can suspend habeas corpus. And the problem is by doing that, you'd be going against what America is all about - destroying freedom of speech and knocking off legally elected people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US is headed to it's own destruction right now.

       I think you have listened too much and observed too little.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, Trump didn't win the election, it was stolen with successful voter suppression.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, since the all Repubican federal government, Congress, the Presidency, and the U.S. Supreme Court, and you know for a fact that was stolen, the all Republican government doesn't need martial law to deploy law enforcement any way they choose to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you are vague about what you expect to be done if martial law is declared, but you suggest the action will be race based.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where are you drawing the line, will we all be subjected to genetic testing, what percentage of "colored," blood are you expecting to be allowed?

       The suspension of the right to habeas corpus must he suspended in order to enact martial law. Even in the civil war the supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional to do so when the civilian courts can still function.

       Haha no doubt! I mean if you can't tell I place no stake in politics, I was more just trying to find the good in the situation; i rally thought Alabama was gonna knowingly elect an alleged pedophile. I was simply surprised when they didnt.

       Also I was curious to see if anyone had any information on how this would affect the Trump getting impeached pink elephant.

       This whole thing kinda backfired on trump.   By making sessions AG , the gop grip on the majority loosened just a little bit.  This may come back to haunt them.

       If you truly want change, you have to get rid of the politicians and the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've already seen how powerless the president is without backing from his party. It doesn't matter what he does - they are trying to screw him over and the people voted him in legitimately, so they are basically saying no to the people. And we've seen what happens when outsiders run for the house/senate, which would help him - they assassinate his character and do everything they can to make sure he doesn't success.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media controls the people. They are literally convincing people that boys can be girls, all white people are racist, people from other countries have more rights than us citizens do, amongst other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way you could fix this under the current system is martial law. The military would be the law and can suspend habeas corpus. And the problem is by doing that, you'd be going against what America is all about - destroying freedom of speech and knocking off legally elected people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US is headed to it's own destruction right now.
