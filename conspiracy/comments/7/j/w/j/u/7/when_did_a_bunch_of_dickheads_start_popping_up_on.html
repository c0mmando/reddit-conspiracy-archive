<p>If someone takes the time to write out a legit self post, I may downvote if I disagree. But if they are offering their own personal philosophy and put a lot of effort into crafting a nice self post that reflects what this community believes in, I&#39;m not going to shit on them and insult their character. unfortunately, I&#39;ve been seeing some of that recently...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think shills are here just to cover up false flag investigations, bury pizzagate, and protect Monsanto. I think they are also here as part of a demoralization campaign. </p>

<p>Real users, if someone makes a post or comment and you agree with it, you need to speak up and let it be known in the post/comments somewhere. The shills get paid to comment, and they always seem to dominate the comments section, which is part of them trying to control the narrative of what the community supports here. </p>

<p>Those guys usually weren&#39;t as aggressive as the shills that work for the political parties, which is probably what OP is experiencing.

<p>Oh absolutely. It&#39;s so effective too. I&#39;d love to see detailed, thought-out self posts get more love. Interesting links are great, but it&#39;s people&#39;s original research that really makes this sub shine, more often than not.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been trying to focus on upvoting high-effort self posts. I posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6mia1b/a_tale_of_two_chiefs_was_dc_police_chief_cathy/">one</a> here once, many months ago, on a controversial topic, and didn&#39;t even get trolled by shills, just downvoted to obscurity without anyone even having the balls to articulate why. Not gonna lie, that successfully discouraged me from posting my own in-depth research here. That&#39;s probably true of a lot of people, and that&#39;s a shame. </p>

<p>This is absolutely happening, shills want to destroy communities that don&#39;t parrot a narrative that they are told. They don&#39;t need to push propaganda, that&#39;s hard to do. It requires constant disinfo and the truth is always at risk of being revealed, so instead they just fuck with people&#39;s minds so they don&#39;t know what to believe, or which communities can be trusted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A question...</p>

<p>How do you know what &quot;the community supports&quot;, if you characterise any comment you disagree with as being from a &quot;shill&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The shills get paid to comment, and they always seem to dominate the comments section</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But for all you know, none of those people are actually &quot;shills&quot; and &quot;the community&quot;, as you put it, actually disagrees with you.</p>

<p>See, that&#39;s the problem with people like you... you assume the fact you&#39;re in the minority is a result of &quot;paid shills&quot; rather than simply being in a minority.</p>

<p>Your reading comprehension skills need work.</p>

<p>I never said anything like &quot;conspiracy sub users are a minority&quot; (although they clearly are). I was talking about the claim that &quot;shills dominate the conversation&quot; which appears to be nothing more than &quot;anyone who disagrees with me must be a shill&quot;.</p>

<p>Totally agree. They&#39;re basically gangstalking. </p>

<p>Just for fun I go to r/politics from time to time to see where I can insert a bland, non-partisan, but dissenting comment, and I get pummeled with downvotes and insults. Twice now I&#39;ve had people &quot;out&quot; me as a conspiracy theorist, and insinuate that means I have no credibility. Both times the commentors would have either had to have crept through pages of my comment history, or used a analytic like Snoopsnoo to figure that out. It&#39;s deliberately creepy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If everyone would just use a cordial tone with one another and not be dicks, we could fight off the shills. They&#39;re not here to convince us of a specific viewpoint, they&#39;re here to pollute the waters so that people who come by to lurk and read about interesting things get turned away by the vitriol. I don&#39;t care if shills counter signal theories I tend to agree with and I would never call someone a shill just for being for or against a certain theory. It&#39;s how they express it -- not by making an argument but by hitting you with sarcastic one liners, derision, and snark. They don&#39;t want you to start pulling up sources and arguments, they want you to start a slap fight about who is the shill.</p>

<p>IMO we could even get to a point where the mods could start handing out temp bans and warnings for being intentionally mean. It&#39;s a hard thing to enforce and the shills would stir up a shitstorm if they saw it coming, but I actually don&#39;t think it&#39;s ridiculous for a board to enforce some basic decorum. Especially when it&#39;s such a target for shilling. </p>

<p>There are thoughtful, intelligent ways to convey a point of view and to do so respectfully. But that&#39;s the new age, isn&#39;t it? To &#39;screw thy neighbor&#39;. Laughing at others misfortune and insecurity, the culture of ridicule.</p>

<p>Was it Joe Rogan who said(paraphrased off memory) &#39;It&#39;s much cooler to be the one to say when something is wrong or inaccurate&#39; - that is, opposed to proving what something is.</p>

<p>It&#39;s idiotic and a simpleton perspective, but that&#39;s not surprising from Joe Rogan, he doesn&#39;t strike me as a very wise person.</p>

<p>You may be very accurate with your thoughts. Maybe it is about morale!</p>

<p>But I think many of us can agree, it&#39;s also about disinformation, isn&#39;t it? Like Alex Jones. Maybe 75% of what he says(on a good day) is accurate, that&#39;s what makes him dangerous! That disinformation is laced with truth.</p>

<p>ONLY deal with this subreddit by clicking on &quot;new&quot;.</p>

<p>ONLY comment on posts you get to via clicking on &quot;new&quot;.</p>

<p>The rest is what it is, but it won&#39;t be the best parts of (a) what this subreddit is or; (b) what you can contribute to the truth of this subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still lots of shitting on Republicans, but also shitting on democrats, and less propaganda in general. There used to be more support for 3rd parties and election/voting reform, agreement that our 2 party system was failing and both sides sucked.</p>

<p>Threads about things like different voting methods and the unfair debate system were more common, those are just examples but you can see how thats different from what we see now. Iirc most people were in support of things like Snowdens whistleblowing, which is much more mixed now.</p>

<p>Heck, most of these things are true for all of reddit, not just politics. I think it&#39;s slowly been shifting to this state and will probably only get worse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No... you&#39;re right... he just said &quot;shills dominate the conversation&quot;, implying the majority of comments are made by &quot;shills&quot;.</p>

<p>I simply pointed out that he has literally no way of knowing whether a comment was posted by a &quot;shill&quot;, but he assumes that there must be shills because he disagrees with their comments and they &quot;dominate&quot; the conversation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not possible that his views are a minority... it must be &quot;paid comments&quot; posted by &quot;shills&quot; to &quot;control the narrative of what the community supports&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth is, I doubt there are <em>any</em> shills here. Trolls maybe. Shills, no.</p>

<p>Who would pay someone to post comments on a subreddit most  reddit users, let alone the public in general, never even bother to visit?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a form of self-aggrandisement - a belief that their opinion is so important that corporations and government are actively trying to suppress it. The reality is, they couldn&#39;t care less.</p>
