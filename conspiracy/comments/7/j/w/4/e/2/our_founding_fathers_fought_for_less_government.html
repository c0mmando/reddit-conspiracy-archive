    <div class="md"><p>From the research I have conducted, it would appear the founders of America were of the same mind-set of those we today fight against, except they had honour.</p>

<p>They decided to let people choose: can you govern yourself or will you beg for the fetters of government.</p>

<p>It was chosen for us long before we were born and this entire system needs to bite the dust and be replaced with a truly 21st century alternative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a bit more complicated than that. Even the FF&#39;s themselves were split on the roll of the Government. This is where the first parties arose, as differences between men like John Adams and Alexander Hamilton lead to a split with men like Jefferson and Madison, and resulted in the creation of the Federalists and the Democratic Republicans. Should the government provide infrastructure projects? What is the role of taxation? Should there be a central bank? All of these issues were fought for, supported by, and fought against, by various prominent FF&#39;s. To say they were all for &quot;no government&quot; is a bit of oversimplification. </p>

<p>Washington, for example, sided with the Federalists and decided that Federal Taxes should be used for Internal Improvements under what was then called the &quot;American System&quot;, which called for public funding of roads, bridges, canals, and other pieces of infrastructure that would facilitate commerce and connect the colonies. Then, Jefferson and Madison reacted against people like Hamilton, who favored an incredibly powerful executive and the creation of an American Aristocracy to dominate the Senate. </p>

<p>What was needed was a compromise between the two, which this county managed to keep finding with well known names like the Missouri Compromise and the Compromise of 1850, which though both dealing with slavery, showed how important the concept of compromise was to the young Republic.</p>

<p>Long in the short, this debate has raged since the Founding Fathers themselves ruled this country. Anyone on the Left or the Right could find ample support for their cause in the various writings and opinions of the Founding Fathers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what you are getting at is less the &quot;American Project&quot; and more the nature of Republics themselves. At its core, a Republic is a diverse collection of classes, races, and various groups that choose to come together and compete, peacefully, within the framework of the Republic. Politics arises from this peaceful competition, and it dies, with the Republic, when this competition becomes violent.</p>

<p>Politics break down when these groups factionalize, joining together some against another because they have lost faith in the Republic itself and its ability to represent them. Violence inevitably follows. This was how the Roman Republic died, and it is how most Republics die. Will 21st century America be able to overcome a factionilzing of its power groups and a break down of politics? I do not know. As you said...people just fuck everything up. </p>
