        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Talk about a mindfuck...</p>

<p>It&#39;s moments like these that leave you in awe at how effective the social engineering and programming is. If you think hard enough, you can trace how it all developed from the beginning.</p>

<p>It had to have started with a small group of sociopaths, thousands of years ago, probably even before spoken language was developed, who considered themselves superior and intelligent to the rest of the group. Like most animals do, these humans seemed to have deemed themselves worthy to hoard the majority of the resources for themselves. </p>

<p>As time progressed, their means of control evolved and expanded, but it had to have all started with this one group of people. Then they developed schools and hidden societies through which their offspring could be taught to perpetuate their system of control. </p>

<p>Fast forward to modern day. Highways cluttered with cars, thousands of people walking from block to block to their &quot;jobs&quot; in the big cities as if they&#39;re on autopilot. It baffles me that this all emanated from one small, tightly nit and secretive group over the course of a few hundred or so years. </p>

<p>When you observe all of this stuff happening, and you walk amongst these people, do you ever pause to consider consider how vastly different your reality is from theirs? </p>

<p>This reality is all most of those people will ever know. And when you really think about it, the only reason we are still subjected to this slavery state, is because the majority of them just aren&#39;t able to see that they are being vampirized by the system. </p>

<p>I think their stranglehold of control on us really began to take hold in the early 1900&#39;s. The first era in history where certain men (Rockefellers, Ford, Morgan) had a wealth that rivaled entire countries.</p>

<p>I gotta be honest, I&#39;m not exactly too sure where I&#39;m going with this, but I feel like maybe if people had a picture of how this all developed, maybe it would seem less &quot;intimidating&quot; to them. At the end of the day, whether or not these people succeed in their global government, humanity still ultimately prevails. We have created some of the most incredible and inspiring art, and developed technological advances far beyond anyone&#39;s comprehension. It&#39;s the elite&#39;s that steal <em>our</em> labor and creativity, and use it for their own benefit. Remember, they have no creativity or ingenuity of their own. These type of people that advocate for global government and suppressing humanity are not clever or intelligent themselves; they simply use the work of <em>actual</em> visionaries and intelligent/creative people to forward their own goal. </p>

<p>Bottom line, they can be beaten. I promise you all this. So, don&#39;t get discouraged and don&#39;t give up. Shit can be depressing sometimes, and we all need to pick each other up and help each other develop a positive mindset on the world, so we can keep pushing forward. I truly believe we are on the heels of a new, modern day renaissance, a massive global awakening. The internet has allowed for this &quot;global conversation&quot; between the world&#39;s population. </p>

<p>Keep pushing, good things ARE happening, and don&#39;t let anybody fucking convince you otherwise.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>While there was indeed the Cult of the Divine Augustus, it was reinforced quite selectively based on the Emperor, and was far more prevalent in the Eastern provinces which had a history of divine kingship. It wasn&#39;t until after Diocletian took the throne in 285 CE that one sees the trend towards a more divine monarchy, defined by a system called the Dominate, in opposition to the system put in place by Augustus which maintained Republican facades, the Principate. </p>

<p>Diocletian withdrew from the Public, fully instituted the Imperial cult, wore a diadem, and ruled in the fashion of the Eastern monarchs of yore, which was vastly different than the Augustus styled model of the &quot;First Citizen&quot; who worked with the Senate to allow for a smooth function Imperial Bureaucracy. It was this divine Caesar aspect which was transferred to the Eastern Imperial Court at Constantinople and would define the relationship between Emperor and People in Byzantium. </p>

<p>This statement itself is highly uninformed. This is why I highlighted the difference between the <em>Principate</em> and the <em>Dominate</em>. The Romans themselves were <em>always</em> distrustful of Monarchy. Augustus instituted the Imperial Cult hesitantly, it grew more fervently in the East, where as I said, there was a tradition of Divine Kingship from Persia and Egypt, from which Alexander fashioned himself.</p>

<p>Augustus&#39; own Propaganda painted Marc Antony and Cleopatra as Eastern despots in the Pharonic fashion, which was a highly revolting concept to the Latin elite of the West. A Roman Emperor could only become truly divine after his death, when granted such honors by the Senate. As I said, this as well as the Imperial Cult in life were selectively enforced. For example- Tiberius did not enforce nor demand the Imperial Cult be enforced at all, and it fell by the wayside except in parts of the East. It wasn&#39;t until later emperors, like Claudius about 7 years after Tiberus&#39; death, needed more legitimacy, that he re instituted the cult. And Claudius was refused divine honors by the Senate after his death.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Constantine was already fairly modern Christianity at that point, I just think you are off base on this</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t say Dicoletian was the model for early Christianity. I said he was the model for the Eastern style divine Emperor, which he was. It was his practices, of complex Court ceremonies, withdrawal from the Public, wearing a Diadem, and enforcing fully the divine status of the Emperor, that later Emperors after 285 would emulate and that would define the role of the Emperor in the East. This was the system of the <em>Dominate</em>. The key difference between this and the <em>Principate</em> was, as highlighted in my other comment, that the Principate was trapped in Republican norms. Even as Augustus instituted the Imperial Cult, he did not act like a Pharaoh. He acted as a Princeps, the &quot;First Citizen&quot;. He sat in on the Senate and sought to paint himself as an equal. He clearly was not, but power was <em>not</em> flaunted like it was by the Pharaohs. Doing so would not have kept Augustus in power for long. There is a key change in Emperors and how they defined themselves after Diocletian. I didn&#39;t just make up the words Principate and Dominate. They are very important to understanding the subject. </p>

<p>First of all, I never claimed Claudius was a late Emperor. I used him as a specific example because he came to power shortly after Tiberius and Caligula, who ruled after Augustus. And he was in apposition to Tiberius&#39; position of not keeping up the Imperial cult. Second, Augustus and Diocletian weren&#39;t 1,000 years apart. Augustus died in 14 CE, Diocletian took the throne in 284, that&#39;s a 260 year difference. Third, Trajan ruled in the 2nd century, with the 5 Good Emperors, at the height of the Pax Romana. He wans&#39;t a &quot;late&quot; Emperor at all.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not really over simplifying though. As a culture they had a tendency against setting ones self up as Divine. This is why the Emperors were only deified after death by the Senate. That&#39;s how it was. Only in the East were they worshiped as living gods. In the West they weren&#39;t considered Gods until their deification after death. That&#39;s not over simplifying, that&#39;s actually have a nuanced understanding of Roman culture lol.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The emperor was <em>not</em> based on the Pharaoh, or on a divine position. That is why I keep trying to explain the Principate and Dominate. The Emperor inherited his legal powers during the Principate from the offices and titles granted by the Senate upon his ascension to the throne. He did not rule as a divine god-king like the Pharaoh. He may have used the Imperial Cult, and been worshiped as such in the East, but in the Western provinces that simply wasn&#39;t the case, as I have already highlighted. Augustus did <em>not</em> make citizens in the Western provinces worship him as a living god. They did that in the East, and in the West he was worshiped only as a pseudo-divine figure until after hi death. And again, this practice depended entirely on the Emperor.</p>

<p>You seem to have an understanding of some Roman history, but trying to tell me I lack it, when you have glaring inconsistencies in your own understanding of the Principate, Dominate, legal justifications for Imperial Rule, and the cultural tendencies of the Romans themselves, means you shouldn&#39;t be telling anyone they don&#39;t understand, and it&#39;s kinda funny. </p>

<p>It had to have started with a small group of sociopaths, thousands of years ago, probably even before spoken language was developed, who considered themselves superior and intelligent to the rest of the group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My investigations have lead me to a slightly different conclusion. Same end result, different beginnings. First, humans discovered farming. We were always spiritual creatures, as evidenced by ritual burial, and Venus Statuettes going back 50k+ years to the dawn of our modern consciousness. Eventually, Priests, likely sincere and well meaning, realized they could use the auspices of the gods to direct large scale communal projects. This is likely how the first large scale irrigation projects began in Southern Turkey/Northern Iraq 9k+ years ago. Eventually, we discovered metal working. This was the sea change. Once weapons could be created, a warrior class emerged. This warrior class subverted the Priests and became the first &quot;divine kings&quot;.</p>

<p>Also important to note that warfare didn&#39;t really develop until we had surplus from farming, then humans actually had something to <em>fight</em> each other for.</p>

<p>That being said, I had a similar epiphany when I recently visited NYC. Walking through Central Park, surrounded by hundreds of people, I just listened to all of their conversations. A lady walking her dog. A mother talking to her child. A woman talking about work over the phone. Me and my Friend had a conversation, amidst all of this, about the commodification of America, and the fact that everything seems to have an ad on it nowadays, and about how this country has been completely sold out to Corporate interests. And everyone just carried on with their day. Surreal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really does, this same theory took me from capital L Libertarian free market fanboy to a classical libertarian (polar opposite on the political spectrum) rather quickly. Bookchin does an excellent job illustrating how these systems of hierarchy evolved from their initial, simple forms to our modern, ineffably complex world order. Along with the philosophical musings about how power corrupts absolutely, it forms a very compelling account that explains an awful lot.</p>

<p>When do you think this happened?</p>

<p>It was a gradual process that generations of hunter gatherers didn&#39;t even realize they were participating in. It began with wild cereals that they would pass by every year. When they learned they could utilize it to make a sort of grain pancake, before they even invented flour, they made sure to pass by these stands seasonally. As time went on, they began picking the seeds and without realizing it participated in a selective process which gradually domesticated the wheat because the seeds they picked, over successive generations, created a plant that needed its seeds plucked in order to grow more. This lead slowly but surely to the first villages practicing rudimentary agriculture. And this process began after the end of the last ice age, and was completed in a form of farming we would recognize about 9k-10k years ago, circa 8,000 BCE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to go digging through JSTOR to pull up articles, but according to very respectable and well documented academics and evidence.

<p>You can say &quot;the Academics are lying!&quot; but you realize how incredibly insane that would be, to assume that hundreds of thousands of archaeologists and anthropologists are lying about their discoveries?  I can understand being skeptical about the 50k+ year old graves, there could be errors in strata and in dating. But to say that we don&#39;t have well documented evidence of tombs and graves going back at least several thousand years is ridiculous.</p>

<p>The Iliad was written in the 8th century BCE and vividly describes the cultural memory of war, death, and burial from a generation born 700 years before it was written down from the oral record. That alone shows that the concept of death, graves, and tombs goes back to at least 1500 BCE. </p>

<p>You have no response to my personal evidence concerning the Iliad. What of it? It is a 2700 year old poem detailing 3500 year old cultural experiences, and describes death, battle, and burial. There is no debating that. Like I said, I can understand being skeptical of the 50k+ y/o graves, but to say our civilization hasn&#39;t existed for several thousand years? Ridiculous.

<p>This is true, but many many billions have bought into <em>their</em> system, and these people will defend it to the death, because it is all they know. This is why I don&#39;t see anything short of total economic collapse/nuclear war as the catalyst for the change we need. Like in Star Trek- Nuclear Holocaust lead the planet to unite, abandon money and a monetary based culture, and strive to live for each other in their quest across the stars. This system is literally what civilization is built upon. Millennia worth of generations have been indoctrinated. That won&#39;t go away overnight.  </p>

<p>I just wanted to comment here and leave this Kropotkin quote, since OP mentioned &quot;small groups thousands of years ago&quot; levying this control over us:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In our civilized societies we are rich. Why then are the many poor? Why this painful drudgery for the masses? Why, even to the best-paid workman, this uncertainty for the morrow, in the midst of all the wealth inherited from the past, and in spite of the powerful means of production, which could ensure comfort to all, in return for a few hours of daily toil?</p>

<p>The socialists have said it and repeated it unwearyingly. Daily they reiterate it, demonstrating it by arguments taken from all the sciences. <em>It is because all that is necessary for production – the land, the mines, the highways, machinery, food, shelter, education, knowledge – all have been seized by the few in the course of that long story of robbery, enforced migration and wars, of ignorance and oppression, which has been the life of the human race before it had learned to subdue the forces of Nature.</em> It is because, taking advantage of alleged rights acquired in the past, these few appropriate today two-thirds of the products of human labour, and then squander them in the most stupid and shameful way. It is because, having reduced the masses to a point at which they have not the means of subsistence for a month, or even for a week in advance, the few can allow the many to work, only on the condition of themselves receiving the lion’s share. It is because these few prevent the remainder of men from producing the things they need, and force them to produce, not the necessaries of life for all, but whatever offers the greatest profits to the monopolists. In this is the substance of all socialism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. Honestly every time I leave the property, to the store, post office, concert, etc. I am struck that I am surrounded by people who (through no real fault of their own other than ignorance or self preservation/denial) are completely oblivious of the state we are in.</p>

<p>I have tried. It&#39;s no use. The people who are not slaves at someones else&#39;s hand, accept being slaves.</p>

<p>The 100 people society microcosm parable is what did it for me. The different sectors and material streams and the few people who pit the others against one another to control the outcome to their own advantage.</p>

<p>Multiply that by 75 million.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you step back and look at it, all the systems in place are kind of crazy. Take the five day 40 hour working week and the concept of the weekend in the West. It gets drilled in from such an early age that we accept like it&#39;s almost a natural law. <em>Saturday and Sunday are the weekend and they are different from the other days.</em> </p>

<p>Entire chunks of population are shuffled into being debt and wage slaves for their whole lives, fattened up on the opiates on prime time TV and social media. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we&#39;re on the heels of any global awakening sadly. Social media is as good an opiate as any and as widespread. Cellphones keep people busy, clicking away, caught in a cycle of engagement and gratification. The concept of things like healthcare being a right rather than a commodity that profits corporations is still actively resisted. The environment is carved up for big business and any resistance is either ignored or shut down by the police. </p>

<p>Look at the big nations. If anything they&#39;re becoming even more slanted towards the elite and the system. Occupy Wall Street and the concept of the 99 versus the 1 percent now seems like a quaint memory in the face of new tax laws designed to reward the elite. </p>

<p>I think there was a point in the 1960s and early 70s when it looked like there might actually be some sort of social revolution against the post-war industrial era, but that got co-opted and shut down as always. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you honestly believe that people are oblivious to the fact that they are debt slaves? Take some time off of Reddit and social media and go out and talk to people about this. You&#39;d be surprised to find out how many people are very well aware of this. While I think the underlying message of your statement makes a lot of sense, that there is a large network of super wealthy corporate and political elites controlling the global economy, there is a lot of history you are glossing over. And you also assume the same group of people have been in control for centuries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And when you really think about it, the only reason we are still subjected to this slavery state, is because the majority of them just aren&#39;t able to see that they are being vampirized by the system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OR the majority of people need money to survive and provide a comfortable life for their family. So long as things are going OK, they aren&#39;t going to demand to tear down the system. But when the tipping point is reached and the situation becomes so dire for the average person, then we would see radical change. All revolutions have started this way. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think their stranglehold of control on us really began to take hold in the early 1900&#39;s. The first era in history where certain men (Rockefellers, Ford, Morgan) had a wealth that rivaled entire countries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are missing thousands of years of history. The Vanderbilts and Rockefellers in the late 1800s, is not the first time a few select people had wealth that rivaled entire countries... The Romans, Chinese Dynasties, the British Monarchy, the Egyptians. History has been a long tale of winners and losers, subjugators and subjugated. Who is in power has shifted throughout human history and will continue to shift. But what will always remain the same is that a small group of people will have the power, and the rest won&#39;t. </p>

<p>We all live in the machine. Just because you&#39;re cognizant of it doesn&#39;t set you free from the simple obligations you need to meet to eat and have shelter in this world. It&#39;s still a rat race and money still matters and will impact your quality of life. </p>

<p>Sure, for the time being we all have to abide by these rules. But that doesn&#39;t mean we have to accept them, and can&#39;t brainstorm as to another way to sustain life.

    <div class="md"><p>It really does, this same theory took me from capital L Libertarian free market fanboy to a classical libertarian (polar opposite on the political spectrum) rather quickly. Bookchin does an excellent job illustrating how these systems of hierarchy evolved from their initial, simple forms to our modern, ineffably complex world order. Along with the philosophical musings about how power corrupts absolutely, it forms a very compelling account that explains an awful lot.</p>

If their name doesn&#39;t convince your they&#39;re evil, their actions easily could, so I oppose any systems that put people like those cretins in power.

<p>We have tombs going back 5k+ years, and graves going back 50k+, in which we have found evidence of ritual burial with jewelry and possessions. Are you suggesting that humanity has not been around for that long? Or even for several thousand years? </p>
