    <div class="md"><p>This has officially freaked me out! That means that the phones are not just listening for a &quot;Hey Siri?!&quot; Quary. They&#39;re listening to every.single.word. and cataloging it. WTF?</p>

<p>Sure, I heard of big brother snooping. But I thought it was just the government monitoring for &quot;national security&quot; threats. That didn&#39;t bother me and I see it as a way of life, in this day and age. But for fucking FB to be listening and using it against me to market it to me in this manner? This is out of control. </p>

<p>My wife once told me. One time she was searching for vacations in her iPhone and an hour later she stepped into her office, used her desktop, and ads for the same destination she was looking for on her phone were popping up with specials. </p>

<p>Could this mean that we all have user profiles that transcend all platforms (?)!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s tied in to google as well. 
Who has an gmail account? 
Maybe about 90% of everyone I know. It&#39;s not their only account but they have at least 1 gmail. Pull that in to your iphone and sign in to your home and office computer and it is aware of your activity. 
Your ISP is probably sharing everything with everyone all of the time too. It&#39;s not like you can even opt out. 
I feel like if I&#39;m paying for the device and the service, the privacy should come with it but the whole thing happened too fast and everyone is way too greedy and is probably selling you out for pennies. Apple, Microsoft,google,lg, android, comcast,sprint, verizon, AT&amp;T, - any hardware or software or service provider is selling you out. </p>

<p>How many if them come out and advertise that they&#39;re not selling your info? That&#39;s right none. Because they&#39;re all getting a piece of selling you out. Did you see that best of post earlier today about who gets your info? Everyone gets it. It can track you when your phone pings the tower. Televisions now have a camera that faces out that&#39;s hidden and is connected to the internet. 
The user profile does transcend all platforms and is for sale cheap. 
It&#39;s available to anyone anytime. 
It happened too fast for everyone to catch on...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;a random facebook user&#39;s post comes up on her timeline&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s not how Facebook works.  It was either:</p>

<p>A sponsored ad, which can be triggered by data mining across linked accounts.  e.g. You both use the same home wifi, you search for something on eBay, she gets shown an ad for ebay.</p>

<p>An actual user post, in which case she knows the person, and it&#39;s coincidence.  </p>

<p>You aren&#39;t being listened to.  This has been tested, trialled, and proved wrong.  You are, however, having your data mined every time you use the Internet, and there are a shocking number of ways that people can be linked together even without explicit interaction.  The post below about &#39;shadow profiles&#39; alludes to that.  You might not use these platforms, but your data can still be linked to people who do.</p>

<p>If I look at my wife&#39;s Facebook account, and go into the advertising settings, I can see the following deductions, purely based on content that she has interacted with.  She hasn&#39;t explicitly provided this infomation:</p>

<ul>
<li>The correct age bracket for her</li>
<li>The fact she has children, and their approximate age</li>
<li>Accurate guesses at hobbies</li>
<li>Location</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to disagree with the “not being listened to” idea until i had my own experience that made zero sense. A couple months ago my parents were talking to me on the phone about buying new stone slabs for a patio they were building. They described in detail the color and size they were using etc. I never once did my own search for any such products, not on my phone or computer. I also don’t share a WiFi network with them since i live in a different city. Literally the only connection i had to this product was listening to my mom talk about it on a phone call. Two days later i had ads on Facebook for grey stone patio slabs. Nothing like that had ever once shown up on anything i use. How do you explain that happening?</p>

<p>I once ran into a co-worker randomly on a flight from Denver to east coast</p>

<p>but if I thought of it it wasn&#39;t that big of surprise
1) both work same company
2) company HQ out east
3) both travel for meetings sometimes</p>

<p>Your facebook feed is based on things you like/suggestions/friends.  If your wife likes your shit, then your constant liking of dodgecoins could bleed through</p>

<p>it is odd you say random because unless its an add or someone you follow, facebook isn&#39;t that &quot;random&quot;</p>

<p>We do know these devices aren&#39;t constantly listening. People have looked.  The constant listening part of a echo or a phone &quot;okay google&quot; is on the local system. Those bits aren&#39;t being sent.  The local phone can&#39;t translate either. . .it has to say what you say AFTER the command to a central system.  </p>

<p>Bottom Line - if it was always listening you would see the bandwidth use.</p>

<p>What you experienced wasn&#39;t listening</p>

<p>It was the equilivent of &quot;holy shit, I just bought that same sweater / had the same thought&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to disagree with the “not being listened to” idea until i had my own experience that made zero sense. A couple months ago my parents were talking to me on the phone about buying new stone slabs for a patio they were building. They described in detail the color and size they were using etc. I never once did my own search for any such products, not on my phone or computer. I also don’t share a WiFi network with them since i live in a different city. Literally the only connection i had to this product was listening to my mom talk about it on a phone call. Two days later i had ads on Facebook for grey stone patio slabs. Nothing like that had ever once shown up on anything i use. How do you explain that happening?</p>
