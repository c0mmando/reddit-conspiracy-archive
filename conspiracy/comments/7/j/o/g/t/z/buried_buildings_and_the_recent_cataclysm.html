       The name of our sub is tongue and cheek as experts want you to believe that soil can build up 10+ feet in less than a hundred years, because people forgot to sweep their streets.

       I hope that we can all dig into our local history and see if we can find the evidence of "cultural layer" in our areas.

       there are many different aspects to this theory. the evidence seems to indicate an event happening sometime in the 17th century and possibly continuing into the 19th century. In other words possibly some kind of biblical destruction and then subsequent winds carried this layer across the land over the next few decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       (thats just one hypothesis credit to sibved.livejournal.com)
      </p>
      <p>
       But possibly not as long as we think because there seems to be further evidence that the recent timeline has been artificially stretched and historical figures completely made up and others duplicated to fill in the non existent times

       Lol I'm sorry to cast shade on your "conspiracy" but I think it's horse shit. Like literally. 
And I find the conspicuous lack of this as a possible cause quite concerning.
      </p>
      <p>
       &lt; "By the late 1800s, large cities all around the world were ‚Äúdrowning in horse manure‚Äù. In order for these cities to function, they were dependent on thousands of horses for the transport of both people and goods.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1900, there were over 11,000 hansom cabs on the streets of London alone. There were also several thousand horse-drawn buses, each needing 12 horses per day, making a staggering total of over 50,000 horses transporting people around the city each day.
      </p>
      <p>
       To add to this, there were yet more horse-drawn carts and drays delivering goods around what was then the largest city in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       This huge number of horses created major problems. The main concern was the large amount of manure left behind on the streets. On average a horse will produce between 15 and 35 pounds of manure per day, so you can imagine the sheer scale of the problem. The manure on London‚Äôs streets also attracted huge numbers of Ô¨Çies which then spread typhoid fever and other diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each horse also produced around 2 pints of urine per day and to make things worse, the average life expectancy for a working horse was only around 3 years. Horse carcasses therefore also had to be removed from the streets. The bodies were often left to putrefy so the corpses could be more easily sawn into pieces for removal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The streets of London were beginning to poison its people.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this wasn‚Äôt just a British crisis: New York had a population of 100,000 horses producing around 2.5m pounds of manure a day.
      </p>
      <p>
       This problem came to a head when in 1894, The Times newspaper predicted‚Ä¶
       <strong>
        ‚ÄúIn 50 years, every street in London will be buried under nine feet of manure.‚Äù
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This became known as the ‚ÄòGreat Horse Manure Crisis of 1894‚Äô.
      </p>
      <p>
       The terrible situation was debated in 1898 at the world‚Äôs first international urban planning conference in New York, but no solution could be found. It seemed urban civilisation was doomed." /&gt;

       It would be nice if these buildings had addresses or names. I think most of them were designed to be like this and explanations for each unique situation would be more readily apparent if we could look into them. Partial basements and prominently exposed foundations with half windows copying the next floors up have been common architectural techniques for a long time. I don't think substantial full basements were even a common thing until modern times. And cities change. Wars and fires happen, filling land in and building over old things happens. Even in modern north american cities the roads keep rising as they've built layers of asphalt over layers of bricks over wooden roads. It's an interesting idea but I think it just comes down to cities and architectural trends changing over time. Would be open to looking at some more specific examples. Some of these buildings are magnificent enough to have names. The dark blue one at the top looks like it belongs to a compound like Catherine Palace or something similar.

       Is it not possible that because they building a were built a few hundred years ago, the builders didn't out in deep enough foundations? Or is that too rational? Lol
