When the backlash hit he claimed he was donating it to the family but it seemed scammy to me considering that&#39;s the account the MMA fighter contacted and, when he thought he was talking to Keaton&#39;s mom, they turned down his invitation to some UFC thing but asked him to RT their GoFundMe, saying how Christmas is coming up and she&#39;s a single mom. I really want to know if he does know the family or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I don&#39;t think so. The whole incident is creepy to me but basically the video was bait for virtue signalers...who ate it up, of course, BUT THEN they found out about the Confederate flag and that gave them access to extreme levels of self-congratulation comparable only to someone masturabating themselves to sleep.  An irrisistable (but entirely natural) trap for virtue signalers.  A tar pit.</p>

<p>Disgusting, but not conspiratorial behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless something new developed today (I was driving all day) there is absolute no proof his family is racist like they are accused of being. I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re definitely not but I spent about 4 hours on Twitter trying to find proof of this and all I saw was
-Pic of some other kid holding confederate flag while Kearon held the American flag 
-One dude that appears to have started the rumor that Kearon was bullying black kids and cried when they fought back (judging by the 34k RTs I am guessing it&#39;s the originator) but doesn&#39;t offer proof
- One or two people who said she had posts quoting rap songs that say &quot;nigga&quot;
-One comedian who claimed to have seen a video of Kearon calling kids &quot;niggers&quot; but when people asked for the link he was all &quot;lol idk&quot; (I think he saw that joke tweet &quot;Keaton on his weekends&quot; where it was a different kid with a southern accent calling people &quot;niggers&quot;.</p>

<p>Meanwhile you got his little sister tweeting about how hot mixed and black guys are while following and RTing black athletes.</p>

<p>So did something new pop up? Because I was absolutely disgusted at the way adults on Twitter were making fun of a kid.</p>

<p>The whole thing is a shitshow, not the least of which his mom couldn&#39;t think past her own nose to realize Kearon now has to deal with his crying video being online for the rest of his life. </p>
