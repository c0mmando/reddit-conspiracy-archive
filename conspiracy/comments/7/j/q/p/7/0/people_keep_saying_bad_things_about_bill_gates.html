    <div class="md"><p>First, why do we have a society that thinks it is ok to funnel money to a select few. Then when some of these obscenely wealthy people realize that they’ll never be able to spend all their money and they decide to start giving it away, we applaud. The thing is, then they decide how to give it away. So then, Bill Gates decides to spend a lot of money on vaccines, no one asks Bill when he got his medical degree or his degree in public health? </p>

<p>Why do we think rich people are better at deciding how to spend our money on? Because Bill was clever enough to buy an OS off of another developer, slightly improve it and then convince IBM to give him a sweet licensing deal? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2012/08/bill-gates-world-needs-fewer-people/">here</a></p>

<p><em>Both Bill and Melinda Gates repeatedly have said there are too many people on earth.</em></p>

<p><em>“This was made explicit by Melinda Gates in 2011 when she commented that ‘government leaders … are now beginning to understand that providing access to contraceptives is a cost-effective way to foster economic growth,&#39;” Christian Voice said.</em></p>

<p><em>Said the report: “So what exactly is the relation between contraception and economic growth? The connection is simple: fewer people = more resources.”</em></p>

<p><em>The link to the concept that fewer people would make the world better came when Gates suggested vaccines as one method of reducing the world’s population.</em></p>

<p><em>Gates made his remarks to the invitation-only Technology, Entertainment and Design 2010 Conference in Long Beach, Calif. His February address was titled “Innovating to Zero!”</em></p>

<p><em>He presented a speech on global warming, stating that CO2 emissions must be reduced to zero by 2050. Gates said every person on the planet puts out an average of about five tons of CO2 per year.</em></p>

<p><em>“Somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero,” he said. “It’s been constantly going up. It’s only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all. So we have to go from rapidly rising to falling, and falling all the way to zero.”</em></p>

<p><em>Gates presented the following equation: CO2 (total population emitted CO2 per year) = P (people) x S (services per person) x E (average energy per service) x C (average CO2 emitted per unit of energy)</em></p>

<p><em>“Let’s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero,” he said. “Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero. That’s a fact from high school algebra.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Discussing the “P,” or population portion of the equation, he stated, “Let’s take a look. First we got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. That’s headed up to about 9 billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent”</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>vaccine propagandists claim that vaccines eradicated small pox, but this is a dubious claim since only about 10% of the population was ever vaccinated. some people believe that the name &quot;small pox&quot; was merely changed to &quot;monkey pox&quot; and declared eradicated </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ixquick.com/do/search?query=small%20pox%20monkey%20pox">https://www.ixquick.com/do/search?query=small%20pox%20monkey%20pox</a> </p>

<p>rinderpest is another disease allegedly eradicated by vaccines </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinderpest">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinderpest</a></p>

<p>so that makes a grand total of TWO diseased that vaccines have allegedly eradicated</p>

<p>and yet they blame anti-vaccine activists when vaccine programs fail, in spite of anti-vaccine activists being active during the small pox and rinderpest campaigns </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll explain:-</p>

<p>Rich people can avoid paying their taxes by instead donating the money to &#39;charity&#39;.  </p>

<p>The problem we have is the definition of &#39;charity&#39;, many things can be dressed up as &#39;charity&#39;.  Billionaires setup their own &#39;charity&#39; funds so as they can control exactly where that money goes to.  </p>

<p>Gates has many different investments too, so he can use his charity foundation money (which is really the money that he would have had to pay in taxes) to help his other investments by buying products from business he invests in.</p>

<p>Gates likes to market himself as throwing his money away, in reality the money wouldn&#39;t have been his as it would have been for government taxes.  We only have to look into the dirty and ruthless tactics he has used with Microsoft to realize who we are dealing with; definitely not someone who to help the poor.  </p>

<p>His father was head of planned parenthood and wanted the population down, Gates also wants the population down, his excuse is &#39;climate change&#39;, but that&#39;s just an excuse as climate change is very easily debunked as the regulars here will know.  The world elite want to reduce the world population to under 500 million, as it will be easier to control them than the billions with have now.</p>

<p>Vaccines are one method of covertly sterilizing the unsuspecting masses, the WHO and UNICEF have both been caught red-handed sterilizing in the Third World under the guise of various vaccination programs.  Interestingly Bill Gates even admitted the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUJMR3BUm2s">true purpose</a> of the vaccines he sends to the Third World, as when a person is proud of something it can be hard not to brag.</p>

<p>Fortunately India has worked out what he&#39;s up to, they&#39;ve had to ban his <a href="http://naturalsociety.com/bill-gates-faces-trial-india-illegally-testing-tribal-children-vaccines/">foundation for poisoning children with dangerous jabs</a>.</p>

<p>So now he&#39;s definitely not a nice guy, all smoke and mirrors.</p>

<p>&quot;Consent forms to administer the HPV vaccine were ‘illegally’ signed by wardens form youth hostels, showing that the Gates’ prey on the indigent without parents. For those who had parents, most were illiterate, and the true potential dangers of the vaccines were not explained to them.</p>

<p>SAMA, an organization in India which promotes women’s health discovered this insidiousness, and reported it, but only now will Gates and his cronies have to answer for their misdeeds. Approximately 120 girls reported epileptic seizures, severe stomach cramps, headaches, and mood swings, of those who did not die. Other girls receiving the Gardasil vaccine have experienced infertility.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>&quot;The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation declared their little vaccine project a total success. I guess the Supreme Court of India will decide that now.&quot;</strong> Ya, its a success... Sigh. </p>
