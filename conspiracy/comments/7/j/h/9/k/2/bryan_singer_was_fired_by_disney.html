       When the talks of this merger broke, I couldn't help but think about that "Foisted" episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm because of Bryan Singer.
      </p>
      <p>
       For years, Disney/Marvel had been trying to make  nickel and dime intellectual property deals("let us use Galactus from Fantastic Four and we'll agree to a Daredevil rights extension) with Fox with zero success.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now all of a sudden Fox is the party pushing for some deal??
      </p>
      <p>
       However this acquisition is beyond Fox's FF and X-Men franchises, which trips my theory that Fox wants to sell due to Singer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet at the same time, their X-Men division is having a lot of success. Why would you want to sell a golden goose like Deadpool, the highest grossing 'R' movie in film history?

       Singer produced and also had his hand co-writing, I believe. Decisions like having the team all wear one uniform in the first flicks, for instance, were all him and that grounded approach helped a set a precedent for more 'realistic' minded superhero films such as Christopher Nolan's Batman movies to be made. He did put in the effort, I'll give him that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I absolutely agree, he's expendable. Good news is that its catching up to him. Dude got fired while in the middle of filming a Freddy Mercury bio-pic. He's not directing the new X-Men, but I don't think his producing credits, as of now, are stripped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Across six movies and three filmmakers, only one director (Matthew Vaughn, X-Men: First Class) of these X-Men flicks hasn't been accused of sexual misconduct.

       Yeah, it's horrifying. A friend of mine had this belief for a couple of years that Singer was the target of some homophobic conspiracy and -to be honest- I wanted to believe that. Even choose to, if I want to be more candid. On paper, it looks really good that a gay director help spearhead a superhero series that's all about the goal of inclusiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kevin Spacey getting pretty much busted changed all that for both my friend and me. He and Singer owe each other their careers with The Usual Suspects and that guilt by association was one of the things that first popped in my head after Spacey sent that (laughable) tweet.

       From my understanding, Fox is trying to sell its
       <em>
        entire
       </em>
       entertainment division to Disney(although not sure about it's TV network). Which is odd to me because, box office wise, Fox has been on a roll. Doesn't make sense to me to sell when profits have been great. There has to be some ethical &amp; moral smoking gun that's caused the studio to stink up.

       Yeah but think of it this way, what hits have fox studios had recently? 2 biggest has been Deadpool and Logan. A Cure For Wellness,  Alien Covenant and X-men all under performed. Fox probably sees more money to sell than keep producing box office failures.
