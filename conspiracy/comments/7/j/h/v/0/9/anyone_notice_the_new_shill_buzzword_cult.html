But there&#39;s a clear new push against people who support trump on this sub and they are being labelled has being in a &quot;Cult&quot; first heard the word a couple of days ago off a obvious shill account and now it&#39;s being pushed alot by others. I&#39;m not pro trump I&#39;m impartial to US politics being from the UK. I can take a stance and watch how you&#39;re being divided by a higher up group pushing for division amongst yourselves it&#39;s really sad to see.  So eyes open people and keep an eye on this &quot;cult&quot; bullshit buzzword they&#39;re all using now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That post was gilded by somebody to make it look like a brigaded post.  The idiot sent a message about it.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m somebody that calls Trump supporters a cult.  Especially if they frequent t_d.  Basically, if you&#39;re still able to post there, you&#39;ve never questioned a thing he&#39;s done.  Which also means you&#39;ve abandoned pretty much everything he ran for yo still support him....but still support him.</p>

<p>Can you explain why you don&#39;t think it&#39;s an appropriate label?</p>

<p>Btw...I&#39;ve called Trump supporters a cult for over a year and I&#39;ve never made a shill dollar.  Please let me know if I can claim back payments somewhere.</p>
