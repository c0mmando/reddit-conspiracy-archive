       I get pissed off by politics being posted on this sub you can see that from my history.  But there's a clear new push against people who support trump on this sub and they are being labelled has being in a "Cult" first heard the word a couple of days ago off a obvious shill account and now it's being pushed alot by others. I'm not pro trump I'm impartial to US politics being from the UK. I can take a stance and watch how you're being divided by a higher up group pushing for division amongst yourselves it's really sad to see.  So eyes open people and keep an eye on this "cult" bullshit buzzword they're all using now.

       Gotta disagree - these people are hired because they are only good at being a snarky shit head on the internet, it's their only redeeming quality. Most are very good at it because well meaning people just can't help but respond. I've been guilty of it for sure. If things go south for them, they just delete the topic and/or their account and start over.

       There's a gilded post at the minute where it's been thrown around inside the comments check top today or something might show up. Someone said it in a comment to me the yesterday not tagging the user only lands me in trouble even though it was  obviously a shill account post history and comment karma was over 20k each after 20 days or something like that.

      <p>
       And I'm somebody that calls Trump supporters a cult.  Especially if they frequent t_d.  Basically, if you're still able to post there, you've never questioned a thing he's done.  Which also means you've abandoned pretty much everything he ran for yo still support him....but still support him.

       Can you explain why you don't think it's an appropriate label?

       Btw...I've called Trump supporters a cult for over a year and I've never made a shill dollar.  Please let me know if I can claim back payments somewhere.

       I just find it weird you've been going out your way for a year to hunt down trump supporters mate. Even have a label for them. Ive seen it floating around  alot past day or two in comments that's all I'm saying. Call them what you like. I'm just telling people an observation I've made.

       Cut the persecution complex. So, to you, arguing against propaganda and falsehoods parroted by Trump supporters equates to “hunting down Trump supporters”?

       They're obviously here. Don't take a genius to see it either. Their tactics are so see through. Think where one of the last subs still putting up a fight against them everyone else has caved in or been bought out.

       It's definitely a cult of personality. The term "Cult" is being used for its negative connotation, which is a shame, but it's not entirely untrue that there are some incredibly zealous Trump supporters.

       Cult of personality. The phrase has been around for a while. I think it aptly describes much of Trump's reamining followers. He's a strongman using propaganda to elevate himself with his base of support.

       Well, when people are literally so obsessed with a single person (like Trump supporters) that they take his every single word like gospel and willfully ignore facts, the constitution, and logic, it’s no surprise those people would be likened to a cult.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because they behave like a fucking cult. It’s that simple.
