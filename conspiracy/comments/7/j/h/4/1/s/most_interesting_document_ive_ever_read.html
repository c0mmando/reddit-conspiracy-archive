       This baby blew my mind. It really answers a lot of the questions I’ve been asking my whole (short) life. It’s 29 pages but well worth the read. Some of the main topics are the holographic creation of reality, the origin of consciousness, and the structure of the universe. It might change your view of everything. Enjoy 😬

       Consciousness is universal and eternal. We are basically a receiver of it; as an antenna is a receiver of a radio signal.

      <p>
       They have found effect ways to tune in to different fields of the universal consciousness by using advanced meditation techniques and some type of audio called hemi-sync... That's what I got from it.

       HOLY FUCKING SHIT everyone just skip ahead to points 26 and 27 and youll be blown away. It says other forms of life exist in our universe and we can communicate with them through out of body experiences (they probably say way more than that I just don't have time to read it all now)

       On one hand, you've got the Fermi paradox: Infinite universe yet we seem to be all alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, in such a huge universe you'd think there must be some other life out there somewhere. After all, we exist right?
      </p>
      <p>
       So one possibility is that we actually exist in a pretty limited number of dimensions (one temporal and three spatial). If there are more total dimensions than we can perceive with our sense, there could easily be forms of life existing at a higher level than what we can perceive.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is true, then the part about "we can communicate with them through out of body experiences" starts to make sense.

       There are quite a few around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       In China, many  taoist and buddha school paths.
In India and Tibet, buddhism and some of the hindu religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those paths usually use a combination of meditations, chanting and mudras to reach across the dimensions
In South and Central America, along with Africa, there are shamanistic paths that do so. These guys use ayahuasca,peyote and other natural drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im sure there are plenty of others out there I havent heard of.

       Don't get mad at OP simply because you haven't seen any of these concepts for yourself. Keep yourself open, and with some luck, you'll come to see the nature of things for yourself.

       There are these things you also have to sit around with called books. And while they have considerably more than 29 pages, and mommy used to read them to you, it's time you try it for yourself. Start with 29 and work your way up! I believe in you!

       If you have an hour or two, give this a watch - it's unreal how deep this guy is. The first half is from him and the second half was done by his wife after he passed. Between the PDF and this video, my entire view of the universe is upended, and for the better.

       It's a cool article, but their main thesis is that consciousness is a pattern of brain waves, and they use this interpretation (which is pretty controversial to say the least) to "reason" through out of body experiences used by the Gateway Project.
The reasoning is:
They say that electromagnetic waves oscillate in unique patterns in the brain which makes consciousness. In the instant these electromagnetic waves switch from "positive" to "negative" (picture a sin or cos wave), they are neither positive or negative. The author suggests that in that instant it exists outside our physical reality.
Meditation is a way to using breathing/audio tones/hypnosis to reverberate these waves in the skull so much that all these switching points are right next to each other (wish I could draw a picture). That would mean that your consciousness is permanently outside our reality.
Sounds cool, and his loose use of physics concepts sounds convincing, but three clear problems arise with this mechanism.
1. Reverberating waves interfere with each other, and wouldn't make this almost overlapping pattern.
2. When these "switching points" are really close to each other, that means the frequency of the wave is very high. Higher frequency means higher energy. At the point where the "switching points" are less than a plank length apart, the wave would be so energetic that it would make a black hole....IN YOUR BRAIN. Clearly not happening.
3. Heisenberg uncertainty principle says a wave's can't have an exact speed and exact location (not that we can't know it, that they CANNOT EXIST as two exact valves simultaneously). If you pinpoint wave to that exact switching spot, then you have no idea where the next switching spot will be (aka it's speed). So also think it's impossible to line up the brain waves like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope this clears up some on the theories of the paper and why they're wrong. Pretty good way to approach papers that discuss physics: less equations = less trustworthy

       Essentially they talk about the gateway process which includes hypnosis, transcendental meditation, holograms, expanding the human consciousness, the consciousness matrix, self cognition, space-time dementions, Torus, and others.

       So, then it seems that what's commonly referred to as a "break through" in other circles actually does contain relevant information to human consciousness and, frankly, the existence of everything in general, correct?

       Thanks for posting this. I'm still a little awestruck that this information is being given to me by a CIA document, furthermore one that was written over 30 years ago. I'm not sure how to feel about this tbh

       This was the 80s, imagine how much they've improved their techniques and research. If they "mastered" the human consciousness and know how to expand and control it, it certainly would explain a few thing going on in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is why they are suppressing our pineal glands, it's our third eye and if we can't expand our minds, we can't think for ourselves and are easier to manipulate.

       Synchronicity is most definitely not just "happenstance" (changed the quotes around on that one ;).  We humans and our brains are
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       limited.  We have lots of neural, synaptic sectors and abilities "shut off" that if activated would otherwise open our minds up to an entirely different world and way of being and thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are all connected - sparks in the eternal fires of the Cosmic Consciousness.  We are just so limited right now that most of us don't see or realize this truth.  Occasionally, we get some humans that are in fact a bit more open to the reality of the multidimensional existence we inhabit - and those individuals we usually marginalize in some manner, call crazy, imprison, lock in an insane asylum, and/or kill.

       To be honest, yeah! Ghosts, spirits, demons - whatever you wanna call them - are simply other conscious beings. Normally a human can't/is very unlikely to interact with these beings directly. They don't predominantly exist within this 3d expression the universe. They occupy space beyond the restrictions of what we recognise as time, at another frequency to that which our material 3d is based in. (They may be able to interact with the 3d, but we would not be able to recognise that from a 3d perspective, similarly to how from a 2d perspective you couldn't explain why or how the environment changed if it was changed by a 3d being.) When an individual human's consciousness is projected out of the body it enters this 5d "phase space" that isn't affected by time in the same way 3d matter is. Time, from this perspective, becomes another dimensional plane to be transversed through, over and across. You enter a higher dimension wherein multiple realities are existing simultaneously on top of each other and the boundaries between them are much more flexible and fluid. In these states it's possible to interact with other beings who either naturally occupy that space, or are also projecting their consciousness into it from a 3d reality. Some beings are "good", some are "bad" but most - like people - are simply individuals with a mixture of personality traits and characteristics based on what experiences they've been through. It's desirable for a human entering this space - especially one with a given task or mission to complete - to avoid any interactions with beings that would be negative/detrimental to the task at hand or ones own psyche. It's
       <em>
        very simple
       </em>
       to do this though: asserting your intention. If you make it clear that your intention is to avoid these interactions - especially within higher states of consciousness - then you will avoid those interactions. Consciousness is the underlying force that drives everything in the universe, so whatever you set your intention to, the world will shape itself around.

       I recommend anyone and everyone to read this document! It's absolutely fascinating! And as it explains itself in scientific terminology frequently it's relatively easy to follow. Unfortunately page 25(?) is missing and I don't think it exists on the Internet :( which is a bummer. But that doesn't matter. The rest of it alone is plenty enough.

       I am seriously saddened that page 25 isn't present.  The entirety of the document is fascinating, but just as it starts to bring the element of religion and spirituality into the discussion, we are left wanting.

       If what is being asserted in this document is true, and my interpretation of it is correct, then my thoughts would be that all of the conscious energy exists in the same place at the same time when projected into these different realities or dimensions.  I would suspect that the talking involved is more of an conscious energy transfer than actual conversation... telepathy, basically.  The author speaks to students in the project building a holographic projection around themselves to for protection from unwanted intrusions while projecting themselves.  My assumption is that you could interact with those entities that are in-line with your goals while traveling.

       I also had some serious blue balls at page 25. Spent ages looking for it on the Internet but it just ain't on here! But no worries! How much have you read about Buddhism or Hinduism? Because that's your entry point! Then take what you learn from those and apply it to what you read in the bible or the qu'ran. Then mix it all together in your brain and you come to a beautiful understanding of where religion started and how it got to where it is today. Everyone's arguing with each other, but they don't realise they're all arguing for the same thing. They're just seeing it differently to each other.

       I've not read much about Buddhism or Hinduism.  There was a world religion class that I enjoyed very much in college, where the professor did a great job of making it sound both interesting and appealing.  I believe that my best source of information of the philosophy of eastern mysticism has been Alan Watts.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are right on the money when you say that religion is generally arguing for the same thing.  It's shocking, really, how similar most of the major western religions are... the same root of faith.  It's really nothing more than a crippling spiritual monopoly.

       Check out itzhak bentovs stalking the wild pendulum for further background info, this document relies on this work most of the time. 
He also touches topics like reincarnation, your soul should be viewed separated from your body and only enters your body at birth to be able to gather experience in human form, until your body dies and the soul ultimately moves on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost like a driver entering and leaving a car. So in his opinion it is also possible to leave this car at will after a time of practice by using astral projection/remote viewing/obes.

       Well it corroborates with what shamans and certain spiritual texts have been saying for thousands of years. Not to mention that simulation and holographic theory, which have seen and stood up to significant scientific research in recent years, describe a reality and universe as described both in this document, and in spiritual texts.
       <br/>
       It's worth considering this may be disinfo, add the CIA has been known to put out disinfo before, but in this case I believe it's a legitimate study with legitimate findings.

       That's a very broad question. Any religious book (the bible, qu'ran, bhagavad gita), but it obviously depends on interpretation. Anyone who takes these books literally won't understand as they've gone through so many translations over thousands of years that some have ended up looking like story books about magic people with powers. I believe religious holy books were the early explanations of science/the universe/existence, but that due to the translations this message has been obscured. But have a read though of your religious book of choice under the premise that any references to gods and magic are metaphorical references to natural laws and universal properties.
       <br/>
       I don't know where to start on which shamans... That's quite broad and I've read/learned from a multitude of books and sources haha. I'd say either just go on YouTube and search up something like "shaman holographic theory" or something like that. Or have a read of Be Here Now by Ram Dass where he talks about his guru Neem Karoli Baba and how he explains that a crazy high dose of acid is basically a transcendental state. Honestly, it's not enough for me to try and explain it to you  especially through a reddit reply. It's best understood when you dive into this area of research yourself I think. But I hope I've provided something reasonably decent for you to go off!

       Okay I only read it once but I’ll try.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consciousness: overall from their research and data everything that exists is apart of “absolute.” The writer compares it to the ocean, with the deep unmoving depths being the absolute, the mid ocean being current heavy other dimensions, and the uneven surface being the physical world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Universe: basically the universe is one large torus, I can’t remember if it’s dual or not but there’s a white hole and black hole through which reality flows. It actually shows a diagram of where we’re supposed to be within this torus which was pretty cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reality creation: basically we are all energy fields (spirits) and our brains electromagnetic fields interact with the fields of the “absolute” which is somehow holographically encoded by our brain to create reality. (Don’t know if I even phrased that right).
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s much more in there buts that’s just a gist of the very interesting points made.

       This was found in their online record database so yes they’re irrefutable in their origin being the CIA. The information talked about is based on the research of others but it seems like they are taking I.T fairly seriously, imo

       I just started reading it. I'll let you know what I think! I'm already a believer somewhat in this stuff anyway. I would imagine if the CIA is documenting it, they have to be somewhat interested/taking it seriously.
