       It's funny how everybody's accused of being a pedophile until there actually is one, but it's a Republican. Really shows you how Pizzagate is primarily fueled by partisanship, not actually compassion for alleged victims or concerns for the country.

       is clearly an exchange between people in the comments (@joewills and @jimmycomet), and

       So your argument is that "chicken" is a term. Okay, it is. But you don't want us to notice that there is also a term for a "chicken" lover, and that it is not "chicken lover".
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there is a handkerchief code for chickenhawks. Since somebody mentioned handkerchiefs in the emails, well... You aren't going to make any connections yourself (since you can't), you just want to put that info out there.

       There exists a vast network of pedophiles at the top of government, business and entertainment. Because you don't want to check the sources and/or accept the conclusions of the linked article doesn't make that false.

       The post questions the amount of evidence for pizzagate vs. Roy Moore's pedophilia. Your statement that it's "false" that there is more evidence of the claims against Moore vs. Pizzagate has absolutely nothing to do with the article you posted.

       This post isn't even meant particularly to disparage Pizzagate, it's meant to point out the hypocrisy of so many people in the conspiracy community being so willing to accuse people on the left of being pedophiles, then suddenly doubting any/all evidence once it's a right wing politician.

He preyed on girls from single moms that couldn't look after them and/or working a food service job at 16 bc they need to support themselves already. Definition of a predator. Alabama....

       Evidence is what is used to corroborate witness testimony. Calling accusers "evidence" is therefore a form of circular logic. False testimony is literally one of the most ancient crimes we have recorded.

       Accusations are like farts in politics. Which is why so many people got caught up in PG. There was observable evidence of strangely worded emails, dungeons with "risky" "art" which can't be shown in public.
       <a href="http://washingtonlife.com/2015/06/05/inside-homes-private-viewing/">
        Pizza parties with the most powerful man in Washington
       </a>
       who has paintings of naked children also as "art" hanging in the home, along with serial killer inspired "art".  Obvious lies about CPP
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6utk8o/but_comet_ping_pong_doesnt_even_have_a_basement/">
        not having a basement
       </a>
       . And a dozen other red flags and objective pieces of spin, denial, falsifiable evidence and media coverup.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted PG may be the greatest psyop ever done. Perhaps they are all just into weird art, joke about aborting post-birth children for fun, and the video of Skippy abusing a child was manufactured to play along. Maybe the 7, 9 and 11 year olds that were
       <em>
        entertainment
       </em>
       for the hot tub were just going to sing or something. Who knows...
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you are part of their legion, it makes zero sense why you would invoke a comparison. It's terrible optics, it's bad logic, it's mental. You are grasping much harder to support an upcoming dem-vote than anyone involved in PG did, since PG was merely looking over swaths of leaked emails which at least appeared organically driven to most involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding "accusers" in any public forum is like finding contestants for a reality TV show. It hardly reflects reality however.

       oooh serial killer art. There was no evidence in pizzagate, and if you think that garbage you are regurgitating is evidence then take it to the police. Serioulsy go to the police and accuse the owners of comet ping pong of lying about their basement. If it is "evidence" as you state then they would investigate. If you have a video of podesta abusing a child,bring it to the police. Why all this blabbering, fucking do something about it. 
You won't because you know it's a load of bullshit

       What is interesting is how so many right figures were on board for him stepping down including Trump, then something seemed to happen and only the left was calling for him to stand down. I want to know what happened. Something came to light or a bunch of twats decided politics was more important than justice.  Could be either.

       Just politics. When this began there was plenty of time for another candidate to run in his stead, which the GOP would most likely have preferred. It's Alabama, they could run anyone who has the Republican label and says they hate abortion and they won't have any trouble winning. Once it became clear he wouldn't drop out they took the political route and doubled down. It's too late now for someone else to step in

       what happened was that trump and mcconnel and ryan all told him to step down so they could run someone else, and he refused. it sort of put them between a rock and hard place.

       Some people here have defended him and resolutely cast aspersions against his accusers and/or the circumstances of the accusations since the issue first arose. They often don't do it overtly as flag-waving Republicans because they want to retain nonpartisan status in the sub and/or plausible deniability about their motivations. It's transparent as fuck though.

       How can it be "partisanship" when many of us are not even yanks/american? All I've heard of this Moore guys is post like yours saying it's "all true". I've seen so SO FUCKING MANY creepy instagram accounts that are friends with the people suspected in PGate by following these accounts myself just by clicking on comments that I am permanently depressed. It's all true. It's fucking insanely sick. All I've heard of this Moore is complaints that "no one attacks him more" or something.
