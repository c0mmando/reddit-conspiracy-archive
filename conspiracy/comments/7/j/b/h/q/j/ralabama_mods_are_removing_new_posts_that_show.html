<p>provide any type of supporting evidence of your claims, would be a good start.</p>

<p>if they are being removed, you should have communications with the mods. screens of that should be enough.</p>

<p>i strongly suspect that, like most subs, they have their automoderator set to remove posts that don&#39;t meet certain criteria (such as having no karma in that sub, not being an approved site that can be submitted, or breaking one of their submission rules)</p>

<p>that&#39;s what is happening 99% of the time that people claim subs are &quot;censoring&quot; their posts. it&#39;s still a form of censorship, but it can be cleared up usually by just politely messaging the mods.</p>

<p>IF that is not what is happening to you, I would like to know.</p>

<p>They want him because he&#39;s a Clinton puppet and a stooge. Reddit is astroturfed by paid shills. The majority of Alabamans see through the propaganda want Moore to win. He will win as long as the uniparty doesn&#39;t cheat and steal the elections.</p>

<p>Already there are reports of voters being bussed around, with the people getting off the buses and refusing to talk to anyone who questions them. Reminds me exactly of what the uniparty tried to do during the 2016 presidential elections.</p>

<p>and then only 8 years later he became the only sitting president in history to campaign for his potential successor, while labeling her &quot;the most qualified candidate of all time&quot;. </p>

<p>Hillary still controls the DNC. Whether or not she is healthy enough to run in 2020 is a different story, but she is making her intentions clear by refusing to leave the public spotlight and retire.</p>

<p>She rigged the DNC and paid a lot of money to keep in afloat. She is not going to go quietly. </p>

<p>Oh, no one wanted her to run? Is that why 3 no-name democrats and an independent were the only obstacles in her path to the party nomination?  Is that why she had full-throated support from the DNC, it&#39;s surrogates, and media personalities? Is that why most of the democratic superdelagtes let it be known early on who they were supporting(Clinton), and why the media was more than happy to repeat that fact at every possible opportunity?  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see the DNC grooming or even mentioning anyone as a possible candidate for 2020. Clinton has been on a book tour and has stayed very busy harping on the negative aspects of the Trump administration. People are even holding out hope that Bernie may run again because there isn&#39;t anyone filling the leadership void.</p>

<p>It might seem far-fetched to think she might run again, but as long as the Cult of Clinton is still singing her praises in public, the DNC is unlikely to take her off the table entirely. If given the nod, she will run again. Her hubris runs that deep.</p>

<p>Not really. Most of the establishment Republicucks like John McCain hate him and are working with the Dems to smear him and get him out.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you why I haven&#39;t gone public. I was a kid at the time. I told my parents and they talked to the family member. That ended that. They didn&#39;t take me to the police to make a statement or anything like that. Time goes by and it becomes my word vs his. At this point, I know he&#39;s not going to jail for anything he did to me. I don&#39;t have enough evidence. What I can do is potentially keep him from gaining more political power than he already has.</p>

<p>what do you want me to do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>provide any type of supporting evidence of your claims, would be a good start.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>take screen shots of my submitted posts and then screen shot the sub showing you the posts are not there? that&#39;s silly. I&#39;m not going to do that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if they are being removed, you should have communications with the mods. screens of that should be enough.</p>

<p>i strongly suspect that, like most subs, they have their automoderator set to remove posts that don&#39;t meet certain criteria (such as having no karma in that sub, not being an approved site that can be submitted, or breaking one of their submission rules)</p>

<p>that&#39;s what is happening 99% of the time that people claim subs are &quot;censoring&quot; their posts. it&#39;s still a form of censorship, but it can be cleared up usually by just politely messaging the mods.</p>

<p>IF that is not what is happening to you, I would like to know.</p>
