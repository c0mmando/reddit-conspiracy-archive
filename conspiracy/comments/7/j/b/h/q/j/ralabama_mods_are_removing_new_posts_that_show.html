       quite strange to me,  is this normal for Reddit?  I have heard of subs being compromised but I'm not sure what's going on. it's funny that they claim to be non partisan in the sub info.

       Why don't they want an honest, open  discussion? What is their end game?

       provide any type of supporting evidence of your claims, would be a good start.

       if they are being removed, you should have communications with the mods. screens of that should be enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       i strongly suspect that, like most subs, they have their automoderator set to remove posts that don't meet certain criteria (such as having no karma in that sub, not being an approved site that can be submitted, or breaking one of their submission rules)
      </p>
      <p>
       that's what is happening 99% of the time that people claim subs are "censoring" their posts. it's still a form of censorship, but it can be cleared up usually by just politely messaging the mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF that is not what is happening to you, I would like to know.

       They want him because he's a Clinton puppet and a stooge. Reddit is astroturfed by paid shills. The majority of Alabamans see through the propaganda want Moore to win. He will win as long as the uniparty doesn't cheat and steal the elections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Already there are reports of voters being bussed around, with the people getting off the buses and refusing to talk to anyone who questions them. Reminds me exactly of what the uniparty tried to do during the 2016 presidential elections.

       what's strange is believing that a candidate no one wanted to run in the first place, who has lost a nomination to a previous president and lost an election to the current president, is going to run for president again.

       and then only 8 years later he became the only sitting president in history to campaign for his potential successor, while labeling her "the most qualified candidate of all time".
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary still controls the DNC. Whether or not she is healthy enough to run in 2020 is a different story, but she is making her intentions clear by refusing to leave the public spotlight and retire.
      </p>
      <p>
       She rigged the DNC and paid a lot of money to keep in afloat. She is not going to go quietly.

      <p>
       Oh, no one wanted her to run? Is that why 3 no-name democrats and an independent were the only obstacles in her path to the party nomination?  Is that why she had full-throated support from the DNC, it's surrogates, and media personalities? Is that why most of the democratic superdelagtes let it be known early on who they were supporting(Clinton), and why the media was more than happy to repeat that fact at every possible opportunity?

      <p>
       I don't see the DNC grooming or even mentioning anyone as a possible candidate for 2020. Clinton has been on a book tour and has stayed very busy harping on the negative aspects of the Trump administration. People are even holding out hope that Bernie may run again because there isn't anyone filling the leadership void.
      </p>
      <p>
       It might seem far-fetched to think she might run again, but as long as the Cult of Clinton is still singing her praises in public, the DNC is unlikely to take her off the table entirely. If given the nod, she will run again. Her hubris runs that deep.

       Not really. Many people just stay quiet until it seems like their abuser starts moving into powerful positions. There's also a lot of power in the movement at the moment, so it makes sense that more would come forward lately.

       I've told my story here before. I have a family member that beat me as a child. He's also a corrupt as fuck politician in a small town. If he ever moves for anything outside of his little town, I'll go public with my story.

       He's been a judge before. He hasn't been a lawmaker. And the current "me too" movement is helping these victims come forward.

       That was basically directed at anyone downvoting my previous statement stop assuming I give a shit what you think.. I believe in facts not statements and if the accusations are factual of course fuck this guy.. But the political climate should be noted.. Your basically saying if I got raped I should wait until this person gets a promotion and then expose them? Why the fuck wouldn't you go to the authorities right away? Besides HOLLYWOOD where else would your career takea hit by exposing someone?

       People talk about why victims don't come forward earlier all the time. Shame, lack of evidence, threats and the idea that they won't be believed are all reasons victims don't come forward. One of Moore's victims specifically said he threatened her.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll tell you why I haven't gone public. I was a kid at the time. I told my parents and they talked to the family member. That ended that. They didn't take me to the police to make a statement or anything like that. Time goes by and it becomes my word vs his. At this point, I know he's not going to jail for anything he did to me. I don't have enough evidence. What I can do is potentially keep him from gaining more political power than he already has.

      <p>
       Or maybe none of them fuck kids and it is all desperate political smears lead by the charlatan lawyer Gloria Allred?
      </p>
      <p>
       The left always projects. They learned this tactic from Alinsky. I would not be surprised if Jones is a blackmailed sexual deviant.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Moore actually did have a history of fucking kids, they would want him to win because he'd be another puppet politician they could easily control.

       When Roy was 30 he was getting bann3d from shopping malls for being a creep and asking moms of he could having out with their teen daughters. What a stand up guy you're throwing your weight behind.

       The right always needs a boogey man. Alinksy, Soros, Clinton. It's what gets you up in the morning. And it keeps you feverishly watching tv and buying books about how evil people are ruining America. It's a fantasy and it makes your overlords lots of money.

        The fact that both sides of the establishment are rallying so hard against Moore suggests that he is not blackmailed or controlled.

       Love this logic. So I guess you automatically like people that lots of people don't like. So I'm sure you also rooted for O.J., Michel Jackson during his trial, Charles Manson, and One Direction.

       nobody can, without 100% doxxing themselves, which obviously 99% of people won't do.

       it's almost impossible to prove whether someone is a shill or not, which is just one of the reasons why it's against the rules to call people shills.

       it's also intellectually lazy, and form of forum sliding.

       provide any type of supporting evidence of your claims, would be a good start.

      <p>
       if they are being removed, you should have communications with the mods. screens of that should be enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       i strongly suspect that, like most subs, they have their automoderator set to remove posts that don't meet certain criteria (such as having no karma in that sub, not being an approved site that can be submitted, or breaking one of their submission rules)
      </p>
      <p>
       that's what is happening 99% of the time that people claim subs are "censoring" their posts. it's still a form of censorship, but it can be cleared up usually by just politely messaging the mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF that is not what is happening to you, I would like to know.
