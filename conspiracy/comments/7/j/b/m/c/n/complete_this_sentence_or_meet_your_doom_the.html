I know of many people that can be verified this way since I live in Southern California. That being said, if you&#39;re looking to start an actual discussion you could have a different approach than being inflammatory and baiting in the way you ask this question. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;m out. I&#39;m not going to try and suggest differently to someone who believes that they were killed another way mainly because I can&#39;t refute this or propose a logical answer to what you&#39;re saying. If you truly don&#39;t believe these people were killed by gunshots then- what were they killed by? I&#39;m really curious to know what this theory is. </p>

<p>I settled on it being a failed human trafficking exchange. Given that the douchey Saudi Prince was there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so what killed these people then. There&#39;s very clearly victims of incident here. I can&#39;t logically deny that to myself. I know that there are people that died there. What is the opposing theory to the cause of death. I wan&#39;t to know what you think. I&#39;m willing to accept that maybe there wasn&#39;t bullets- you have to be willing to accept that there were victims. If were both correct, then the killer is?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work as an audio engineer for a company that is contracted for events such as this. I have friends and associates in the industry that were present for the entirety of this event. Everyone in Vegas is still talking about this and sharing their stories. I have heard stories of people being trampled by stampede. I have heard a story of a person having equipment fall on them. I have friends suffering for various injuries caused by panic and crowd behavior. I have heard stories of gun fire coming from every direction. I have not heard a story yet of anyone seeing a person shot or die from a gun shot. I personally am not sure the numbers are correct but I can not say that nobody died because I know someone who did. There are questions pertaining to her death but again, this is not what OP is asking. Another upvote to you for conversation. </p>

<p>At 1:00 you begin to hear a long volley that includes 3 sounds. Cracks (caused by the projectile breaking the sound barrier), distant reports (from the weapon--this occurs AFTER the crack) and occasional ricochets.</p>

<p>These aren&#39;t multiple shooters, they are one weapon firing supersonic rounds.</p>

<p>The ricochets aren&#39;t important for you, since you&#39;re just asking if live ammo was used. <strong>A crack will not be heard if there is no projectile,</strong> you would only hear the distant report.</p>

<p>So in the movies there are literally guns being fired in every gunfight scene? I thought they were using blanks and adding sound effects in later. </p>

<p>I also just heard a crack down the hall. Did someone shoot a gun?</p>

<p>A crack is proof of a supersonic projectile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, you’re a real asshole and I hope you feel like a complete ignorant idiot when you realize that this event was very real and people were in fact shot. </p>

<p>I have had no desire to respond to posters like you anymore because you just shut down everything anyone says. However, because of how you’re addressing and talking to the people who have taken the time to comment on your post (making it more popular), I had to say something and share. </p>

<p>Why don’t you take a look at this video: 
<a href="https://m.liveleak.com/view?i=4ff_1507067186">https://m.liveleak.com/view?i=4ff_1507067186</a></p>

<p>For me, the most telling shots were at the 30second mark. As he moves to feel her carotid, you see blood accurately come out of her mouth. Around 1:20, is the shot with a clear view of a head exit wound. In the video they are trying to feel in his hair for the entrance. </p>

<p>Now I think I can say with 100% certainty that you’re going to respond to this with some bullshit answer that it all could have been faked. That’s the main issue with these posts, absolutely nothing that anyone posts will be good enough for you. No matter what, it could be fake blood, CGI, fake wounds etc...</p>

<p>It’s actually become almost pointless for anyone to even answer to posts like this because of OP responses....which makes people not answer anymore in the first place. You then just use the fact that no one is answering to fuel the fire and post more bs like “no one? No one can post anything?!”....yea, no one posts anything because of your dick responses. It’s a cycle you’re using to win and it’s sad. </p>

<p>Patiently awaiting your three word asshole response as to how it’s all fake..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yes the Liveleak &quot;aftermath&quot; video. It shows no medical response, bullet damage, or gunshot wounds, and even several times it can be heard &quot;no entry wound, no exit wound.&quot;</p>

<p>It was available within 48 hours of the event. I expected to see many newer submissions that emerged in the two months since the event that contained more evidence than that video, which some people believe to be [staged(<a href="https://youtu.be/hmKODZ-SRYA">https://youtu.be/hmKODZ-SRYA</a>).</p>

<p>So thank you for your submission. It&#39;s a classic that everyone has already seen, but you tried. Anyway, the leader so far is still u/Thecowboyboot with &quot;bloody leg photo.&quot;</p>

<p>You are currently both the leader and third place, because this is probably the third best submission behind your other one and some other user&#39;s video of &quot;bullet striking pavement.&quot; . It was taken at a later date than the actual event, but at least seems to show a victim&#39;s wound. Thanks again for participating, now give someone else a chance!</p>

<p>There&#39;s a screen grab of the man in question. No gunshot wounds are visible, and after this someone puts her hand in front of the left side of the head. No exit wound is seen, however, and the hand is in the way. Unless you want to point out where the wound is visible. </p>
