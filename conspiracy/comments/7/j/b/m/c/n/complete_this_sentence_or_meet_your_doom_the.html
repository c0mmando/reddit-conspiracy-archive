       Notice I said "best proves" so there is no wrong answer except one that is not a link that does not complete the sentence.

       Listen this theory that nothing happened is kind of a little sketchy. I know of someone killed there with 2 degrees of separation from myself. I know of many people that can be verified this way since I live in Southern California. That being said, if you're looking to start an actual discussion you could have a different approach than being inflammatory and baiting in the way you ask this question.

       I don't think you understand the challenge. We're not talking about whether or not people were killed. We are talking about
       <em>
        visual
       </em>
       evidence that shots were fired. It's as easy as posting a link. Can I spell this out any more clearly?

       I didn’t see where OP said anything about people dying. I know someone who died. No one will tell me how. No one will say how she died. Where is the video with evidence of bullets? I’ve wondered this myself. I was at the site a few days after serving food to the first responders and local victims. Only “evidence” of bullets I saw were on the fuel tanks that had already been “patched.”

       Ok, I'm out. I'm not going to try and suggest differently to someone who believes that they were killed another way mainly because I can't refute this or propose a logical answer to what you're saying. If you truly don't believe these people were killed by gunshots then- what were they killed by? I'm really curious to know what this theory is.

       I settled on it being a failed human trafficking exchange. Given that the douchey Saudi Prince was there.

       This isn’t about people dying. This is just a call for evidence of bullets. The blood pictures are interesting but still not anything on bullets. Have you seen what a high velocity round does to a person? I have. Things don’t add up.

       Ok, so what killed these people then. There's very clearly victims of incident here. I can't logically deny that to myself. I know that there are people that died there. What is the opposing theory to the cause of death. I wan't to know what you think. I'm willing to accept that maybe there wasn't bullets- you have to be willing to accept that there were victims. If were both correct, then the killer is?

       I work as an audio engineer for a company that is contracted for events such as this. I have friends and associates in the industry that were present for the entirety of this event. Everyone in Vegas is still talking about this and sharing their stories. I have heard stories of people being trampled by stampede. I have heard a story of a person having equipment fall on them. I have friends suffering for various injuries caused by panic and crowd behavior. I have heard stories of gun fire coming from every direction. I have not heard a story yet of anyone seeing a person shot or die from a gun shot. I personally am not sure the numbers are correct but I can not say that nobody died because I know someone who did. There are questions pertaining to her death but again, this is not what OP is asking. Another upvote to you for conversation.

       I can buy that, there was a lot of videos of gunfire after the incident occurred.

       Are these shots shown on the video, gunfire explosion from guns not real?

       I’ve watched that one a bunch too. I wanted to believe it fed the multiple shooter theory and even better, it looks like a security officer or leo. After much scrutiny, I am part of the crowd that sees this as a well, (or poorly,) timed flash light. Could be gun shot for sure though. Still not a bullet hole or spent round... Here’s an upvote though. I like your effort.

       Well that much was clear from day one. I think the VIP being escorted out as well as lack of videos plus what happened in SA recently give more truth to this being a botched human trafficking exchange.

       No way, people on the internet don't believe other people??? Did I not even state that myself? Why berate that point on a board for discussion. If you can't at least believe that some posters are honest, legit, hard working good people why even come here? Its good to question everything, especially people in power. Its not so good to continuously admonish and diminish your fellow man, even the ones who you would find largely agree with you.

       What proof do you have really? What proof do I have. But here have the last word. Its simply not important to continue to argue with people when I know I'm telling the truth. Your word does not fundamentally alter reality, as much as you would like it to so that you can continue to dive deeper in to the paranoia that's making you be this way.

       Here we have a picture of a woman's leg with what looks like blood on it! No visible gunshot wound whatsoever, but I am proud to say that you are the current leader in this contest sir. You did submit a photo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok folks, do we have any challengers? Or is this photo with no gunshot wound really the best proof that real shots were fired? If so, we can end the contest and proclaim our winner.

       You are correct i haven't been able to find a photo of a gunshot wound or bullet impacts on the ground. However it is still possible that those crime scene pics are still classified and censored on the internet. I do understand and appreciate your view because its open to an alterate theory. But there could be a more simple and honest explanation.

       Not a contest when you’re just using the lack of posts (because of how you shit everyone down) to your advantage and judging yourself....doesn’t work like that.

       This guy is the lowest. No discussion. No theory about why this would be faked. Accusatory. Belittling. Where are the mods for this sub? None of this contributes to any sort of intelligent discussion. All put downs and name calling. Don’t buy into his game. He just keeps the same thing going.

       Funny you should say that. I was reported earlier for saying “idiot” and was banned for participating in the sub. Ended up having a long exchange with one of the moderators about OPs specific behavior. Shared a bunch of his extremely rude and pointless comments that are only aimed to bring others down as they also went weeks back into his posts. I was unbanned after all of this. Hopefully they realize this person is a real issue and finally take care of it. I just forwarded your comment to the mod I was speaking to as the timing was just too great.

       No it wasn't. He wasn't asking for proof that they
       <em>
        weren't
       </em>
       shot but that they
       <em>
        were

       There's footage of it. I couldn't say about the multiple shooter theory I still can't process all these inconsistencies honestly. Everything is a mystery to me. The only thing I personally know for sure is that I feel sorry for the people who died and their families. Something like this is my worst nightmare.

       Yes. The ricochets are interpreted as other shooters. I haven't heard convincing audio of multiple shooters. You can definitely hear reports, cracks and ricochets in a lot of the videos, so live ammo was used.
      </p>
      <p>
       Were people killed? I guess. I didn't know any. Were people injured? I guess. I didn't know any.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where OP is going wrong here is that he doesn't have to be convinced in order for it to have happened. He doesn't matter as much as he thinks he does.

       I don't know anyone from a mass shooting but I still think people have died in them. I actually do know someone who was at the abortion clinic here in bham back in '98 but that's a different type of situation all together. Just the only person I know involved in an act of terrorism.

       You are free to believe shots were fired with evidence that is paltry at best. Sounds like if you have access to footage that "definitely" proves that shots were "definitely" fired, you should post it. That would make me look kind of dumb.

       Literally all of the video I have watched that included gunshots provided the evidence you are looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your inability to understand the different sounds is not my problem.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       At 1:00 you begin to hear a long volley that includes 3 sounds. Cracks (caused by the projectile breaking the sound barrier), distant reports (from the weapon--this occurs AFTER the crack) and occasional ricochets.
      </p>
      <p>
       These aren't multiple shooters, they are one weapon firing supersonic rounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ricochets aren't important for you, since you're just asking if live ammo was used.
       <strong>
        A crack will not be heard if there is no projectile,
       </strong>
       you would only hear the distant report.
      </p>

       Now move on and quit trolling.

       So in the movies there are literally guns being fired in every gunfight scene? I thought they were using blanks and adding sound effects in later.

       I also just heard a crack down the hall. Did someone shoot a gun?

       First of all, you’re a real asshole and I hope you feel like a complete ignorant idiot when you realize that this event was very real and people were in fact shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have had no desire to respond to posters like you anymore because you just shut down everything anyone says. However, because of how you’re addressing and talking to the people who have taken the time to comment on your post (making it more popular), I had to say something and share.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don’t you take a look at this video:
       <a href="https://m.liveleak.com/view?i=4ff_1507067186">
        https://m.liveleak.com/view?i=4ff_1507067186

      <p>
       For me, the most telling shots were at the 30second mark. As he moves to feel her carotid, you see blood accurately come out of her mouth. Around 1:20, is the shot with a clear view of a head exit wound. In the video they are trying to feel in his hair for the entrance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I think I can say with 100% certainty that you’re going to respond to this with some bullshit answer that it all could have been faked. That’s the main issue with these posts, absolutely nothing that anyone posts will be good enough for you. No matter what, it could be fake blood, CGI, fake wounds etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s actually become almost pointless for anyone to even answer to posts like this because of OP responses....which makes people not answer anymore in the first place. You then just use the fact that no one is answering to fuel the fire and post more bs like “no one? No one can post anything?!”....yea, no one posts anything because of your dick responses. It’s a cycle you’re using to win and it’s sad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Patiently awaiting your three word asshole response as to how it’s all fake..

       Ah yes the Liveleak "aftermath" video. It shows no medical response, bullet damage, or gunshot wounds, and even several times it can be heard "no entry wound, no exit wound."
      </p>
      <p>
       It was available within 48 hours of the event. I expected to see many newer submissions that emerged in the two months since the event that contained more evidence than that video, which some people believe to be [staged(

       ).

      <p>
       So thank you for your submission. It's a classic that everyone has already seen, but you tried. Anyway, the leader so far is still u/Thecowboyboot with "bloody leg photo."

       You are currently both the leader and third place, because this is probably the third best submission behind your other one and some other user's video of "bullet striking pavement." . It was taken at a later date than the actual event, but at least seems to show a victim's wound. Thanks again for participating, now give someone else a chance!

       Yeah I'm going to announce a winner today in a new thread, which will call attention to this thread, which will hopefully get people to see this anger and impotence you speak of and how obvious it is that no shots were fired.

       Yeah, people acting like his question (request) somehow dug up the dead and killed them again. And the fact that Reddit is portrayed as this uber liberal "more educated" segment of society, but can't read. The OP yelled fire in a crowded theater about yelling fire in a crowded theatre. I love it!

       Other reminder: no one here was ever able to substantiate the claim that any real shots were fired in Las Vegas in any meaningful or halfway-convincing fashion other than a photo of some shit that's supposed to be a bullet hole on some random water tower in the police report.

       OP, you bundle of sticks. Here is the proof that a bullet hit a tarp, these frames were captured by a police bodycam video.

       Oh shit, wait... it actually proves the exact opposite, that no round hit that tarp.
      </p>

       My bad... carry on.

       There's a screen grab of the man in question. No gunshot wounds are visible, and after this someone puts her hand in front of the left side of the head. No exit wound is seen, however, and the hand is in the way. Unless you want to point out where the wound is visible.
