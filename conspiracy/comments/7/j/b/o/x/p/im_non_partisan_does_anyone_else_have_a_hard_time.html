<p>Is there an effort to create an environment of cognitive dissonance and divisiveness? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely.  The goal is that a divided people are easier to control.  The world is run by the super wealthy. Period.  They are wealthy and they are powerful, the two are synonymous.  They can only STAY wealthy and powerful by oppressing the rest of the population and using them as virtual slave labor.  And, that goes WAY beyond low-priced labor in sweat shops.  ALL of the worlds &quot;GDP&quot; is created for their benefit, either directly, or indirectly.  Ultimately, 90% or more of the wealth generated by all the labor of the world flows up to the super wealthy.  The super wealthy have one goal and that is to maintain the status of being super wealthy.  They NEED the masses to bicker among themselves rather than rise up and remove the wealth and power of the super wealthy.   Their <strong>greatest fear</strong> is losing power.  </p>

<p>This is a really great way to phrase it.</p>

<p>I would add, with education you also develop certain truths you can hold to as the yardstick to assess information. While you may not know what is true, you may know something you believe to be false. An example, George Orwell once said, &quot;I consider that willingness to criticize Russia and Stalin is the test of intellectual honesty.&quot; The world isn&#39;t binary- not like people are either liars or saints- but you can sort out how much skepticism to approach with.</p>

<p>2) Near certainty.  It&#39;s been proven that this is a tactic by state/non-state/corporate actors in the past.  No reason to believe the practice has been discontinued.  It works.</p>

<p>3) I think reasons include, but are not limited to, a) people being lazy, b) people scared to accept hard truths which may challenge everything they believe, c) it&#39;s human nature to seek out confirming information echo chambers, d) with so much disinfo and psyops, people latch on to one group of people to tell them what is the truth.</p>

<p>4) Use their own methods of information analysis:

<p>Yes, mostly. There are some sources who, over time, I&#39;ve grown to trust. Dave McGowan, Mark Passio, Antony Sutton, Joe Plummer. Not exactly reporters (and not all alive) but academics and seekers of big picture truth. </p>

<p>Yes. For sure.</p>

<p>They like their entertainment. And it&#39;s difficult for modern society to grasp that such a level of sinister control can be accomplished, much less even exist. </p>

<p>Does anyone else have a hard time believing ANYTHING they hear?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is belief? Most people seem to think that belief is mentally assuming something as true.</p>

<p>When I encounter new information or truth claims I ask myself, &#39;If I acted as though that was true how would it impact my life?&#39;</p>

<p>I regularly take inventory of my actions, because my actions reveal what I really believe. I can then modify my actions to test different patterns of being and beliefs.</p>

<p>For %99.9999 of information people peddle, acting as though I believed it was true it would have no impact on my life at all. The information that would/does impact my life is fairly easy to sort through.</p>

<p>Most people are so caught up in mental belief systems that they&#39;re completely unaware of their active belief systems. This leaves them as prey for anyone who can introduce a new bright shiny object to their environment.</p>
