<p>The reason this is coming up a very lot lately, is due to the small deficit increase the Republican tax reform bill is to add.</p>

<p>It&#39;s about a 25% increase in the deficit, which is a pretty large deficit increase unless you believe the current deficit is small.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Massively progressive tax reform</p>

<p>It&#39;s making the tax code less progressive, as far as the definition of progressive for taxes go.</p>

<p>The effect I was mentioning was for over ten years. </p>

<p>No analysis done suggests these cuts will pay for themselves. </p>

<p>The only reason the projected deficit increase is as small as some suggest is because of the sunset on personal income tax cuts put in, which I believe would not be allowed to expire and were put in to make the supposed 10 year projection look smaller and to force another crisis negotiation in the future. &quot;Current leadership wants to raise your taxes&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am going to answer, but I don&#39;t think I am really speaking for them (however, I think we would agree on some points).</p>

<p>First, the science isn&#39;t &quot;out&quot; on IQ. There is a lot of argument that the way we measure IQ isn&#39;t very accurate, and all kinds of social and cultural factors influence the outcome of the test. To draw an obvious and extreme example, if you only speak English, and I give you a test in French, all English only speakers are going to fail miserably. Does that mean french speakers have an higher IQ? Or does it mean the test is poorly done? This idea that we have a perfect measure of IQ is nonsense. However, this is not to say there is no genetic difference that leads to different averages, but the reality is that when you attempt to control for other factors, those racial IQ differences drop to around 5 points. Which is close to nothing, and especially makes your nonsense about &quot;average IQ of 70&quot; ridiculous.</p>

<p>So, you are right, on our IQ tests, the mean for whites is a bit higher than the mean for blacks. However, this is where the &quot;lack of understanding of statistics&quot; comes in. You can be a white person, and 99% of black people would be smarter than you. You can be black, and 99% of people would be dumber than you. Why you would allow that really dumb white guy to immigrate over the really smart black guy? If your goal is to filter on intelligence, suggesting that it be done &quot;by race&quot; just shows that you don&#39;t understand the fact that the top 25% of black people are still smarter than than 70% of white people. And the bottom 25% of white people are dumber than 70% of black people.</p>

<p>Ever own a husky? You have to run them miles a day. This is also race related. Ever own a Labrador?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dear god. This is not the same as race. Dogs have been breed. Humans have been controlling what traits they want to see for thousands of years by specifically choosing certain traits. It is obvious just looking at dogs that their genetic variation is much greater than ours because a 12lb chihuahua looks nothing like a 200+lb Mastiff. As in, there are no fully grown mastiffs that not more than 5 times bigger than even the largest chihuahua. This is untrue for any human group. The very idea that you think race is equivalent to breed reveals a profound ignorance.</p>

IQ is by far the most concrete measurable reference in the entirety of social sciences. If you throw that out, you have to throw everything else out as well. Further, very little can be done to change it. An enormous amount of money and effort and time have been spent trying to solve this problem. And it is a problem. Ask Germany, where they&#39;re trying to figure out how to deal with the, yes, 70 IQ average of the migrant population coming in from Northern Africa where there domestic population averages 105.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether or not it is &quot;the most concrete,&quot; I&#39;m not sure (although, lol, at just parroting that guy, almost verbatim). But the reality is that - and this is something you can&#39;t get around - they are flawed. We know that if you give people three different IQ tests, they are going to get three different numbers. If you give the person the same type of IQ test on two different days, you are going to get different results. We know that if you take people with very similar genetics (i.e. identical twins) and put them into two different environments, they will score wildly (and somewhat predictably, at least int he way direction of the difference) different on IQ tests <a href="https://www.livescience.com/47288-twin-study-importance-of-genetics.html">(this says 30% of the difference can be attributed to environmental differences)</a>. Recognizing these flaws and pointing out how they can bias results is not the equivalent of suggesting that it should be thrown out. I readily agree that a component of intelligence - likely the major part of it - is inheritable. But this doesn&#39;t mean our current tests are good at measuring it, nor that we can necessarily accurately measure it at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But averages exist, I&#39;m sorry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would you be sorry about this? I didn&#39;t deny this, in fact, I explicitly said that there would be differences in the mean between two groups. But by comparing race to dog breeds, you are clearly overestimating the genetic variance among humans. Humans are surprisingly genetically non-diverse (you are almost certain to be 99.5% the same, genetically, as any other human on the planet). <a href="https://whitelocust.wordpress.com/genetic-variation-between-dog-breeds-the-reality-of-human-differences/">The variation between dog breeds is more than 3 times this.</a> Using that site, the human difference is mainly between individuals, and only 10% of the difference is race.</p>

<p>No, they don&#39;t. I&#39;m not arguing that IQ isn&#39;t inheritable. It was even in the link I provided to you that the main factor is genetics.  I&#39;ve even explicitly stated this. Is it really that hard for you to understand that this isn&#39;t a black or white issue and that simply because I disagree with you that IQ tests aren&#39;t perfect, that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m disagreeing with everything you&#39;ve said?</p>

<p>And even if we do agree that this dismantles that point, this doesn&#39;t really challenge my overall point that there is more <em>individual</em> variation than there is variation between different groups (unless, of course, those groups are chosen based on intelligence), which you seem to be avoiding.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If you say that there is a strong correlation between how people score on IQ tests and life success, then yes I absolutely agree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your initial point was that we are going to have to swallow a pill when it comes to race and IQ. We don&#39;t agree on this at all. While I have admitted that there will be a different mean in different populations, due to genetics, these are pretty small, and the pill you will have to swallow is that whether or not that individual you run into is smarter is based on the genetics of that individual, not on whatever race you put them into.</p>

<p>The next point we strongly disagree upon is the how accurate IQ tests are. You still have not addressed the point that if you have never learned French, and I give you an IQ in French, you are going to fail miserably. While less extreme, if you are new to a country like Germany and barely speak the language, and were not brought up in the same education system, there are going to be things on an IQ test that you might miss or struggle with because you were not raised in that same mindset, or exposed to those same. And a test that doesn&#39;t examine your grasp of language wouldn&#39;t be very good. The unfortunate thing is that we don&#39;t have a good way of measuring <em>innate</em> intelligence.</p>

<p>1.Whether it is 3 mill or not, it is significant, so thanks for making that clear.
2. I think the implication of your post was that they are not smart enough, considering it was brought up in an argument about IQ, but that article makes it pretty clear that they are struggling with, mainly, a lack of training/education and language barriers.
3. I didn&#39;t ask that they would do worse, to me that would be obvious, however, you claimed that they were lowering the bar and native Germans were doing worse. I didn&#39;t read the whole article, as (which is typical for the Atlantic) it was lengthy and in depth, but a quick glancing over it did not reveal this claim.
4. Your article doesn&#39;t address IQ, but income.
5. This is not &quot;A little off,&quot; it&#39;s about 19% off. But it is really hard to figure out the numbers for this because I don&#39;t know how much immigration there was from 2003-2013 (or whenever this whole mass migration from Syria started happened), so it is hard to say whether or not this was due to immigration or other factors.</p>

<p>Regarding the Federal Reserve Scam, here&#39;s an interesting quote from your link:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why the Federal Reserve Owns Treasurys</p>

<p>As the nation&#39;s central bank, the Federal Reserve is in charge of the country&#39;s credit. It doesn&#39;t have a financial reason to own Treasury notes. So why did it double its holdings between 2007 and 2014?</p>

<p>That&#39;s when it ramped up its open market operations by purchasing $2 trillion in Treasurys. This quantitative easing stimulated the economy by keeping interest rates low. It helped the United States escape the grips of the recession.</p>

<p>Did the Fed monetize the debt?</p>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s one of the effects. The Fed purchased Treasurys from its member banks, using credit it created out of thin air. It had the same effect as printing money. By keeping interest rates low, the Fed helped the government avoid the high-interest rate penalty it would usually incur for excessive debt.</p>

<p>The Fed ended quantitative easing in October 2014. As a result, interest rates on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose from a 200-year low of 1.442 percent in June 2012 to around 2.17 percent by the end of 2014. </p>

<p><strong><em>On September 29, 2017, the Federal Open Market Committee said the Fed would begin reducing its Treasury holdings in October. Expect long term interest rates to rise as a result. For more, see FOMC Meeting Statement Summary.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does this mean? &#39;The Fed&#39; bought <strong><em>(cough!)</em></strong> $1.6 Trillion in &#39;securities&#39; between 2008 and 2014 - but instead of <strong><em>selling</em></strong> them on the market as usual, <em>they sat on them</em>. This had the effect of  flushing the economy with liquidity (cash) while keeping interest rates low, and more importantly, preventing INFLATION from skyrocketing.</p>

<p>Asa of October, &#39;The Fed&#39; started to SELL these securities. How do you suppose that will effect both interest rates and INFLATION?</p>

<p>What a time to be alive, eh?</p>

<p>Its not like printing money. That completely misinforms how QE worked with regards to Treasuries. QE is an asset swap of treasuries from banks for bank reserves, which cannot simply be spent. Those treasuries are purchased from the Fed by zeroing dollars out of circulation, trading perfectly good cash for almost as good t-bills. Then they are forced to take those perfectly good, good as cash t-bills and trade them for bank reserves, which are only used to settle lending transactions. So only if the bank lends can they utilize the billions of dollars they were forced to cough up to the Fed for reserves.</p>

<p>Its one of the most misunderstood actions of the Fed in its history. The vast majority of macroeconomists aren&#39;t concerned with the expanded bank reserves on the balance sheet. Its completely different than national debt. In some ways, its more deflationary.</p>

<p>Questions: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>What &#39;treasuries&#39; are you referring to? Is that the appropriate term? or are we talking about so-called &#39;assets&#39;, such as bundles of junk mortgages?</p></li>
<li><p>Who benefited from these &#39;transfers&#39;? Was it intended to be a net benefit for the people and the economy, or was it a way to relieve banks of toxic assets they were stuck with thanks to their intentionally reckless lending practices?</p></li>
<li><p>How did the banks benefit from these increased &#39;reserves&#39; bestowed on them by the Fed?</p></li>
<li><p>Did the people of the US benefit from said transfer? If so, how?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It seems to me that a simple barometer to measure the results of the secretive, esoteric and intentionally confusing and over-complicated actions of the Fed, both leading up to the 2008 crisis and the Fed&#39;s reaction thereto would be to ask a simple question:</p>

<p>WHO BENEFITED?</p>

<p>Did the common people of the US reap a substantial gain from these slick maneuvers, or did the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer.</p>

<p>Over to you.</p>

<p>Banking is complicated. Finance is complicated. It takes a lot of smarts to understand it. It takes a lot to run it. It takes a lot to succeed in it. These are extremely educated technocrats that mostly spend the bulk of their lives working for the government.</p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to talk about this. But lets talk in neutral terms without the loaded language. I can probably answer most major questions about this. I understand you are skeptical and I was too. But I read up on it and its more complicated than &quot;a scam&quot; IMO.</p>

<p>Q=questions (me); A=answers (you)</p>

<p><strong>Q 1.</strong> What &#39;treasuries&#39; are you referring to? Is that the appropriate term? or are we talking about so-called &#39;assets&#39;, such as bundles of junk mortgages?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>A 1.</strong> <em>I&#39;m referring to t-bills, or bonds.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You make it sound as though it were a value-for-value trade between the banks and the Fed. I see it as a sleight-of-hand bookkeeping scheme to bailout banks whose reserves had fallen to precariously low levels due to reckless lending during the mortgage bubble.</p>

<p>You mention t-bills. Quoting <strong><em>The Economist</em></strong> (owned/published by Rothshilds and Friends):</p>

<ul>
<li>To carry out QE central banks create money by <strong>buying securities</strong>, such as government bonds, <strong>from banks</strong>, with electronic cash <strong>that did not exist before.</strong> The new money <strong>swells the size of bank reserves</strong> in the economy by the quantity of assets purchased—hence &quot;quantitative&quot; easing. [...]  Several rounds of QE in America have <strong>increased the size of the Federal Reserve&#39;s balance sheet—the value of the assets it holds—from less than $1 trillion in 2007 to more than $4 trillion now.</strong> [published March, 2015]</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/03/economist-explains-5">https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/03/economist-explains-5</a></p>

<p>If it were a value-for-value exchange between banks and the Fed, T-Bills for Reserves, as you seem to imply, that would mean that private banks would have had to have held over <strong>$3 trillion</strong> in such securities prior to 2007, and &#39;sold&#39; them to the Fed in exchange for &#39;Reserves&#39;. <strong><em>Is that what you are implying?</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 2.</strong> Who benefited from these &#39;transfers&#39;? Was it intended to be a net benefit for the people and the economy, or was it a way to relieve banks of toxic assets they were stuck with thanks to their intentionally reckless lending practices?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>A 2.</strong> <em>In some ways we all benefited because of economic knock-on effects.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like another way of saying &#39;trickle-down economics&#39;, no?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Early on, commercial paper and some distressed mortgages were swapped for. But the vast majority at this point are t-bill swaps.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you seem to be implying that the banks traded something of VALUE (t-bills) in exchange for the Fed padding their reserves. Did the banks have $3 trillion to offer the Fed as &#39;collateral&#39;? If not, WTF are you talking about?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>As I explained earlier, they aren&#39;t given away, they are traded for reserves.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>For clarification, when we speak of <strong><em>reserves</em></strong> here, we are referring to the (dubious) practice of <em>Fractional Reserve Lending</em>, where private banks are required to hold a certain percentage of funds <em>&#39;in reserve&#39;</em> for each dollar they issue in LOANS. In the US, that percentage is generally 10%. IOW, if a bank has $1 billion in <em>&#39;in reserve&#39;</em>, it can legally issue up to $10 billion in LOANS, and collect interest on these loans. Once upon a time, &#39;reserves&#39; meant DEPOSITS from customers held by the bank. QE was a &#39;magic trick&#39; that artificially inflated these &#39;reserves&#39; far beyond funds held from customer deposits, allowing the banks to write LOANS far in excess of said deposits, and profit from interest paid on said loans. (At least that is my understanding, but then, I&#39;m not a genius Rothschild, am I?)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 3.</strong> How did the banks benefit from these increased &#39;reserves&#39; bestowed on them by the Fed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>A 3.</strong> <em>Banks didn&#39;t necessarily &quot;benefit&quot;, per se. The Fed forced them to hold onto a much higher level of &quot;excess reserves&quot; going forward,</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Forced them? Oh, my! As I explained above, the &#39;reserves&#39; (from whatever source), are a massive boon to banks, as, in the Fractional Reserve system, they are able to to write (and profit from) loans up to TEN TIMES the amount of &#39;reserves&#39; on hand. This was especially handy (a bailout) for banks who had overextended themselves in the game of &#39;musical chairs&#39; that was being played during the massive scam that created the mortgage bubble that popped in 2007-2008.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>which function like a small tax. The Fed pays a small amount of interest on those reserves,</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To who?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>since banks are forced to just hold them and not make money off of them.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, banks ALWAYS &#39;hold reserves&#39; (in theory), and second, of COURSE they make money from having more reserves on hand, as it allows them to write more loans, charge more interest (and associated fees, etc), and after all, that IS how banks make their profits, is it not?</p>

<p>Sheesh!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>This was intended to spur lending so banks would extend credit and hopefully grow the economy.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, it worked, sort of. <strong><em>The rich did get richer</em></strong> (WAY richer), but the middle-class shrunk like a dick in cold water, their numbers migrating into the poor and destitute.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q 4.</strong> Did the people of the US benefit from said transfer? If so, how?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>A 4.</strong> The people benefited by having slow and steady growth instead of a credit freeze.* </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember who created this &#39;crisis&#39; to begin with - the banks in collusion with the Fed and other central banks, and with our filthy, corrupt politicians. Are the <em>&#39;little people&#39;</em> supposed to be <strong><em>grateful</em></strong> that the Fed softened the blow that <strong><em>they hit us with</em></strong> by providing an artificial (and temporary) cushion? [POP!]</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It was also a move towards a simpler and more streamlined approach to reserve maintenance. Instead of sitting on the treasury price in the market,</em> <strong><em>the Fed requires excess reserves</em></strong> <em>which function as a price floor.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you mean by &#39;excess reserves&#39;? Has the Fractional Reserve percentage ration of private banks been increased? If so, cite that, please.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Banking is complicated. Finance is complicated.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It need not be complicated. Like the US Tax Code, Big Finance is a shell game that has been made <em>intentionally</em> complicated and convoluted by TPTB so that they can work their <em>&#39;craft&#39;</em>- bleeding the wealth of the people and the nation for their own benefit, while telling the peasants that it&#39;s all for their own good... <em>&#39;you wouldn&#39;t understand... just trust us!&#39;</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It takes a lot of smarts to understand it. It takes a lot to run it.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like I said, I&#39;m no Rothschild Money Magician, but it seems to me that the <em>&#39;smarts&#39;</em> are mainly required to hide their schemes, to get away with what they do without being drawn and quartered by angry mobs, should they ever catch on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I understand you are skeptical and I was too. But I read up on it and its more complicated than &quot;a scam&quot; IMO.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right. To call this multi-generational international long-con a &#39;scam&#39; would be a gross understatement.</p>

<p>I look forward to your reply. Maybe you can &#39;educate&#39; me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From your first post:</p>

<p>(Me, quoting an article linked by OP)</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Fed purchased Treasurys from its member banks, <strong>using credit it created out of thin air. It had the same effect as printing money</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>(You, arguing against that point) </p>

<blockquote>

QE is an asset swap of treasuries from banks for bank reserves, which cannot simply be spent. <strong>Those treasuries are purchased from the Fed by zeroing dollars out of circulation, trading perfectly good cash for almost as good t-bills.</strong> </p>

<p>Me, quoting the (Rothschild owned) Economist Magazine:</p>

<ul>
<li>To carry out QE <strong>central banks create money by buying securities</strong>, such as government bonds, from banks, with electronic <strong>cash that did not exist before.</strong> The new money swells the size of bank reserves in the economy by the quantity of assets purchased—hence &quot;quantitative&quot; easing.

</ul>

<p>So the Economist Magazine reinforced what OP&#39;s link had said. YES, it IS like printing new money.</p>

<p>I suspect that this is where you decided to jump ship, hoping to save face by pretending to be <em>insulted</em> because, you claimed, I was not being &#39;civil&#39;.</p>

<p>Well, whatever. I did learn something today, but not by your sharing accurate information, rather, by researching the details of the misinformation you provided.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A California federal court has ordered Coinbase to turn over identifying records for all users who have bought, sold, sent, or received more than $20,000 through their accounts in a single year between 2013 and 2015. Coinbase estimates that 14,355 users meet the government’s requirements. The full order is embedded below.</p>

<p>For each account, the company has been asked to provide the IRS with the user’s name, birth date, address, and taxpayer ID, along with records of all account activity and any associated account statements. The result is both a definitive link to the user’s identity and a comprehensive record of everything they’ve done with their Coinbase account, including other accounts to which they’ve sent money.</p>

<p>this means $1 Trillion per year tax money direct to the banks and the debt goes not 1 cent lower.</p>

<p>as for staying on budget, keep electing the 95% who easily are re-elected every cycle even tho their approval rating is in the toilet ... that&#39;ll fix it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of frequent concern is how the national debt will be paid off. This overlooks the fact that banks don&#39;t lend any tangible thing to anyone - not even to governments. </p>

<p>While we&#39;re told that no one is as far in the hole as Uncle Sam, it will be difficult to define and describe precisely &#39;what monetary substance the World Bank, IMF or The Fed have loaned to Uncle Sam or the world&#39;s many bankrupt nations. This is because bankers are the actual debtors. They only pretend to make the loans. </p>

<p>Of course, the public is equal to the task, pretending to borrow a sum of nothing in proportion to the numbers shown on little slips of paper. </p>

<p>So how much of the national debt is actually owed to whom? </p>

<p>There is no scenario where the existence of extremely long term generational debt is a good thing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>$1.4 billion is pocket change to the federal government. Look at the amount of taxes they collect. The interest is a really small part. The government has no intentions or incentive to lower the national debt. Our National Debt could be almost completely gone in 30 years if they stopped issuing debt and let it come due. When debt does come due they, instead of paying it off, issue brand new debt and pay off the old with it, essentially. Far cheaper, not necessarily better, to roll debt forward and keep paying 6 month debt interest payments than payoff that round. </p>

<p>For example, someone loaned you a $1000, you only had to pay $55 to the person year for that, no principal payments. When the loan is up and the person wants their $1000 back, would you rather give him back a $1000 or ask someone else for a $1000 and keep paying $55 a year?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My unfounded conspiracy theory is this, If the US stops supercharging their economy with massive debt, the entire system crashes.</p>

<p>Eventually they will have to let up or run out of &quot;fuel&quot;. Either of these would be fatal. The US is currently in a economic death spiral and nothing anyone can do under the current enviroment will do anything. Future tech or economic systems can mitigate this.</p>

<p>The good news is this is sustainable for a time, I&#39;ll say.......2025-2035, pulling years out of my ass. (The Russians projected 2025, but they seem a pessimistic/fatalistic bunch)</p>
