        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a very long story but I am in a dire situation. I am pretty much your stereotypical conspiracy theorist cliche.. I don&#39;t live in my mom&#39;s basement but close...</p>

<p>I am a middle aged guy with aspergers.. I have been studying this stuff full time for many years. I feel I have made discoveries that would change the world if I could only convey to others what I know and understand. I have been working so hard to find a way to convey this info... it seems impossible though. I worked for a long time on a project to get this to the masses. I have some of it online but it&#39;s a mess and I burnt out working on it.</p>

<p>I have a lot of issues.. I have Aspergers syndrome which I think helped me put the pieces together I have. I have been unemployed for many years and live with a parent who has Narcissistic Personality Disorder and has been gaslighting me for many years to keep me dependent on her as well. But I have been starting to get my life together and this makes someone with NPD lose their mind. I am at a point now where I might be homeless any day.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what I am looking for here.. but some kind of help or some idea of what to do... some support from the community if it&#39;s possible. But who to trust?</p>

<p>I have a paypal account.. if anyone wants to give donations to help me continue my work and keep myself afloat that might be the only way to help at this point. I feel bad asking for this but I also feel like I am screwed any way I go.. I could sell all my belongings and have to start fresh homeless and honestly might never make it out of that with my aspergers ADD and physical issues. I don&#39;t know how you link people to a paypal account either.. do you need to do that through Patreon or something?</p>

<p>You can read a fictional story I wrote here that incorporates truth with fiction.. I was going to provide a key when the story was finished to show what was truth and what wasn&#39;t after the story was complete... </p>

<p>Maybe I could start dumping info to people here and if they are intrigued they could provide some support. It&#39;s tough though because this is part of the problem.. how and when the info is released is a big responsibility. You can&#39;t understand that unless you know how all this works. Corey Feldman is going through this himself and being attacked for it.. like me he knows the real issue is HOW you get the info out.. it&#39;s a logistical nightmare...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am in the process of getting an Aspergers evaluation. But to navigate that when homeless with no money might not be possible. I just started going through this which is why my mother seems to be losing her mind. She has no one else but me and she is afraid I will abandon her.. when this happens to people with NPD they abondon someone before they can abandon them.. which is why i will possibly end up homeless.</p>

<p>I was homeless in high school for this same reason. I got a job at a grocery store and was working a lot.. she went nuts and acted so crazy I had to get away from her. She moved me to a city away from all my family in another state and abandon me there. I was barely surviving for many years then she conned me to live with her again and has been gaslighting me the whole time. I didn&#39;t know she had NPD until a couple years ago.</p>

<p>I dealt with it to try to get this info out.. and now just at things are getting better for me she is at her worst. She physically assaulted me today then threatened to call the police on me... she has done this to my brother and her husbands in the past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would just reveal the info right here and keep researching everything I have.</p>

<p>I could finish writing my comic book to help get this info out.. I could also start working on the tech involved.. make a true free energy device - antigravity device..</p>

<p>I want many people to start working on this device.. if we are all working on it I think we could evelop it very fast. Most the info is known it would just take some trial and error to get it working. You will understand that when I convey all my info.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind if I had been working for the last 8 years making minimum wage I would have made at least 16 times that 20k... I threw all that money away to try to bring this info to people.. I threw my future away really..</p>

<p>But I did that because this info is that important..</p>

<p>In the same way that I suspected that I had ADHD before I went to a doctor, you cannot say anything more than &quot;I suspect I have Aspergers&quot;</p>

<p>These 2 things are the most important things I have ever seen in my life.. their impact on society are that great.</p>

<p>But for me to convince how I know this is the hard part that is so difficult.</p>

<p>One of the revelations is how to achieve free energy as well as antigravity.</p>

<p>The other is proof that an advanced civilization on Earth existed... which ties into many current events... such as Antarctica...</p>

<p>I believe I know how both of these things can be physically proven.. and definitively prove this is real to society.</p>

<p>When i discovered this some crazy thing started to happen in society as if the people in power knew what I discovered as well....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far expression of your knowledge goes you should begin looking into a YouTube channel, or popular platform. The reality is most of the info people receive if quick video format. People like consistency in their entertainment along side easy access. Video Editing, Voice recording, Griping footage, and accurate information will keep people coming back. After that you need a solution to guide people to. Your knowledge is the water you are leading them too. From there they make the choice to drink, so guide them. </p>

<p>Above all else remember this, Those in power don&#39;t want you to succeed. Your diet, resources, and new sources are all working to make you more hopeless. Falling into that scheme will take away your time, and resolve. Be wary of the path ahead while it may be the right one it will certainly not be the easy one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it comes to disability you need to advocate and push push push. It took me months upon months for anyone to actually evaluate me for low vision. The system sucks, and esp if you&#39;re not good at handling situations like that it can seem hard, but sometimes you have to figure out how. </p>

<p>There should also be community programs that focus on social and cognitive disorders and help you with therapy, work programs, etc. Genesis is a good one here, but idk about there. If you can find one they may advocate for you. </p>

<p>DBT therapy is really helpful with understanding and processing social situations. Your state health care, if avaliable, should cover it. </p>

<p>Living with someone like your mother is hard. Trust me. I know. My mom is npd and bpd. It&#39;s a tripppp. Just try and ignore her. Try and seek out literally any and all social welfare and community programs. You&#39;ll get there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many subs that have been recommended and I would advise you to visit each of them. My MIL is NPD, so I know how damaging they can be and the games they play. It is very toxic to be tied to someone with NPD when they are not actively trying to get better. They rarely get better, btw. You have to take care of yourself, not her. </p>

<p>In you town, there is most likely a support group to help deal with the NPD mother. Find out when and where they are and go to them. Once you go, they can help you find the resources to get what you need; disability insurance, homeless shelters, counseling, whatever you need. They are usually at hospitals and churches. There are people that can help you, I promise. </p>

<p>Good luck! </p>

<p>It is more common for an NPD  mom to also be v. Munchousen by proxy than not.</p>

<p>I know she didn&#39;t tell you that you have Aspergers, she raised you to think of yourself as sick and to look for a diagnosis.  All these things are personality choices, not biological illness.  They are a software disease and not a hardware disease.  You have a virus in your mind, as in the book, Virus of the Mind.</p>

<p>Believe me, you can fix the Asperger virus but getting a disability certification is self-destructive.</p>

<p>Your relationship with your mother sounds more to me like codependency. You bring up the joint bank account and your mom’s threats to lock you out of it. Why would she do that unless you were using the money for something you shouldn’t?</p>
