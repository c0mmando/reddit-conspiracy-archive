        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As Title Reads. I am just tired that so many people still fall in line to the belief that some guys with box-cutters took down multiple buildings in free fall motion and even had their passports picked up off the ground! Fucking Miracle that among the millions of lbs of debris... their passports just fall into the streets! Amazing! How is that not suspect af?</p>

<p>Furthermore, if I say something like &quot;You should just simply look into WTC 7 and tell me what you think after that&quot;, It&#39;s never good enough, On the internet and in person I get barraged with stupid ass rebuttles like well jet fuel can melt buildings like that and it would take them forever to plant that much thermite, how do you explain that?</p>

<p>If I simply say.. no It can BEND steel at that thickness.. and it would take hours of direct contact.. and even then it wouldn&#39;t collapse a tower.. They still think i&#39;m just pulling shit out of my ass.</p>

<p>I am supposed to be an encyclopedia to break down every second of the day for them and even then I would look even crazier.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t even have to do much digging to figure out that 9/11 was an orchestrated event. </p>

<p>You really don&#39;t, and its not just blindly believing a single youtube video with no merit. Professors, architects, engineers, firefighters, police, ect, ect, first hand eye witness accounts all have enough evidence to strike down the notion that jet fuel took down all three WTC buildings.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s before the deeper digging that thermite can be used to blow apart steel columns.</p>

<p>But If I say just go look into it, its not enough. I am supposed to be an encyclopedia of that day and break it down and look like Charlie Day <a href="https://imgur.com/a/8Bcio">https://imgur.com/a/8Bcio</a> </p>

<p>This should not be a &quot;conspiracy&quot; any more.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a single video that I can save and just pass around that gives a fast and great breakdown of why and how? </p>

<p>On the other hand,   we have to learn how to express that &quot;pissed&quot; productively,   not let it make us sick,   and fight the fight with skill and some patience.    Some of that anger is that we haven&#39;t worked out our own issues.    Some of that anger is expectations that are at odds with how the world works:<br/>
