<blockquote>
<p>“Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For consciousness is absolutely fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else.”</p>

<p>&quot;Quantum physics thus reveals the basic oneness of the Universe&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>― Erwin Schrödinger</p>

<p>Nobel prize 1933, enormously advanced quantum physics</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clearheaded science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about the atoms this much: There is no matter as such! All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. . . . We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Spirit. This Spirit is the matrix of all matter.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Max Planck</p>

<p>Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918. Birthed Quantum Mechanics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Werner Heisenberg</p>

<p>Nobel prize 1932, enormously advanced quantum physics</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It from Bit symbolizes the idea that every item of the physical world has at bottom — at a very deep bottom, in most instances — an immaterial source and explanation; that what we call reality arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes-no questions and the registering of equipment-evoked responses; in short, that all things physical are information-theoretic in origin and this is a participatory universe.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- John Archibald Wheeler</p>

<p>Coined &quot;black hole&quot; to objects with gravitational collapse already predicted early in the 20th century, and coined the terms &quot;quantum foam&quot;, &quot;neutron moderator&quot;, &quot;wormhole&quot; and &quot;it from bit&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Metaphysical has been science’s designation for all weightless phenomena such as thought. But science has made no experimental finding of any phenomena that can be described as a solid, or as continuous, or as a straight surface plane, or as a straight line, or as infinite anything. We are now synergetically forced to conclude that all phenomena are metaphysical; wherefore, as many have long suspected — like it or not — life is but a dream.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Buckminster Fuller</p>

<p>Second World President of Mensa from 1974 to 1983, architect, systems theorist, author, designer, and inventor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. It should transcend personal God and avoid dogma and theology. Covering both the natural and the spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things natural and spiritual as a meaningful unity.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Albert Einstein</p>

<p>Nobel Prize in Physics 1921</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Science is incompetent to reason upon the creation of matter itself out of nothing. We have reached the utmost limit of our thinking faculties when we have admitted that because matter cannot be eternal and self-existent it must have been created.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- James Maxwell </p>

<p>One of the most profound physicists of all time. Greatly advanced understanding of electromagnetic fields</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“God is a mathematician of a very high order and He used advanced mathematics in constructing the universe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Paul Dirac</p>

<p>Enormously advanced quantum physics and quantum electrodynamics. Shared Nobel Prize with Shrodinger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Epistemologically, where science ends philosophy begins.</p>

<p>This boundary where one morphs into the other is continually pushed further back as science finds ways rationalize phenomenon.</p>

<p>The reasoning why this is so is simple in nature: the underlying tenets of philosophy gave birth to science as we know it, thus when science can no longer explain something we appeal to philosophy.</p>

<p>All these quotes OP give just go to show this. Does not mean any of those quotes are true, but rather shows the appeal to a previous authority that came before science in order to explain something science currently cannot.</p>

<p>Consider, how in the past, when the sum knowledge of the sciences was smaller, that certain concepts were explained via an appeal to philosophy, that have now been explained by science. It&#39;s because that bubble of knowledge and understanding has grown.</p>

<p>It will continue to grow, but the edges will always be an unknown frontier, which will be explained philosophically. Push the envelope, and that unknown edge just gets pushed further back, but it&#39;s always there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except that science isn&#39;t a derivative of philosophy, but rather the orphan of the anti-philosophy of &quot;Materialism&quot; that the ancients quite rightly rejected and condemned for it&#39;s purely self-serving and completely self-referential nature. </p>

<p>An anti-philosophy that science was quite deliberately used as a back door to re-establishing and promoting it to become the most dominant and official characteristic of modern society in everything but name.</p>

<p>True enough that what came before what is now called &quot;science&quot; was appropriately called &quot;Natural Philosophy&quot; but just try finding out anything about what that was because science, and by that I mean Newtonian science and it&#39;s advocates systematically erased and destroyed virtually all traces of it and set about re-defining and re-explaining everything in purely materialistic terms whether that was a logical or reasonable thing to do or not. </p>

<p>For well over two hundred years Newtonian science and physics simply assumed that all energy was a property of matter because it could only be that from any purely materialistic view of life, the Universe and all that, as Douglas Adams put it. </p>

<p>That is until Quantum Mechanics and Physics finally arrived to dispel that completely erroneous assumption that never could be scientifically tested or proved by any of science&#39;s own procedures and methodologies despite it&#39;s rigid insisted on those to verify absolutely anything and everything else. </p>

<p>As a consequence we have no idea of how much science has gotten completely upside-down, inside-out, or ass-backwards, due to it&#39;s own empirical nature and that erroneous assumption that was one of the main cornerstones of so much it believed, and in many cases still believes to be factual. </p>

<p>Quantum mechanics is based on the concept that all matter is merely an expression of energies that have no physical form of their own and that all matter is composed of patterns and multiple layers of them substantiated by the continuous motions of such discrete little energies that are absolutely everywhere and are essentially &quot;all that is&quot; in any true sense.</p>

<p>And where are we now, almost a hundred years after that? Why still teaching the Newtonian model with all it&#39;s purely materialistic notions *as if&quot; it was perfectly true or might as well be which is all most people who won&#39;t go on to any advanced studies in physics will ever learn or know and that is the single largest impediment to actually learning and understanding what Quantum Physics is actually all about. </p>

<p>There are any number of other models that would be far more accurate and correct than Newton&#39;s but haven&#39;t been adopted because of what they would do to the body of information that is based entirely on Newtonian and purely materialistic principles which they desperately want to maintain otherwise they&#39;ll have a huge credibility problem, especially give the pre-eminent position science now has an enjoys.</p>

<p>Philosophy is the &quot;love of wisdom&quot;, not any simple love of knowledge for no more than knowledge&#39;s sake and hang the consequences which is about all you can honestly say about science. </p>

<p>Wisdom dictates a concerted search for knowledge and information that would be benevolent and beneficial for all of mankind to have and acquire for the betterment of it&#39;s own life as well at that of all other life-forms. </p>

<p>Science prefers to maintain that any knowledge is neutral and yet it&#39;s very plain that it has commonly and deliberately sought out all kinds of knowledge and information that can only have destructive and harmful effects when directly applied, as if that wasn&#39;t known from the very outset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Science, like religion, has always been man&#39;s attempt to explain the inexplicable.  And in so doing, we mistake the map for the territory, just as the Buddha taught long ago in the famous <a href="https://essenceofbuddhism.wordpress.com/2016/04/19/what-the-finger-pointing-to-the-moon-analogy-really-means-from-zen-buddhism-the-buddha-in-the-shurangama-sutra/">finger pointing at the moon</a> parable.  This is what conventional science misses completely and why dogmatic scientists may never fully accept the quotes you posted, despite the fact that they come from the most advanced scientific minds in human history.  Excellent post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The infinity of space time curvature comes about because you are measuring the curvature of something that is being modeled as a point in order to make the formulas work.</p>

<p>There is no inconsistency with using any concept no matter what it&#39;s origin as part of a formula - it&#39;s the math that makes the formula work, and not the concept.</p>

<p>These concepts can be absurdities that eventually get reigned in and formalized, yes.</p>

<p>Still, to talk about those concept as if they are something concrete is completely missing the point, imo, because the infinite and the infinitesimal exist as a possible subtext to <em>any</em> formula describing <em>any</em> phenomenon, and one could rearrange the terms to solve for either one in any given situation, and proclaim the infinity of any single thing. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not claiming that either infinities exist or do not exist - that&#39;s not what this is about. It matters not whether they exist or do not exist. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just like <em>i</em> - something that exists within the realm of the maths used to model phenomenon. It matters not whether it actually exists or not in the actual phenomenon that is being modeled, because that is an unknowable. It&#39;s only the model that will ever be known, and not the thing being modeled. So the map is not the territory, etc.</p>

<p>The concepts we use in the models ultimately have a philosophical underpinning, and that&#39;s why the resort to philosophy and metaphysics when we reach the limits of what our formulas can explain. </p>

<p>To proclaim the infinite is real because the formulas use it is confusing the map for the territory. I get it, that&#39;s the best we can do, because we are mapping territories with the only tool we have to gather data with: our mapping tools. </p>

<p>This pushes the boundaries of epistemology and degrades into that self referentialism of &quot;how do we know what we know&quot;, with an appeal that basically says &quot;we know what we know because the tools we have designed to show what we know say we do&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an appeal to authority that confuses the map with the territory, or the formulas to describe phenomenon with the phenomenon itself.</p>

<p>The infinites are tools in maths. They do not explain anything in and of themselves, and will always remain as philosophical concepts.</p>

<p>When you point your finger and say &quot;but look at the curvature of a black hole, it&#39;s infinite&quot; that doesn&#39;t mean anything. You are not pointing at a black hole, but merely at an aspect of a formula that is used to model it. That formula exists in the mind. Not out in nature.</p>

<p>Science doesn&#39;t actually argue that it exist in nature because the mind has sufficiently modeled it, but I think people miss this point altogether, and thus will speak about concepts as if they are concrete.</p>

<p>Infinity is but one of these concepts that is used to model things.</p>

<p>No, but this is a philosophical problem and you won&#39;t be getting anywhere.</p>

<p>But this comes into questioning reality and knowledge itself, and not the subjects. How can we know anything is actually true? We can&#39;t, but due to the circumstances we have and the &quot;patterns&quot; we&#39;ve found we can conclude and theorize about things.</p>

<p>Logic itself is the result of multiple observations about multiple things which forms a pattern therefore making your brain realize what is happening. Like a mutation. It&#39;s a process - which takes millions of years to evolve and come into this &quot;intelligent mind&quot; that we all have. The scientific method of analysis is the result of logical thinking.</p>

<p>This does, a very little.

<p>...When you dig deeper from here, shit REALLY starts to get nuts.</p>

<p>Random Probability Particles (or waves), Are they real or not? Why not both? They exist and do not exist within the same space time, until observed. A good portion of our universe exists in this state simply because it has not been interacted with. Once it is interacted with, it has ALWAYS existed or not existed, it &quot;rewrites itself backwards through time&quot;.</p>

<p>But hey, at least it&#39;s not all a video game.

<p>Now, I&#39;m looking for an Entity/System that does ALL of these things plus the things I know (Little tiny bit), the things I know I don&#39;t know (The whole of human knowledge), and the things I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t know (everything else).</p>

<p>I wish it was just the universe, That can be grasped and understood fairly easily (not really, the size alone is mind boggling)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The universe seems pretty volatile considering the fabric of existence can be modified and manipulated by mere humans.
In any one given universe it would make the most sense that there would be only a single conscious entity/player and the rest would be NPCs/reflections of their subconscious.
This also ties into the simulated reality theory.
If the universe is as old as people believe it to be, then there would have been numerous entities/groups to reach the level of technological supremacy where they would be capable of not only &quot;space travel&quot; but modifying their host universe, that would inevitably lead to conflict and perhaps the destruction of their host universe.
So each conscious entity awakens in their own bubble of existence that reflects what an actual universe would be like, except to avoid conflict and self-destruction they are zoned off into individual timelines/realities separated from each other.</p>
