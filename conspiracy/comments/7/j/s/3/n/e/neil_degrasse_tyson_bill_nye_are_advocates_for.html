       They support it so much so that they starred in a pro-gmo documentary called "food evolution" (produced by Tyson as well). They also have pushed it through countless speeches you can find on YouTube, and have even devoted several full episodes of Neil's startalk podcast praising gmo's and essintaly calling "gmo truthers" idiots and connecting dots that aren't there. You know, the usual I'm sure we've heard before.
 Now, what makes this interesting is the fact that you can find videos of bill nye on YouTube from in the 90's talking about the harmful effects of gmo's, so why the sudden shift and why did they all just star speaking about it around the same time three years ago? 
To wrap this longer then intended post up, I'll just say that I'm open minded that gmo's maybe aren't as bad as we were led to believe seeing as so many people are coming to the defense of it but I don't know. Something seems off about this situation.

       That's a good point. Wouldn't it of been more scientifically precise for nye and degrasse to talk about the benefits of gmo's to end world hunger insteaded of making this huge blanket statment that americans should eat gmo's and not worry? If you're in a developing culture that can't even eat one meal a day, get any source of eatable food you can over there asap. But if you have the choice, avoid gmo's. No way in hell Neil &amp; Bill are eating gmo foods anytime soon, I would bet on that.

       I think it's great they're advocating GMO food. It's evident that GMO's are societal game-changers. However, the methods used to preserve or progress these crops are toxic. Nye and Tyson should shift their focus to a healthier alternative to herbicides or insecticides used on the food.

       That's funny because when we  voted to mandate labels for gmo foods in grocery stores there was huge push back from the food industry. This was in Oregon and unfortunately the bill didn't pass. You would think of gmos were so wonderful that they wouldn't mind the label

       Yup, I volunteered my services to bolster the No GMO campaign in Oregon, explaining how GM foods have miniscule nutritional value by comparison. They said No, they were not going to canvass Oregonians like that, but here take our shitty pamphlet. It was a critical loss, as the Dark Act subsequently trumped NH(?) initiative that Oregon was to bolster.

       They mind the label because it implies, without actual evidence, that GMOs are dangerous and the public needs to be warned about their presence.

       I work in science and haven't seen a single credible argument against the use of GMO's other than the shady business practices of companies like Monsanto. GMO's allow us to carry out the process of selecting desirable traits as we have been doing since the dawn of agriculture, in a much more rapid and controlled fashion.

       "I work in science." LMFAO.

      <p>
       I didn't know science was either an employer or even an industry. It's a concept. Nothing more. You can't work "in it," you can only work AT it.
      </p>
      <p>
       One does not paint a picture and say "I'm working
       <em>
        in
       </em>
       my picture." You are working
       <strong>
        AT
       </strong>
       it because you are in control of it, and not the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science is the quest for isolating control for a mechanism. If your work is
       <em>
        in
       </em>
       science, then this suggests that science is what is in control of you!
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't sound like a person in control of one's environment, which is what science is, but rather one whose environment is in control. A subordinate drone in a chain of command. You sound like you're in the army, not a free thinker.

       A field encompasses a set of fixed coordinates, therefore explaining its definition as "a sphere of activity." A sphere, indeed, has fixed coordinates. Circumference, diameter, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <strong>
        only
       </strong>
       fixed coordinate of science is the subject. Instead, science operates on the goal posts being moved, if you'll accept that analogy, while the subject remains fixed in position. The goal posts being our disposed perspective, and the prospective displacement of said goal posts being our capacity to have our perspective altered.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we move the goal posts, we can't have ourselves a game. Science, of course, is not a game. We can move the goal posts all we damn please. Science, though, can be seen as us
       <em>
        gaming
       </em>
       the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science is predicated on a subject purveying one's subjective perspective of an object onto another subject. Here, then, we have a set of three coordinates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let us say that I am the first subject, and that you are the second subject, and that the object is science. Here, then, we have a closed system. A
       <em>
        field
       </em>
       !
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, you might think at this moment that you have caught me contradicting myself because I have just called science "object." If so, on the contrary I tell you, we are
       <em>
        objectifying
       </em>
       science by talking
       <em>
        about
       </em>
       this subject rather than simply being engaged in scientific inquiry for the sake of itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, are we in this field, or is it our mutual dialogue that makes the field so? If we're in the field, how is it that we are permitted to study its parameters? If we're outside the field, how is it that we are permitted to study its inner workings? We are neither in the field, nor are we outside of it, for we are squarely in between these designations. The field's parameters are incumbent on our two subjective poles relating to each other our concerns for the object. What's going on between us, and our concern, is the field, and whatever else going on is not. To say we are
       <em>
        on
       </em>
       the fence is one way to put it, and to say we
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       the fence is another way to put it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, our three coordinates triangulate the field for additional observers. If not for our triangulation of the field, there is nothing delineated for observers to consider. Therefore, the field is not an open house environment where anyone may participate, for participating in it is an obstruction of its very construction, or even a complete destruction of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one were to cross into our field, the interference would preclude us from the cogency to corroborate our subjective perspectives of the field into an objective perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that our field must be left alone for it to be of any value. If our findings are satisfactory to an observer, said observer will attempt to repeat our findings with yet another subject.
       <strong>
        Our
       </strong>
       field is never replicated. It is
       <strong>
        ours
       </strong>
       . An infinity of similar fields are permitted to be made, but ours will always be our own.
      </p>
      <p>
       If other fields suggest the same findings ours suggest, then our field will go on to be perceived as a law.
      </p>
      <p>
       And because it may be perceived as a law does not change the objective truth that our finding was a subjective relationship all along. And because this is true, it is also true that no matter how perceptibly lawful and increasingly dogmatic said law becomes, the field on which it all is predicated was
       <strong>
        always
       </strong>
       ,
       <em>
        all along
       </em>
       a subjective construct, and a subject is not that which contains us, but what we actively interact with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science is a frail fabric that was meant to be pelleted with sturdy rocks. It is the pursuit of externalizing one's self from an environment for the express function of comprehending and cataloging the controls for its mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
       To perceive science as structure like a building that is permitted to be toured like a museum is the whole problem and is what empowers the "I work in science!" posters on Reddit to manipulate our minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       The structure I speak of is esotericism. The average vocabulary for a person is 5000 words. Eventually, there comes a point where a prospective field has a great many more than a measly 5000 terms. There comes the time where the dynamic is no different than gambling at a casino. The house always wins. They have more terms to send your mind on a wild goose chase and leave you thinking this was an honest transaction of dialogue. They don't want you to understand, they want you to comply and to belittle the next dissident.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't work
       <em>
        in
       </em>
       science. We work
       <em>
        out
       </em>
       science.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hearing "I work in science" on Reddit for me was like hearing someone say "I train UFC" on Sherdog.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope my explanation can at least help you see that I'm not arbitrarily being obstinate. Words are weapons. And words also tells for us poker players in seeing a wolf in sheep's clothing, whether the wolf knows they're the wolf or not.

       First off, GMO's are not in food. Food is a GMO. If you knew what GMO stood for, you would know that. Second, GMOs are not inherently bad. Your dog is a GMO. In fact, GMOs can be very good and may even save the planet. Plants can be Genetically Modified to be more nutrient dense, or grow more fruit for less water.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is the companies who manufacture GMOs do so based on bottom line, $$$, and not necessarily the good of the people or the planet. Further, they use archaic laws to push out competitors, like monsanto suing neighboring farmers whose crops get cross pollinated by wind and bees based on copyright infringement.

       done in a lab does not make it bad. GMOs are like guns. They can both do a lot of harm. But at the same time, they can be used for good. It's not the GMOs that are bad, it's the people behind them.

       like i have said to other people, if they make a gmo gros michel banana that is resistant to panama disease or something similar then i am all game.   but i havnt found a current gmo that solely increases yield without putting something into the dna or allowing it to be sprayed by a ton of herbicide.  there may well already be some;  if you know of any please let me know

       GMO developers do extensive testing on the safety of their product. The potential lawsuits far outweigh the risks. Add on top of that recalls, as well as research and development of the product. Just because something may be perceived to be dangerous doesn't mean it is. Now, you can say that you don't trust the testing the corporation ran on the safety of the product. But that is just conceding my original point which is that it's not gmos that are the problem, it's the companies that make them.

       That's the point I'm trying to make. You accept risk when you put trust in organizations whose only accountability is financial loss due to lawsuit. Be that from a private farmer or megacorps like Monsanto. That being said, I've seen far more outbreaks of human e.coli from vegetables that got shit on by underpaid and overworked field hands than I have of cancer from eating GMO soy. I'm not saying that all or even any GMOs are safe. I can't say that. You can't say that every GMOs is inherently unsafe either.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the same token, I will absolutely not say that GMOs should be allowed to be developed willy nilly and without regulation or oversight. But I will also not accept broad spectrum classification of GMOs as dangerous. And that's not what Tyson and Nye are doing either. I imagine they would all agree on every point I've made here. Responsible research and development of GMOs with proper safety and testing, done by companies who adhere to a proper code of ethics is nothing to be afraid of.

       okay i only see one organic thing on either of those links.  and it doesnt prove that it came from human feces. 
in fact it says "Traceback investigations of pre-packaged leafy greens purchased by ill persons identified State Garden as a common producer,
       <strong>
        but a source of contamination has not been identified.
       </strong>
       The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues its investigation to identify the source of the contamination."

       You are the king of congitive bias. "Organic" and "Non-organic" only determine what kind of chemicals and insecticides are used. They're still plants grown in the ground. They're still farmed like any other fruit or vegetable. Some companies use machines and college educated farmers. Some use actual people with boots on the ground. Most of the time, those people are day labor, who are paid based on what they pick, not how many hours they put it. They're not going to walk half a mile to go take a dump, especially if they are hung over and have the whiskey shits. They literally shit in the field. I know, because I've done this work. Some fields, a bathroom could be 20 minutes away. That's 40 minutes plus poop time round trip. That's a lot of money in picking time. Organic food is actually FAR more likely to be contaminated than non-organic food, because they have to use less effective organic cleaning solutions on the product. Further, E.coli is just one out of a hundred diseases you can catch from eating shit berries. You're more than welcome to search the CDC site for outbreaks from all diseases, if you want. I guarantee you will find a lot more cases of disease spread from pickers than you will of cancer caused by GMOs. GMOs, of course, are not immune from contamination from humans either.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the moral of the story, you pedantic twat, is that the REAL danger always comes back to the human element, human carelessness, human irresponsibility. Now, we've been arguing about this for 3 days. I'm finished. If you can't get even the simplist of concepts through your zealotry against GMOs, I'm going to treat you like every other anti-vaxxer and Flat earther, and climate denier i've spoken with on this sub.

       Yeah this isn't correct, and since you were being a pedant I thought I would as well.  Consider the food 'pizza' for instance.  Sure, perhaps the tomatoes in the sauce are GMOs, but the pepperoni is not.  That would mean that there are "GMOs in our food".  Food is usually made up of multiple ingredients,
       <em>
        some of which
       </em>
       are GMO.  So his wording was more correct than your correction.

       The topic of GMOs is very much akin to the topic of modern medicine. The technology, while not perfect, is fairly safe for consumers. The issue however is that corporations are more focused on turning a profit that they are taking shortcuts to get GMOs in the market (Or in the case of Monsato, terminate the crop during the less profitable time of the year).
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern Medicine is not inherently bad or insidious. It's marriage to corporations and stockholders who see to squeeze every penny for every treatment that turns people off. If this marriage or mindset ceased, I strongly believe that modern practices could cure, not treat, the vast majority of diseases and ailments.

       I used to farm, and have many friends and family who are farmers.  The number one major argument that these people always use to defend GMOs is that "we need it to feed the world."  This is total bullshit and nobody calls them on it.  GMOs are used on large farms typically with thousands of acres of corn or soybeans.  Even with GMOs, these farms don't come anywhere near close to producing the amount of food per acre that a smaller family farm that practices permaculture will produce.  No one disputes this fact, yet they keep parroting the same bullshit line of "it will feed the world."
      </p>
      <p>
       It actually will do the opposite of feed the world, because its fostering a system of farming that is MUCH less productive per acre, and more and more small family farms go bankrupt every year.  If they really cared about "feeding the world" they would make policy changes that would foster the resurgence of the type of farm that has vegetables, grains, chickens, bees, beans, etc.  But they won't do that, because what they really care about is Monsanto's bottom line.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying GMOs aren't more productive compared to non-GMO corn.  I know a lot of corn farmers, and they all grow GMO and are happy with it.  What I'm saying is that the argument that GMOs are necessary to feed the worlds population is disingenuous because if that was really your concern you would desperately be trying to encourage small diversified farms, because that will have a MUCH larger impact on total food production compared to GMO corn vs non-GMO corn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the fact that by many accounts, there's already more than enough food being grown and raised for everyone.  The issue is much of it gets wasted or doesn't reach the people who need it, and actual high quality food is diminishing.  Increasing the yields of corn fields is not the solution to this problem.  As small farms slowly die out, high quality meats, eggs, cheese, and fresh vegetables are becoming only for the rich.  This is the real cause of the problems with our food supply, but you don't hear about it because heirloom tomatoes don't have a powerful lobby like GMO corn does.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can keep pretending that higher yield dent corn is the solution to our food system problems though.  I guess that's the intellectual, no-nonsense, official scientist position.  Because nobody knows farming like scientists.

       The problem isn't the GMO.  The problem is glyphosate.  The crops are GMO'ed to withstand glyphosate so the farmers can use it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Farmers spray glyphosate 2 weeks before harvest because they can harvest sooner, have larger harvests, and it's easy to harvest.
      </p>
      <p>
       The modern "gluten allergy" epidemic going on right now is an allergic reaction to glyphosate.

       That's a good point. Wouldn't it of been more scientifically precise for nye and degrasse to talk about the benefits of gmo's to end world hunger insteaded of making this huge blanket statment that americans should eat gmo's and not worry? If you're in a developing culture that can't even eat one meal a day, get any source of eatable food you can over there asap. But if you have the choice, avoid gmo's. No way in hell Neil &amp; Bill are eating gmo foods anytime soon, I would bet on that.

       Organic foods do not allow fluoride based pesticides. This is one of my main concerns.

      <p>
       And I think what you say is true only if you don't account for the fact that some of the genetic modification builds the pesticides right into the plant so you don't have to use as much.

       Sure and I would never knock you for being skeptical, skepticism is a wonderful trait. But there are a lot of non qualified individuals, 'health bloggers', that dispense bad information daily. Doesn't mean you should toe the line that the big companies put out, but refuting a study, even a flawed study, with junk science is far worse and becoming all too common.

       GMO's are a fix to the esoteric issue of a thing belonging to everyone and may instead belong to a corporation.

       A corporation is a legal person boarded by persons who vote on who the person will be publicly. Many heads and yet only one body.

       What I'm showing you is that it isn't the GMO plant in itself that is harmful, it's why they make it GMO that is harmful - to dose it in super potent pesticides.

       This I would agree with.  Additionally it means that they can create some super nasty herbicides, make a GMO plant that is immune to them, and then spray that shit on them with no regard for anything other than the GMO plant they are being sprayed on.  Could be the most carcinogenic crap we are spraying, but it's ok because the plant was made to withstand it.  Plus it'll take 50 years to figure out how carcinogenic the herbicide is.  Obviously the company that created it will know way sooner than the rest of us, but they won't tell anyone and once found out they'll just get a slap on the wrist.

       That's a fair point, I hadn't read up on that but seems like a legitimate criticism of agriculture. GMO technology could certainly be used irresponsibly or facilitate irresponsible farming practices.

       Same thing in my mind.  I don't see us being harmed by the GMO food itself.  I see GMO food and food that has been selectively breed for years and years as the same thing.  One is just faster.  I will say that since selective breeding is slower that allows us to study what we spray onto them for a much longer period of time, but that hardly matters when we have case after case of companies knowing something is harmful to us, yet not releasing that info because they'll get in trouble or it'll cut into their profits (and I'm not just talking about specifically food related industries, this is a problem throughout our entire nation/world).

       okay i only see one organic thing on either of those links.  and it doesnt prove that it came from human feces. 
in fact it says "Traceback investigations of pre-packaged leafy greens purchased by ill persons identified State Garden as a common producer,
       <strong>
        but a source of contamination has not been identified.
       </strong>
       The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues its investigation to identify the source of the contamination."
