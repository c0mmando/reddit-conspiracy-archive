       As you haven't even defined what you consider 'interest' to be it just might be, plenty of people have shown interest in the thread now so what's the beef man? If you want this to be known just get it out there on as many different forums and relevant subs as you possibly can and the internet will do the rest, if it's of any value to interested parties.

       All we other users can do is read it and assess whether it is of interest or relevance to us. This post has 69 comments now, mostly complaining about the nature of the post. Maybe there should have been 69 comments discussing the actual info.

       The problem is that there are lots of people who drop hints about having some huge bombshell and then never follow up. Maybe you do have lots of information, and maybe you don't, but past experience shows that the people with lots of information don't mess around with these kinds of "if there's enough interest..." teasing games.

       This isn't info that can be conveyed quickly. There are many links to info and there is disinfo mixed with the info. I can't just list stuff off and people will know it all. There is too much info to do that. You need to view the sources like I did.. even then people still may not get it because it requires a lot of knowledge to understand it.

       Really? Because it seems like you're asking for attention, and hyping up that you will share something you're excited about, but you never really get to the point, or even close to it.

       Because looking through your post history you never say what it is you think you're on to. You just say you want people paying attention to you to make you feel ready to share.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just get to the point, because this looks a lot more like an attempt to market a comic book than share a conspiracy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I have no clue what Q has to do with any of this. That just seems like another attempt to deflect from answering any questions about what you're talking about.

       Your post links to another post that links to an outline for a comic book. Now you want me to sort through 250 comments, most of which are calling you out for not sharing any info, and you act like it's my fault for not understanding what you're tying to share.
      </p>

       I'm interested in listening, but if you can't explain yourself, that's on you man. If you really want people to listen to what you're saying, you need to be show a little initiative as far as communication goes.

       It's worth it man.. It's not easy to understand.. Just trust me.. that's all I can say. I am doing the best i can.. There's a reason for this..

       So let me try to follow your logic. It's not easy to understand, but it's easier to understand by just not sharing. There's a reason, but that reason can't be communicated. You need help, but can't communicate what that help is.

       I wanted help in the past because people won't listen to me.. they won't go through the process to learn what they need to. I would have taken people through the same info you are now...

      <p>
       I have told people before.. all this info is out there.. people just haven't put the pieces together properly.. they don't see what is really going on.. they have been convinced to ignore what is so important.. maybe even because it is so simple...

       Bullshit. You complain about people not listening, but there are 250 comments in this post from people listening to you. Most of them center around, "I'm here, I'm listening" and your only response is "I can't tell you, you wouldn't understand"
      </p>
      <p>
       You say all the info is out there, but you don't even give the slightest hint what you're talking about and seem to go to great lengths to keep people from understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all I know, your big secret might have to do with lizard people, the vegas shooter, the trump administration, or the fucking tooth fairy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is because instead of putting the most miniscule amount of effort into explaining yourself, you put all your effort into saying "I can't explain it so look through all the times I haven't explained anything and figure out what I'm explaining"
      </p>
      <p>
       It feels like your whole goal is to make it as tough for people to understand what you're talking about as possible, then complain when people don't understand what you're talking about. You're incredibly frustrating and self-defeating.

       If they were listening then they would read the sources.. you need to go through the sources..

       People won't understand this without understanding the sources...

       Then why don't you put your sources in your post, and a general idea of what they have in common? Why link to another post you made, that only links to a comic book you made?
      </p>
      <p>
       Physics is complicated. Computer science is complicated. You'd understand it better if you read a couple 1000 page text books. But if you asked me how voltage works, or how assembly instructions are translated into machine code, I could give you a synopsis because I studied it and understand it. If I told you you could never understand it just by me explaining, it would probably be because I didn't know those topics well enough to explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       And honestly, if your idea isn't important enough to explain, and  to provide a list of sources in the body of your post, and to provide the slightest idea of what ties them together, but you do have the time and energy to spend hours on end coming up with excuses, your idea is probably bullshit.

       Go fuck yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't take the time to put your sources in your post, or to link to them when somebody is trying to listen to you ("but boo hoo, nobody listens to me"), I don't have time to read through 300 comments of you not explaining yourself, just to get to some bullshit source that you can't explain the importance of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, this is very narcissistic behavior when you assume that your time is so important that you can't put sources in your post, but my time is so unimportant that it should be no big deal for me to go through 300 comments just to get the vaguest idea of what the fuck you're talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, go fuck yourself.

       That has to be the case right? I’ve tried to help this kid, but he doesn’t seem to want to actually convey any information. It has to be for the attention, hence the attempt at what can only be keeping everyone on the hook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read the threads, read the sources, watch the videos, discuss and care! Only then will you be ready to ask OP wtf he’s talking about, and only if he deems you worthy to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just think of him like Q except even more important, and then sit at the edge of your seat and hold your breath through months of “drops” which aren’t actually drops at all and then perhaps you may be ready to hear the truth. Perhaps

       They don't have to be upvotes.. but the thread will drop if they don't then no one will see it.. so why bother? If you want the truth out then lets do it.. what do you have to lose?

       They’re called shills, my man. And their purpose is to stifle any and all meaningful dialogue by downvoting everything and being trolls.

       That’s why you’re being downvoted. I promise, the majority of real users here would love to hear what you have to say.

      <p>
       But don’t tease it, don’t look for “interest”, just do it. Us folks around here have grown quite tired of people toying with the notion of releasing information only to have them fade away without doing such.

       Because you don’t need to be begging for attention or interest. This is a conspiracy sub; the interest is already here. If you have info, why do people have to beg you for it? You’re probably being downvoted because of the “you’re not worthy” tone of your post.

       No but I honestly think he came on the scene after I discovered what I did as a distraction from my info.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also have aspergers and when I started looking for people in the media to convey my info Sandy Hook happened.. who was an aspie - had aspergers. This is the only aspie incident like this I am aware of..

       Because the only thing that allowed me to discover what I did IMO is that I have aspergers.. and what my dad saw.

      <p>
       People with aspergers have a laser like focus on things.. and an ability to not be conditioned by public opinion.. public opinion like people think people with aspergers are nuts.. which the Sandy hook incident did at that time..

       Not really. Saying you're going to release it and actually releasing it aren't the same thing. You keep asking people to imagine you as Q. I think you might not realize that a lot of people find Q's style of posting to be tiresome and annoying, so comparing yourself to them isn't helping your case.

       Because I am leading you through the info as I discovered it.. this is the only way I know how to do it..

       Disinfo is mixed in with the info.. there is too much info for me to just convey it all myself.. you need to go through the sources otherwise you will never understand it..

       I mean I get it, but you're claim of having all this info assumes it's interesting to everyone. I'd be interested in an observational sense, like ,you lay everything out so then people can decide if they personally find it interesting enough to keep engaging on the topic. I don't have much familiarity with the topics you're laying out.

       Watched it. Element 115 being key to anti-gravity or something. Dude claims to have worked at area 51 and saw aliens were using it or something. You wanna suprise the video a little more eloquently for me? Like I said, without context, I have no idea what I'm supposed to be taking from this. I'm not trusting this guy at face value, I have no idea who he is.

       Well I checked your post history and around 45 days ago you made some similar threads with roughly the same outcome (people asking for the info, you telling them you can't just say it like that)
      </p>
      <p>
       I went back a year and you were asking about how to release information etc aswell, very similar to now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe you have something that you feel is very important that you want to share, and that most people will not fully understand... so what do YOU actually want to do with this information? Because it's been over a year I assume and you havnt released anything

       Comic books..
      </p>
      <p>
       Comic books are the most powerful media in the world right now.. they are the biggest threat to the people in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 50s there was a huge attack on comic books by the establishment.. they made it so parents were afraid to let their kids read them
      </p>
      <p>
       I know the government did this to destroy that threat,.. then the government took control of this industry.. DC and Marvel comics are likely fronts for the government..I would bet Stan Lee is a government agent himself... and comic book creators are likely MK Ultra.. they control comics just like the movie industry and other entertainers.
      </p>
      <p>
       They made comics a joke as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a guy who wanted to make comics educational in the 50s.. he died under suspect conditions... No one else has ever considered this I am aware of but I think it was for this reason..

       No. But anybody who claims to know the truth, claims everyone else is too dumb to understand the truth, spends 6 hours telling other people to read every god damn thing they've posted on reddit instead of linking to a source, all under a post that could be easily retitled "Look at me! Look at me! I might tell you something if you look at me!" most certainly is a narcissist.

       Please upvote this post... so people see it. The saucer Lazar said he saw is the exact same saucer my father saw in the late 60s in northern Washington.
      </p>
      <p>
       My father told my mother about what he saw a couple years later.
      </p>
      <p>
       My father was driving on a 2 lane highway on his way to a small town in northern Washington near the Canadian border.. He saw the same type of saucer lazar said he witnessed.. it was hovering over the powerlines next to the road.
      </p>
      <p>
       This info was what made me research all this.. I need to convey to you all what I discovered researching this..

       Glory Hole. On the receiving end. I'll be more interested when you give something of substance BEFORE you ask for monetary donations.

       If what you say and provide as concrete evidence, i.e. pics or it didn't happen, then you'll have the support you are attempting to receive without having to ask for it.

       That was a metaphor. Evidence proves itself. Your hanging a piece of candy in front of people's noses hoping to snag one for whatever reason; malicious or benign.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's the thing. You haven't shown anyone anything, least of all how to put "it" together. So how about something a little less vague than my dad saw something back in the 60's.

       I've been awake since I was about 4 or 5. I am in my 30's now. If you have anything to give me outside of vagueties, I promise I will not shy away. I've done years, decades now, of research, as you claim to have done, and in no way, shape, form, function or variety have you led me to believe that you have anything to offer outside of a delusion.

       So you're trying to get people to smell a scratch and sniff by only looking at it and guessing what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I gather you want people to look into the multitude of UFO phemona; but are you suggesting they are ET or in fact terrestrial? Even more, they have the answers, but because it remains hidden it won't disclose itself? And, even more,that all of the technology that we preclude is in fact being hidden is in fact being hidden?

      <p>
       The human mind is only limited by itself. If it has been thought of it has been attempted to be put into practice; therefore it either must already exist in sime fashion or it will exist Either here or there; Cogito; ergo sum.
      </p>
      <p>
       You claim you have aspbergers, yet don't proclaim anything else except that you have serious information that could change the face of humanity... but not enough people are interested so you won't divulge the information.
      </p>

       I know how this game works. I've played it with myself. Such is philosophy. Such is an entertaining thought. It leads full circle back to nowhere and everywhere.

       Hey, when I get drunk I've been told I don't make sense either. I make perfect sense to myself, but because what I know I am talking about doesn't make sense to those I am trying to talk to... they do not have the knowledge or understanding on a certain level... wh00sh over the head, then you're labeled a nut and they're just frustrated.

       In this case, your case, I am still calling Glory Hole. You are looking for acceptance for what you think you know. Either spill it and receive validation. Or keep shut and continue with your delusion, just quit dragging people along in this way. It doesn't help or hurt any of us, but it may be hurting you.

       He’s got nothing but delusions of grandeur. I saw in another post that his big info has to do with free energy and antigravity as well as proof that an advanced civilization existed on Earth. He says we probably wouldn’t be able to understand most of it. He also self-diagnosed himself with Aspergers and ADHD and diagnosed his parent with Narcissistic Personality Disorder.
      </p>

       By the way, I get a very specific voice in my head when I read OP’s comments and I feel like my image of him is pretty accurate.

       Or maybe I am right.. I have seen many things go mainstream that no one would have believed when I was convinced..
      </p>
      <p>
       Being a conspiracy theorist yourself you should understand that.. or are you trying to suppress the truth? About aspergers as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it.. if anyone was going to discover the truth don't you think it would be an unemployed aspie living with his parents? Why do you think those people are demonized.. think about it.. everyone else is too busy to find the truth..
      </p>
      <p>
       Aspies aren't necessarily smarter.. we just have no life like normal people.. which is why Einstein discovered what he did or Temple Grandin etc.. even normal scientists aren't capable of this because they go with the flow of society.. unlike aspies.. we have never gone with the flow... we don't know how to..

       If you had knowledge of the technology to build a free energy device and an antigravity device you’d be very valuable to a whole lot of people and if you were as smart as you think you are you would have already reached out to some of those people and you wouldn’t be asking for money and attention on reddit.

       No.. because what will happen id that people will likely pick and choose info from what I post.. post that themselves and pretend they came up with it.. like on Youtube and things.

       Why does it matter if someone else pretends they come up with it? And if you posted a PDF with all the info first, then couldn't you always prove you posted it first at least?

       It just seems odd to me that you "need to see a lot of interest". You'd probably tell us to remain skeptical, to trust but verify, and yet you are asking us to do the opposite of that.

       Just so you know how reddit works, typically you put the content together and post it, and then if the content is good the post rises to the frontpage and everyone sees it, and it's all contained there.
      </p>
      <p>
       By doing this you are fragmenting the release, since there will now be at least two separate posts with information from this event.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are here, you can check the sidebar and see how many are currently here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know I might be mistaken, but from what I've seen on this subreddit you may have just shot yourself in the foot here, killing any momentum you could have built by dropping something meaningful as your first post.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, that would have made a lot of sense wouldn't it have? Assuming you have a bunch of different findings, you could have posted one or two good ones and went from there, kinda like what Q has been doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you've come out the gate looking like someone who is either fishing for attention or trying to mislead the community (by getting them to start taking people at their word and trusting them without a single bit of information released).

       Probably to maximize the impact it would have, keep the whole thing being talked about for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference is that he actually started off with some pretty important stuff, immediately cementing his reputation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if Q had begun by saying "hey guys I have all this info but I need to know you are paying attention to me first".
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't work like that. You drop something meaningful and then people pay attention. Even if you drop something meaningful now, people might blow you off just because you annoyed them with this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your best move now is to make a new post, open it up with an apology for this one, and then DROP SOMETHING MEANINGFUL.

       Right now there is no story. All of the actual info you've released is spread through a bunch of random comment threads. Like I said, you are doing exactly what you hoped to avoid here. Please just make a new post with some actual info in it and salvage this mess, for your own sake.

       People can read it all here.. This is why I want interest.. so there are many people here going over the info. I think people are more likely to get involved this way than to read a long post. It's interactive.. I am just doing the best I can.. I wrote a long story and no one read that...  so what choice do I have but to try it another way?

       I'll read your long story. I'm not going to wade through a handful of threads crap talking you to try to piece together your information. Nothing personal.

       Would love to read something real from you though. You will have my full attention! Maybe others feel the same way, and this wasn't such a bad idea after all. Now you have everyone's attention, how will you use it?

       Yes... I'd already read that story long ago, just like the video you linked to and the ones you mentioned (but didn't link for some reason).

       At this point I'm 99% certain you're a teenager who wants attention. Go ahead and stop replying to me now, because you will find no more patience or sympathy from me.

       You've said some parts are disinfo, some are not. Can you summerise which parts are most important? What do you want us to take from these videos?

       I said I could maybe do it in a couple days if some people who are really knowledgeable may be able to get it.. Keep in mind though that back then this stuff was a lot less known.. there were things I couldn't include in my story a couple years ago because people would think they were impossible but there is an awakening happening now..

       Trying to save them time from reading this thread.

       Sounds like you're lonely and need some friends. If you're that bored, there are hobbies that don't cost any money to pick up. Might be better than LARPing around on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care either way. You're most likely not aware of anything that hasn't been brought up on this thread already. Some of the smartest and well researched people come here and actually deliver goods.... without asking for upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       A true individual that would want the world to know would do just that. No one in the reality of information sharing would dare care about upvotes. They'd let their info speak for itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're lame, this thread is lame, and it's too bad it's shit like this that's clogging up r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So much potential for a strong community here ... and this guy is just worried about getting 500 "likes" before his info is ready to be released. Watching too much Black Mirror, by the sounds of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't you shut all us naysayers up with some solid info ... it's because you either don't have it, or, you don't have it. I don't think you have it. And every comment you prove that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying you and you're info is important is a hell of a lot different than your peers deciding that.

       You are not presenting any info to be suppressed. Other than you are a middle aged man that is unemployed who blames his problems on the mom who is financially supporting you. Maybe you have aspergers, but Im skeptical since its self diagnosis and you insist that you know more than any psychologist. To me you sound delusional, you probably have some other mental heath issue.

       Seek help from a professional or continue to suffer. That is up to you.

       I know more about myself than any psychologist.. if you knew how aspergers was diagnosed then you would get that..
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you don't understand how someone can self diagnose aspergers because younger people now don't go through what I did.. aspergers is more well known now.. when I was young it wasn't. If it was I wouldn't have had to self diagnose.. it wouldn't be so obvious and ignored..
      </p>

       Nice job shooting the messenger though.. whose side are you on again? Probably the side that knows what a threat people with aspergers are...

       Im 41.  my grandmother on my moms side was a paranoid schizophrenic, my dad was bipolar and an addict. I have clinical depression and anxiety which I have talked to mental health professionals about. Hell, I might be on the spectrum myself. Ive also worked in hospitals with mental health units. Im not a mental health professional, but Im no laymen on the subject and I take exception to you make assumptions about my age.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also no more about myself than any psychologist. Part of their job is diagnosis, and the other part is for them to teach you tools to be a happy and functional adult. Which you are neither right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       You begged for donations and upvotes for you to release information. That raises red flags about your intent, not just to me but to many others.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you cant figure out how to be independent from your supposedly abusive mom or hold a job, I highly doubt you are a threat to any side.
      </p>
      <p>
       My intention isnt to shoot the messenger. I dont doubt that you have mental health issues. But you need to talk to a professional.  Im pretty sure you are mis-diagnosing youself

       Instead of posting meaningless links in hopes people start to discuss them and you “leading” us to “enlightenment” delete your posts, take the time to do a write up and provide your evidence. As it stands now you’re crying out for attention that not many if any will give.

       <em>

       is a great way to get everyone to ignore everything you're saying.

       This seems more like trolling. That or a mental issue, if so get help man. You state that things are bad, get your life in order, get your thoughts in order. If you have new information, please share it. 
 Otherwise, please stop.

       Only half the story I wrote is up.. No one read the first half so I haven't done the rest.. but I have a lot of it but haven't put it up. I was considering reworking everything I have already.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just tried to dramatize things to get people to follow along. A lot of things are just educated guesses or dramatized to make people understand them better.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the characters is based on me but a dramatized version.. I think I could build one of these devices and it might work similar to what I showed... I could do what the character would but I wouldn't do it in real life... but it makes an interesting story and shows the real world issues..

       Again, all of this piecemeal, nonsensical "I have the answer" isn't getting you nowhere. You keep asking for help on how to get this information out, many people have provided you with paths to follow, yet you continue to sing the same song.

       Throughout this entire thread I either see egos or shills.. or both...
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people are more upset that they couldn't find the truth rather than wanting the truth..
      </p>
      <p>
       So even if I told them the truth they wouldn't believe it.. It's going to be funny if any of these people discover the truth and then have to go through what I have to try to explain it to people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe this is the problem with society.. they aren't looking for the truth.. they think they are too smart to not understand what is happening... so they are waiting for one person to come out and reveal all the secrets because they couldn't have possibly missed them themselves.. and that is how the whole con works..

       I said it elsewhere but you sound exactly like Tom Delonge. Saying you have all this info and anyone could see it but yet only you were able to finally put it all together and want to share it but just can't yet because.....uh yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus you are all over this thread posting links, then replying to your own comments (running up this post comments, kinda click-bait) and begging  people to upvote to show interest. Dude this is the conspiracy sub even if your info is bullshit someone here is gonna find it interesting so just post it. You gotta nothing to gain from internet points.

       why don't you just trust me? Instead of assuming you know how I should convey my info better than I do...
      </p>
      <p>
       And DeLonge came on the scene when I was first trying to get attention for what i discovered... I honestly think they had gotten wind of what i had discovered and created a disinfo agent just like me so I wouldn't be taken seriously.. many disinfo agents have come out with pieces of info I felt I discovered.

       I don't just hand out my trust so easily. All I'm saying is if you have any sort of information, even if it's just your own theories that lead no where, then post it. Don't beg for upvotes to gauge interest, again your in the conspiracy sub. We are literally here for this and other stuff like it. Also please don't say your worried about
       <strong>
        <em>
         them

       Basically you want people to read all the books you have read, watch all the vids you have watched and then listen to your theory on how they are connected. When they say ‘Actually we are quite busy doing other stuff right now’ you say they are shills and dont deserve the ‘truth’.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do have anything then you need to find a way to condense your theory or infomation into something manageable. I don’t need to have studied the fossil record first hand to grasp evolution.

       I mean I get it, but you're claim of having all this info assumes it's interesting to everyone. I'd be interested in an observational sense, like ,you lay everything out so then people can decide if they personally find it interesting enough to keep engaging on the topic. I don't have much familiarity with the topics you're laying out.
