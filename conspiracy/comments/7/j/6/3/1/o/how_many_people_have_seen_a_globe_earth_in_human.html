       You do have to take their word for it. There's no strict evidence to support any other theory, but the lowkey possibility, no matter how out there it is, still exists.

       Would you think the earth is flat? That it's hollow? That we're a simulation, and that the people who know are keeping it under wraps to avoid mass panic so they Photoshop and create such images.

       That's assuming parallel light rays on a sphere.
A point light with divergent light rays on a plane gives the same result.

       As the other user responded to you how the Eratosthenes experiment can also calculate correctly for a nearby sun scenario. And go google the ships "disappearing" over the curve, there are tons of videos I think it is the Nikon camera, it has a super zoom as soon as they disappear from the naked eye just use the camera and there are the ships. No curve. And yes, they've attached GoPros to weather balloons.
I guess the weirdest thing NO ONE can debunk is how the moonlight gives off colder light than the sun, like in the shadows of moonlight is warmer than in direct moonlight (exact opposite of the sun)

       They don't all fly the "same route."  First "route" is kinda meaningless when you're talking about orbital dynamics -- the term you're really thinking of is orbital inclination.  Generally, US craft orbit at an inclination of around 28 degrees, because that's the ideal inclination to launch from off of Cape Canaveral.  (The closer you are to the equator, the faster yore moving due to the earth's rotation, and the more kinetic energy you can add to your launch to help achieve orbit.)
      </p>
      <p>
       ISS, however, is at 51.6 degrees.  That's the same inclination that MIR had, because that's the inclination of orbit that's easiest to get launching from Baikonur (Russia's space center in Siberia) without passing over Chinese airspace.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the Russians and the US were negotiating the placement of the ISS, they chose the inclination that's easer for the cosmonauts because the more inclined towards polar orbit the inclination is, the greater he percentage of land that you will eventually pass over, so the more-inclined Russian orbit had greater scientific value.

       Dude don’t even bother. These people are fucking nuts and nothing you say will change it... The second you mention orbital mechanics or anything based on scientific fact they’ll just get defensive and spew more garbage.

      <p>
       This thing about the same route is comical but how do you explain something as simple as ‘closer to equator = less energy required to leave orbit’ when they think we live on a damn dinner plate. It’s unreal.

       Yes I am in fact reactionary when people spread blatant lies. Shocking. Why would I back up scientific fact. I could literally throw thousands of facts at you and you would brush them aside the same way you brush aside literal video of live shooters. Much like you feel no need to prove your insane theories and rely instead on “you can’t prove my invisible friend isn’t really there”.

      <p>
       So, think about this for a second.  There are a little over 2000 operational satellites in orbit.  The earth's surface area is just under 200 million square miles. So if you were to place every satellite on the earth's surface, spaced evenly, each satellite would be about 300 miles from its closest neighbor. Obviously satellites aren't evenly spread around the glove, but they are deliberately kept in different orbits to avoid crashing -- any given satellite will be at least dozens of miles from the nearest satellite, each of which will be moving extremely rapidly compared to its neighbors.  (Orbit is FAST, and the velocity changes quickly depending on orbit -- a satellite orbiting at an altitude of 620 miles will be moving over 1000 mph relative to one orbiting at 680 miles.)  So not surprising you can't see any others.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Where are the stars?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You can't see them, because it's daytime.  Any camera aperture that won't be washed out by viewing the satellite in daytime isn't sensitive enough to see the stars, which you can only see at night.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

      <p>
       That's the Hubble Space Telescope.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Where are the millions of other satellites?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, there are only about 2,200 operational satellites at the moment.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What about space trash in orbit?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The vast majority of space trash is less than 10 cm, so impossible to see from any distance besides right up close -- plus, from the reference point of any orbit, even the closest debris will be traveling at relative velocity of hundreds of miles an hour.  No suprise you can't see something a couple centimeters across, dozens of miles away, traveling at a couple hundred miles per hour.

       Nope. Anything in "shadow" at night is actually losing heat less quickly because it can't radiate that heat away as quickly. The moon has nothing to do with it.

       These are all interesting points but I wouldn't say conclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Re: the linked video experiment: GREAT real-world experiment but hardly ACCURATE scientifically since in the photos you can see all kinds of mismatched rulers, bent rulers, etc. which are hard to account for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, and this may play in to the horizon issue, there is a such thing as atmospheric lensing/refracting, which may dillute such mesurements. The point of the ships is, can you show a ship going over the curve? We cannot prove a negative, and why you see "some" obfuscation near the bottom is mainly due to waves (the water is not 100% flat) at varying distances blocking your view. I think unless you can prove otherwise, at very least you have to admit that ships disappearing over a horizon is essentially an old wives tale. Def NOT science.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I think you are saying the same thing, the shadows are losing heat less quickly. You are just reversing the language. The moonlight is COOLING things. Otherwise, how does the moon have nothing to do with it if yoiu are in the moon's "shadow" as you say? In the daytime, do you say you are losing cool less quickly when you are in the shade from the sunlight? It's just words one way or the other.

       The math doesnt add up. You can figure this out at home.

       The method you are suggesting works on one spot and one spot only. When you take measurements from other locations at the same time the angles dont add up.

       Eratosthenes actually disproves a FE.

       You cannot see the 3d curvature of the Earth though. Basic geometry. You are seeing a 360 horizon-line. Already stated in this thread the ISS at ~400KM can only see ~2000KM in any direction.

       Nowhere was it stated that Earth isn't a globe, but, it's very loathsome watching people rationalize it being one with faulty logic. Also, officially its both flat and spherical. The Earth is planer geodesic frames in local perspective, and it becomes a geoid which is defined by Einstein's curving of spacetime, where gravity is measured as potentiality.

       You might be aware since there are Navy documents stating this.

       In that case dust mites  have also witnessed a "globe finger" if you have ever had them on the tip of your hands. ISS can only see ~2000km in any direction. The curvature is merely the horizon line and vanishing point. No different than being in an open field with the same 360 degree horizon.

       The ISS only sees ~3000km in any direction. You are not seeing the curvature of the Earth from the ISS, it's actually a 360-horizon line.

       Look at any picture of it. Standing over a flat plane with a vanishing point would yield the exact same frame of reference.

       SOOO fake. 
1st one: Where are all the other satellites? Where are the stars? Def a composite image.
2nd one: What satellite is this? All it shows is something that could very well be high in our atmosphere. Where are the millions of other satellites? What about space trash in orbit?
