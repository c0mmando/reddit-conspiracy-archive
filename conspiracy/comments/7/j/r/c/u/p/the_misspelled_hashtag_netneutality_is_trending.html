    <div class="md"><p>People point to pre-2015 internet to make it seem like we&#39;ll go back to a time before censorship. This is literally the top FCC talking point. It&#39;s propaganda. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/myth-vs-fact-chairman-pais-restoring-internet-freedom-order">https://www.fcc.gov/document/myth-vs-fact-chairman-pais-restoring-internet-freedom-order</a></p>

<p>The reality is, nothing about net neutrality impacts the censorship found on YouTube, Reddit, Facebook, or Twitter. Everyone will continue to be allowed to censor content they don&#39;t like. </p>

<p>Now that that FCC talking point is out of the way. There are a few things people want net neutrality to protect. </p>

<p>First, content creators rely on the internet for distribution of their creations. If Comcast decides to create an alternative user made video site, they can just throttle down the speed of all of the competitors. Thus forcing people to leave those other sites, if they want legitimate speeds. </p>

<p>Second, ISPs can block sites outright or simply charge money to access those sites. So, do you want a package that covers everything, like we have today? Or do you want to have to pay extra to access certain sites?</p>

<p>There are certainly other complaints in favor of keeping net neutrality. The only one I&#39;ve seen in support of dropping net neutrality is censorship, which actually has nothing to do with net neutrality. It&#39;s a complete fabrication.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the clarification. Paying for site access sounds pretty horrible. Would a VPN be able to work around the speed throttling or would that be a systemic change as opposed slowing things down at specific addresses? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding is that a VPN would not help with specific sites that are blocked or throttled. In fact, this could open up the option for ISPs to block the use of VPN services. I&#39;m sure techies will come up with a solution, but it&#39;ll take a while. None of this might come to pass, but I&#39;d be shocked if AT&amp;T and Comcast don&#39;t have plans for this sort of thing. Especially considering how much money they&#39;ve spent lobbying for the destruction of net neutrality. They have to expect some return on that investment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On point 2.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d like to see the numbers on that. If you and your grandma are paying the same amount per month, they are making money from both of you. They&#39;re just making MORE from your grandma.</p>

<p>You pay for speed of delivery, and amount of data (or no data cap at all, which is better). Estimates put the cost to an ISP of 1GB of data in the fraction of a cent category. ISPs are very opaque in reporting this, but some estimates put 1GB of data to a home internet connection as low as 1/10th of a cent.</p>

<p>Assuming your Netflix numbers, let&#39;s do some math...</p>

<p>10hrs of Netflix a day
30 days
approx 3GB per hour for a Netflix stream (*)
= 900GB/month</p>

<p>If we&#39;re VERY generous to the ISP, and assume that they&#39;re paying a FULL penny per GB, then a habitual binge watcher costs the ISP $9.00/m</p>

<p>If we go low end to the 1/10th of a penny, it goes down to $0.90/m</p>

<p>There are obviously a lot of other costs , and there are line maintenance fees, but the ISPs aren&#39;t losing money on a serial Netflix binger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the thought out response. </p>

<p>Comcast as a whole averages a ~10% profit margin which is great,  but lends to the idea that other costs are really what you are paying for when you have a company that has such a massive physical/corporate infrastructure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This net neutrality thing is all about being able to block torrenting and file sharing. Once that is gone it will be tough to leak anything even remotely anonymous. Also, they want to destroy all the free stuff that&#39;s on the internet. Pirating is a problem sure, this is their way of making P2P service illegal.</p>

<p>I remember before my ISP sent me a letter saying it detected illegal activity, which was p2p sharing. Then Net Neutrality happened and the letters stopped coming, although I&#39;m sure they still track it. I think ending it would be a horrible idea and people keep trusting the people in power to do the right thing when we are on this very board because we know better than that!!</p>
