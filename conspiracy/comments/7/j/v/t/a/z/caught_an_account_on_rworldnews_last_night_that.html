       So, last night,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7jo201/david_cameron_to_trump_your_fake_news_act_is/">
        this thread
       </a>
       hit #1 on r/all since it's the usual "Ex-XXXX says something bad about Trump!" shit that reddit eats up. (It ended it's life with 87.5k karma)
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, I decided to looked at the
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/therecordcorrected">
        OP's post history
       </a>
       and discovered quite a few interesting things
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         It is a 1 year old account created 2 weeks after Trump won
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It has 2m post karma and 72k comment karma
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It posts Anti-Trump articles nearly 24 hours a day, several threads an hour. All in anti-trump subs or in subs where the Reddit circlejerk will pay attention.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <a href="https://snoopsnoo.com/u/therecordcorrected">
        First, let's take a look at it's stats through snoopsnoo
       </a>
       . As you can see, in the past year it has been quite active. It posts nearly 24 hours a day with it dying down between 3-5 before 'booting back up'. It's overwhelming majority of posts are in r/enoughtrumpspam, with it's other huge chunks being r/enough_sanders_spam, r/impeach_trump, r/worldnews, and r/democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at their activity timeline, you see it's a straight slope up with never a break. Here's a
       <a href="https://snoopsnoo.com/u/illuminatedwax">
        r/conspiracy mod for conparisen
       </a>
       and
       <a href="https://snoopsnoo.com/u/tarrock">
        here's me
       </a>
       . Notice how neither of us have a pure uphill straight line?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xON3rNP.png">
        Here's a pic of some of their posts in the last few hours
       </a>
       . That's just 1 27 inch monitor in a screencap. There's A LOT more. I know the #resistance is known for no-lifeing, but who has the time to trawl through motherjones, twitter, wsj, appleinsider, vox, newsweek, and thinkprogress (just to name a few of the sites they've posted news from in the past 24 hours) and search for anti-trump shit? Almost like they're being siphoned news to post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I pointed this out last night in the thread on r/worldnews and got one of the top comments with 770 karma before the mods deleted my chain (Which could be considered a personal attack which is against their rules, and nothing was done about the OP). But no surprise since Max over there was posting shareblue links the other day and if you believe that 4chan larp, the pheonix is a CTR plant.
      </p>
      <p>
       In summary, outside forces are heavily involved in reddit, both politically and advertising wise. Careful what you read.

       You can set up your account to automatically post submissions to the subreddits of your choosing. You give IFTTT an RSS feed to follow, your account info, and tell it where to post.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can have it just repost from other subs too.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how accounts like this one make over 28,000 submissions in a year.

       Yes, that is very suspicious. The problem with your comment is that it violated our personal attack rule, since it was a shill accusation. However, you did end up bringing this to our attention. While we can't do anything about it (it would violate Reddit policy to ban him with no proof), we can (and did) talk to the admins about it.

       You're damn right. And it applies to ALL of reddit. Especially ones of the "woke" variety. Treat information from  reddit like you would your most hated news network. It's really that bad and manipulated.
