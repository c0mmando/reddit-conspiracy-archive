       I'm just skeptical and question everything including presenting weed as a panacea to humankind.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Getting "stoned" is not really positive connotation in my book, even taking biblical reference.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Definition of the word "weed" is not really positive one - "a wild plant growing where it is not wanted and in competition with cultivated plants."
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The weed smell is not really attractive and it's actually much worse than tobacco smell imo.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In some cultures weed is called "devil's dick".

       If you don't like it. Don't use it. Or smoke it. From there you have no skin in the game anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's where I have an issue. Someone who doesn't like it or doesn't use it and decides it an evil crusade in the name of fear and starts telling everyone else what to do without any actual reason other than their own personal lack of knowledge and research of a very well studied plant.

       Well it is not as bad as alcohol, but it's not completely side-effect free. In the Netherlands its been sort of legal for a long time and my experience is that Dutch people generally smoke less weed than people from other countries, that is obviously a biased statement since a lot for people come here to smoke. The fact that its legal I think takes away the extra excitement in your teenage years about taking it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weed does have a different effect on different people I think, some people I know say it makes them lose focus for several days so they only use it on weekends and others instead get a bit more creative.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for me, I usually don't like the feeling of being stoned on weed, so I rarely actually use it and when I do its in moderation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure its not specifically a gateway drug, it definitely isn't addictive to the vast majority of the population and its a lot more difficult to die from a THC overdose than it is for pretty much all other drugs.

       I used to be fake, like my mindset was trying to be popular, an attention seeker. I started smoking weed and ever since i felt awake, transitioned from fakeness to understanding whats real and whats fake. all these things i tried to accomplished before smoking weed was just pointless. Weed was a revelation for me, if it wasnt for weed personally for me, it would taken me much much longer to reveal the whole fucked up world. I understand to some people weed not their thing and everyone reacts different to it.

       "I'm 38, and have been vaping cannabis and using edibles for chronic pain due to several back issues.

       Been using it every day for 1.5rs now. I'm on a pretty good dose too. I go through an oz every two weeks.

       I'm no longer taking any opiates, antidepressants, or the damn ADHD meds I was on for over a decade.

       The shit works, and I'm eternally pissed I was lied to, poisoned, and that they continue to stigmatize it's medical benefits.

       It is an excellent pain killer. I would highly recommend it. It saved my life.

       What. Really. Wow. Ydont say. The Catholic Church is older that the Mormon church. That's sarcasm in case you don't recognize it. Although. The Mormons will oddly tell you in a fantastic story about how they are the Original Christian Priesthood right from jebus.

       The point of all this. Stop telling other people what to think, do, and believe. The churches do it. It's widely recognized as bad. Don't be a church. Lol...

       No, but i don't hear that in restaurants. As a rule I think we see less drunks than people who are high out on a day to day basis.

       Is it? Aside from my pretty much coming out and saying it, what leads you to believe i am a stoner? Poor grammar? Incomplete sentences? A lack of punctuation? See what i did there?  Sit down homes, you've got nothing.
