<p>Ignoring the obvious bias in the writer&#39;s tone, I honestly don&#39;t know what to make of this. The global engagement stuff is ACTUALLY hidden in this military bill and the main thing that caught my attention was the very last line about it ceasing to exist exactly 8 years after created... like they were very sure a certain someone was going to be elected.

    <div class="md"><p>Government regulation, vs mega-corporation self regulation.  Neither option is very appealing, but I&#39;d settle for the one that at least pretends to have consumer protection in mind.  Regulatory capture ensures that we&#39;re pretty much fucked down the road, either way, but repealing protections just seems to speed it along.</p>

<p>Marx? You mean Clinton Roosevelt? He was the person who actually wrote the Communist Manifesto for TPTB, via the League of Just, then the Communist League. Marx merely put his name on it, then married into Royalty. Which isn&#39;t surprising, being that Marx was related to Rothschild.  Oh the webs TPTB weave...</p>

<p>Marxism/Communism was created by TPTB to get people to voluntarily (at first) hand over all rights, liberty, and personal property to the State who was owned by the Bankers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just watched it and it&#39;s sort of a shaky argument. On one hand, he claims that it would be &quot;suicide&quot; to throttle customers even though (granted it may have been different in 2015, I don&#39;t know) most people have 1 or 2 choices. I personally only have AT&amp;T here, nothing else. On the other hand, it&#39;s interesting seeing how NN could very easily be used to take down anything the govt declares &quot;bad info&quot;. </p>

<p>It just seems like whether or not NN was repealed or kept, we would get fucked in some way whether it be from something obviously dubious like ISPs throttling users &amp; charging for packages or something less obvious like a slow takedown of everything the govt deems &quot;bad info&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s definitely true. Does the internet really have to be classified as a utility? It&#39;s clearly one of the very last &quot;free&quot; things the people have and giving the government regulation over it makes me uneasy.</p>

<p>edit: A bit of side note but another thing that rubs me the wrong way is Ajit Pai blatantly doing and saying shit to piss people off. Why would he get in front of the public and do something like this: <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/12/13/ajit-pai-wants-you-to-know-you-can-still-harlem-shake-after-net-neutrality-video/">http://dailycaller.com/2017/12/13/ajit-pai-wants-you-to-know-you-can-still-harlem-shake-after-net-neutrality-video/</a> to intentionally get people to hate him?

    <div class="md"><p>In that case, ignore the narrative he&#39;s trying to push. There&#39;s still this &quot;global engagement act&quot; hidden in a long ass annual military bill. It&#39;s a real thing and it&#39;s purposely left ambiguous so they can take action on whatever they see fit. I suppose the main question is... does Net Neutrality give these type of powers leverage?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy lost me when he referred to everything being just fine before NN was put in place because the Free Market made it safe. He then went on to pose a question as to why an ISP would shoot themselves in the foot by throttling a fan favored site. I don&#39;t know what world this dude is from but where I live there is ONE high speed internet provider and fro what I understand, it&#39;s like that in a lot of places. There is no &quot;free market competition&quot; when it comes to ISP&#39;s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Global Statism isn&#39;t the end game written in the book which makes me believe that you haven&#39;t read the book. Plus you act like everything was perfect prior to 1913 which makes me believe you have little understanding of our own history. </p>

<p>What we are seeing is the end game of crony Capitalism which pits winners against losers... just like every other major empire in the history of empires. We are about as far away from the ideals written in the Communist Manifesto as you can possibly get. </p>
