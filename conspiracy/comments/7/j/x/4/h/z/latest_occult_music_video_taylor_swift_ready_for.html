        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is something I&#39;ve always been interested in.  The music industry has been inserting certain themes/symbols into music videos for years/decades.  I&#39;m not sure what to make of it but as somebody who is spiritual myself I don&#39;t rule out the possibility that the high level producers believe they are drawing upon a higher power to either manipulate the masses or simply make more money and power.</p>

<p>The latest video released today is Taylor Swifts lyric video for &quot;Ready for it&quot;.  Read the lyrics and ask yourself if you were to make a music video...what would it be about?  Just based off of the lyrics the video should be some kind of romance song involving a newer boyfriend/lover.  Now watch the video...not one bit of romance/sex or any kind of human to human interaction.  Instead the whole video is about Taylor Swift transforming into a super-being and performing magic/sorcery the whole time.  It&#39;s even spray painted on the staircase she walks up at the end of the video &quot;They&#39;re burning all of the witches&quot;.  I see these themes in music videos being released every day...I&#39;m going to start posting them when I see them.  Even if it&#39;s just to keep a record for my crazy self.  Here are a few of the lines...ask yourself: if there is no man in the music video, who is the &quot;he&quot; she is talking about?</p>

<p>&quot;Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he&#39;s a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin&#39; him for ransom&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I&#39;m gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every lover known in comparison is a failure&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All Music is Magick. It creates thoughts, emotions, and feelings that otherwise may never have existed or come to pass in that particular individual. In doing so it alters the base nature of reality, and can be used for good or bad. I haven&#39;t watched this particular video yet but I&#39;ll give it a look and edit my comment with my thoughts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your input.  I agree about music being magick...but can&#39;t ever talk to anyone about it because they think I&#39;m nuts (which I am).  Watch the actual video...it has much more in it.  I only posted the lyric video because I saw it trending on YouTube today.  Here&#39;s the actual video from about a month ago:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re definitely not nuts. I worked in the music industry for years and I can definitely see the symbolism and the way music influences people. It&#39;s one of the biggest culture creation tools out there. This transhumanist stuff is definitely a big theme right now. If Taylor was promoting cyberpunk culture I would be okay with it, but unfortunately her recent work doesn&#39;t look punk at all, she is clearly on the evil corporations side.</p>

<p>My friend Mark Devlin has some good music related rabbit holes for you to investigate if you&#39;re ever interested. Some of his theories are a bit crazy, but he still talks about some very blatant stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;It is inconceivable that those with
power and wealth would not band together with a common bond, a common
interest, and a long-range plan to decide and direct the future of the
world. For those with the resources, to do otherwise would be totally
irresponsible. I know that I would be the first to organize a conspiracy to
control the outcome of the future, if I were such a person and a conspiracy
did not yet exist. I would do it in an attempt to ensure the survival of the
principles in which I believe, the survival of my family, my survival, and
the survival of the human race, if for no other reason.&quot;-Bill Cooper</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree.  I&#39;ve said for years how she&#39;s one of the only ones who didn&#39;t go off the deep end.  I hope this isn&#39;t the beginning of her unravelling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real conspiracy: She&#39;s a raging lesbian</p>

<p>The music video is a series of metaphors for Taylor being trapped in the closet by the industry. Being gay is unprofitable especially for a 15 year old girl starting out in the conservative country crowd. You must conform to an ideal image that represents your teams values and her contact most definitely included homosexuality in it&#39;s morality clause. That&#39;s all it is. Don&#39;t think too deeply into this. Her girlfriend is also a big sci-fi nerd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good catch on the writing on the wall.  I&#39;m not sure what it means...all eyes really are on her.  Some of her videos have over 2 billion views.  I edited my comment above with an interesting quote from Katy Perry who I think is one of the most invested into this type of thing.  They are clearly <del>hiding things in plain sight</del> openly telling everybody they&#39;re putting subliminal messages and dark symbols in their videos about magic/witchcraft.</p>

I&#39;ve been looking into Laurel Canyon lately and have been blown away with some of the stuff that went on there.  Thanks for sharing.  Have you ever seen any of Mark Passio&#39;s stuff?  When you said Mark that&#39;s who I thought you were talking about first. </p>
