        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Miles Johnston of Bases Project said he saw a huge spider crawl out of a black box near TV transmitter antennas and then disappear into thin air, he talks about black goo a lot, an ancient <em>intelligent</em> sentient fluid that has emotional effects on people who interact with it, thinks it&#39;s related to the spider.</p>

<p>In children&#39;s book Shosun&#39;s Mistake a light orb appears to a little boy with an alien in it and speaks about his planet being covered in a sticky black goo that makes people really angry, he sent it on a meteor to Earth and it&#39;s everywhere now and needs the boy&#39;s help to clean it up.  </p>

<p>I was just watching Dark City and a big clear insect crawls out of a bad guy&#39;s head when he dies, they&#39;re in like another dimension.</p>

<p>In Morgellons desease or delusional parasitosis, people report wires coming out of their skin and remote viewers could see insects. I saw a crawling insect in my mind once but it felt like electronic weapons, like how they showed an Egyptian eye one time without being in a meditative state (spiritualists would say it&#39;s spells that seem like technology...)</p>

<p>I think Teslaphoresis or assembly of nanoparticles in a magnetic field has something to do with it: <a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/04/16/teslaphoresis-tesla-coil-causes-self-assembly-in-carbon-nanotubes/">https://hackaday.com/2016/04/16/teslaphoresis-tesla-coil-causes-self-assembly-in-carbon-nanotubes/</a></p>

<p>Clive De Carle said everyone has too much aluminium in their body cuz they add it to water.</p>

<p>In The Matrix they had to pull out an insect thing from Neo before taking him to Morpheus, the attacking ships looked like insects. </p>

<p>Harald Kautz-Vella says there&#39;s 2 black goos, is known as a highly telepathic blue shining stone in many cultures, at center of every ancient religion involving blood and fire sacrifices, an evil type crashed with meteors before stone age period, people would go to caves and have spiritual experiences, flows in laylines, is a self organizing intelligent liquid and speaking to it is speaking directly to Satan </p>

<p>Maree Batchelor says black goo comes out of her patients after healing sessions and it&#39;s controlled by negative aliens</p>

<p>(Transhumanism is kinda like GMO or fluoridated water or vaccine debate, people are gonna get angry but it&#39;s probably gonna get pushed anyway.)  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why the cabal gets away with so much shit. Because of people like you that are too hesitant to believe anything that falls outside their comfort zone. There&#39;s a hell of a lot of stuff going on that would shock and make anyone scared and they use that against us. Seriously, there&#39;s more to life than what we see and to brush someone off for exploring into the unknown is a fucking disservice and also a shame to this sub. </p>

<p>Sick of this general attitude of &quot;oh that doesn&#39;t sound believable therefore you&#39;re crazy and mentally insane you should probably get that checked out&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here ya go. A link to a transcript to a show called cosmic disclosure on Gaia streaming. David interviews a whistleblower that comes forth regarding underground bases and how he used to work on tissue samples. It started off with salmon filet size tissue samples and eventually moved him up to half bodies and other specimens. He goes on to say the stuff he saw looks like nothing that has come from this world. He goes on to say how they are working on alternative energy devices in underground bases and how huge the complex is and how secure it is. He goes on to say he&#39;s been threatened and has had his house broken into and stuff stolen. He talks about top secret state of the art satellites that can look into anyone&#39;s homes or even see in the walls etc. He goes on and on. The stuff he says sounds outlandish but he saw it first hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So a large degree of faith is required to believe this sort of thing?</p>

<p>Nothing he says can be verified, so we only have his word to go on. There is no evidence other than his spoken word, in fact I can&#39;t even find anything relating to this guy&#39;s name on a quick google search. He is mentioned on r/UFO back in 2013 as being prosecuted for operating some kind of commercial venture on a national wildlife refuge.</p>

<p>Why do you beleive what this man is saying is true?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope nothing about faith. What you do is look for facts. In this case, there are declassified documents on deep underground military bases. Don&#39;t buy his story if you want but it&#39;s easy to verify what he&#39;s discussing, I.E. Underground bases and alternative energy devices.</p>

<p>Why have such a dismissive attitude about everything? Such a waste of time to discuss these ideas with close minded folks such as yourself because everything is explained away and you can&#39;t connect dots you don&#39;t see right in front of you. </p>

<p>Such a waste of time. Why even bother being here on this sub with that closed mind of yours. </p>

<p>My original comment stands. The cabal loves people like you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only person being closed minded is you.</p>

<p>The only proof you have is some random person&#39;s word that he saw things he can&#39;t even really describe in any great detail. I also notice he quite often describe&#39;s things as how you would see them in movies. There is a bare minimum amount of depth to what this guy is even saying. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t even entertain the possibility that actually there isn&#39;t much proof this place even exists, let alone the possibility that this person might just be making everything up.</p>

<p>So again, where is the proof? I could literally create a mock interview with a friend of mine on the existence of unicorns and it would have as much evidence as this video.</p>

<p>&quot;Melanin detection by Fontana-Masson staining</p>

<p>MD filaments</p>

<p>Argentaffin and melanin granules are stained a blackish color with Fontana-Masson staining. Patient 1 had only hyaline filaments, and melanin staining of filament sections from this patient was negative. Patient 2 had some calluses with only blue filaments and some with only red filaments. <strong>Sections of blue filaments demonstrated positive melanin staining</strong>, while sections of red filaments lacked visible melanin staining. Patient 3 had calluses with red, white, and blue filaments; some of the filament sections from this patient were positive for melanin, while others were negative&quot;</p>

<p>While the clear/red filaments may not contain melanin, the blue filaments did indeed contain melanin. This means that colorful fibers are indeed a characteristic of Morgellons disease, but the primary characteristic seems to be systematic sphirochetal infection. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had some lucid dreams where I encountered the mind parasites. I saw one inside anderson cooper, so I pulled it out and smashed it until it broke. It was like a robotic creature. I figured the cia was using them for their assets or something. I also saw a satellite grid for projecting electromagnetic stuff to keep human thought within certain frequency ranges.</p>

<p>I know that this stuff is quite compelling, but its part of the 4th density exchange with 3rd density. Everything in 4th is thoughtform based. You can tune your consciousness with different beliefs and thoughtforms and you will get different realities. Some have control mechanisms, some do not.
<a href="http://www.lawofone.info/results.php?q=4th+density+exchange">http://www.lawofone.info/results.php?q=4th+density+exchange</a></p>

<p>You get to choose what path you follow. I know that within my heart I am free. I tune into love, and see those illusions for what they are. I find I can channel and connect with positive beings that are there furthering my own path of love. Spiritual power will always be more advanced than technology. If you find yourself too involved in virtual or simulated realms you should turn off your computer and go outside. Your mind will dream about what you <em>pay</em> attention too. Its all a dream, if you are looking at it from a higher vibrational perspective. Some believe the dream very strongly and wish to control what happens. The human collective consciousness is a dream, that has not the motive or will to wake itself out of its stupor. What you see in this world is a consequence of everyone. The path to freedom is a path walking with love for self, others, and nature.</p>

<p>Create your own dream with your soul and you will have nothing to fear.</p>

Personally my astral travels rarely encounter such things, but in an infinite universe you encounter it all every once in a while. Best way to disconnect is to stop feeding your mind electromagnetic information from a computer and go outside to look at real things. The mind will tap into the energy of the internet if you let it, and its far easier to hypnotize in that state. How many dreams do you have where you are just playing a game or watching a movie, rather than finding something real or spiritually relevant to your life?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This almost reads as The Secret World / Secret World Legends fan-fic (note: I love the lore of the game, so this isn&#39;t an insult at all). In the game, there&#39;s a black goo substance known as The Filth (among other names) that functions as a living mutagen of sorts, among some other Lovecraft-inspired existential creepiness. The Filth is sentient and has taken the form of twisted spider-like entities throughout the game. </p>

<p>There&#39;s not much of a point in this comment besides noting the similarities. Cool post though. </p>
