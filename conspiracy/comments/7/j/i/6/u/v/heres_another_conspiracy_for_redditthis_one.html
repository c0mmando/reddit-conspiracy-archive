       Coinciding with this statistic is the number of heroin addicts which has reached epidemic proportions. Not a happy coincidence. Then the doctors push people off prescription drugs making them look to streets. A vicious  cycle orchestrated by the powers that be. I had a friend overdose on cheap Chinese fentanyl laced heroin,and my wife was kicked off her meds by insurance co after years of using a particular drug ,they said sorry we don’t want to pay anymore. It’s collusion between DEA,Congress ,and drug companies. How many have to die?its a known fact the USA gov ha sold cocaine to fund war. Remember colonel Oliver North,Ronald Reagan,CIA,in Nicaragua. They did it and still do it. SHAME ON THOSE people.

       Actually, in my experience, fear, dread, and utter, insurmountable desperation are the most effective at getting you off drugs... I did it... Tried methadone, subs, rehab... 20 solid years of drug use, 10 years of opiate use, 7 IV heroin...plus everything else under the sun... Nothing could "fix" me ...except me (and some supernatural force)... Even almost dying (from fent tainted H) didn't make me stop... I had to want to quit using literally more than anything else in my life, and I had to seek help... I've got 14.5 months clean and sober now... It fucking hard.

       Ayahuasca shamans guide you to the places in your own psyche psychically, that require the most help, thus liberating you from your own minds beliefs, the cause of all addiction. That is, if they're worth their salt. Even Bill W had his divine experience on belladonna, aka datura, an extremely potent psychoactive plant. Used by shamans throughout the Americas.

       I just think there’s a high likelihood that some of the stats from the Taliban period have a chance of not being accurate. I mean, who in Taliban run Afghanistan was keeping national records of poppy harvest?
       <br/>
       It’s also likely that very low production figures would have been helpful for a Taliban regime.
       <br/>
       Don’t get me wrong, I’m definitely not pro-Afghan war/invasion. I just think a bit of a critical eyes needs to be applied to this data set.

      <p>
       As someone who's followed the "drugs as a great CIA slush fund" angle since the crack in SoCal days, my guess is that the stats are pretty accurate. There were reports even in western media like the NY Times about the Taliban declaration of war against poppy harvesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       While not completely eradicated in a single year, I believe it dropped 95% in 2000.
      </p>
      <p>
       "taliban declare war on poppy" will find a number of pre 9/11 sources from 2000 and early 2001.

      <p>
       USAID and the UN track international drug harvesting, for example. At some point in the 1990s, the UN has it's own Drugs and Crime office.

      <p>
       The Taliban actually tolerated the poppy fields (like any large group, there are differences of opinion), but it was all but wiped out in the 2000 purge for religious reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The results were a mixed bag.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the ground, a lot of farmers suffered because they couldn't really grow any other crop, because there was no international market for them, due to various trade policies.

       Hi Fizzy333,
      </p>
      <p>
       First point, I just want to be clear, I'm not disputing it's public knowledge that Taliban wanted to stop Poppy production. Rather I am saying that if Taliban had public stated this, as a new regime, wouldn't it be in their own interests to juice the stats to show they were successful?
       <br/>
       Quotes from the NYT aren't really helpful in that context, because all they do is reinforce that there was some intent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, on the second point, yes, the UN has it's own Drug and Crime office. It also has it's own nuclear and chemical weapons sections, and we all know how accurate they are... and also how much they sometimes struggle to get full access for inspection purposes. So, keeping an open mind here, and given that Afghanistan would have been largely chaotic during the Taliban regime, which wasn't officially recognized by the UN as the rules of state, wouldn't a skeptical position be the more natural position to take?
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, I think given the first point - the stated intent of the Taliban to stop poppy production. It seems rather obvious to me, that the Taliban would have benefited from the policy appearing to be successful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, I would suggest that it's at least possible that we are just seeing more reliable statistics now rather than before?

      <p>
       Of course that's true of any new regime, but every available stat for international agencies that follow such things backs up their claim, and none that dispute it. It's worth pointing out that I recall reading reports written after US and UN inspectors returned from touring the country.
      </p>

       If they're lying, as a skeptic would ask, what reason would they have to do so?

        So, keeping an open mind here, and given that Afghanistan would have been largely chaotic during the Taliban regime, which wasn't officially recognized by the UN as the rules of state, wouldn't a skeptical position be the more natural position to take?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'd argue that it's one thing to have an open mind, and another to completely ignore all data possible and not offer up ones own evidence to the contrary, to maintain a hypothesis. There's zero evidence that the Taliban didn't decimate poppy production in 2000, and a lot that they did.
      </p>
      <p>
       At what point does earnest skepticism become contrarian for the sake of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who's lying about the numbers in 2000, and why? Who benefits?

       Hi,
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m sorry, thought I was clear on that - I think the Taliban would be the clear benefiting party of the juiced figures in 2000.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see it as being a bit like how Stalinist Russia juiced their raw materials production figures under the five year economic plans to deliver full industrialisation.

       The problem with juiced numbers is that unlike Russia bragging about a feat, the poppy numbers were from the US and UN, after having teams on the ground touring the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, either the Taliban deceived teams from Vienna and Washington that poppy fields weren't actually poppy fields, or said teams were in on the lie. The latter would be more likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that there's zero evidence that it's a lie at all, you're going to have to be a little more robust in building a hypothesis.

       Fine, since you seem to be Google-challenged. Here's a study that looked to see if the reported numbers were accurate...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This study presents what we believe to be the first formal evaluation of the Taliban crackdown against opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. Afghanistan was the main source of the world’s illicit heroin supply for most of the 1990s. From late 2000 and the year that followed, the Taliban enforced a ban on poppy farming via threats, forced eradication, and public punishment of transgressors. The result was a 99% reduction in the area of opium poppy farming in Taliban-controlled areas.

       Yeah, and there's links in there to the UNODC reports. You can also search UNODC along with the year to find their PDFs. No more breadcrumbs.

       At this point I'm assuming you don't want the poppy reduction to be real because it goes counter to some political agenda only tangentially related to the subject at best.

       No, the full text of the conclusion is thus...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The main conclusion of the evaluation is clear: all available evidence suggests that the 99% reduction in illicit opium poppy cultivation in Taliban-controlled areas of Afghanistan in 2001 is attributable to the enforcement activity. This produced a 65% reduction in the potential global illicit heroin supply from the 2001 harvest.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's right there in black and white.
      </p>
      <p>
       Directly under the conclusion are a number of sources, including UNODC, the US Dept of State, and a number of news articles. If you're truly interested, you can follow those, or do your own searching beyond those sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have even a SINGLE source that suggests this one year dip did not happen, pony it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do NOT have a source, but don't believe numerous federal and international agencies, and the reports thereof, what is your reasoning, beyond "The taliban faked it to look good". What was the cost-benefit of them faking the information?
      </p>

       Generally, when people misrepresent this badly, it's safe to assume they have an agenda.

       I should have ignored your first post, because all you've done is say "I don't believe it". That's not skepticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The study presents just SOME of the sources that comprise the larger body of evidence, to come to a pretty resounding conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you suggest you've read the study, you are now free to look up the UNODC sources, or the US State Dept, or any of the periodicals all listed in there, to explore it further. It should also aid in your googling of other sources.
      </p>

       I was just sharing my opinion based on some of what I've read, like others have.

       At this point it’s principal, you act like you’ve provided conclusive proof, but fact is you’ve single sourced a conclusion - which wouldn’t even hold up to the most basically journalistic standards, and acted all high and mighty in doing so.

       In addition you’ve thrown around insults like “lazy” which basically, are uncalled for.

       I never said that one study was "conclusive proof". I offered it up because it does source other evidence as to its conclusion. I figured the Times article about it might have been enough shorthand for your initial "skepticism".  I guess not, hence the study. This was done because..
      </p>
      <p>
       a) the reduction was widely reported by numerous sources at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       b) this is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , where people who follow the CIA-drug money angle frequent, and a) is a widely accepted fact, not some arcane knowledge.

       And I never claimed to be a journalist. I simply shared my opinions, with a couple of links to back them up, and there's links in those links too!

        Quotes from the NYT aren't really helpful in that context, because all they do is reinforce that there was some intent.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because the NYT article is reporting ON the reduction, NOT reiterating the Taliban's prior INTENT.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you were replying, unless taking the piss, suggests you actually WERE looking for evidence, as given by your statement "I just think a bit of a critical eyes needs to be applied to this data set.", but actually just skimming, before I even chimed in.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this boils down to "How much data is enough data to suggest to you that not only did the Taliban plan on reducing their poppy fields, but actually went through with it?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the NYT lying, or their sources? How about the study, or the sources in the study?

       The Taliban was reliably fanatic: if you grew opium in the areas they controlled, they murdered you. That much we know. They are religious nuts, and put eradication of drugs ahead of their political aims. It's possible some of them took opium money, but in 1999 until the US invasion, they didn't peek their heads out very much.
      </p>
      <p>
       By all reliable accounts, i.e., UN inspectors, satellite data, harvest numbers plunged under Taliban control.

       <p>
        Just as the indirect American intervention of 1979 was followed by an unprecedented increase in Afghan opium production, so the pattern has repeated itself since the American invasion of 2001. Opium poppy cultivation in hectares more than doubled, from a previous high of 91,000 in 1999 (reduced by the Taliban to 8,000 in 2001) to 165,000 in 2006 and 193,000 in 2007. (Though 2008 saw a reduced planting of 157,000 hectares, this was chiefly explained by previous over-production, in excess of what the world market could absorb.

        Afghanistan's opium poppy production goes into more than 90% of heroin worldwide. Afghanistan has been the world's greatest illicit opium producer, ahead of Burma (Myanmar), the "Golden Triangle", and Latin America since 1992, excluding the year 2001. Afghanistan is the main producer of opium in the "Golden Crescent". Opium production in Afghanistan has been on the rise since U.S. occupation started in 2001

       Where do you think it all goes? Ive thought quite a alot about this and came to the conclusion, all the prescription medication is the most likely culprit, because most of the opiates on the street are diluted and dirty as hell, but the prescription medication seems to be way more effective than the "synthetic" stuff. People get hooked instantly, and then we just hand them out for diabetes and broken bones and shit. Its really no shocker the huge opiate crisis affecting this nation, but because it mostly effects the lowest of the classes its often overlooked and even people cheer thinking they are getting rid of scum, even though its your choice to initially do it, once youve done it, its not your choice whether to keep doing it or not, you physically need it or you will die. People dont really understand and until its one of their loved ones who have went through that straight up evil poison.
Thats why the opiate wars were fought to begin with, japan/china were being destroyed by it, they executed people who made it back then, we should too. That is also why in 2001 the Taliban had actually almost eradicated opium, it was down to about 1%, but then 9/11 happened and we invaded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ill leave you with two nuggets of thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a interesting thought, how come there is a small supply of life saving drugs and often shortages, but when it comes to opiate's there is almost a unlimited supply of them.

       To paraphrase some numbers I remember, or will try to remember, before the Afgan war the area supplied roughly 10% of the world's heroin. Today it's 90%~.

        Yeah and now heroin is through the roof because the Taliban need it's profits to survive and are cultivating it for that purpose...

       And you DON'T think the CIA makes bank of the international heroin trade?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd humbly suggest looking up some of the work from Alfred McCoy regarding the CIA and the Golden Triangle, dating back to the Korean War, and how that's continued through to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't completely disagree though, because historically the poppy syrup was exported for processing outside of Afghanistan (and as religious fundamentalists, many Taliban are opposed to drugs), but in recent years (especially the last 5-10 IIRC), a higher percentage of opium is being processed in country.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had to guess, the poppy syrup that gets processed out of country is the CIAs cut, and the stuff made in Afghanistan is for the Taliban.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole situation is a mess, and farmers have no problem with growing more traditional crops like cotton or corn, but they find that most international markets are closed to them.

       So it's not about preventing them from farming opium. That's really easy. You just burn their fields. The problem we had is that if you bar them from their only source of revenue, where are these Afghani men going to turn for employment? The Taliban. Now obviously a lot of these funds from the people growing it end up funding terrorism anyway but it's a complex issue - what do you do with people whose only income comes from the drug trade, and if they stop growing drugs turn to terrorism? Kill them all? Imprison them? Pay them to do nothing?

       No, they didn't just say that. They gave a list of things that were impossible to comply with and then refused all negotiations. They did the same with Iraq. It's a typical move when you want a pretense to go to war. I think Julius Caesar did the same thing with Pompeii.

       crops would've been the best no-brainer solution.  For all the billions and trillions spent on waging wars, the cost to subsidize wheat, corn, fruits or vegetables wouldn't have been too much.

       Happy farmers, a population with better access to cheaper food.  It would've been pretty straightforward.  But our military didn't go over there to help them, or us.  It's become pretty obvious why they went.

       You can’t in Afghanistan. American companies planned to make it the bread basket of Central Asia and built a damn in Helmand province and attempted to teach the locals modern farming techniques. Unfortunately being  bunch of ignorant inbred uneducated fucks the afghans basically ruined the soil and now poppy and cannabis are basically the only things that will grow.

       The reasons why do not retract from the circumstances that are created and as mentioned, there is a recent history of nefarious activity regarding the illegal sale of drugs, I'm just sharing something I learned.

       No contractors are not veterans. They did it for money not for country. We shouldn't even be using them we have enough soldiers to do basically all of the jobs we pay others outrageous money for. Most contractors happen to be veterans as well because that's where they recruit from. They tried offering me 150k to come do intel analysis for battalion level after I was done doing CID stuff. Not sure why the only Intel I analyzed was drug stuff when I was on the drug team.

       That's just a crock of shit to me. If these men and women, former veterans, are offered positions by our government to remain in country, for ANY reason, regardless of money - how this doesn't constitute service is absolutely beyond me.

       Maybe it's a military thing, something internal, the differences - I just believe of all the people we as human beings should be honoring it should be these people who are apparently fighting on our behalf.

       I smoke weed. There's nothing wrong with it, at least not the way I smoke. I'm not addicted, I don't use it as an emotional crutch, I take breaks if I want to for a variety of reasons. I do recognise though that it has the potential - as literally anything sense does - to be abused and misused, and so I stay mindful of that fact when I do smoke. I plan to go teetotal come new year though, and I barely drink alcohol as it is. I've gone sober before for months at a time and I love the feeling of that, so it's certainly not damaging my mind.
       <br/>
       Anyway, the CIA creates the demand for any drug (cocaine and heroin mostly, but yeah sometimes weed) by mass producing it in some 3rd world country they've recently bombed/"destabilised". Then they poison the local (USA) well by saturating the market with fake products, cutting the drugs with other stuff, offing certain pre-established suppliers etc. Then they introduce the mass produced drug they've been cultivating overseas and push it through routes and supply lines they've now taken control of.
       <br/>
       Weed has had a more natural increase in demand imo. You first have to remember that many natural psychedelic/psychoactive substances have had a long term relationship with humans in spiritual practice for thousands of years (weed, mushrooms, ayahuasca). These have only been made illegal in recent human history. The resurgence of these particular substances has been, at least in my opinion, a natural response to the needless and society-damaging criminalisation of these substances. I think these substances have their natural, respective place within the human experience and they should be legal, but alongside that legalisation should go a thorough education on them. As society today proves: scare tactics don't work. Because if someone finds out they've been lied to about something or other, that makes them far less likely to believe what they're told next time around. That's dangerous for so many reasons. But yeah, I think I've explained myself reasonably enough.

       Yeah. Because it's not harmful. At least not compared to cigarettes, car exhaust, fuck man the insulation in your house can have more harmful fumes than what's found in pot smoke.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact the only harm I can see you point out could be eliminated entirely by making it legal. You could stop sending money anywhere but to American families if American families grew their own weed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And not just that buddy, but 100% of the weed I've smoked in my life was grown in the proud USA. And I can state that as a factual guaruntee. My money never went to some pseudo cartel. It went to people like you and me. People with families who don't like paying taxes or relying on the government. People who want to smoke and work hard at what they know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't lie and say it's always been this way. Because it hasn't always been this way. But with legalization and the continued cultural acceptance of libertarianism when it comes to drugs... the market supply in America for marijuana has moved into American borders.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you.... you sit here and lie and say it's economically viable to send weed that sells for 10 dollars a gram across two oceans and a continent to me the consumer. And this is taking into account that if you want to ship it from say... Mexico to texas, you have to bail it to take enough with you to cover fuel costs. Cause gas is expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 70's gas was a fifth the price it is today. It wasn't a bad idea to buy a big bag of weed off the cartel in Mexico and bring it to Colorado to sell. Today... you would burn more gas than you could fit weed in your car. The price of weed would would not cover the cost of gas. Unless you packed the car full of bricked weed.... there's no way. But here's the thing.... Americans don't smoke bricked weed anymore. I haven't seen bricked weed in 30 years. 
Sometimes you'll find it washed up on the shore in florida and texas and Louisiana. But I'm telling you my friend, there is no demand for shitty bricked cartel weed in America. A land where we can get high quality, medical grade, taxable, no additive, pesticide free weed. The full buds picked off the mountainside 20 miles away. The profits going to the guy who just wants to rough it year round. So he can vacation in December.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying we need to have cultural acceptance of cocaine. Fuck that poisonous ass shit. I've never tried it and I never will. But weed isn't cocaine. Weed doesn't sell for $100 per gram. Cocaine does. Weed doesn't make you and your families financial, physical, and emotional well being reliant on your next hit. Heroin does. Weed doesn't shut your heart down randomly if it wasn't cut just right. Cocaine does. Heroin does. Even in the 70s people knew smoking bricked weed was a risk because you couldn't really know what a cartel would add to it just to make it more profitable to sell.
      </p>
      <p>
       This day in age we need to end the war on drugs and focus on teaching people that they are strong enough to not have to pussyfoot through life high all the time. That there's a time and place to explore your consciousness and how it can interact with substances.... but the time isn't always and the place is in private. So while it's good to have this conversation, don't talk shit about things you don't know. Especially when you claim to be a fact conscientious person.
      </p>
      <p>
       My belief is that you and definitely not the government has any right to tell me not to smoke any plant that i can grow myself, harvest myself and smoke myself, putting the onus on myself. Putting the responsibility entirely on my own shoulders, to keep it away from children, to smoke it on my own property. No money isnt being made on that process. In fact if someone else grows it for me they make money. And only because I enjoy that transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even then... all the sketchiness of dealing with a drug dealer could be eliminated entirely if it wasn't illegal in the first place. If police could treat the harmLESS substance of weed like the harmFUL substance of tobacco, or the harmFUL substance of alcohol.... would anyone be ripped off by sketchy drug dealers? Well answer this... does a gas station take your money and refuse to give you gas? Or would you expect the justice system to disallow that from happening? Think about it.

       Yeah people leave out a drug that has no habit forming properties, helps with a wide range of ailments, and is consumed without being processed in any way, and that people literally can't overdose and die on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compared to the drug that forms addictions that are extremely hard to break,people overdose every day all over the country.

       There was once a federal law banning the consumption of any and all alcohols as well that was eventually overturned due in part to people like today's modern potheads who produced and sold it. So by that logic, you must be a tea totaller who wishes for nothing more than strict prohibition on alcohol as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was a federal law stating that every child over the age of 10 must be taken from their parents and forced to work in mines and as farm hands or even go to war, would stand by it because it's a federal law? Would you willing give you children up knowing damn well there's a high chance you may never see them again? No, because that law would be fucking stupid and evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banning a plant that has known medicinal values is stupid and evil. Throwing people longer prison sentences than rapists for growing, selling or consuming said plant is stupid and evil.

       You made me think of an interesting historical parallel: The British selling opium in China (to help stave off a deflationary crisis brought about by their tea industry in India). To balance the books, they engaged in the narcotics trade. Opium was illegal under the Qing dynasty, so a British merchant vessel was stopped (and its heroin impounded), whereupon the British declared war.
      </p>
      <p>
       After they won, they forced the Chinese to sign the humiliating Treaty of Nanking and got Hong Kong--after which they forced heroin down the throat of the Chinese.
      </p>
      <p>
       (The Bank of England was created by drug money.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast-forward to the end of the fading American empire, and you had missing trillions from the Pentagon and a government hemorrhaging after the Dot-com bubble burst.
      </p>
      <p>
       Solution to recoup the losses?
      </p>
      <p>
       Invading Afghanistan and ramping up heroin production for the international markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The U.S. is pursuing the same British template, point by point--even up to the quivering collapse of its currency and loss of its standing as a global empire.

       Here's just one of many links. Kinda disgusting!

       Lithium is mined and there is a lot of it there. It is mined for the mineral-ionic form to be used not only in drugs that can be made, esp for people who have many different neurological issues. But one thing you can google is these crazy demons who want to put the lithium in the municipal drinking water supplies to "sedate" the populations to make them more cooperative and complacent while they continue bringing in their dastardly agendas of world domination. All this info is available online. I personally did my thesis in toxic heavy metals in water.  If I can answer any more questions, dont hesitate. Ive been a redditor here since 2005 or 2006, and yes, I am horrified at what has happened to this subreddit. I hardly go on anymore but when I do, I always see and appreciate your posts. Its after 4am and I need some rest. While keeping my fingers on the pulse of the world and Homo sapiens species, I dont get much sleep anymore! Take care. Happy holidays if you are able.

       I live on the east coast and its insane.   I cannot even relate to you how many people i know that have died, lost children, been incarcerated, became homeless, committed suicide, became prostitutes, were raped, lost parents, lost jobs, homes, all their money due to this epidemic.   I watched it happen.   I will never forgive this country for over looking the absolute destruction to good hard working families  we have caused.

       This country doesn't just overlook it my friend.  This country exacerbates the problem by incarcerating those who have hard drug problems.  Throwing a drug addict into prison almost always ensures they will keep coming back and the addiction will continue.  There are very few and subpar options for rehab when in the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       When released most use again, violate parole, and go back.  Or get released and OD before they have a chance to go back.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to lower our incarceration rates in this country by moving nonviolent drug offenders to rehabilitation facilities in an attempt to actually fix the problem.

       The only heroin addicts I have sympathy for are the ones that end up on it bc their doctor got them hooked then didn't help them wean off properly.

       I appreciate your perspective. Maybe we should pay more attention to those that were ultimately not at fault.
      </p>

       However, I would ask this, where is the love in what you just said? Where is the compassion and mercy? I'm not trying to point a finger or get personal, that's not the point, the point is maybe, as the self proclaimed 'greatest nation on earth', should take more of a leadership role regarding these things?

       None of that is the drug's fault. I'm sorry for your losses but if they had learned to manage their addictions better then they would not have suffered the consequences they did. The problem is that there is a false cultural and legal dogmatic dichotomy in America which posits that a drug addict's only option is to take part in abstinence based recovery or else they are selfish criminals.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no guarantee that an opiate addicts brain will go back to normal and it's different than "just quitting." The dopamine reward system and opiate pathways are a kind of feedback loop that require stimulation, like from exercise and socializing, to have a chance of going back to normal. Many times drug addicts feel like ass when they stop using so they lay in bed all day and there is no hope for their brain to restore plasticity and healthy stimulation. Most people in modern day culture are too lazy and unmotivated to eat right, exercise, and maintain health relationships. It's totally unreasonable to fucking expect heroin addicts in a kick, sick as a dog to be able to find the motivation to do all those things and it's nothing but cultural prejudice which tries to push the "pull yourself up by the bootstraps" meme; otherwise they are just selfish criminals right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Drug addicts aren't just hedonists like kids in a candy store or escapists. Most drug addicts just want to feel fucking normal and when they take their dose they usually feel the kind of pleasure people experience from a tobacco buzz. Our culture demonizeds their habits though because they will get sick if they stop yet we don't demonize cardiac patients that require heart medication to live. And most of them picked up their addictions when they were around age 13, and it's totally unethical to hold people this responsible for choices they made when they were young. And the most common exposure was through doctors that repeated their mantra, of the early 2000s, "Take these pills exactly how it says on your bottle." And there are actually people that think a person is less likely to get addicted to a drug if they are taking it for medical reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The good news is that opiate addictions are actually very manageable. Besides the cultural misconceptions and legal pitfalls, as well as inorganically expensive drugs from artificial limits on supply; the problem is that the dopamine reward system is the primary motivator for human behavior and learning. That means that when drug addicts learn a harmful way of using they are very likely to keep doing their drugs that way even when it doesn't even provide them with more euphoria or relief.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than cultural acceptance the other thing that needs to happen is that drug treatment centers start focusing on teaching drug addicts less harmful ways of using, even chemicals like heroin, rather than just methadone. Traditional abstinence recovery is only 5 percent effective, even by the most optimistic yet sober estimations. Dont believe higher estimates because they do a flawed kind of study where they interview past patients of rehab centers. Can you see why someone who has relapsed, and been shamed by NA and AA, might be less than willing to participate in a follow up interview? Harm reduction has the capability to help 100 percent of drug addicts. Only drug addicts with coexisting mental conditions like schizophrenia aren't capable of learning to use their drugs in ways that limit the negative consequences and keep them safe and preserve their longevity. Shaming drug addicts does not motivate them to stop using drugs, neither does fear.

       also not sure why you are being down voted as i agree with most of what you say.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw how AA/NA failed many people and went to meetings with some of them as support.   I my opinion the only thing valuable from that type of program is having a sponsor/ someone to talk to when times get tough.   The abstinence preached there will help very few individuals.   I also find it absurd how many times i heard people saying "god will decide for me" or basically "god take the wheel" in relation to their addiction and relapses.  My personal beliefs on the existence of a higher power aside, teaching an addict that they can relay on someone or anyone else to fight their addiction for them is extremely detrimental.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also seen first hand the life of a long time daily methadone user.  Waiting in line every morning at the clinic to get their dose.   Not being able to get their dose because the clinic runs out of supply at 6:30 am.  Having to wait in line for 2 hours because its the day that prison comes to get their doses.  Not being able to dose before making it to work because a fight broke out in the line and now the clinic is no longer administering them for the day.    I have also seen what methadone does to a person body.  Sinking in and residing in the bones causing aches and creaks if your dose is late or you happen to be trying to lower your daily Mg intake.  How bad it makes peoples skin.  How it makes peoples teeth rot from the inside out.   How much worse Methadone withdraw is in comparison to heroin.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen those who get on Suboxen to try and break their habits.  Trying to find a doctor in a 60 minute radius of a major metropolitan city that is or can take new patients and actually prescribe suboxen. 
How each doctor is limited to how many patients they can have at a time on the maintenance program.  How despite being in an area where you can find 30 or so doctors within a 30 minute drive, the epidemic is so bad not a single one can take on new patients.  So you drive a friend with no money an hour away so they can do the monthly required in office consultations.   How the vast majority of insurance companies dont cover any of it.   How it costs hundreds of dollars a month, for someone with no money, to stay on the program.    How the doctors insist on starting on a huge dose, in many cases more Mgs a day then some opiate addicts were consuming illegally.   How Suboxen withdraw is way worse then heroin withdraw.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apologies I'm getting way off track here.  I could go on and on about the problems with how we see and treat addiction in this country but for me that doesn't change one simple thing.   For the first 20ish years of my life i knew zero opiate addicts.   Then the United States invaded Afghanistan and my life and thousands of other peoples lives that i know changed dramatically for the worse.

       Years ago we dubbed a lot of South Americans as terrorist.  At the same time, U.S. corporations were taking over the land and displacing people which caused a lot of revolt.  When growing coca became a means to survive, the U.S. was caught trading guns for coke.  The situation mirrors what is happening in the Middle East in so many ways.

       doesn't actually come from a certain area, or have a certain identitifier except for the fact that he's the bad guy, and that he better start running because America is coming for him.  Why work hard at alienating a whole culture when you can just make people react and respond to a single word almost like a dog responding to a whistle and salivating.

       But, it doesn't matter. You're an American, yes? Do you take what the Declaration and Constitution says seriously?
      </p>

       If so you're in luck. The Declaration in particular is especially strong worded and it states very clearly:

      <p>
       One, we are all part of the militia. It's not a choice, it's a duty.
Two, if you believe there is a problem it is a duty to fix it. Again. Not a choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm apparently radical for taking all that seriously... maybe I am a 'domestic terrorist' too, because people like me scare the shit out of the oligarch.

       So your failure to care about your own death, is somehow related to a belief in God?

       I'm agnostic, but I think if there were a Good he would want a person to care. On the other hand you cannot hide the truth under a lampstand. It is for that very reason that I live completely openly, and in the light. Check me out at joshua-ray.livejournal.com.

       I think you misunderstand a little.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I mean is, my natural fear of death and the unknown I will, hopefully, not sway and influence my judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will die. It's a certainty. The question is how, when and why. I don't fear death due to an unknown because I have faith and I don't fear it due to some animalistic instinct or because I never put a lot of thought into the esoteric, as I imagine most people simply haven't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Non-violence is certainly the right way, I think the majority of people will agree - however, even in the Bible it clearly states the defense of the helpless, your loved ones, your property, your ability to care for others IS worth killing for.
      </p>
      <p>
       David was a killer. Yet, he was 'a man after God's heart', because he always ran back to God.
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate your openness. It's how we will win the war. These people behind all this, from the lowest levels to the highest, they are all coward. They took the easy way, the materialistic way, the simpleton path - they went 'with the crowd' instead of trusting their emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
       These bastards are destined to lose. Because if they ever let any of this into the light they know what's coming to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psh, put me in charge of that. Historically good people are more vicious, as mentioned. Killing is -their- game, they could be a lot more useful alive and suffering than dead.

       I'm sure there are "good people" at all levels of society. The enemy is the human condition, and all humans are in it together. We have to all win as a team or we all lose. Yes many humans are weak, and perhaps there is another force which plots our destruction. Call it evil, aliens, our own fallacies, or call it nature. Call it a fault of our methods of living. That would be closest to the truth in my opinion, but don't blame your brother for the faults or our fathers.

       I do blame them. Especially when many are knowingly involved, acutely aware what they are part of. And those that are too cowardly to embrace it, those that are disillusioned, the fault falls equally on their shoulders. Just like how the good cops are to blame for allowing the bad cops to behave that way.

       Fear of death is no excuse. Naivete is no excuse. Lack of historical knowledge is no excuse. They are adults, not children(a kid is a goat btw, use the word children pls). This is why Christian values are so important regardless of your personal views.

       I spent a lot of time in Afghanistan, and while I didn't oversee any shipments of heroin or raw opium, what I saw did lead me to believe that the USG is in fact facilitating heroin production and/or the international export of it.

       Lots of things. Mostly, being told one of our primary missions was to eradicate opium fields, but not seeing any eradicated. Watching the DEA operate against these opium farmers and thinking they would handle it, but basically just seeing them hang an "under new management" sign on the place.

       What we were told and what i saw were very incongruent.

       I've always wanted to know some of the puzzle for that maze.  On one side you have "it's bad and we must stop it no matter what it takes and need a bigger budget to handle it" and yet out the other end is usually climbing addiction rates and busts and epidemics.  The "under new management" story is fascinating to say the least.

       Yeah, we would assault the farm or have some guys go arrest the owner of the farm. At first I assumed the field would get burned or Monzanto'd...but months or even years later, I would see the same farm still producing. But with a new (and I'm assuming more compliant) owner.

       Increased opium production in Afghanistan probably just lowered the price of heroin in Europe. The US market is fed by Golden Triangle / Mexico / Chinese fent. 
That doesn't sound as cool. What is the end game in turning your citizens in junkies? They don't work and are a burden on social systems.

       Not entirely true. The ports of Baltimore and Philadelphia and Boston have become Heroin MAGNETS, getting most of their supply straight from the Middle East, and this is directly correlated to the dramatic rise in opioid use and abuse on the streets of said cities, and in other urban and rural areas all up and down the east coast.

       I agree and believe the us wanted to keep Afghan heroin booming in the world market(not the us). But then that just incouraged demand for Mexico made heroin in the us.

       Are you implying that CIA agents never go against the interests of the American Public. Do you think it was beneficial for the American public to believe that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you understand why the war on drugs is so insidious? Almost every fucking person uses drugs in some form. By making the most popular ones illegal that gives authoritarians a way to grab people by the balls when they need to. It means everyone is living in fear. And better yet they can control the supply of certain drugs which people need and then they are very easily manipulated. Absolute power corrupts absolutely and this kind of authoritarian control mechanism is not an accident. Then when you pair that up with a constantly growing prison system, both private and public,
       <strong>
        there is always a demand for fresh souls in their system.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We live in a society which respects doctors like they are some kind of all knowing oracle and most people follow their directions
       <em>
        faithfully.
       </em>
       This means that the pharmaceutical industry can effectively give every person that has had a tooth pulled or broken bone a gateway hit of opiates. A lot of people who aren't even addicts will compulsively take their opiate medication when they are prescribed it and they rationalize their forming addiction because the doctor said it was okay and to follow the directions on the bottle, like that would actually save a person from developing an addiction (it wont except for a possible placebo effect.)
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard to imagine a user on r/conspiracy that is so naive they think the CIA has their best interest in mind, let alone the private prison industry, military industrial complex, and medical industry.
       <em>
        If someone is trying to control your behavior there is no reason to trust them.

       Good point.  It's easier for a half-dead drugged out heroin addict to get clean than it is for a fully-dead power-hungry villain to not be greedy and to stop selling heroin.

       Maybe if weak people would control their impulses there wouldn't be a drug problem in the first place.  No one cares about the addicts because they chose their fate.

       What has happened to every society that has used concentration camps historically? Did any of them stand the test of time? Did drug users find a way to skirt the totalitarian authority? Can you not still buy drugs in china even after mao tried to kill them all? You know you can still buy drugs in the philipines and in saudi arabia right? And when they kill stupid addicts it just leaves the sneakíer ones alive. Like darwinism.

       Also Hitler and Goering were both raging drug addicts. Your idols were self loathing hypocrites that punished people that reminded them of themselves. We see the same behavior with gay preachers that advocate for conversion therapy. In that way mike pence's electric chair is like hitler's gas chamber, a tool of ironic hypocrisy.

       Create an opiod crisis in America to further keep us in chains. It makes perfect sense. I'm glad the cleans under way with Trump is finally here. Just the fact that he is confronting this problem gives me hope we finally have a non-puppet in the White House.

       Trump doesn't act with regards to principles or even populism. He is just doing whatever is pragmatically opportunistic in the moment. Look how he stopped being critical of the economy once he was in charge. He now takes credit for the feds and wallstreet pumping so that they can dump on him later.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think Trump will do to combat heroin addiction? Ramp up the war on drugs?!? Since when has punishment and fear based behavioral motivation EVER worked in history? I bet the cartel would be happy to because then they could charge more for drugs if their supply is interrupted. The cartel probably donates to partnership for a drug free america.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Trump just sent more military personal to 'stan and that means more corrupt officials looking to profit. That means more opium fields guarded. And even if the corruption stops that doesn't prevent other countries from growing poppies. I was just reading about how they are growing them in south america and cutting carteĺ tar heavily with fent which the cartels regularly produce now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is an authoritarian without principle. This kind of problem is something his younger self might have been able to combat but he's old and senile now. He has no creativity or greater ideals. He used to advocate for shutting down the war on drugs. But that Trump is long gone. Now he is just going to empower cartels more than ever if he does anything at all.

       Pot enables lazinessn it doesn't cause it. All types of people have/do use marijuana. I wouldn't call Michael Phelps lazy or Carl Sagan stupid.

       Are there stupid and lazy people who smoke weed? Duh. But they were stupid and lazy beforehand. Weed didn't 'make' them that way, they just use it to perpetuate a lifestyle they have already chosen. Don't paint with such a broad brush.

       It also depends on the type of weed it is. Indica will generally make you want to sit around and be lazy (In da couch). Satvia on the other hand will make you want to get up and go get stuff done, clean, go out and have fun.

       What about people who have tolerances so the opiates have no effect on their behavior? What about opiate users who report getting energy and creativity from using opiates? You are making a flawed assumption that drugs create the same effect in everyone.

       The following is a forum post about how oxycodone gives one user energy and a "pump up." You can find many many many more just like it if you google "oxycontin gives me energy" and it was one of the google suggestions implying it's a popular search:

       NSAIDs are in no way as effective. I'm sorry. That is one of those myths that gets spread by guys like Dr Drew. If you break your arm a fucking a tylenol isnt going to fucking do jack fucking shit. Meanwhile a shot of dilaudid will you put you at ease within seconds. What you said is objectively false.

       I actually come from a meth heavy area, and spoke with a cop who busted meth labs. he said after 9/11 the number of meth labs he busted severely dropped because everyone just does heroin now. He pretty matter of factly stated that us military personnel, and contractors were smuggling it back, and it wasn't really a problem before that.

       Well that guys was wrong about Supply fueling Demand. But that's an interesting story. A society though that can't handle freedoms like the freedoms to buy narcotics is just growing a big authoritarian nanny state cancer. Of course there would be consequences at first (although heroin is available now) but long term robustness that ending the drug war would provide is worth it. Humans can adapt to anything, and it's not beneficial to condition a civilization to relying on authority as a solution for personal problems.

       This hardly counts as a conspiracy, it's just a history lesson public education doesn't teach. A large part of all the worlds opium is grown in Afghanistan, and has been for a long time. The most powerful country at any time period has had a stake in Afghan opium. Right now that's the US and Russia. Remember what Britain did to China when they were the global power?

       Agree.

      <p>
       However, the word conspiracy would actually fit here. There are forces/factions/groups that together, where they perhaps may otherwise compete, have conspired together to make this a reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy doesn't mean 'hokey pokey', it's only the western culture of ridicule that allows that kind of dismissive behavior to take place. Btw, I'm not suggesting that's what you meant.

       True, I was using the conspiracy in the sense that it is a secret phenomenon, but it is one in the sense that the opium trade is intentional and allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the dictionary- 
a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful.
      </p>
      <p>
       the action of plotting or conspiring.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only meant it doesn't fit the first definition properly as the opium trade and the global participation in it is no secret, but you're right that it can still fit as it is an intentional move by powerful groups to keep the trade alive and wel.ll.

       A real H addict I met once told me  he tried to get off H recently (this was a couple years ago), and the people he knew that knew he did it before, and sold to him, came and beat him up. They told him he can't just quit.

       It seems clear that elements within the US government run the drugs and keep the entire world buzzing with heroin. These elements are clearly in collaboration with companies, and with the mafia and other organized crime. Also it seems clear these elements are in control of street gangs from the top. Street gangs heavily recruit ex-military, and I wouldn't doubt gangs are controlled directly by the military itself, to enforce dark order on society (ensure people are actively pushed into the traps).

       This high level of conspiracy, will not stop, as it is enabled and continued by very powerful organizations of individuals. The only way to truly win, would be to instantiate an object which renders theirs obsolete. A new way must be found, or the remnant will be lost :c

       We're almost there. Kratom was one way as far as opiates are concerned. But there will be new developments that savvy addicts can use. There always is. Like karma left open a door for intelligent people even when they are in bad situations.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right though. We need to figure out a way of maintaining safety and order without relying on authority and control. Human nature is corrupted by having power over others and when they try to become independent the power will beat them into submission all over again. Just like your friend but this happens at other levels of society as well.
      </p>

       That's why anarchism would be ideal. There are dangers with that though so it all has to be figured out one bridge at a time. The best we can start doing is creating alternatives to state provided services. That way people start to trust voluntarily pooled resources and private groups.

       My theory is that anarchy is a way of life, and I've lived it most of my life. Perhaps you could say we all live it, sometimes. However, when we all go have anarchytopia, the rest of the world will keep spinning. Without uprooting the force which perverts- the force which dominates human society from above on aome lofty vantagepoint- there will be no respite for our people.

       Ask yourself this:  Why are we still in Afghanistan?  Originally it was to get the See-Aye-A asset Osama.  Well he’s been dead for years.  Why are we still there?  The Taliban had eradicated almost all of the poppy fields.  Americans get there, move the Taliban into Pakistan, boom, poppy fields are back into production.

       This is anecdotal, so take it with a grain of salt.
      </p>

       But I've heard that we are literally guarding the poppy fields with U.S. soldiers and Marines. The story is that "this is the only way these people can make money." I remember seeing a documentary where one of these soldiers is interviewed right on the poppy farm. He claimed that the U.S. is trying to steer them to other crops, but for whatever reason it was difficult and for the time being they were allowing them to continue to grow opium.

       That was the old neocon policy, it wasn't anecdotal.  The new policy is to destroy the fields.  Just Google it, all the top results are stories telling us why we shouldn't destroy Afghanistan drug labs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new policy meshes perfectly with the ending of support for Sunni extremists in Syria and the Saudi coup.  It's like the CIA is losing a struggle of some sort.

       No I don’t. Look up Oliver north and cocaine. It was called a conspiracy when I was a kid,but now it’s a movie with Tom Cruise. They sold cocaine to fund war in South America. So I believe they sell heroin to fund whatever they need to fund outside of Americas eye sight.

       Yeah this ha been going on for a long time. CIA had people smuggling opium in from Vietnam during that conflict. They had a secret airbase in Cambodia if my memory recalls. An of course one of the big reasons we have been all over the Middle East.. a lot of folks don't realize that.

       No contractors are not veterans. They did it for money not for country. We shouldn't even be using them we have enough soldiers to do basically all of the jobs we pay others outrageous money for. Most contractors happen to be veterans as well because that's where they recruit from. They tried offering me 150k to come do intel analysis for battalion level after I was done doing CID stuff. Not sure why the only Intel I analyzed was drug stuff when I was on the drug team.

       There are some interesting connections to the far east and Jesus Christ the historical figure. I found that information to be pretty fascinating. There's even a place in the middle east, along the silk road supposedly, where Jesus' mother Mary had passed and the locals still honor it, despite the area being majorly Muslim.

       Being honest with you, you seem able to extract a large amount of information from simple Americana. Especially about me specifically. You must be a Jedi or something. haha.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure what you're talking about to be honest, but your attempted personal attack does not sway me, nor am I compelled in any way to explain myself any further. You don't know what's in my mind and heart and you never will.

       Absolutely not. I firmly believe that there's no government like

        no

       government.

       What I would like is a government that doesn't actively(seemingly) attempt to subjugate it's citizens by drugging and taxing them. While I don't really care people someone wants to fuck their life up by injecting heroin into their veins, I would prefer if the government didn't sell them the smack.

       As an aside, I disagree with abortion, and I'm torn on whether or not it should be mostly illegal. But, not for any sort of moral reason. Abortion is a key factor in the destruction and eventual replacement of our society.

       I can't think of any sources but there is a lot of literature available.  I can probably help with general context.
