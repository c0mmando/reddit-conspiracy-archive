Examples include - Elsagate on MSM, dozens of arrests of individuals and rings in multiple countries, more stories breaking worldwide like RYB Educational in China, etc.. Now is this just a correlation with trending times or was PG the spark?</p>

<p>The Roy Moore media debacle was also a psy op and part of this limited hangout. I believe he&#39;s guilty as sin, but instead of us all uniting against the elite pedo&#39;s regardless of party, they are &quot;politicizing&quot; these cases of pedophilia/sexual abuse to divy up the population and divide us on the issue. The republican hillbillies all thought he was a saint, and the other side claimed he was the devil. </p>

<p>See what I mean? We should be uniting under the issue. Now they can make any case of political/elite pedo&#39;s and child abusers look like politically motivated witch hunts. Dont fall for that shit. </p>

Although its way too late now, they&#39;re not dumb enough to carry out trafficking in the same place they almost got busted in.</p>

<p>HA!  This is awesome!</p>

<p>Hey Champ, the Arch of Hysteria was completed years before any of the Dahmer crime scene pics were seen outside of the courtroom.  So you either have to believe a) little 84 year old Louise Bourgeois flew from Manhattan to Wisconsin to attend the 1993 trial and gather this <em>inspiration</em>... or b) this statue has nothing to do with anything remotely &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;cannibal&quot;.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some <a href="https://remedianetwork.net/2014/06/23/the-arch-of-hysteria/">academic dialogue</a> of the piece, although you may find it to be a bit above your pay grade.</p>

<p>You require proof from others, so let&#39;s be 100% skeptical here and consider the possibility you have something to hide on your main account. BTW, usernames <strong>have never gone under the slang &#39;ID&#39;</strong> on here. Strongly suspect you don&#39;t belong on this site, or you wanted to hide a bias apparent on your main account. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why are you playing this game where you pretend to not see Podesta&#39;s possibly influence when exhibiting the piece. F*** what the artist thought originally. If the Podestas are into portraits of captured bodies in agony, and some of those are of children, then you must have a really good reason to divert attention away from the exhibitors and back onto the artist. Which leads me to</p>

<p>The connection between Dahmer symbol, <a href="http://turnitoffnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Ahf52E.png">the kiddie portraits</a> is a combination of sexual undertone, the portrayed as someone seemingly kidnapped, and the easy connection to the two occurrences in Podesta&#39;s emails where at some point a &quot;torture chamber&quot; is mentioned as Podesta&#39;s location, and &quot;a hot tub with kids&quot; is mentioned as being ready for Podesta&#39;s arrival.</p>

<p>Why are YOU playing the game where renowned art collectors like Tony and Heather Podesta shop for art like you shop for trinkets at a roadside tourist trap?</p>

<p>This piece has <em>very</em> specific meaning, and it&#39;s meaning is well known in art circles.  You want me to believe that he purchased this piece at great expense because it reminded him of a Dahmer photograph from a crime textbook that he 99.9% likely never even saw?  You&#39;re delusional.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Identify which of those &quot;kiddie portraits&quot; Tony Podesta owns or owned.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll help you out:  <a href="http://ibankcoin.com/zeropointnow/files/2016/11/unnamed-2.jpg">These two</a>.  Neither of which could be considered even remotely pedophilia-related, except in the demented pizzagater psyche.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t possibly be this thick, right?  Here&#39;s some context for you:  <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/56492">This email</a> was sent on 1/31/14.  Aside from the fact that you have to be some kind of sick fuck to read this and say,m &quot;AH HA!  CHILD SEX ABUSE&quot;... this was also the timeframe right before the Podesta&#39;s filed for divorce in April.  Do you think maybe, <em>just maybe</em>, this could be a reference to marital strife, and <strong>not</strong> a literal torture chamber?  It is exactly the kind of thing I&#39;d say to my sister if I had been fighting with my husband.</p>

<p>No... you&#39;re right, it&#39;s gotta be kid fucking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and &quot;a hot tub with kids&quot; is mentioned as being ready for Podesta&#39;s arrival.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus CHRIST.  [Learn your own retarded narratives.]  At NO place in that e-mail does it mention a &quot;hot tub&quot;, let alone &quot;ready for Podesta&#39;s arrival&quot;.  </p>

<p>If you can read that entire exchange I have linked, and see <em>anything</em> but a friendly invite and discussion between about 8 women and 9 men (most with children of their own), then you are one sick puppy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>dreams back to Podesta&#39;s incredible hotdog stand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s an inside joke, Einstein.  People with stressful jobs often joke with their friends about &quot;quitting the rat race&quot; and doing something relaxing.  I have a brother who jokes about becoming a float guide on the Colorado instead of doing insurance.  I guess he&#39;s a pedo, too, right?  What is &quot;float guide&quot; translated to in your 4chan Rosetta stone.</p>

<p>Honestly, you guys creep me the FUCK OUT.</p>

<p>Antinous, a famous Greek boy lover</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Antinous was considered an adult during his time. His statue was used as a gay rights symbol since the 70&#39;s. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>His followers and friends on social networks sure seemed to joke a lot about cp.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they don&#39;t. They make a few jokes that people chose to interpret as joking about CP. There&#39;s 10x more references to it on any random /b/ thread then the entire Instagram account.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about Podesta, handkerchief and pizza?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well what about it? A guy got an email asking about a &quot;pizza related map&quot; on a handkerchief. Weirdly worded, sure, but it&#39;s far more likely that it was just typed in haste or by someone who&#39;s grammar isn&#39;t all that great than it is to be some sort of code. And even if it was a code, the only &quot;decoder&quot; was a thread on 4chan, since none of those words are CP code words. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyway, I&#39;m not here to say PG is real or it definitely is a Hoax, people can do their own research.</p>

<p>This right here is the issue. A lot of people like to pretend that there&#39;s two equivalent sides to every matter and &quot;do your own research&quot;. No. There&#39;s the side that supported the harassment of an innocent business owner for close to a year and the side of rationality.</p>

<p>Do you support the continuing &quot;investigation&quot; and &quot;research&quot; into the aforementioned DC pizza store? Then you&#39;re rationalizing the actions taken by the internet in the last year that lead to the pizza store being forced to close its online presence, limit its publicity, hide email addresses and phone numbers, hire security, keep its employees anonymous, and any one of a thousand other issues they had to face because people won&#39;t stop bugging them by any means necessary. </p>

And if someone with a bunch of money (say roger stone, David seaman) called me a serial killer, I would sue and win.  Now, tell me why podesta or James haven&#39;t done this if these accusations are ruining their lives lol me you say they are?</p>

<p>What evidence would come up in podesta Alefantis?  Code words.  Social media.  Podesta dyncorp connection.  Podesta ambromovich connection.  Podesta.  Podesta connection to defamed SK president/cult member park.  Tony and john&#39;s child-abuse artwork.  Podesta ties to Epstein group (through clinton).  Pedesta ties to hastert?  Ties to teaching in Japan with good friend hastert?  Madeline McCann?  Clinton/podesta ties to Kosovo govt responsible now for organ harvesting during Bosnian war?  All the buildings on the block of CPP being owned by Saudi Arabian buyers (hint: saudis bang kids)?  DuPont tunnel systems underneath D.C.?  Pegasus museum?  Threats to the pizzagate gear guy?</p>

<p>Most importantly-if you were around last year when shtf, the biggest piece of evidence is the blatant cover-up and damage control.  The term fake news was created to discredit PG.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, knock yourself out, but you didn&#39;t answer my point which was addressing your hypothetical of them gaining credibility through suing. When you (and I mean both specifically you and PGers in general) assume that evidence exists and that guilt is assured, no contrary evidence will make an impact. Every contrary point is a cover-up or decoy, every explanation is untrustworthy, and every weakness in your argument they expose is a distraction/trying to shift the narrative.</p>

<p>You may not be a shill or getting paid, but you (and those like you) do not argue or debate in good faith, and that is one of the many, many reasons PG is being dismissed.</p>

But man, it&#39;s almost like I feel I was chosen to be part of the community dealing with this shit.  Like, this is my chance to try and rally ppl towards the truth.  And no, I&#39;m not certain of the truth of PG, but I am certain it has not been disproven.  And obviously, it bothers me and makes it hard to look at the world when Donald trump is president, our cultural gatekeepers (Hollywood/senate are pedos),  the news doesn&#39;t give a fuck about truth, and everyone is just complacent.  It&#39;s depressing yo.  And hard to look away from without feeling guilty or selfish.</p>

<p>You could tell by the look on Jones&#39; face when he did his apology that he was shaken.  If he had not backed off, Alefantis would be running his empire as &quot;Homo Wars&quot;, and hawking colodial silver butt lube.  If you don&#39;t believe me, look what Hulk Hogan did to Gawker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting about Seaman.  I knew he was hawking BTC, but I don&#39;t know if there has been any legal precedence of a court compelling someone to surrender their bitcoin wallet in a judgement.</p>

<p>They&#39;ll always go after the deepest pockets, so I&#39;m sure that Podesta&#39;s lawyers went straight to CBS, and not Swann.</p>

<p>Jones, disinfo or not, was <em>spooked</em> during his apology.  I don&#39;t think he&#39;s that masterful of an actor, the guy would be the shittiest poker player on the planet... so, IMO, whatever they said to him or threatened him with, it worked.</p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t they hitting more people with C&amp;Ds?  I dunno... it could be that they feel it has played itself out?  Google trends shows that it&#39;s at nearly it&#39;s lowest point since it broke.  Maybe they think the storm has passed?</p>

<p><em>Pizzagate proponents are generally not rational individuals.</em></p>

<p>Take for instance the video where Podesta was speaking at the college.  His understandable reaction to the questioner&#39;s pizzagate query was to get visibly agitated... and people on this sub took it as evidence of his guilt.</p>

<p>No matter what explanations he provides, there will be a significant majority of mentally defective folks who will not believe him.</p>

<p>There is nobody outside of a small, vocal group of Internet <em>nobodies</em> calling for any explanation... yet you think he should call a press conference and address all of these nonsensical claims one by one?  Ridiculous.</p>

<p>seems convincing and plausible but not definitive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course it&#39;s not definitive, because you&#39;re reading personal emails written by people you don&#39;t know talking about the minute of their day to day lives. In addition, you&#39;ve already decided in your mind that these emails are actually talking about having sex with a child sex slave that John Podesta gave them for Christmas, and that pasta and cheese are code words, so it&#39;s going to be difficult to &quot;prove it otherwise&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s because the pizzagate timeline has gone something like this:</p>

<p>Nov 2016:  <em>&quot;Hillary/Podesta/Alefantis are fucking, killing and eating babies!&quot;</em></p>

<p>Dec 2016:  <em>&quot;Comet Pizza is some kind of front for child trafficking.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Jan 2017:  <em>&quot;Alefantis sure owns a lot of properties, what&#39;s up with that?&quot;</em></p>

<p>March 2017:  <em>&quot;Some pedos got arrested somewhere!  Pizzagate is real!&quot;</em></p>

<p>Summer 2017:  <em>&quot;They&#39;re probably laundering money via art...&quot;</em></p>

<p>October 2017:  <em>&quot;OMG!  Weinstein!  Pizzagate is REEEEEEEal!&quot;</em></p>

<p>Nov 2017:  <em>&quot;Ummm... you&#39;re saying Ray Moore is a pedo?   &lt;crickets&gt;&quot;</em></p>

<p>Dec 2017:  <em>&quot;It&#39;s happening!!!!!  Any day now!!!&quot;</em></p>

<p>To finally, your contribution today:</p>

<p>Dec 13, 2017:  <strong>&quot;It has increased awareness.  We did it Reddit!&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Can you at least acknowledge that <em>maybe</em> the narrative has shifted just a bit over the last 13 months?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has it ever occurred to you that a group with an agenda &quot;pulled&quot; the goalpost to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hillary/Podesta/Alefantis are fucking, killing and eating babies!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is my recollection of the events/discussion unfolding:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wikileaks released Podesta emails</li>
<li>One email addressed to Podesta referenced a &quot;map that seems pizza-related. Is it yours?&quot; and Podesta confirmed</li>
<li>It has long been known that c hild p orn = CP = cheese pizza</li>
<li>People from all sides are questioning: what does this mean?  does this seem weird to you?</li>
<li>More emails released - more questions around the context of these emails as the wording seemed odd (albeit without context)</li>
<li>Emails released referencing Alefantis and Comet</li>
<li>People start asking questions around Alefantis&#39; IG account regarding odd pictures and comments</li>
<li>Legitimate journalists start asking the same questions (e.g. Ben Swan)</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, what seemed like a flip of a switch threads researching this were flooded with ZZZOOOMMG Hillary/Podesta/Alefantis are fucking, killing and eating babies!</p>

<p>This is what a lot of people pick up on as &quot;pizzagate&quot;.</p>

<p>Competing Hypotheses:</p>

<p>The creation and spreading of the assertion that &quot;Hillary/Podesta/Alefantis are fucking, killing and eating babies!&quot; is a result of:</p>

<p>(A) Organic logical leap by individual actors with an emotional bias</p>

<p>(B) A coordinated effort by an anti-Clinton group to influence voters by preying on emotions, perpetuating such an absurd assertion that would be hard to prove false (cant prove a negative), and pumping said assertion through a coordinated social media campaign</p>

<p>(C) A coordinated effort by a pro-Clinton/Podesta/Alefantis group &quot;pulling&quot; the goalpost to an absurd assertion that can be &quot;debunked&quot; given the lack of evidence and logical hoops to arrive at that assertion and/or therefore &quot;debunking&quot; all of the questions leading up to said assertion (aka pizzagate) to influence voters and/or deflect from actual wrongdoing</p>

<p>(D) Combo of the above</p>

<p>(E) None of the above</p>

<p>Evidence and Analysis:</p>

<ul>
<li>The origination of the assertion was posted somewhere by one anonymous individual -  Supports A but doesn&#39;t mutually exclude B or C</li>
<li>Massive posting of the assertion on social media targeted towards conservative-leaning voters - Supports A and B but doesn&#39;t exclude C</li>
<li>Massive posting of the debunking of the assertion without addressing the underlying questions targeted towards liberal-leaning voters - Supports C but doesn&#39;t exclude A/B</li>
<li>Reddit censorship and removal of a subreddit - Could be a group acting in response to A/B or could be the C group removing the questions leading up to the assertion</li>
<li>Ben Swan goes off-air, posts cryptic shit, came back and hasn&#39;t addressed anything - not sure how to analyze this</li>
<li>The original questions have never been addressed - supports C but doesn&#39;t reject B</li>
<li>The definition of pizzagate is now the assertion - supports C and could support B by piggybacking on a hashtag</li>
</ul>

<p>Conclusion: Not enough evidence to support or reject any hypothesis with a reasonable degree of confidence.</p>

<p>Just because <em>you</em> don&#39;t understand the context of something that was never meant for you doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s &quot;weird&quot;. It means <em>you don&#39;t understand it</em>.</p>

<p>Pizzagaters are more than willing to wildly speculate in favor of elaborate conspiracies as explanations, but refuse to accept rational speculations that rely on common sense interpretations.</p>

<p>Pizzagaters constantly scream, &quot;How do you play dominoes on pasta? It&#39;s impossible!&quot; Is it impossible to play guitar on heroin? Ask Sid Vicious, I guess.</p>

<p>Pizzagaters have no sense of humor, but I suppose that&#39;s what <em>weaponized autism</em> implies. Equating pasta with a performance-enhancing drug as a joke gets mistranslated into sex with kids.</p>

<p>Pizzagate isn&#39;t an investigation, it&#39;s a smear campaign run completely by trolls who love to twist words and assume the worst.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots to digest there, and thanks for taking the time to type it out.</p>

<p>I do disagree with your timeline in one respect, though.  The &quot;ZZZZOMGG&quot; narrative started almost immediately, not after the Ben Swann piece.  Throughout Nov/Dec 2016, everywhere you looked in the three subreddits (T_D, Pizzagate and Conspiracy) as well as Voat, the baby-fucking/eating cabal narrative was in full swing.</p>

<p>That makes it a bit harder to claim that it was pulled in later by (B) or (C).</p>

<p>I&#39;m of the opinion that it was 100% (A), but I&#39;m happy to change my mind if any evidence of Russian (B) or ShareBlue/CTR involvement (C) comes to light.</p>

<p>I lean a little more toward (D).  Started by (A) or 4chan larp, simplified and perpetuated by (B), and later utilized by (C).  Just gut though - not enough evidence to make that conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to rewrite what pizzagate is believed to be or is commonly defined as.  I do think there were legitimate questions asked in the beginning and then it transformed into a wild claim.  What I find more interesting is that this claim and the debunking of it is exclusively binary.</p>

<p>Regardless, I&#39;m trying to defend OP here.  I think that it is interesting that there was a fervor of speculation regarding sexual abuse and those close to Clinton (from wikileaks and PG) and Trump himself (from actual audio recordings) that started a year ago and now there are a lot high-ups getting outed.</p>

<p>Does that give the wild claim that is pizzagate more merit?  No evidence supports that and I don&#39;t think that is what OP is saying. </p>

When you (and I mean both specifically you and PGers in general) assume that evidence exists and that guilt is assured, no contrary evidence will make an impact. Every contrary point is a cover-up or decoy, every explanation is untrustworthy, and every weakness in your argument they expose is a distraction/trying to shift the narrative.</p>
