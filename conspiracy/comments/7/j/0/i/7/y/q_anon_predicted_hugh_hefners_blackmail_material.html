        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I honestly haven&#39;t looked too deep into Q anon, as most of it seems like gibberish, and I honestly wish if people knew things, they would just expose it already. But reading the Q post at this link from Nov 20 just now, in regard to Hef&#39;s honeypot material:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/tripcode/%21ITPb.qbhqo/page/3/">https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/tripcode/%21ITPb.qbhqo/page/3/</a></p>

<p>And having already read the recent post from Dec 9 from the anon Hollywood insider known as Himmmm, it really seems like Q anon knows stuff.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/12/blind-item-1-priceless-collection.html">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/12/blind-item-1-priceless-collection.html</a></p>

<p>Not sure if this has been posted already, but definitely going to read more q anon, as far as I can tell, the Himmmm article was a shocker, so not many insiders knew. For those out of the loop, Himmmm has been helping expose rapists, murderers, and pedos in Hollywood, and this recent post almost seems like he&#39;s protecting himself from payback by stating he has access to this material. Anyone have any idea how Q would know ahead of time about this if he was a fraud? </p>

So it was a revelation to see Q had info like that. He&#39;s definitely a somebody though, even predicting how this would be flipped to protect those exposing this stuff:</p>

<p>&quot;What if Hugh Hefner was /a Clown In America?
What is a honeypot? 
Define blackmail. 
How could this be applied?
Fantasy land.
WHO HAS ALL OF THE INFORMATION?
No Such Agency.
The hunter becomes the hunted.
Operations underway.

    <div class="md"><p>I  been on the fence about Q ever since half november or so... I can&#39;t decide on it either way...</p>

<p>Considering the activities going on at the playboy mansion, i highly doubt its the first time its mentioned hugh hefner could have dirt on alot of people. Also considering the influential people that visit the mansion, its not that far fetched...</p>

<p>Did someone check out if in the past some people called out this honeypot mansion ? I do believe thats exactly what it is though...</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Regarding Q... The reason why i remain skeptical, is mainly due to no new information. Alot of what he points to are literally ALL of the conspiracies that are familiar to those already interested into these subjects. He might be connecting the dots, in some kind of bizarre puzzle. If a Q clearance validates those conspiracies we&#39;re along way from home i guess. </p>

<p>The photo&#39;s shared and texts mentioned by the president is a big mystery to me. Imo, this implies actually knowledge of Q being on 4chan/8chan by trump and Co.</p>

<p>still all very interesting and ill continue to follow the developments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah well alot of people are thinking Himmmm is RDJ from what he&#39;s posted so far, iron man himself posting frequently on what started out as a Hollywood gossip site. And he&#39;d have the clout to be invited to see hef&#39;s stash, he even got to sit there watching all the films he wanted to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just saw on Enty&#39;s twitter (the guy that runs crazydaysandnights):</p>

<p>&quot;There is finally more to add to The Web tomorrow. Another big player who is trying to cut deals left and right to save his own skin. No, it isn&#39;t Bran Singer.&quot;</p>

<p>Notice &quot;The Web&quot; written like I title. reference to this article titled &quot;The Web&quot; about DG having Chris Cornell killed?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/12/todays-blind-items-web.html">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/12/todays-blind-items-web.html</a></p>

<p>If they are both referring to the same big story tomorrow, Q and these Hollywood guys are in on the same intel. And if y&#39;all don&#39;t know who DG is, he&#39;s like Voldemort, he who shall not be named or the thread will be deleted. Think, murderous pedo looking, rich and famous, old record producer whose name rhymes with Wayvid Deffen. </p>

<p>Not really much to tell other than, before 4chan&#39;s boom of popularity due to little shits coming and telling their sOopEr cOoL and R4nDumb friendz&quot; who then told theirs - it was a place where the highly intelligent came to act like a jack ass. People reveled in two things: complete freedom and complete anonymity. The internet wasn&#39;t what it is today - there WERE equivalents to back alleys, and anything went on in those back alleys.</p>

<p>Make no mistake though - people who say that kind of shadowy figure play is the price of freedom are retarded and pseudo-intellectuals. It&#39;s just where we&#39;re at, evolutionarily speaking.</p>
