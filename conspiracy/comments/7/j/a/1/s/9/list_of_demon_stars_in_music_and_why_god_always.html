       What's common behavior pattern for demons: heavy drug/alcohol use, pedophiles/child abuse, gays, they've been abused, satanic rituals, and finally dead with a drama. Usually their life's comes with a lot (!) of drama/suffering. So normal human being life can be extremely boring. (There's your explanation how Michael Jackson turned white from black and how Freddie released a few genius albums right before his death). Demons take life/death easily and enjoy suffering because they know they will be (this is blocked for demons as of recently so they won't) reborn.
      </p>
      <p>
       They often go only by the first name/use nickname/symbolic name. What's also often common among them - high voice pitch for men, low pitch for women, specific face features (often quite unique look), unique vocal or dancing talents.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a human you can't distinguish between a demon and real human, but they can't hide their evil nature in the presence of the angels (yes, good guys do exist!). It shows up by robotic jerky movements, much faster than a human could do and very bizarre/unnatural, that's why they can be fantastic dancers. Also dogs can detect their sweet-ish/tart smell (that's why they are usually heavily perfumed to hide it, good guys don't use perfume at all) and start barking aggressively (that's where detection of Terminators by dogs come from).
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually Demons are not hiding it - you can find it out based on their music videos, lyrics, concerts, dancing but most people are blind to see through. For example, "Thriller" and "Remember the time" Michael Jackson, "Made in Heaven" (which totally looks like hell) and "It's a Hard Life" by Freddy Mercury/Queen, "Dark Horse" Katy Perry, "I'm not afraid" Eminem, "Pretty Girls" Britney Spears, "Born this way" Lady Gaga.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously demons are very talented and persuasive - that's why it's easy for them to be likable and become celebrities.  Demons are getting their inspiration and energy from the evil (NOT the dark side (Hello Star Wars!), amusingly enough - black side are the good guys, and white side are the demons) but you already know that (Devil/Lucifer, which is "It", not "he/she". Devil has been terminated as of pretty recently in every time/place/incarnation in the whole universe, total 666 copies (yep, it multiplied itself, lol) that's where this number comes from).
      </p>
      <p>
       Demons want to be in the center of attention and be treated like "gods" at all (!) costs. Fame for demons is as attractive as money. But more so, they impact life of the millions of innocent people in a negative way (even it appears that they are piece makers, help charity, etc. - if you dig deeper it's not so). For example, "The Show Must Go On" is actually programming people for life full of pain, struggles and suffering and it should go on and go without end. ("Eternity/Forever" is a favorite devil's word as in "Who wants to live forever").
      </p>
      <p>
       Music is very powerful tool for mind programming, via rhythm, lyrics, sound, etc. it comes into your brain and thoughts without you actually realizing it. When you guess how a human could create such a masterpiece (song, dance, show)? That's the first sign it's not created by humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now a lot/ if not all of the demons/devil's masterpieces and ideas have been stolen from God himself and he lives like cattle financially with his wife and son (hello, megarich evil bastards). Listen to the song "What if God was one of us".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now how that's possible? If 1 is against 666 copies of Devil and army of demons, he can be drugged, brainwashed, (memory erased as in Total Recall) and controlled by white magic (remember black is good). However, 1 (God) always wins against 0 (Devil/Lucifer), simple math which Lucifer is just bad at. If it's 0, even 666 copies of it wouldn't help. "Enlightenment" from Lucifer? Common, just a sick joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       P. S. Bible and most of the human history is fake - the real events are distorted in the favor of Devil/Lucifer to the point of complete rubbish. (Fake History) and should be rewritten.

       I believe being gay is more of a survival technique to fit in  and feel excepted. A cover or disobedience to God as well. Rebellion and a need for human approval without the work of living the way required.

       I do have a Ghost Rider comic where Ghost Rider escapes Hell and Lucifer tries to go after him. Since Ghost Rider had the power of the Spirit of Vengeance he was able to shift through time/space. Hell--&gt; Earth. When Lucifer hit the portal he exploded into 666 different demons.

       Given that everything in existence is matter  vibrating at different frequencies, God and Lucifer are merely different expressions of the same energy. Much like a house brick or a steaming pile of shit.

       Eminem interests me. I read his book and unless it's a complete work of fiction it's hard to see how he would be a "chosen demon" or whatever.
