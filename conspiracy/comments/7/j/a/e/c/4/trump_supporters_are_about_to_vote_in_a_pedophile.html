        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let&#39;s be clear, Roy Moore is a pedophile. Multiple women have come forward alleging Moore made sexual advancements on them when they were teens. Former local police officers were aware of Moore and one was told to look out for him as he was known to harass cheerleaders from local schools. There have been stories about Moore&#39;s conduct for decades in the town of Gadsden. </p>

<p>Why are Trump supporters downplaying all of this? Politics. They pretended to care about sexual abuse and pedophilia when talking about Clinton, Biden, Franken, etc... But to show they are not only hypocrites like Democrats but worse, they are pushing supporters to vote for the pedophile. </p>

<p>So the question remains, why are Trump supporters rallying behind a known pedophile? Who&#39;s funding Moore&#39;s campaign?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can they prove it was him in a court of law when this happened well before his political career and the statute of limitations prevents it from going to trial? It is impossible to prove in a court of law because once the statute of limitations has passed it cannot be tried.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not JUST me that thinks this senators have been calling for congressional investigations into this since October. You say you&#39;ll only believe successful convictions but how can he be successfully convicted if the statute of limitations has passed. It&#39;s an impossible standard. You have to admit it&#39;s enough to warrant at the very least a congressional investigations. I just want the opportunity of a fair trial. Of course congressional Republicans won&#39;t do this and of they do I&#39;ll eat my shorts. I would love to stand to be corrected but apparently having an R next to your name exonerates you from facing serious investigation nowadays.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might be my favorite piece of spin on this one. Because it&#39;s so easy to accidentally end up at a brothel with child prostitutes. Moore is like a poorly written villain. If he showed up in a movie, you&#39;d immediately know he&#39;s the bad guy. You&#39;d complain about how one-sided he is as a character. </p>

<p><a href="https://thinkprogress.org/speaker-at-moore-event-says-he-accidentally-went-with-moore-to-a-brothel-with-child-prostitutes-65c9819f8a1e/">https://thinkprogress.org/speaker-at-moore-event-says-he-accidentally-went-with-moore-to-a-brothel-with-child-prostitutes-65c9819f8a1e/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Staehle said that, when he and Moore arrived, they soon realized the man had taken them to a brothel. The third man, Staehle suggested, essentially tricked them. “I could tell you what I saw but I don’t want to,” Staehle said mischievously.</p>

<p>“There were certainly pretty girls. And they were girls. They were young. Some were very young,” Staehle acknowledged. But according to Staehle, Moore was shocked by what he saw. “We shouldn’t be here, I’m leaving,” Moore said, according to Staehle.</p>
