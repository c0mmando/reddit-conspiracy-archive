<p>I&#39;m not quite sure what to make of this, but it seems overly creepy to me, especially at 1:28 and 5:01.Into a heated debate with what seems to be a rabid shill to quickly shut down my providing this evidence on a front page picture about Joe biden. I saw in the comments one about how Joe biden is a creep, and there was video evidence, so I googled it, and this is what came up. </p>

<p>Odd to see that this hasn&#39;t had more attention then it has. What do you guys think?</p>

<p>He was in a brothel that had children. Actual proof of him being in one, okay no evidence that he fucked a kid, but certainly better evidence than some emails that talk about pizza or a guy looking creepy in a video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guess how many child brothels (or any brothel, for that matter) I have been in?   Exactly zero.</p>

<p>Podesta being college friends with Hastert is proof that he&#39;s a pedophile... but Moore chumming around with people who know where to find a child brother is &quot;nothing to see here&quot;.</p>

<p>Plus, Moore is an evangelical, so that raises the odds right there that he&#39;s a kid toucher.  Most evangelicals are.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.biljanadjurdjevic.com/images/5.jpg">How can you possibly view the children in this painting as &quot;dead&quot;</a>?  I mean it&#39;s not my cup of tea, but I can certainly understand how people could find a painting like this quite striking and beautiful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the emails of being &quot;entertained&quot; by 7 year olds in swimming pools</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No matter how hard you guys try to spin this, there is absolutely nothing creepy about a grandmother inviting 8 women and 9 men (most with children of their own) to an afternoon picnic at a farm house.  Maybe you could tell us exactly which part of this particular e-mail is giving you the erection, and we can zero in on it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the email of still considering Hastert a dear friend</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a new one to me, do you have a source?  I see where <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/48488">Tony</a> mentions that he has &quot;stayed in touch&quot; with Hastert over the years... that hardly qualifies as a &quot;dear friend&quot;, though.  And regardless, sometimes our friends do shitty things that we aren&#39;t proud of.  I have a childhood friend who is in prison for murder right now... does that make me a murderer, too?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the resemblance of both Podestas to the police sketches </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Should be the easiest thing to prove in the world, then.  Were both Podestas in Portugal on May 3, 2007?  If so, then you&#39;ve cracked the case, Columbo!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the being friends with Weiner and Epstein</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Show me where either Podesta is &quot;friends&quot; with Wiener.  And I&#39;ll guess you don&#39;t want to <a href="https://i.redd.it/qgv19nbo994z.jpg">start digging into Epstein&#39;s friends</a> too deeply.</p>

In those videos of him being a creep around kids, he literally drags them into position next to his crotch and continues to touch them all over the face/shoulder/waist areas even though he could see the children squirming. No reasonable man will continue physical touching if they can read signs of discomfort. It definitely looks like a dominance thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate is what convinced me.</p>

<p>The Wikileaks emails are proven to not be fabricated.  Even some in the government admitted their validity.</p>

<p>There is blatant code talk in some of the Podesta emails.  One is even pretty blatant about having kids under 10 years old in a pool for entertainment purposes.  There are plenty more if you look.</p>

<p>There have been congressmen who have actually been busted for pedophilia.  See Dennis Hastert, who was speaker of the house from 1999-2007.  Research the Franklin scandal.  Research Jeffrey Epstein and his Lolita Express.  Some of the people being accused in Hollywood took a trip on it.</p>

<p>Alefantis&#39;s, the Comet Ping Pong pizza joint owner who is connected via the Podesta emails, Instagram account had tons of convincing and disturbing stuff on it.  A room tagged #Killroom and a kid sized coffin are two of the main ones.</p>

<p>Then you have the F.B.I. pedophile symbols that are on the D.C. pizza joints connected to Alefantis.</p>

<p>Then you have Podesta&#39;s art, which is stuff like a sculpture or whatever of one of Jeffrey Dahmer&#39;s victims and little children in underwear to name a few.</p>

<p>Then you have all of the MSM including Fox News (republicans would have benefited tremendously from such a scandal) label Pizzagate &quot;fake news&quot;.  This is evidence of all of the MSM coordinating a narrative and cover up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s awful. And he has indeed been named by a former Secret Service Agent as engaging in &quot;Weinstein-level groping&quot;</p>

<p>I hate it that whenever this video (or any of the many others like it) is posted, straight away people flood the comments with &quot;there have never been any accusations&quot; as if that makes a difference when it&#39;s plainly visible that he is clutching at, weirdly positioning, and secretly whispering things to little girls!</p>

<p>And in fact there have been several attempts in the MSM to get a debate started about it...all to no avail. Yes, I think he is without doubt a pedophile. I&#39;m afraid they all are.</p>

<p>Check out the tweetstream mentioned here also</p>

<p>There are innumerable videos online that show Biden touching children and whispering into their ears. A thread tweeted by Richard Armande Mills on Monday highlights an alarming number of these incidents.</p>

<p>In this clip, former Vice President Biden uses a candid moment to fondle the chest area of a little girl — in front of her entire family. Her visible discomfort is extremely obvious. pic.twitter.com/PXZx68KEGe</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 13, 2017</p>

<p>If that wasn&#39;t disturbing enough, in this clip, Biden not only touches a young woman but smells her hair, kisses her, whispering something into her ear, only to tell her &quot;see you back home, I hope&quot; after visibly creeping out her and who I assume is her mother. pic.twitter.com/WrFLWmAPFJ</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 13, 2017</p>

<p>As former VP, Biden had a habit of smelling the hair of women and (particularly) little girls. In this clip, he fixes the hair of a little girl, conveniently placing his hands near her chest area. Her and the other young girl beside her clearly seem uncomfortable by it all. pic.twitter.com/fpER7WB604</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 13, 2017</p>

<p>In this clip, Biden swears-in (R) Senator Jim Risch. During photographs, Biden touches Risch&#39;s daughter, specifically asking to take a photo alone with her. You can hear Risch say &quot;Dad&#39;s going to stand pretty close.&quot; (I wonder why?) Biden even jokes and says, &quot;If I was young…&quot; pic.twitter.com/LLqJ4guU0q</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 13, 2017</p>

<p>In this clip at another swearing-in ceremony, former VP Biden starts strangely sniffing the hair of a very young girl (he just met) repeatedly, also kissing on her. This man clearly has no boundaries. pic.twitter.com/MxYxEJVDRR</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 13, 2017</p>

<p>Biden almost always seems to immediately inquire about the age of the girls he meets during these ops. He also has a habit of creepily saying &quot;no serious guys till you&#39;re 31.&quot; &quot;Serious&quot; guys? The way he handles young girls is discomforting to watch. You can see it on their faces. pic.twitter.com/AH0V41WiQG</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 13, 2017</p>

<p>In this clip, Biden grabs onto a little girl he just met, continuing to grab her with one hand as he uses his other to shake hands with those he&#39;s being introduced to. Very awkward. He then starts stroking her face repeatedly. pic.twitter.com/NhHkuthDb6</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 13, 2017</p>

<p>A lot of the family members involved in these awkward moments don&#39;t know how to respond to Joe Biden preying on their young female relatives. Jeff Sessions, however, knows exactly what to do. Watch as he swats Biden&#39;s hand from touching his granddaughter. Wonder why he&#39;d do that? pic.twitter.com/YNw5ZHlXWP</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 13, 2017</p>

<p>Former VP Joe Biden has a quote he tells practically every girl he met during those taped confirmation hearings.</p>

<p>&quot;No dating till you&#39;re 30.&quot;</p>

<p>In this clip, he asks a little girl if she remembers what he told her the last time they interacted together. What do you think he said? pic.twitter.com/tykYacaI85</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>Former VP Joe Biden doesn&#39;t just target little girls. Watch as he grabs onto the shoulder&#39;s of Ashton Carter&#39;s wife, Stephanie, smelling her hair. She&#39;s clearly surprised by his awkward behavior. pic.twitter.com/nerOikRQcZ</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 13, 2017</p>

<p>Think about it.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re turning 11. You&#39;re beautiful. Just remember: No dates till you&#39;re 30.&quot;</p>

<p>Is it a joke? A rule. A requirement. A demand?</p>

<p>Why shouldn&#39;t a young women be able to date until she&#39;s well-past maturity?</p>

<p>Former VP Biden has said it so much, a montage exists. pic.twitter.com/SdWqn8mSIa</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>The footage from former Senator Kelly Ayotte&#39;s swearing-in was one of the most awkward encounters. I&#39;ve broken it into 2 parts. In this clip, Ayotte&#39;s daughter Billy impatiently enters the staging area ahead of schedule. Former VP Biden notices.</p>

<p>&quot;Who&#39;s that beautiful child?&quot; pic.twitter.com/oGdQyt7s8g</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>After strangely asking 6 y.o. Billy if she was 17, telling her she can do &quot;whatever she wants,&quot; former VP Biden proceeds to have an awkward exchange with Kelly, stroking Billy to the point it almost seems Kelly asks her son about the &quot;cameras&quot; intentionally.</p>

<p>You decide. pic.twitter.com/pzA2jN3aM4</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>One awkward moment after another. The mother&#39;s discomfort is clearly noticeable when Biden meets and poses with the children in her family. She strangely asks if picture taking is over early. Biden tells the kids &quot;keep the boys away from their sisters.&quot; Sons called &quot;protectors.&quot; pic.twitter.com/Esa0SEWyze</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>In this exchange, Senator Sullivan himself wonders if the picture-taking (&amp; likely Biden being around his kids) is over. During the picture-taking, Biden physical moves Sullivan&#39;s daughter towards him, clutching onto her side. She even calls out for her father twice in confusion. pic.twitter.com/9voIJ10mG9</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>Visibly perturbed family members seem to be a running theme at these Biden led swear-ins. During this one, a family member almost looks as if she&#39;s using the prop she&#39;s holding to mask Biden&#39;s roaming hands, which are on her younger female relative. pic.twitter.com/o2fVhe5hda</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>During this confirmation swear-in ceremony, the senator involved loudly (and intentionally?) reminds Biden of his position by saying &quot;this is the Vice President of the United States.&quot; Hair sniffing and eery whispers by Biden make an comeback in this clip. pic.twitter.com/9RSV1fOGoT</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>In this clip, Senator Cantwell introduces former VP Biden to her nieces, who all look visibly uncomfortable in his presence. The former Vice President then says &quot;it&#39;s ripe&quot; while whisper-speaking with Cantwell&#39;s young nieces. What on earth does he mean by that? pic.twitter.com/EGqYx8SG1a</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>In this clip filmed by a random Sacramento family, former Vice President Joe Biden repeats the &quot;keep the boys away from your sister&quot; line. Then he tells the family a strange story about how his daughter at &quot;about age 12 &amp; a half or 13&quot;, &quot;wakes up, there&#39;s a snake in the bed.&quot; ?? pic.twitter.com/RHJfubccyh</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>While there are unfortunately many, MANY more disturbing clips like what has been previously witnessed, this last clip with Senator Joni Ernst concludes the video portion of this thread. Observe everything Biden says or does that leads to an uncomfortable laugh from Ernst. ?? pic.twitter.com/gWFQ1IzdSE</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>Why must former Vice President Joe Biden habitually smell the hair of the women, little girls, and babies he meets? pic.twitter.com/U53mdueVFi</p>

<p>Imagine putting some kind of chemical in your hair, that you need to be up close to smell in order to be poisoned by it. Wonder if that assassination would work.</p>

<p>Starting early on getting the rumors going for a potential presidential nominee huh? I&#39;ve seen this same vid posted what like 3 times this week? Somebody is definitely pushing an agenda and it&#39;s not them trying to save the children. There has never even been a complaint by a single kid or parent that Joe Biden was sexually inappropriate. It&#39;s not even like it&#39;s one of those secrets nobody talks about but everybody knows. Paul Joseph Watson is a fucking right wing hack trying to lump Joe Biden into a right wing hit job. You ever hear pizzagate claiming major Republican party members are pedophiles? No it&#39;s always a Democrat and I know the Republican party isn&#39;t lily white in regards to sexual deviance. You might as well believe a video put out by Roger Stone</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure murder is as effective anymore because of the internet. They know there&#39;s a tipping point. Plus, I think the White Hats hold more sway than they used to. </p>

<p>Also, sometimes the killing doesn&#39;t come right away. They give it months, or years, depending on how docile and agreeable the subject has become. </p>

<p>Killing Ben Swann right after he made that video, for example, might&#39;v actually brought it to more people&#39;s attention. Now that he&#39;s been neutered, people just think &quot;Well, he was out of line and got brought back into line.&quot; </p>

<p>Other people, like Chester Bennington, for example, get killed. </p>

<p>It may be that the people who get killed got their info first hand, after joining secret societies or being abused themselves. Reporters like Ben Swann merely gathered the information on their own, and they&#39;re hands off? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about &quot;honor among thieves&quot; or what kind of secret society agreements hold true, not being part of one personally. </p>

<p>As for the &quot;Johnny rotten said a bit about Jimmy Saville, his behaviour was whispered about,&quot; well......the Washington Post and other mainstream and alternative publications have been more than whispering about Biden for a while now. The Ted Heath thing is pretty obvious by this point, particularly considering how much info has been destroyed yet enough remains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing to do with politics. I&#39;m not even American. I just know a pedophile abusing children when I see one</p>

<p>There are innumerable videos online that show Biden touching children and whispering into their ears. A thread tweeted by Richard Armande Mills on Monday highlights an alarming number of these incidents.</p>

<p>In this clip, former Vice President Biden uses a candid moment to fondle the chest area of a little girl — in front of her entire family. Her visible discomfort is extremely obvious. pic.twitter.com/PXZx68KEGe</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 13, 2017</p>

<p>If that wasn&#39;t disturbing enough, in this clip, Biden not only touches a young woman but smells her hair, kisses her, whispering something into her ear, only to tell her &quot;see you back home, I hope&quot; after visibly creeping out her and who I assume is her mother. pic.twitter.com/WrFLWmAPFJ</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 13, 2017</p>

<p>As former VP, Biden had a habit of smelling the hair of women and (particularly) little girls. In this clip, he fixes the hair of a little girl, conveniently placing his hands near her chest area. Her and the other young girl beside her clearly seem uncomfortable by it all. pic.twitter.com/fpER7WB604</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 13, 2017</p>

<p>In this clip, Biden swears-in (R) Senator Jim Risch. During photographs, Biden touches Risch&#39;s daughter, specifically asking to take a photo alone with her. You can hear Risch say &quot;Dad&#39;s going to stand pretty close.&quot; (I wonder why?) Biden even jokes and says, &quot;If I was young…&quot; pic.twitter.com/LLqJ4guU0q</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 13, 2017</p>

<p>In this clip at another swearing-in ceremony, former VP Biden starts strangely sniffing the hair of a very young girl (he just met) repeatedly, also kissing on her. This man clearly has no boundaries. pic.twitter.com/MxYxEJVDRR</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 13, 2017</p>

<p>Biden almost always seems to immediately inquire about the age of the girls he meets during these ops. He also has a habit of creepily saying &quot;no serious guys till you&#39;re 31.&quot; &quot;Serious&quot; guys? The way he handles young girls is discomforting to watch. You can see it on their faces. pic.twitter.com/AH0V41WiQG</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 13, 2017</p>

<p>In this clip, Biden grabs onto a little girl he just met, continuing to grab her with one hand as he uses his other to shake hands with those he&#39;s being introduced to. Very awkward. He then starts stroking her face repeatedly. pic.twitter.com/NhHkuthDb6</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 13, 2017</p>

<p>A lot of the family members involved in these awkward moments don&#39;t know how to respond to Joe Biden preying on their young female relatives. Jeff Sessions, however, knows exactly what to do. Watch as he swats Biden&#39;s hand from touching his granddaughter. Wonder why he&#39;d do that? pic.twitter.com/YNw5ZHlXWP</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 13, 2017</p>

<p>Former VP Joe Biden has a quote he tells practically every girl he met during those taped confirmation hearings.</p>

<p>&quot;No dating till you&#39;re 30.&quot;</p>

<p>In this clip, he asks a little girl if she remembers what he told her the last time they interacted together. What do you think he said? pic.twitter.com/tykYacaI85</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>Former VP Joe Biden doesn&#39;t just target little girls. Watch as he grabs onto the shoulder&#39;s of Ashton Carter&#39;s wife, Stephanie, smelling her hair. She&#39;s clearly surprised by his awkward behavior. pic.twitter.com/nerOikRQcZ</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 13, 2017</p>

<p>Think about it.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re turning 11. You&#39;re beautiful. Just remember: No dates till you&#39;re 30.&quot;</p>

<p>Is it a joke? A rule. A requirement. A demand?</p>

<p>Why shouldn&#39;t a young women be able to date until she&#39;s well-past maturity?</p>

<p>Former VP Biden has said it so much, a montage exists. pic.twitter.com/SdWqn8mSIa</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>The footage from former Senator Kelly Ayotte&#39;s swearing-in was one of the most awkward encounters. I&#39;ve broken it into 2 parts. In this clip, Ayotte&#39;s daughter Billy impatiently enters the staging area ahead of schedule. Former VP Biden notices.</p>

<p>&quot;Who&#39;s that beautiful child?&quot; pic.twitter.com/oGdQyt7s8g</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>After strangely asking 6 y.o. Billy if she was 17, telling her she can do &quot;whatever she wants,&quot; former VP Biden proceeds to have an awkward exchange with Kelly, stroking Billy to the point it almost seems Kelly asks her son about the &quot;cameras&quot; intentionally.</p>

<p>You decide. pic.twitter.com/pzA2jN3aM4</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>One awkward moment after another. The mother&#39;s discomfort is clearly noticeable when Biden meets and poses with the children in her family. She strangely asks if picture taking is over early. Biden tells the kids &quot;keep the boys away from their sisters.&quot; Sons called &quot;protectors.&quot; pic.twitter.com/Esa0SEWyze</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>In this exchange, Senator Sullivan himself wonders if the picture-taking (&amp; likely Biden being around his kids) is over. During the picture-taking, Biden physical moves Sullivan&#39;s daughter towards him, clutching onto her side. She even calls out for her father twice in confusion. pic.twitter.com/9voIJ10mG9</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>Visibly perturbed family members seem to be a running theme at these Biden led swear-ins. During this one, a family member almost looks as if she&#39;s using the prop she&#39;s holding to mask Biden&#39;s roaming hands, which are on her younger female relative. pic.twitter.com/o2fVhe5hda</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>During this confirmation swear-in ceremony, the senator involved loudly (and intentionally?) reminds Biden of his position by saying &quot;this is the Vice President of the United States.&quot; Hair sniffing and eery whispers by Biden make an comeback in this clip. pic.twitter.com/9RSV1fOGoT</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>In this clip, Senator Cantwell introduces former VP Biden to her nieces, who all look visibly uncomfortable in his presence. The former Vice President then says &quot;it&#39;s ripe&quot; while whisper-speaking with Cantwell&#39;s young nieces. What on earth does he mean by that? pic.twitter.com/EGqYx8SG1a</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>In this clip filmed by a random Sacramento family, former Vice President Joe Biden repeats the &quot;keep the boys away from your sister&quot; line. Then he tells the family a strange story about how his daughter at &quot;about age 12 &amp; a half or 13&quot;, &quot;wakes up, there&#39;s a snake in the bed.&quot; ?? pic.twitter.com/RHJfubccyh</p>

<p>— Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>While there are unfortunately many, MANY more disturbing clips like what has been previously witnessed, this last clip with Senator Joni Ernst concludes the video portion of this thread. Observe everything Biden says or does that leads to an uncomfortable laugh from Ernst. ?? pic.twitter.com/gWFQ1IzdSE</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s where you and I differ then friend. An adult clutching at children, whispering to them, smelling them, making sexual claims over them, forcing them in front of his groin, calling out for kids from across the room is child abuse as far as I&#39;m concerned.

    <div class="md"><p>Gobsmacked.  </p>

<p>Can you actually <em>see</em> how uncomfortable the girl in the photo which accompanies this post is? Like, I&#39;m tempted to ask you if your eyes are actually correctly passing information to your brain? </p>

<p>Her face is contorted, she&#39;s leaning as far away from him as she possibly can, she doesn&#39;t want to hear whatever he has to whisper to her - </p>

<p>So I would counter your &quot;look within yourself&quot; comment with - </p>

<p>Try and improve your observational skills. </p>

<p>Read up on kinesiology. </p>

<p>Read up on what constitutes &quot;abuse&quot; (for starters - unwanted touching is definitely on that list...)</p>

<p>Read up on how difficult it is for victims of abuse to come forward when their abuser <em>isn&#39;t</em> the Veep. </p>

<p>Read up on what how difficult it is for the victim to come to terms with if the abuse happened on camera in front of multiple witnesses (eg Saville, Bush Snr, Hoffman, etc etc - all abused victims on camera, in front of mutliple witnesses). </p>

<p>I would add - I haven&#39;t imposed &quot;all those thoughts onto old video&quot;, I have literally described what is happening in those videos - which is that Biden <em>won&#39;t stop touching, gripping hold of, whispering to, and smelling kids</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m not the only one suggesting his behaviour around children is suspect. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also not a pedophile. </p>

<p>Part of the way I can <em>tell</em> I&#39;m not a pedophile is his behaviour around children makes me <em>deeply</em> uncomfortable - because I have empathy for his many many victims, who can be seen visibly writhing in distress as he manhandles and paws at them.</p>

<p>Are you capable of understanding that abuse can happen <em>even if a complaint hasn&#39;t been made yet</em>?</p>

<p>Do you understand it can take <em>years</em> for victims of abuse to even <em>process</em> that they have been abused, let alone <em>file charges</em>?</p>

<p>What about his ex secret service agent who claims Biden was as bad as Weinstein for groping women and children? You dispute the claim of a man who spent hours and hours in his company, and had to constantly protect female Navy personnel (who must obey all of his commands) from him? How bizarre that you would think you know better than him.</p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming you haven&#39;t actually spent much time with Biden yourself? So why doubt the evidence supplied by a man who has?</p>

<p>Are you saying the only qualifier for abuse taking place is that the kid <em>literally runs off screaming</em>? </p>

<p>Because <em>that</em> is a fucking terrifying assertion, and if it&#39;s truly what you believe, I&#39;d suggest you take a long hard look at yourself</p>

<p>You&#39;re of course entitled to your opinion but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that Biden hasn&#39;t been accused of any of the heinous acts you&#39;re suggesting.</p>

<p>You know what makes me uncomfortable? The way Trump holds his daughter, the way he talked about her infant breasts. The way he bragged about walking around backstage at miss teen USA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edited? To show him groping kids? They can&#39;t edit what doesn&#39;t happen, those aren&#39;t CG hands, they are Joe&#39;s (unless you are suggesting otherwise?). Not dubbed whispers, either, unless they&#39;ve CGI&#39;D his mouth. Not CG expressions on the kid&#39;s faces either.</p>

<p>Why is it so difficult to understand abuse can happen without accusations? </p>

<p>The girls who were abused - let&#39;s be frank here - finger-fucked on live BBC TV by Jimmy Saville, in front of the cameras, the performing pop bands and the studio audience? It took them years to come forward. </p>

<p>Like, 30, 40 years (perhaps in part because of what I said before about how long it can take victims of sexual abuse to come to terms with their abuse, and in part because of what an &quot;untouchable&quot; part of the Establishment he was).</p>

<p>And Saville was an entertainment personality, not the Veep of the United States.</p>

<p>Biden isn&#39;t &quot;goofing around&quot;. He&#39;s abusing children. Yes, in front of millions of people. </p>

<p>And as for Trump - yes, well spotted, he&#39;s a sexual predator and pedophile as well. </p>

<p>He raped a 13 year old girl with Jeffery Epstein, according to the victims&#39; Sworn Testimony. I have no doubt he&#39;s abused his daughters, as well as his previous wife (who he raped), and I&#39;m sure his new wife gets the same treatment, as we all know, old habits die hard (surely there&#39;s a reason her Xmas decor was so very very gloomy and dark...?)</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t understand how people are so blinded by their personal politics. You can see pics of Trump&#39;s teenage daughter sat on his lap and perceive that <em>that</em> is deeply uncomfortable, but because it&#39;s just Good Ole Joe, he can do whatever he likes? </p>

<p>(I don&#39;t suppose this will work, because you&#39;re obviously set in your mindset about this - but just imagine, for a moment, that it was Trump in the video, not Biden - how would you feel then, I wonder? Uncomfortable? Disconcerted by his behaviour? Disgusted? All perfectly appropriate reactions. In fact, shit, cover his face entirely and just watch the video with a headless man, or disregard Biden totally and just watch the faces of the kids... He is an adult, making them do things they don&#39;t want to do ie be felt up or intently whispered at... How would you feel about the behaviour if it was Trump doing it?) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Such a fitting title for this whole thing, isn&#39;t it? I read once, that Kubrick initially wanted the naked sex-ladies at the masked gathering  to be girls and boys of varying ages, but they obviously couldn&#39;t put that into the movie, so regular adult sex-slaves it had to be.</p>

<p>That would also justify the whole flirty scene Cruise has with the Russian guy&#39;s daughter from the costume shop a little better.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still cautiously optimistic that our collective eyes are slowly creeping open. Eyes Wide Shut will seem like a documentary just a few years down the line. At least I hope so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guys honestly now. Im not from USA and I don&#39;t really know why you guys have such an outrage with pedophiles. I really dont get it I&#39;m really hoping you guys can clear this out for me. There are so many other problems of your national security, of millions and billions of dollars being frauded and you guys are SO outraged because some guys MAY be pedophiles? Why is this such an important problem this year? </p>

<p>Not to say that pedophiles are not a problem and they should be dealt with, but I feel like you guys have such rage for pedophiles and whatnot recentyl you are forgeting about the actual problems impacting millions of people</p>
