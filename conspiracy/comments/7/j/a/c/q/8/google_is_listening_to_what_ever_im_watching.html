Thought ah maybe its just coz like the documentary i clicked on was related. 
But today i was watching a vine compilation (link below) 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PSKpmSEoo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_PSKpmSEoo</a>
and i wanted to look for one of the vines within the compilation.

    <div class="md"><p>Said it before and I&#39;ll say it again. If you want to know if there are real people listening in, or if the algorithm flags you in some way... There is a certain thing you can talk about on social media or forums that is guaranteed to get you a visit from the secret service, just to be sure you aren&#39;t really a threat. Because they have to take all threats around this special topic seriously, because it is highly sensitive.</p>

<p>So ...somebody should have a very convincing &quot;conversation&quot; about that certain special topic and see how long it takes for the secret service to show up. Likely won&#39;t get in any real trouble, but it could be entertaining to ask who turned you in...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had to do Robert Mc to get a suggestion for Robert McNamara. But, I didn&#39;t watch any documentary lately. </p>

<p>The thing is, if you watched the documentary at home, even if not on your device, &quot;The internet&quot; sees the traffic as somebody in your home watching a doc about Robert McNamara.</p>

<p>If you watched it on Netflix or something, it&#39;s conceivable that Netflix shares data with Google or gets metadata from the same third party. Or, it&#39;s also conceivable that your ISP is doing deep packet inspection and selling that data to a third party. This could even potentially happen if you merely watched it on cable, as the line between cable and internet has become very blurry.</p>

<p>The impressive thing is it looks like this whole system, if not just a coincidence, is capable of pimping out your info in a matter of seconds or minutes.</p>

<p>Now if you had watched the documentary on VHS or DVD or at your friends house, that might be a little weirder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue is that I had not mentioned Alan Partridge at all. Nobody in any of the chats had referenced it and we did not watch it through the internet. Nor did I have my work phone on me at the time of watching it. The conclusion that draws me to is that there is software that collects and interprets audio on my personal phone that is sharing it to a common app on both phones (perhaps Gmail/google). </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a conspiracy as most people are aware that these companies are spying on their customers but I personally wasn&#39;t aware that they also record audio. It&#39;s a huge invasion of privacy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last week I gave in and finally updated the iOS on my iPhone 6s, so while on safari and upon hitting the search bar, two recommended words to search appear. </p>

<p>While watching friends Snapchat stories, one had a string of videos in the car playing Meek Mill. I have never searched his name nor do I have one of his songs on my phone, a couple minutes later “Meek Mill” appeared in the recommended for safari.</p>

<p>Not sure if it’s specifically google but some company/entity is definitely keeping an ear out, my opinion is it’s either for algorithms to promote consumerism or are for looking out for specific key words like bomb, terrorism, kill etc. in which case would be the NSA &amp; not a harmless ad company </p>

<p>I just did a google search for <a href="https://imgur.com/a/P6hRL">&quot;they ask&quot; and it autocompleted to the same thing</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s serving it up because google thinks/has learned that is what most people are looking for when starting to type &quot;they ask&quot;.</p>

<p>This is how autocomplete/type ahead works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so I know this kind of thing gets posted here a lot and I honestly don&#39;t know if there&#39;s anything to this but I have an anecdote to share that kind of spooked my wife and I a little bit. </p>

<p>My son was telling us about a guitar that he wanted. It&#39;s a very specific Paul Reed Smith guitar so he pulls it up in his phone and shows us. My wife and I are not musicians and have never had a reason to be searching for anything guitar related. However within minutes her and I both started to see ads for this exact same guitar on our own phones.</p>

<p>Now I don&#39;t think the phone is necessarily listening. I think the database know that the three of us are connected in some way so it targeted us after his search. Sounds more plausible than the phone tracking audio for targeted ads right? I mean the ads were accurate right down to the specific color he wanted, which was never actually mentioned out loud in the conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s likely that you were all in your home and using your wifi. Basically, while each of your phones will have its own unique IP address, they&#39;re all headed out of the same gateway. For targeting and marketing it would make sense to pay attention at that point rather for every device. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s way more complex than that but you get the idea.</p>

<p>What concerns me is my xbox, echo dot and the Google thingy. If you start seeing ads for stuff you&#39;ve only had a conversation about in your house, that&#39;s creepy.</p>
