    <div class="md"><p>You are misunderstanding me. </p>

<p>By hiding the fact that the Earth is flat (if it is), then it could be argued that someone is suppressing evidence that we were created by intelligent design rather than by a random cosmic explosion.</p>

<p>It would mean everything NASA or any other agency has ever told anyone and that the only goal is to keep the population in the dark and take money from them in the form of taxes. </p>

<p>What fruits of labor have actually come from NASA? Have YOU or anyone YOU know been there? Has there ever been any absolute, undeniable, irrefutable proof that anyone can actually go there? Even the moon rock given to the dutch was proven to be petrified wood. Any footage from the ISS can easily be made in front of a green screen with anyone that gets billions of dollars a year. </p>

<p>There are many reasons to hide flat earth. Start thinking for yourself and you can probably come up with a few for yourself.</p>

<p>I fell asleep on an airplane because it certainly didnt feel like it was moving 600+mph. Why could I not feel movement? Does that mean the airplane was actually stationary?</p>

<p>Turbulence is different than motion. Also in space there is no wind to cause turbulence making high speeds even easier. This seems to be more proof of space... </p>

<p>On a clear day with no turbulence its a very smooth ride. How do you explain that I can sleep moving that fast?</p>

<p>You also arent explaining why this supports a FE. Your argument is basically &quot;ITS SO FAST!!!!&quot; but what does this have to do with movement? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I dont think you understand how the moon works... Its not the opposite of the sun. It can be in the sky the same time as the sun... </p>

<p>I have observations... Also considering the spike in private space companies I assume we will eventually have proof free of NASA. </p>

<p>I mean you can go watch SpaceX land a spaceship from space. Space agencies are actively encouraging private companies to develop space tech, you would think they would try their hardest to hide it all. </p>

<p>TPTB have taken that sense away from us, and have told us we have no meaning or purpose, only then do the endless wars begin. </p>

<p>This is a hard thing to face no matter who you are, we all wish our actions didnt matter and that we will never be held accountable. That is the main reason this &quot;YOLO&quot; mentality is so popular, because it&#39;s easy, and with that you can do anything you want with no worry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If TPTB reveal earth is flat then it proves G-d exists. I already know and believe G-d exists, but for some others they question it, and for the rest they blindly accept everything the gov&#39;t/MSM/and other proven liars say. </p>

<p>The Flat Earth simply explains and proves what G-d has given his apostles and chosen ones to transcribe what he has spoken. Globe earth keeps people questioning G-d and they force globe earth down our throats to further their agenda of one world religion (heliocentric &quot;universe&quot; evolution, money, vanity, etc) if we find out the earth is actually flat then we will question EVERYTHING else we have been told. Our scales are being pulled from our eyes everyday and we are slowly waking up. </p>

<p>Look up project Northwoods, operation highjump and admiral Byrd and his journeys to Antarctica, and into how we can only go through ONE company to visit Antarctica (even though they have 60+ different sites and other shell companies to go through, it&#39;s still only one parent/primary company), also how 80+ countries have signed a treaty to not allow anyone to go to Antarctica other than the few spots they are allowed to on government expeditions and if people do attempt it then those countries dispatch coast guard/military to intervene and stop your progress any further, look into the Bible discussing flat earth and how it is shown in certain passages, there&#39;s a few to get you started. </p>

<p>Basically it just comes down to them hiding G-d from us and keeping us from knowing we have an ultimate creator that controls everything (we have free will but he has our lives planned out already and can take different paths to get to the same finish line) and created the universe. We are the center of the universe and aliens are just demons manifesting in these abductions/possessions. Project blue beam fits here with the govt falsifying that aliens are from a distant and more intelligent universe. If you research any alien abduction then you will see that if you call out the name of Jesus Christ or G-d almighty then the abduction ends and you wake up from your &quot;possession/abduction&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;m bracing for the downvotes from this but I am simply speaking my heart and what the good lord has spoken to me. 1.5 years ago after praying and praying for an open heart and opening of my 3rd eye, I began to slowly see things from a perspective that I never have before and the scales began to fall from my eyes after every new revelation/discovery without unquestionable doubt. Eventually it brought me to FE and I was so against it and laughed at it anytime someone discussed it here or other sites. I watched a few videos and did some cross referencing and research and I am now a believer. All I ask is do your research and you will be a FE&#39;r as well please keep an open mind and watch different lectures/videos and start in some areas that you have always wondered about and you will go down a rabbit hole that ends with NASA has faked their flights and missions to &quot;moon and outer space&quot;.</p>

<p>I think the opposite. If we live on a FE earth with firmament enclosing us its proof god is finite. </p>

<p>Why would god lock us in a terrarium that perfectly simulates an infinite universe instead of, you know giving us an infinite universe?</p>

<p>If its beyond his ability then he isnt God. </p>

<p>I think they&#39;ve been going on for hundreds of years. If the flat earth theory is true, we are all literally surrounded by a prison wall. The civilization beyond probably uses our resources, and probably our people for slaves and god know what else (kidnapped or raised as slaves). If it is ever exposed, I assume the economy could crash because there wouldn&#39;t be scarcity anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lucifer is real.  That&#39;s why the elite worship him with blood ritual (Spirit Cooking) and all Hollywood and Singers talk about selling their souls.  The word Sorcery in greek ties to the word pharmakeia which ties to things like LSD, Mushroom, DMT etc.  These things are &quot;Sorcery&quot; in the Bible.  When you take these things it opens you up to be influenced by devils (demons).  This is why guys like Steve Jobs were big on these drugs as they provide &quot;revelations&quot; and breakthroughs in technology and philosophy all which progress Lucifer&#39;s agenda of a one world technocracy which his son (the Antichrist) will someday destroy and be everyone&#39;s hero.  </p>

<p>The human vessel doesn&#39;t have any idea what is influencing them unless they are into the Occult and are aware of these things.  The idea of atoms, quantum theory, big bang, and evolution can all be tired back to pagan mysticism that came from Babylon.  Atomism, Kabbalah, Alchemy, etc are all hidden under the veil of &quot;science&quot; today.</p>

<p>Issac Newton was heavily into the Occult.  His inspiration was from these demonic entities.  The same goes for all of the &quot;science saints&quot; of history.  Their ideas are not their own but come from a spiritual place and in that place Lucifer runs the show.</p>

<p>Lucifer has created the greatest deception in history by hiding the true nature of our existence.  That is a flat, enclosed cosmology where the sun, stars, and moon shine down on us through a lens like molten glass.  This is why rainbows, sundogs look the way they do.  This is why the upper rainbow in a double rainbow invert their colors.  It&#39;s reflecting off the dome and perspective makes everything look to be the same distance away once you get past your vanishing point (horizon).  This is why you can use a magnifying glass and focus moonlight and it will cool things (seriously test this yourself).  The Moon gives off it&#39;s own cooling light.  NASA never went tot he moon and the ISS is a puppet show with wires, harnesses, and Augmented reality.</p>

<p>So the answer to your question is, Lucifer is hiding the nature of your reality because if you knew you were on a flat, enclosed earth you would start to seek God.  If you seek him you will find him.  It&#39;s that simple.  Anyone who doesn&#39;t find God goes to the same place Lucifer is going in the end.  He want to take as many eternal souls to the lake of fire with him.</p>

<p>Rev 12:9  And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. </p>
