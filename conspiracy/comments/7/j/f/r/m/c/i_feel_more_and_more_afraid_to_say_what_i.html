        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It just seems like anytime you say anything, you just get attacked. I feel like the internet is just full of &quot;attack dogs&quot;, waiting to make you feel like an idiot for having the gall to voice an opinion. It seems only those with a tolerance for endless attacks are left to comment, which just selects for those type of people, reinforcing the pool in a positive feedback loop until anyone left is either an attack dog who is cool with attacking everything and getting attacked constantly, or people naive enough not to realize this. </p>

<p>If this is what we let the internet become, we lose. All rationality dies, not just on this medium, but in the culture at large, because the culture is under the impression that the medium represents the culture. Just like with TV for the previous generation. </p>

<p>We&#39;re losing faith in each other, and for good reason. We look like idiots. The internet looks HORRIBLE. It is full of hatred, emotional blindness, disinformation, confused people, the overconfident. What you know matters less and less, and how loudly and emotionally you can shout it matters more and more. The conversation, even the medium itself, seems to favor the loudmouthed idiot. But due to the difficulty of connecting to the internet, there was a disproportionate amount of smart people, so it was balanced out, all through the 1980s and 90s, and early 00s. </p>

<p>But now... everyone has access. The idiot can spew his garbage with just as much visibility as the wise man&#39;s careful writings, as always, but the idiots were now in larger numbers. </p>

<p>Then the propaganda came. Companies and governments started realizing the usefulness of the internet as a propaganda tool. And it is easier to make dumb propaganda than smart propaganda.</p>

<p>So in the places where people were talking about stuff the companies and governments don&#39;t want talked about, they just send in a thousand loudmouthed idiots, some of whom may not even realize what they&#39;re doing or who they&#39;re working for. They just want to say stuff loudly, and appear correct (even if incorrect in reality), and be on a team who backs up this worldview. A community with a mutual lack of humility. For many, that is enough because they&#39;re not well-liked in the real world because of these same beliefs. </p>

<p>So both of the hired and unhired variety, there are people poisoning the very arenas of discussion that many of us have held so sacred for the last few decades. It really hurts. I feel like I&#39;m watching my child die. This is my community, this is our community. But some people, mostly who do not realize the full extent of their extremely vocal negativity, have brought down the main tentpoles holding up the internet as an &quot;information superhighway&quot;.</p>

<p>Information has been supplanted by data. The difference is this: Information is data that gives knowledge. Information is always data, but data is not always information. More and more we see useless data. We can also call it &quot;noise&quot; in the electrical engineering sense. Our signal to noise ratio is completely fucked now, because there are so many people making noise compared to before. It&#39;s not that humanity has gotten dumber, it&#39;s just that the dumb have a louder voice, and there are many powerful and moneyed interests who are utilizing the loudmouthed dumb for propagandistic purposes, both to poison the discussion with nonsense, but also to push certain narratives (which is harder to hire for). </p>

<p>The end result is that all the <em>reasonable</em> people in this world that use the internet get on and see that it&#39;s a madhouse. Then they have 2 reactions: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Fuck this noise, I&#39;m out of here. I have better things to do. </p></li>
<li><p>Man people are fucked up and stupid. I can&#39;t trust people. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The first reaction only strengthens the concentration of noise and weakens the signal. YOU, you rational person aspiring to have deep thoughts, you are the signal. Bertrand Russel said that &quot;The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are so full of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts.&quot; For a while, the internet protected us from this. But now, there are so many aggressive loud-mouthed idiots, it&#39;s just overwhelming. Both naturally, and pushed forward due to moneyed interests and useful fools. Plus the anonymous consequence-free nature of the internet shields people from any real consequences of making poor communication. </p>

<p>The internet is crabs in a pot, the idiots dragging us all down. And anyone who dares to call another person out without perfect emotional tact becomes a target of ridicule. </p>

<p>The internet is like you&#39;d better have everything perfect, or you can go fuck yourself in the worst way possible. And &quot;perfect&quot; is meaning less and less to be well-researched and reasoned, and more becoming what best pushes forward the narrative of some pre-established echo chamber. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just frustrating as fuck. And it&#39;s exhausting. The internet used to be an exciting place to learn new things and connect with people, with the occasional asshole. Now it&#39;s like an uphill battle against a crushing current of asinine tomfoolery and misinformation. </p>

<p>Look at how popular the depression memes are. On some level, it shows the deep malaise of the culture that isn&#39;t being addressed, and these memes speak to that. On the otherhand, you can be having a good day and then come across 20 of these memes and feel like a total piece of shit afterward. At what point does it stop speaking to something that needs said and instead is programming people to behave a certain way? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if we can go back. I think it&#39;s just over now. We can try, and I&#39;m trying, with our new website at antiextremes.com. I&#39;m not giving up to try and find and create good pockets of the internet where reasonable people can discuss complex things in a subtle manner. I hope the internet culture can shift away from what speaks to the lowest common denominator, and instead strive to pull our minds upward to thoughts we&#39;ve never thought before, instead of just endless backpatting about the things we already know. </p>

<p>So what is different then between 4chan and reddit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find way better quality discussions on 8chan more than reddit for reasons stated above. You have to actually focus on the argument and there isn&#39;t as many ways to deflect or change the topic. Investigation threads are a common thing on chan image boards, while on reddit you have to tip toe or the subreddit gets &quot;banned&quot; or mods get punished for &quot;doxxing&quot; when the information is in the public realm for fucks sake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. It gets to the point where you leave an internet discussion feeling like you just left a battle rather than leaving with any kind of positive feeling a calm, rational exchange brings. I think they want it that way. There are a few corners of the internet, and even this site, where that still exists though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! So many conversations feel like battles. I miss learning things together, and arriving at a mutual understanding.</p>

<p>People are just addicted to the short emotional knee-jerk response, and the culture of the internet in the last few years has been encouraging that type of thinking more and more. </p>

<p>There will always be little pockets where people who want serious deep discussion can go to, but those pockets will always grow and then be infiltrated and destroyed. It&#39;s the lifecycle of most social websites, we saw it with digg and we&#39;re seeing it with reddit, and whatever&#39;s next will probably go through that same cycle. </p>

<p>I think the solution might be in embracing the cycle and building around it, but that&#39;s just a total guess. The idiots need a place to go, but it&#39;s only fun if you&#39;re wrecking something that&#39;s been carefully built up, I suppose. Creating the most entropy. I just don&#39;t get how people can enjoy it in any other way than a lashing out because their internal emotions are so wrecked they want to take it out on others. Or they just lack the ability to understand how hurtful they&#39;re being to others. Or they don&#39;t care. </p>

<p>Some of that can be excused by people being teenagers or younger and just being jerks without fully realizing how they&#39;re hurting others. There&#39;s so many young people on the internet compared to 20 years ago, so there&#39;s a lot of immature people &quot;cutting their teeth&quot; in a social/conversational sense on places like reddit. But I don&#39;t think those people are the real problem, they just help create the echo-chamber as they&#39;re played by others who have created these emotional groups that they can then drive around emotionally to accomplish political, corporate, and social propaganda goals. This part, to me, is what is truly frightening. It&#39;s hard to tell exactly how widespread it is, but it&#39;s definitely not an insignificant influence on the behavior we see widespread on the internet. </p>

<p>You can see by their frantic attempts at &quot;monitoring&quot; <em>as much</em> online activity as they can (NSA et al) and the other attempts they&#39;ve made at &#39;regaining kontrol&#39; of this &#39;information free for all&#39;!</p>

<p>Alas, they failed which has caused the &#39;red pilling&#39; of many and this &#39;knowledge&#39; <em>will spread</em> as it&#39;s The Truth ... and that which is True, <em>cannot</em> &#39;change&#39;.</p>

<p>I really hope the shitty state of mind of so many people in western societies is the &#39;darkness before dawn&#39; of an &#39;awakening&#39; of the collective consciousness</p>

<p>and it only <em>needs</em> for about 85,000 peeps to &quot;agree on a thought&#39; for it to become reality for All 7 billion! (the square root of the population is sufficient to affect ALL the rest)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And it is spreading out into real world exchanges. Think of these younger people cutting their teeth here on the internet, thinking it is perfectly ok to treat people this way IRL. Manners have gone by the wayside, giving way to snarky remarks and outright temper tantrums. I see it all the time, and it’s not ok. Being a decent human being only applies to those that agree with you, everyone else gets the  brunt of your frustrations. I fear for our society, I really do. </p>

<p>Exactly. Our culture is kind of self-destructing as internet culture becomes IRL culture. People treat real life with as little respect as the internet, and everyone suffers for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Online humor geared towards kids/teens is so negative now. Watching YouTube videos marketed towards them is almost depressing to me. It&#39;s either very self deprecating or mean spirited towards others. </p>

<p>I am grateful I did not go through junior high and high school with social media. Every kid goes through some shit at school at some point, but I can&#39;t imagine having a bad day at school then coming home and instead of it being over and feeling relief, you get text messaged and blasted on tweets and FB posts all night.</p>

<p>These kids go through this shit and most of their parents are disconnected from them. It&#39;s a bad combination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really has become so mean spirited and widespread. Just last month 2 teenagers I know of killed them selves. One because her boyfriend broke up with her and everyone was talking about on Facebook. She couldn’t take the rejection, hung her self. The other was a 15 boy, not sure what pushed him over the edge, but he made sure to livestream( for dramatics) blowing his brains out. These were normal fucking kids. Not like, oh we saw that coming cause the kid was troubled. Normal fucking kids. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t even have to be paid. Lots of people nowadays have been programmed to think that:<br/>
A: their own beliefs and ideas are true and the right beliefs.<br/>
B: that an attack on their beliefs is an attack on their person.<br/>
C: that you&#39;re weak if you admit to being wrong.<br/>
None of these are true. No one&#39;s ideas and beliefs are absolutely true, nor are they always the best in every situation. It&#39;s important to often challenge your own beliefs to test their grounding in reality and to improve upon them. It&#39;s also important to be able to entertain and consider the ideas of others while putting your own beliefs aside. Try on a new perspective. You&#39;re likely to learn something. And lastly, it&#39;s not shameful and you&#39;re not weak if you admit to being wrong. It takes strength to break apart of your egoic attachment to false/incorrect/incomplete ideas. Only when you realise your mistakes in life can you make a conscious improvement on them. If you&#39;re never wrong, or never think you&#39;re wrong, then what&#39;s the point to it all? Self worship? Nah. I prefer self improvement. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not rude to people and I don&#39;t hurl insults because I hate them so much. Its definitely bothersome because of the insult itself but also very irritating that rude people&#39;s reaction tend to be knee-jerk and based on one interaction or comment, and a total over reaction.

    <div class="md"><p>To post a different perspective, which is sort of bittersweet but in my opinion more on the sweet side.... the internet did it&#39;s job and the damage has been done(in a good sense.) Like a bag of tea that slowly loses its potency but transforms the content in which it is contained, the internet acted as the medium in which information once only available to a select few, became openly available to the masses. This was the printing press on steroids, the true lifting of the veil. Knowledge is power and even if the internet disappeared today, there would still be thousands, possibly millions of people who have had their hearts and minds opened by what it has so generously provided. The sleeping Giant has been awakened and s/he is not going to back to sleep. So, OP,  even if the Internet entropies into a shell of its old self, it was not all for naught! All great things eventually become corrupted and fade out but the illumination that it provided, as always, will spark the next invention or discovery that will march humanity one step closer towards its promised land. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dan Carlin&#39;s Hardcore History &quot;Prophets of Doom&quot; mirrors, to an extent,  this dilemma. I believe it is currently a premium episode, but well worth a listen. It&#39;s about how Martin Luther, after translating the bible into German and making it understandable to the common people, unlocked a door in which treacherous (or maybe just manipulative and not too bright) people walked through and took advantage of the so called newly &quot;educated.&quot; And how they allowed it to happen. Reading your post instantly brought that episode back for me, and it&#39;s been a few years since I heard it. </p>

<p>I think we have arrived at  a big wash-out in the road, with lots of dangerous water to either tread through or build a bridge over. History suggests we can be a bright, persistent, and industrious species. You are doing a huge amount of work to do your part, please don&#39;t lose hope.

    <div class="md"><p>I will keep trying. It just feels so lonely sometimes. It gives me heart to see others care, and try themselves to get the word out about things they think are genuinely important. People who keep their eye on the ball, and actually express their ideas instead of just stew on them for a lifetime and then die having never expressed them.... It brings a tear to my eye almost, to think of all the genius that went unexpressed because of fear. </p>

<p>Wisdom and understanding doesn&#39;t mean much if it dies with the person who has it. It has to be passed on and communicated and preserved. And that means some smart people are going to have to say what they feel, and that is scary. But sometimes it will trigger deep validation, like the number of points and comments this post got... </p>

<p>Sometimes if you craft a paragraph or two in a certain way, it can leave an impact on a lot of people. The thoughts and effects can ripple outwards in ways that I might never even notice or be able to witness, and that&#39;s something I just have to trust in, because it just logically is true because I have seen the words of others act similarly through myself. Communication is valuable, especially if it is honest, accurate, and concise. That will never cease to be true, as long as information matters. Even in this &quot;information fog of war&quot; that we are currently engulfed in on the modern internet.</p>

<p>We simply have to say the things we think are worth saying. Over and over, and help others do it too. If we could honestly cast off the frivolous, that would leave so much room for real conversation and real emotion. People just need to take this task seriously, but I don&#39;t know that that will happen until they personally see <em>why</em> that is a valuable task to undertake. </p>

<p>Basically I think the bulk of the internet will have to get <em>genuinely tired</em> of seeking &quot;the lulz&quot; and begin seeking more substantial and meaningful content. Then the culture will change on the internet, and then the culture in the real world will follow. I could see that happening someday, to some extent.</p>

<p>The average age of a person on the internet is probably as low as it will ever be, right now. There&#39;s few old people online, but in 40 years that won&#39;t be true. So it makes sense that the culture will &quot;grow up&quot; as the internet user population ages. This gives me a bit of hope in the long-term, but that&#39;s just one factor among many that influences the quality of internet culture. </p>

If we graduate high school, go to or graduate college, get a job, and watch the news, we are educated and informed. Comparatively to three generations prior, that is a huge amount of progress. Look at us, we&#39;re doing great!  What we have lost though is the ability to process information through a meaningful filter.  The information supplied caters to how we feel, purposely,  and reinforces a weak perception of self: i.e. nice car, new phone, cool shoes.  But, because people have their sense of self so closely tied into the process, they perceive a self that doesn&#39;t exist, but has been supplied to them and reinforced.  It takes a wrecking ball to break this down, not only do we not want to be wrong but to change as well?  “You mean, I have to look at many sources, and decipher for myself, and after all that I may still be wrong? Then what happens, when I&#39;m wrong? I will look stupid, and no one will like me. No thank you, TLDR, take a selfie, laugh at cat memes. I&#39;m cutting edge, I liked it first, that&#39;s enough for me.”</p>

<p>We&#39;ve all been fed a junk diet of info and we crave something better, but the supermarket is big, and potato chips taste good. And there are so many choices, we don&#39;t know what to eat. But I think you are on to something: Many of us are getting tired of it. This may be the best opportunity to get a deeper, meaningful message out there. (Personally, I heard you, and I feel you opened my eyes to the truth a bit wider, and thanks!)  But you are going to get way more negative responses than positive ones. Someone told me that it takes three positive responses to negate one negative one. That may be psychological bullshit or not, but sounds logical. So you go to bed bloody and bruised. I bet, though, you will sleep well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would also like to add that <strong>Twitter</strong>, on the <strong>18th of December 2017</strong>, will start tracking you on and <strong>off site</strong>. Anything you say that they &quot;find&quot; to be harmful — they only list &quot;violent&quot; — can result into your Twitter account being banned from their site.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure uBlock or any other ad-blocking extension will be able to prevent this. But still, you shouldn&#39;t be afraid of saying whatever you want wherever you are, Twitter or not, in fear of having your account suspended/banned. Obviously there&#39;s no way humans will be able to do this task, so AI will be doing it. Take a look at YouTube&#39;s algorithms with the advertising and demonetisation issues.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Violence and physical harm</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Violence</em>: You may not make specific threats of violence or wish for the serious physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people. This includes, but is not limited to, threatening or promoting terrorism. You also may not affiliate with organizations that — whether by their own statements or activity both on and off the platform — use or promote violence against civilians to further their causes. We will begin enforcing this rule around affiliation with such organizations on December 18, 2017.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Abuse and hateful conduct</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Hateful imagery and display names</em>: You may not use hateful images or symbols in your profile image or profile header. You also may not use your username, display name, or profile bio to engage in abusive behavior, such as targeted harassment or expressing hate towards a person, group, or protected category. We will begin enforcing this rule on December 18, 2017.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>bro, I wish you weren&#39;t but you are correct in your pov, the &#39;signal to noise&#39; ratio has gone way out from what it was 10yrs back</p>

<p>IMO things like FB gave people the place to use their &#39;internet training wheels&#39; to move around and become familiar with posting their &#39;opinions&#39; Loudly ... and now they do so like dogs pissing to mark their territory&#39;</p>

<p>Yes, and what it&#39;s showing, as you&#39;ve suggested, is the sad sad representation of the average person&#39;s state of mind these days</p>

<p>The &#39;average person&#39; <em>hasn&#39;t really</em> got a clue about &#39;why&#39; they do what they do, they&#39;re simply &#39;following the mob&#39; and they&#39;ll run off a cliff IF that&#39;&#39;s what the mob does.</p>

<p>In my youth, rationalizing one&#39;s behavior by saying &quot;I did it <em>becoz they were all</em> doing it&quot; ... would get a reply like &quot;and I guess if they were all (insert stupid behavior of choice i.e. jumping off a cliff) you&#39;d do that too?&quot;</p>

<p>Nowadays the MSM is <em>constantly</em> supporting people&#39;s FOMO with shit like  &quot;don&#39;t miss out on being part of the <em>latest show everyone&#39;s talking about</em>, watch it now on your icrowd789&quot; blah blah</p>

<p>Hey  bro, why did you stop moderating on this sub? IMHO you are one of the best minds here!  At least I think so</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate seeing your posts across the handful of subs we both visit. You&#39;re one of the greenest cats in my RES and I admire how much effort you put into screaming into the iVoid. It is discouraging though. I&#39;ve found myself posting less(or less seriously) over the past few years because the conversation is increasingly subverted. </p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s a good thing in a way. If the shiternet eventually becomes useless as a communication tool, maybe we&#39;ll be inspired to do more IRL. But that also means it will probably get (even more) locked down by the telecoms and content-hosting sites. </p>

<p>When tablets/smartphones came up and the younger brothers/sisters of millenials log in and literally can&#39;t fathom an internet without facebook and youtube providing everything for them, I don&#39;t see a way to win. Maybe meshnets and some kind of cryptohippie movement, I dunno. Whenever the internet switched from being an open platform into a collection of &quot;channels&quot;, with slick UIs requiring(or allowing) barely any original activity from the user, is when it was lost. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just wanted to share a recent experience I had...</p>

<p>I went to some random website after having clicked on a headline somewhere. I think the article was about maybe health care or some other hot button political issue. I started to notice these pretty abrasive comments from the same user replying a lot. I mean A LOT. Like 30 times in the first 30 minutes the article was up. </p>

<p>That was weird, I thought. So I clicked on the user and found that this guy has been doing this on tons of articles on the site. Definitely over 10 before I stopped counting. </p>

<p>I mean wtf? Why Is this guy so against Obamacare or just so into “winning” imaginary internet arguments? Is he getting paid? Is he just “on the spectrum”? Who has the time for that?</p>

<p>I don’t think he was a bit either because here and there there were some reasonable or moderate comments sprinkled in that just didn’t seem so nuts. And there where a few articles where he only posted once or twice. </p>

<p>Just crazy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post, just chiming in to agree with you. I&#39;m older than the internet, and have bounced from space to space seeking intellectual connection and both value- and interest- based community. It&#39;s been hit-or-miss over the years. These communities rise and fall as platforms are introduced. I think you&#39;re right about the median intelligence creeping down as more of the population gains access. Hadn&#39;t thought of it that way, but yeah.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also more and more afraid to speak out. Well, maybe not afraid so much as just wearied. I feel so beaten down, sometimes by direct hostility, sometimes just by inadvertent stupidity. And lately, by the propaganda. Plus, it takes energy to self-reflect, to look at things from various angles, to try to avoid being a useful idiot.</p>

<p>Reddit had its heyday, it&#39;s on the decline. Most of us have been there, done that, seen the show, bought the t-shirt. Digg has been mentioned. When facebook first started up, it killed yahoo groups. I was involved with some amazing communities on yahoo, and they just went away - poof - almost overnight. Tried to find and/or replicate them over on facebook, but the platforms were structurally just different enough that the quality of conversation suffered (I say suffered, but more like devolved into the foolish my-team-vs-your-team shouting matches that we see today). As social media evolves, the programs seem to allow for less and less nuance. You nailed it with your distinction between info and data. The programs are designed to mine data, not info, so that&#39;s what people are encouraged to share. This distillation is not conducive to creating and sharing quality content. If your info or opinion can&#39;t be quantified, it isn&#39;t valuable.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, though, I still feel lucky to be the exact age I am, to be able to watch humanity transition through this analog-to-digital age. It&#39;s endlessly fascinating to watch the social dynamics of voluntary connectivity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I blame the phones. Phones were the technology that allowed <em>everyone</em> access. It&#39;s only gotten uglier and uglier since then.</p>

<p>For awhile I wasn&#39;t sure if it was facebook or phones that killed the internet. I would put the beginning of the decline at 2007. Phones and fb both became popular that year. I actually think fb was a great tool at first but got distorted when tptb decided to propagandize/data mine it. 2016 and the election put the nail in the coffin of civility, not just online but in meatworld too.</p>

<p>So to answer your question, no I see a gradual change (2007-2017) punctuated by periods of catastrophic degradation (2016), somewhat analogous to geologic change. Weathering and erosion occasionally interrupted by an earthquake, if you will. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree</p>

<p>Glad you made the post.  You said what i wanted to say but so much better. 
Countless times I&#39;ve began writing posts only to delete them as I don&#39;t want the negativity in my life. </p>

<p>There are a few encounters I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve been talking to a bot. They reply quickly and use unusual formulas for arguing.</p>

<p>Then there are the deliberately obtuse people that just make having a conversation very difficult. </p>

<p>Remaining sane and polite in the comments section is a daily challenge </p>

<p>I had a lovely encounter the other day though so all is not lost. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the Internet was never meant to help people be better educated and learn the Truth and raise the level of the debate globally. Just like the TV that was pushed into every single household in the world was not meant to help people not be bored at home. It was meant to be a tool to help people consume more. The Internet is pushed into every household for the same reason, plus to control the population. </p>

<p>The Internet and the TV don&#39;t come with a manual unfortunately and people misuse these tools. People sit their fat ass all day on the couch in front of the TV, eating chips and drinking soda. And people use the Internet to write shit, to use facebook, and tinder and basically waste their time on useless shit. I don&#39;t know if any kind of education on these tools would help much. The small part of the population that is smart and self disciplined enough will know how to use all these new technologies, which is to acquire knowledge mostly.</p>

<p>Also, be aware that just like with the TV which mostly misinform you, there are large businesses involved on the Internet with their own agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also think the internet is in a battle mode right now. Me personally, i don&#39;t really have a big problem with it, since i learned how to deal with it. I know its hard to stop caring. But just stop. Its really refreshing. Same goes for facebook or twitter or reddit. stop caring. I contribute where i can. If a discussion arises from my posts, i test the waters and see if its worth another reply. If someones tries to correct your grammar but ignores the argument, move on. I see this happen so much. While alot of you also know this is the most populair tactic to derail a thread. Rise above it and just ignore. even though its frustrating as fuck. </p>

<p>A worthwhile conversation/discussion is really awesome to have and feels really good when it happens.
To me this, outshines the negative discussion i see happening on here. I try to just keep the positivity going. I think eventually thats what makes a winner. </p>

<p>Edit; i posted this in a thread some weeks ago... I think this could also apply here; </p>

<p>Its been really refreshing not trying to convince anybody about any of these conspiracies. Share the info you got. Thats it. When people want to discredit or derail, just try to ignore (i know its hard). The seeds of these thoughts are planted. Me personally ? I started out trying to debunk all this shit. It really fucked me up for awhile, and i soon realized why. I tried convincing others about the things i found out. My points is basicly, don&#39;t focus all your energy on just trying to convince people. If they find the answers themselfs its worth like +9000</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! So many conversations feel like battles. I miss learning things together, and arriving at a mutual understanding.</p>

<p>People are just addicted to the short emotional knee-jerk response, and the culture of the internet in the last few years has been encouraging that type of thinking more and more. </p>

<p>There will always be little pockets where people who want serious deep discussion can go to, but those pockets will always grow and then be infiltrated and destroyed. It&#39;s the lifecycle of most social websites, we saw it with digg and we&#39;re seeing it with reddit, and whatever&#39;s next will probably go through that same cycle. </p>

<p>I think the solution might be in embracing the cycle and building around it, but that&#39;s just a total guess. The idiots need a place to go, but it&#39;s only fun if you&#39;re wrecking something that&#39;s been carefully built up, I suppose. Creating the most entropy. I just don&#39;t get how people can enjoy it in any other way than a lashing out because their internal emotions are so wrecked they want to take it out on others. Or they just lack the ability to understand how hurtful they&#39;re being to others. Or they don&#39;t care. </p>

<p>Some of that can be excused by people being teenagers or younger and just being jerks without fully realizing how they&#39;re hurting others. There&#39;s so many young people on the internet compared to 20 years ago, so there&#39;s a lot of immature people &quot;cutting their teeth&quot; in a social/conversational sense on places like reddit. But I don&#39;t think those people are the real problem, they just help create the echo-chamber as they&#39;re played by others who have created these emotional groups that they can then drive around emotionally to accomplish political, corporate, and social propaganda goals. This part, to me, is what is truly frightening. It&#39;s hard to tell exactly how widespread it is, but it&#39;s definitely not an insignificant influence on the behavior we see widespread on the internet. </p>
