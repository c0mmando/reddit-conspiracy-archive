       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       For the initiated, the film stars Fred Savage as a young boy who discovers that monsters are real. They are former. Children who live in another dimension, the doors to which are located under beds. Maurice (Howie Mandel) is a monster who Brian befriends. He starts visiting the monster world and causing mischief with them until he gets scared when he begins to change into one. He then finds out that he's being groomed to be handed off to the monsters' evil dictator, Boy.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        THEMES AND IMAGERY:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Strange man-child (Maurice) stealing a young boy away to a world where "no one tells you what you can't do." Parents mustn't be told.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stolen child is from a broken (breaking) home and is looking for a friend when he is taken advantage of.
      </p>
      <p>
       The boy is taken under the pretense of friendship, but is eventually meant to be given to another, even stranger man-child (Boy). Boy, by the way, wears a schoolboy outfit with knee-high socks. He also wears a young face to hide a literal monster underneath.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even assuming Maurice and the other Little Monsters are children, they are rounding up other innocent children to be used and abused by the only two adults in their world, Snick and Boy.
Brian only sees how awful their world is when they try to abuse a baby right in its crib, and refuse to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Boy kidnaps Brian's little brother Eric and keeps him obviously drugged and in a box. When Brian refuses to submit, he tosses him into a box as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The villains can only be defeated by "shining a light" on them and their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        SUGGESTIVE DIALOGUE FROM AN ADULT IN A CHILDREN'S FILM (SOMETIMES TO CHILD CHARACTERS):
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       MAURICE: Man's best friend, his right hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       SNICK: You're scared of me, aren't you Arnold? I like that. Oooh, I love that.
       <em>
        deep heavy breathing
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       MAURICE: Dead kids have limited potential, and I don't think Boy would like damaged goods.
      </p>
      <p>
       SNICK: We almost had him Maurice. And you let him get away. Boy sometimes gets lonely. He wanted to play with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       MAURICE: Why doesn't Boy just play with himself?
      </p>
      <p>
       SNICK: You bring a kid in here, and tell him our secrets! If you can't get him, I will!
      </p>
      <p>
       MAURICE: Where there's a bed there's a way.
      </p>
      <p>
       MAURICE: Got em, got em, need em!
       <em>
        cups dick and balls
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       MAURICE: You gotta get up there, cuz you're gonna get married pretty soon. to an 11-year old boy
      </p>
      <p>
       BOY: I'll let them all go, if you'll stay... and be my paaaal.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        BOMBSHELL
       </strong>
       Read this fucking exchange between Snick and a small child (recently turned monster):
      </p>
      <p>
       SNICK: Boy gets what he wants. He asks you for a favour, you should take it as a compliment.
      </p>
      <p>
       ARNOLD: I tried Snick! I tried!
      </p>
      <p>
       SNICK: Well, you didn't try hard enough!
      </p>
      <p>
       ARNOLD: My knees, they hurt!
      </p>
      <p>
       SNICK: Oh your knees hurt? Well that's not the only thing that's gonna hurt.

       This analysis is spot on and I think you've hit the nail on the head we already know they hide truth in fiction

       I watched this movie a lot when I was a kid. Never noticed any of this when I was small. From memory, the most unsettling thing to my child mind was watching them empty a bottle of Apple juice, refill it with urine, and get the school bully to drink it.

       Not saying you are wrong as you did a great job presenting what you found but do remember that this movie is from a while ago and cultural trends have changed. So some things that seem odd or inappropriate now might have been more ‘normal’ back then.

       That wasn't that long ago. Mores regarding predatory nature towards children haven't changed that much since then, fictional or otherwise. From my point of view, only the awareness of those who promulgate this type of media has

       Home Alone wouldn't be made now, I doubt Goonies. A lot of children/family films from that era simply wouldn't be made due to controversy relating from health and safety or PC culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Little Monsters feels distinctly innapropriate today, however it was always a 'naughty' film. It taught me at a very young age the term "over the shoulder boulder holder".
      </p>
      <p>
       Watching it today feels like the creators were extremely misguided in what was appropriate for kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       It feels very self indulgent and I wouldn't be surprised if the creators found the suggestive immagery funny, rather than it being a specific warning.

       Not that it should have been but that it could have been more normal when combined with the context of that time. So, for instance, if you go back and look at older comic books, the verbiage they use is hilarious now (I wish I could find an example to show).

       We watched this movie followed by Monster Squad. I can see what you mean by verbiage being different for PG-13 back in those days, but the theme of grooming, separation from family and kidnapping/drugging are hard to write off as just

       Yeah I was just thinking that. Yeah it's weird and fucked up but if you were to make a movie based on something horrible that children often experience , how else would you make it in a way children can understand.? The theme is basically wolves in sheep clothing befriend children and hurt and abuse them but the moral like you said is they can be exposed and the abuse will stop, don't trust anyone essentially. Would it be better to not make a movie about such a topic therefore never giving children the idea that they can escape evil men?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what the answer is but it's something to talk about. As a kid I really enjoyed this movie, thought it was weird and kind of scary. I don't recall understanding the complex theme but who knows maybe it's movies like this that make me skeptical about trusting others.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        With all this uncovered horribleness about pedophilia in Hollywood, I wondered if this movie isn't some sort of allegory for it. A seducing "no parents, no rules" character sent to groom new inductees into their secret world. And then I googled Boy Meets World star, Ben Savage, the bring pictured being groped at a producer's house. Isn't that exactly what happens in the movie with the kidnapping and drugging?

       This is nothing new, Hollywood producers love dropping pedo hints in their films. Just take a look at 'Lost Boys'.
 Roots go way back to the Peter Pan story, the author of which was a suspected pedo (not proven though, due to lack of evidence).
I'm pretty damn sure Corey Haim was abused by Joel Schumacher on the set of Lost Boys.
