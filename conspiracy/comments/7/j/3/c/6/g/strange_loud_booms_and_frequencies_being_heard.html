        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Today at approximately 4:46 AM PST in Salem, Oregon there was a sound that I heard that was nothing like I&#39;ve heard before in my life. </p>

<p>A very loud trumpet like sound was resonating all across the sky for about 30 seconds, only to randomly stop for about a minute and a half, and then continued for another 30 seconds and then completely vanished.</p>

<p>Earlier this morning I saw this video getting shared on social media </p>

<p><a href="http://m.worldstarhiphop.com/apple/video.php?v=wshhdLU8gT0AI9GWZOT8">http://m.worldstarhiphop.com/apple/video.php?v=wshhdLU8gT0AI9GWZOT8</a></p>

<p>The sound I heard was nothing like the ones that are being reported anywhere else, but just the fact that there is this trend of strange phenomenon occurring in the sky is strange enough. Do any of you folks here at r/conspiracy have any clue or logical explanation as to what could&#39;ve caused such a sound? </p>

The sound literally sent chills down my spine, it didn&#39;t sound like anything from this world honestly. It resonated so perfectly, almost as if it had a very finely tuned perfect pitch.</p>

<p>Not only will it create a boundary for wildlife, it’s handy in so many other ways, if you suddenly wake up to rain or snow, wild temp drops, you’ve got it already going.</p>

<p>Setup heat stones the night before, if you have food, it’s quicker and easier to cook then starting from coals or reignition in the morning.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve said it&#39;s a change in the Earth that&#39;s is causing pressure build up. The sounds are that being released through small openings in the surface. Or something to that effect. </p>

<p>A opening could act as a whistle  and small openings unable to withstand the pressure could be the loud booms. </p>

While the folks in Alabama hear it all over, their state is riddled with pipes. But for Idaho, it seemed it only occurred in the perfectly named Magic Valley located in Southern Idaho. It also happens to fall right on the only significant pipeline in that state. Not saying this confirms it, but it helps this theory hold water for me.</p>

It raised in volume and lowered in pitch, and I looked up to see a huge white and grey helicopter racing through the sky.  It passed overhead in an instant, and then the sound slowly faded.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used &quot;mystery hum map&quot; and &quot;pipeline map&quot; to find the comparable data for given region. (So for U.S. it&#39;d be adding U.S. to the end of the search phrase, etc.) Not to hard to overlay the data sets if you can find comparable sized maps and line-up and match the geography. But it&#39;s really funny how much matches with pipeline density. (Or at least that which is documented publicly.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As long as you aren’t undercover I always try to do this, maybe even is underutilized by most others idk. </p>

<p>Not only will it create a boundary for wildlife, it’s handy in so many other ways, if you suddenly wake up to rain or snow, wild temp drops, you’ve got it already going.</p>

<p>Setup heat stones the night before, if you have food, it’s quicker and easier to cook then starting from coals or reignition in the morning.</p>
