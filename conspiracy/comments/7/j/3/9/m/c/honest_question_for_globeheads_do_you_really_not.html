       What I see is the tip of his little finger catching the edge of the other guy's pocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see no evidence at all of a cable.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact... it is impossible that a cable could be attached where the video claims. Watch the microphone cable. That black cable would have to pass
       <em>
        through
       </em>
       the supposed harness cable when the astronaut does his flip.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL:DR; You proved nothing other than the astronaut is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       wearing a harness suspended from cables.

       His fingers have a "grasp" on nothing. His little finger caught the pocket, and thanks to the micro-gravity, that was all he needed to pull the other guy back into frame.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is abundantly clear is there is no cable suspending this guy from the ceiling. If there was, the microphone cable and even his own leg would have to pass
       <em>
        through
       </em>
       it when he does his flip.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither the microphone cable nor his leg hit any sort of invisible harness cable, so the existence of that cable is utterly disproved.

       Doing a parabolic dive on a jumbo jet to simulate weightlessness is not "zero-gravity." There is no magical place where you gan go high up enough about the earth and

       If there are uncut clips of the astronuts on the "ISS" which are longer than ten minutes, they are suspended from wires. In some clips you can see the wires making their shirts protrude, but if you fast forward the videos you also see them bouncing around, sometimes to the same "rhythm" as if they are suspended from the same mechanism. You also will notice that they never move around each other as this would tangle the wires. All they can do is their stupid little somersaults in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dangers of being aboard such a craft begin to pile up when you take a minute to brainstorm about it.   The simple issue of human hair and dust poses a huge problem that is nowhere near adequately addressed. And the women float around with their hair by shaved or covered by a cap, using copious hair spray to simulate weightlessness. It's absurd!

       They don't explain them. And anything can happen at any moment that would cause a catastrophic failure and certain death, yet these clowns act like they're chilling on a park bench the entire time. They even have a mother with young children aboard, as if that wouldn't be a huge failure of mission planning. I've asked several mothers if they would do such a mission putting their lives on a razor's edge at all times with two young children back home and they all said no without much thought.

       A subverse which is merely a compilation of various YouTube videos which are themselves compilations of official NASA ISS videos is incapable of "lying" to anyone.

       There's no doubt that ISS is a hoax. You can literally see the wire attachments protruding from their clothes. You can see how ridiculous, vague, and unscientific their interviews are. You can see how the women use hairspray and gel to make their hair stick straight up like Marge Simpson rather than freely floating as if actually weightless.
