    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be confusing sexual harassment (which is against the law) with women wanting to further their careers using sex and then using it later on to destroy who ever put them there, which is what I believe the OP is talking about.  In every state, it is illegal to do what you said.  In no state is it illegal for a woman to use sex to get further then turn around and claim sexual harassment.</p>

<p>It is consensual.</p>

<p>Women and some Men have been using Sex to get themselves a head forever.</p>

<p>Most of the women coming forward in Hollywood are NOT Victims in any way.  Most knew exactly the deal they were making and went along with it.  No one forced them to sleep with anyone...they did that willingly.</p>

<p>They made the trade of their Beauty and sexuality for their careers.  Many a woman has made a living at it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Due process is, more or less, only required when the state is attempting to deprive an individual of life, liberty, or property.</p>

<p>Citizens don&#39;t owe other citizens due process, as citizens cannot legally deprive others of life, liberty, or property. Applying this to the Franken and Moore circumstances, I feel like the outcome is reasonable. There are pictures of Franken groping a sleeping woman, and there are other accusers with believable claims. Further, Franken&#39;s actions, as proved by an image, make him a hypocrite, as he has very loudly lambasted others for similar conduct. As such, the public is upset and demanded a resignation.</p>

<p>In the Moore circumstance, the evidence, or lack there of, speaks for itself. People realize it&#39;s a coordinated attack from Podesta/WaPo/Communists, and they aren&#39;t buying it.</p>

<p>I would have agreed with you 5 years ago, but what&#39;s wrong with the system now that there is viable alternative media to offer an opposing viewpoint that can rebut attacks from MSNBC/CNN/ABC/NBC?</p>

<p>I say more or less because unions often negotiate for industrial due process, which if memorialized in an authenticated CBA, is binding. There are other circumstances where due process is required as well, but really the key consideration is life, liberty, or property.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe just one accuser right off the bat, barring additional evidence. But when the accusations pile up and its not clear why they would be lying, then I&#39;m going to figure you did it. I don&#39;t care who it is. And I&#39;m not a judge, juror, cop, or prosecutor, so due process is irrelevant. You don&#39;t use that standard to decide your beliefs. You believe Obama wasn&#39;t born here ffs.

    <div class="md"><p>Lot of people are talking about it.</p>

<p><strong>No one is listening.</strong>  The majority of those making the accusations never have to worry about being the victim of a false allegation.    The Lives of Men don&#39;t matter.  Disposable Men.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dangerous.com/36943/teen-vogue-writer-says-innocent-men-should-suffer-false-accusations/">Emily Lindon of Teen Vogue</a> is willing to pay the price of innocent men being harmed...since it is a price she will never have to pay.</p>

<p>Notice how most of the men are not that attractive being accused.  No one really regrets banging a hottie.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t wait for the pendulum to swing further and Men start outing women who have or have tried to use sex to further their careers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was no evidence of an alleged Benghazi conspiracy which precipitated the investigation.  No evidence was uncovered that proved any of the claims.  The emails had nothing to do with Benghazi.</p>

<p>A riot did break out in Cairo 2 hours before Benghazi based on that YouTube video, it was reported by the NY Times that night before Benghazi.  They did not know all the details about the attack, after all it was in Libya not NYC, until the next day where Obama said in the Rose Garden it was a terrorist attack.</p>

<p>So yes, Benghazi is completely analogous to this.  There was no evidence to support any claims of a conspiracy and it yielded 8 investigations that provided no evidence of a conspiracy.</p>

<p>THIS is thousands of women using a hashtag to try to assassinate the character of someone sometimes for consensual sexual activity that involved a boost to their careers or an alleged unwanted touch of some sort that happened over 30 years ago.  It&#39;s character assassination based on hashtags.  Iti s NOT the same thing as a terrorist attack on a United States embassy that resulted in the brutal death of a man and was handled poorly in the immediate after math.  It&#39;s not at all an appropriate analogy.  Note, I make no claim about the pizza stuff because that is technically a better analogy.</p>

<p>I live in the Tampa area. When the shooter was INITIALLY arrested, he had not confessed. Only admitted to owning the gun that matched the ballistics from crime scenes. I&#39;m not going to try to defend anyone who does this kind of thing. </p>

<p>However, the morning of his arrest, the sheriff went on TV and held a press conference. He admitted he was going on 2 hours of sleep and didn&#39;t even know what day it was. He then declared, &quot;he&#39;ll be able to sleep easier knowing THEY FINALLY GOT THE GUY&quot; </p>
