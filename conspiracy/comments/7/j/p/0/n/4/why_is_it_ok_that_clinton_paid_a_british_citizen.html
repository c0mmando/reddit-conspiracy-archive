       I'm not supporting Trump or Clinton or any party. I'm just v tired of both parties blaming each other for shit they do themselves... Its causing emotional responses not cognitive responses. Its obvious both parties are unethical and the system is a shit tornado yet they keep pointing fingers.

       Id say Assange is a spy too. One is a state sponsored force to protect the echelon and the other is a rogue actor trying to tell the poor what the rich do. I guess You like protecting the rich against the poor?

       They aren't the same at all. It has to do with HOW the information was obtained, and by who.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange got the Clinton Dirt from Russian hackers, who are likely currently affiliated with the Russian Governmemt. Thus, Trump utilized information obtained ILLEGALLY by a hostile foreign government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton got the Trump dirt from a private citizen, who obtained the information LEGALLY.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, there's evidence that Trump and Russia discussed a transactionary deal where Russia would funnel the data through Wikileaks in exchange for loosening of sanctions.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no evidence, on the other hand, that Clinton promised anything to Britain or anyone for the delivery of the data.

       Clinton

       Which is a real shame because WikiLeaks should be this amazing thing you expose corruption on all sides, but he's publicly said that he has stuff on the GOP but is choosing not to release it.

       It's been shown that the "hacked" emails were taken from the server to quickly for it to have been done over the internet, the speed involved makes it so the only possibility is someone being physically present and copying it to a thumb drive. So no, there were no Russian hackers.

       More like it was quickly downvoted by shills and democrats (sorry but there's no appreciable difference seeing as how leftists downvote truth if it doesn't fit their worldview) just like anything else that goes against the narrative. If I remember correctly the people who did the analysis were retired intelligence people, where as the only ones that say it was hacked were "all 17 intelligence agencies", which as it turns out meant 3 intelligence agencies, surprisingly of those 17, 14, including the likes of the Coast Guard or the Geospatial Intelligence Agency, declined to weigh in. The ones that did happen to be the ones most heavily politicized by the Obama administration... no matter, we're slowly but surely uncovering the evidence and in the end justice will be done.

       Slavery was once legal... Legality is a terrible standard. And, words like probably and likely don't mean a thing. Machines communicate and the flow of data is easy to trace. If it was russia, they'd of already known. Also, we see Saudi and israels role so them hacking lebanon and giving it to America would be ok in your standard then? Also, it was a Russian hacker who gave the evidence of rigging markets in The EU. So the banks sgould of been given a pass as it was Russia who alerted them. Or what about Russia alerting us to the holocaust? Should that info be not allowed in America since it was a bad state that provided it? What about the actual info and it not mattering who gave it?

       The only thing that

       matters is whether the info is provably true. Trump’s Russian connections seem to be increasingly so... Hillary’s Uranium One connections... not so.

       It was more podesta and his brother and other lobbiest. It is just really strange to see the flood of Clinton foundation Spain's and bill clinton running around Russia at that time, but it could of just been about something unrelated like adoptions.

       Seriously? Hillary's uranium one involvement is not and hasn't been a matter of debate, the only question is did she break any laws, and it looks that way. Meanwhile all the "evidence" of Trump's "collusion" keeps falling apart day by day. Are you just living in some fantasy world?

       Clinton paid an American research firm who used a source that happened to be ex-MI5/British. So I'd say it could be because the Clintons weren't actively looking for a foreign agent and Steele wasn't actively looking to insert himself into the election. He was just doing a research job for an American firm, paid for (in-part at least) by Clinton.
      </p>

       Compared to Assange who is (and I'm not saying I think this but rather this is how A is viewed) seen as wanting to personally affect the outcome of the election as an end goal.
