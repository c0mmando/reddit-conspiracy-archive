Hell the law is so goddamn obtuse they have lifelong careers to study laws and challenge them in court.

<p>Has there ever been a single person in the history of mankind that has accumulated that much knowledge about laws based on hundreds of years of precedents? </p>

<p>I dont think so, protection from the law costs time and resources, the poor have neither. Slaves with no recourse is what we all are. If i find myself in court i know ill be flipped on my back, slapped on belly and thrown into the grater like a piece of processed cheese.</p>

<p>I will say again that the law, in its basics, is easily understood by someone with a high school education.  If you don&#39;t understand &quot;basic law rules&quot; that&#39;s on you, because it&#39;s not hard to learn, and the laws are published so you <em>can</em> learn.</p>

<p>The continuity of government was activated so they could protect Congress from a plane flying into the capital. It&#39;s perfectly valid to think more planes will hit the area especially if they&#39;re your planes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted something a lot like this over at r/FringeTheory. The reason that a coup cannot look like a coup in the US is because of the Constitution.</p>

<p>Most Americans are strong supporters of the Constitution. Therefore any change of leadership/transfer of power has to &quot;follow the rules&quot; in order to be seen as legitimate.</p>

<p>So a military or intelligence coup can&#39;t look like what it is, or it would meet with huge resistance and probably fail in the long term.</p>

<p>So we got a coup, and a false narrative of Oswald as lone gunman.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Unlike other countries our people actually love and believe in our Constitution. Sure some people are offended by the first amendment and some people the second and we like to push the limits on it sometimes. </p>

<p>But most of us would not see a straight coup as legitimate. Not at this point. </p>

<p>But one thing you must remember. We were founded on basically a coup. People believe in our declaration of Independence just as much as the Constitution and that says from time to time it&#39;s necessary for man to change their government. </p>

<p>Just my interpretation here...</p>

<p>To me, this passage might be a recommendation of what &quot;The People&quot; should do in reaction to a Government that either takes power (or acts?) in an unconstitutional way.</p>

<p>This might seem ironic, but you could argue that opposing an unconstitutional government might be a Constitutional right.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m wrong, but still you made a very interesting point in your comment:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As with most documents of this kind, it&#39;s open to intepretation.</p>
