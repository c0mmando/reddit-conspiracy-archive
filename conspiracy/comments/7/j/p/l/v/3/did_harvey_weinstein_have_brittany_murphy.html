        Harvey Weinstein has former spies on his payroll
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Brittany Murphy was
       <a href="http://www.eonline.com/ca/news/751173/e-investigates-5-reasons-brittany-murphy-s-death-is-still-a-mystery">
        killed under mysterious circumstances
       </a>
       which suggested a possible crime. Her husband Simon Monjack
       <a href="http://www.eonline.com/ca/news/751173/e-investigates-5-reasons-brittany-murphy-s-death-is-still-a-mystery">
        died of the same mysterious cause five months later
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Brittany Murphy's father believes they were murdered. A
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2509626/Brittany-Murphys-father-believes-husband-poisoned-death-government-spooks.html">
        toxicology report found heavy metals and suggested the presence of rat poison
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Salma Hayek says that Weinstein told her,
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/13/opinion/contributors/salma-hayek-harvey-weinstein.html?action=click&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;amp;clickSource=collection&amp;amp;module=opinion-c-col-top-region&amp;amp;region=opinion-c-col-top-region&amp;amp;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-top-region">
        "I'll kill you. Don't think I can't"
       </a>
       . This could be an empty threat, or he could know from experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/actress-brittany-murphy-and-producer-harvey-weinstein-are-seen-inside-picture-id52952535?s=612x612">
        Weinstein creeped on Murphy
       </a>
       . Probably, she had similar experiences of
       <a href="http://theweek.com/speedreads/743240/salma-hayek-divulges-years-terrifying-abuse-by-harvey-weinstein">
        terrifying abuse
       </a>
       , like the allegations made by so many other women. Her and her husband may have been intending to do or say something about it. Or maybe one of them just pissed him off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did Murphy or her husband do or say anything to push Weinstein to order one of his Mossad agents to poison them? Is this why Weinstein was so confident threatening Salma Hayek by saying he could kill her?

       Something's fucky that's for sure. Weinstein is certainly interesting variable, with his

       If you go to the library, they have things with plumbing somehow to the phone lines and people there can help one look thing up using something called goggle. tell them you want to see if there is a video of Jennifer Lawrence talking about Harvey Weinstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck with your investigation man. you must be really smart.

       Wow, for a moment there I was worried you were going to be a prick about me asking for you to back up your claim instead of having me Google around the Internet for ages for something that might not fucking be there. Thanks for restoring my faith in humanity.

       I only made the joke because I thought you were using "Source?" as an  act of discrediting the story without making a commitment. ( and I incorrectly presumed that it was common knowledge )

       At the same time I saw that your inquiry was genuine (which I could have more easily answered than that shit I wrote...) i saw that someone else had posted the link.

       Yes &amp; no? “These included "elevated levels" of hydrocodone”.  Apparently it was pneumonia but the husband/widow stayed in the house for a year later.  I doubt it was anything conspiracy related but it was always strange.

       It’s always been a mystery. Extremely coincidental and really messy. At beta they were in a toxic relationship that involved drugs and eating disorders (hers not his). At worst it’s something very sinister and the internet is full of leads that go every which way.

       Agreed. For a long time there was a source close to her Dad posting on the IMDb message boards who gave updates on his investigations. But, since IMDb has since taken down their message boards there's no way to reference the posts(stupid move IMO... they weren't losing any money from them now I never go there).
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing was super weird. I don't know about Weinstein, but her husband was really shady. After she died her mother moved in with him in her house. I'm not sure they didn't conspire to kill her and the Mom did away with Simon Monjack to be honest.

       I refuse to go to IMDb since they did that. Supposedly, the boards were taken down because staff were monitoring too many trolls. Complete bullshit. I mean, if you went on a GoT or LOST page, I think that might've been true. But, for the most part, I found people were helpful and gave great insight into movies/TV. The subs here are the only thing I've found close.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, actually, the closing of the message boards happens to be a conspiracy theory in and of itself. As mentioned, they gave the reason of monitoring trolls. But, supposedly the boards were exposing the fact they were inflating their user numbers and were using credibility with advertisers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know a lot of crew members who posted on those boards after films wrapped and told stories of their terrible encounters with celebs. But, the Britney Murphy board was disbanded and I never heard anything more about her death until now.

       Here's a recent article on the suspicious questions regarding her death. She died of pneumonia (which depresses your breathing). If she was taking hydrocodone and was anemic, this combo can be fatal on it's own. However, her whole death and that of her husband is weird as fuck.

       There was always foul play surrounding Brittany’s death and I have no doubt she was murdered, but I never found a reason that was all that plausible but THIS makes a lot of sense. Could also explain why Brittany’s mother never wanted to investigate, Harvey could have scared her a lot easier than Brittany’s father.

       The creepy part is Murphy didn’t really have anything noticeable in her career (from my experience) that jumps out at me as an accomplishment before her death. Since we haven’t heard from her up until her death, one assumes that maybe she was blackballed by Hollywood. Or maybe she was just that bad of an actress. Just putting another idea out there.

       She probably was blackballed. She was clearly talented, but rarely given more than rom-coms toward the end of her career.
      </p>
      <p>
       She was a stand-out in both Clueless and Girl Interruppted. Those roles should have opened the door to leads in any movie she wanted.  and who knows, maybe she wanted to do rom-coms?

       She was blackballed after Sin City, her first and only Weinstein film. She only did small indie films after that.

       Hmm the dots do connect. Always thought there was a lot more to her death, just so weird. A lot of these ‘troubled’ actresses are a) probably not as big of a mess as the media is told to portray them and b) if they are a mess it’s cos they are struggling to cope with being abused.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope her death is looked at again in the light of the death threats Weinstein made.
