        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Anybody else picking up on this? </p>

<p>First they tried to ignore pedogate/pizzagate...</p>

<p>Then they pushed the &quot;Fake News&quot; angle once the social engineers realized it couldn&#39;t be viably contained..</p>

<p>After a short hiatus, they devised a series of politically motivated sex scandals and tabloid hollywood sexual abuse controversies, to ultimately muddy the waters and shift the focus from the occult infused rape/trafficking of pre-pubescent children among the social and political elites, to goofy tabloid and ratings boosting accounts of sexual abuse and &quot;groping&quot;...</p>

<p>Your typical high level players are protected as always; Trump, the Clintons, Podesta&#39;s, Alefantis, Biden, the Royal Family, the Catholic Church, the European aristocracy, ect. Instead, they are implementing a &quot;limited hangout&quot; to shift the focus to something similar (sex crimes), but without the same implications and impact of exposing the global elite pedophilia ring. </p>

<p><strong>They hope that by throwing you a bone, it will satisfy us and make us go away. FUCK. THAT.</strong></p>

<p>The elites control and profiteer from the global trade of drugs and narcotics, so what makes you think they don&#39;t have the human trafficking industry under their thumb? This is a multi million dollar global crime syndicate, implicating some of the wealthiest and most powerful people on the planet, and it needs to be brought down once and fucking for all.</p>

<p>Buckle down, and shift the focus back to what it originally was. You can expect the shills to be going overtime regarding their downvotes and contrarian comments regarding pedogate/pizzagate. But, you should absolutely <strong>NOT</strong> stop talking and posting about it on this sub. Don&#39;t let the subject die down, and keep fighting to expose the criminal elites. </p>

<p>Even bored housewifes like celebrity gossip and it plays far better than an unknown orphan getting raped by a non famous person (sad but true). The celebs who are Jeff E&#39;s friends are the best chance to reach mainstream people about what is happening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, most likely to flip and throw everyone under the bus is this A list mostly movie actor who is an Academy Award winner. He is the one who almost killed several of the boys to the point where his host no longer invited him. Our actor had a preference for tweens who didn&#39;t speak English. He didn&#39;t want to hear anything they had to say. Probably one of the cruelest people around. He lied to the feds like crazy the first time around and said he only went to the island to fish and lay out and relax. He also told the feds he never saw anything happen with anyone and that he usually was alone when there. He is by far facing the most time in jail if caught so would first flip our second a-hole.</p>

<h1>4 - The Island - That A list mostly movie actor who is having so many issues right now has another big one staring him in the face. Apparently the owner of the island made special arrangements one time for a trip not to the island but to a different country where our actor raped a dozen boys in one of the poorest countries in the world. Oh, and get this. The actor bragged about the money he paid to the parents and said he claimed it as a tax deduction.</h1>

<li>ENTERTAINMENT LAWYER 07/07 <strong>#12</strong>
It was not that long ago that this A list actor who stars in movies and an almost television show and really should probably be just a G short of an EGOT but is missing two parts almost brought down a secret society all by himself. I’m not saying it would be a bad idea if he brought it down, but it shows that it depends on its members and their guests to follow the rules. If they don’t disaster happens. At the annual meeting of this society, no cameras are allowed. Sure, some have been sneaked in, but there are no cameras or phones. If you bring one you are to put it in a locker and you can retrieve it when you leave. Well, our actor likes to record first sexual encounters with guys for later viewing material and he wasn’t going to let anything stop him. The society stocks their event with barely legal gay men who make some very big money for some very closeted big money men. Our actor is closeted and he loved every second of his time there until someone discovered he was filming. The s**t hit the fan. The member who invited him got a three year suspension. Other members who also knew but didn’t say anything got suspended. Our actor tried to apologize and did apologize – apparently sincerely which is why his member only got suspended for three years and not expelled. The actor had to turn over all the recordings. Some involve other members and those will probably be used to blackmail them. This is the craziest place and that incident just added to the craziness. Kevin Spacey (&quot;House of Cards&quot;)/&quot;Bohemian Club&quot;</li>

<p>It looks like Kevin got hung out to dry because he upset the grove folks by bringing a camera. He even did a season 5 HOC episode set in a grove like place where he charmed them all. I did read it on CD&amp;N but it isn&#39;t there now. </p>
