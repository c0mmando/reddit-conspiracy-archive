       investigations and the final signitures. The mods and Ajit Pai bend to the will of the controllers.

       Mueller was 1 member of a team responsible. The mods are trying to make it seem like Mueller wasn't a member of the team. If you're a member of a team that wins a championship, you Won a championship. We don't say Altuve never won a world series, it was the Astros.

       Is what he reported... I don't believe they collapsed from fires. Fires never burn evenly so the top would of fell over before the bottom gave way. Anyone who's had a camping fire knows this.

       You just compared a passport to metal, and paper inside an air tight safe. Throw a passport into a fire for ~8 minutes and see what happens...

       The presumption is that the passport was ejected as the plane crashed into the building, was coated in jet fuel, but was ejected quickly enough that it escaped the fireball and did not ignite.

       So, a two whole planes vaporized, along with all the people and such inside of them, but.... a passport survived proving it was a terrorist hijacking. You're really saying that? Do you really believe that's probable?

       The fuck would we need the passport to prove it was a terrorist highjacking for? We knew what was up as soon as the second plane hit, and the identities of the highjackers were known almost as soon as passenger lists were assessed properly. The passport was in no way, shape, or form a crucial piece of evidence. Just a curiosity that it survived.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as it actually surviving, yeah. Presumably, it was on the highjacker’s person in the cockpit. If so, it would have had the best chance of escaping from the impact and nearly simultaneous explosion.
      </p>
      <p>
       We almost certainly found pieces of the other passenger’s belongings too, but none were identifiable or traceable to the right person. There wasn’t
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       left of the planes, people, or stuff inside. Just very small bits.

       Mass v surface area also makes it less likely to have gained the velocity to be ejected and even less likely to have moved very far from the ejection point.

       I see some argument that it could have been ejected with the body but then what happened to the body?

       That a passport survived is not unbelievable. Lots of things survive explosions. It is rather unlikely that someone would find it so quickly, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see why anyone would fake it, though. Find a passport there doesn't prove anything. We only know of Satam Al Suqami because his name was on the Flight 11 manifest. Without that, finding his passport at the scene wouldn't mean anything. And his passport doesn't add anything to the fact that his name was on the manifest, either.

        However, according to the 9/11 Commission, the passport is actually discovered by a male passer-by who is about 30 years old and wearing a business suit. The man gives it to New York City Police Department Detective Yuk H. Chin shortly before 9:59 a.m., when the South Tower of the WTC collapses. The man leaves before he is identified. Chin, according to the 9/11 Commission, will give the passport to the FBI later in the day.

       Just to play devils advocate here:
      </p>
      <p>
       If the passport if from a hijacker perhaps standing in the cockpit, not strapped in. Then upon hitting the tower (at ~500mph), the hijacker himself would continue out through the cockpit window also at 500mph. He would be totally ejected (this is seen all the time f.ex. in carwrecks with passengers not wearing seatbelts).
       <br/>
       So as the plane explodes, he is flying out the window at 500mph and out through the building. 
In the process he is basically shredded, his clothes is shredded. Passport etc. flies out (also at 500mph). A jetfuel explosion is actually not very fast, so likely the flames don't even reach him before he and his passport etc. is ejected out the building (at 500mph thus traveling pretty far away from the crumbling buildings).
Also, passports are made quite sturdy. Ever try to burn a book? not so easy.

       I doubt that he would fly out the front window into the building, with enough force and velocity to out run the explosion and burst out the other side of the building sending his passport (that was soaked in jet fuel) flying blocks away and landing on the ground, to then be found by a mysterious man in a suit who gave it to the police department and left before being identified.

       It's just like in car-accidents. If you don't wear a seatbelt you WILL fly straight out the front window in a head-on collision. Basically the plane stops but you don't.

       Nothing about that day was realistic. It was the most surreal day I've ever experienced. Judging the accuracy of official and unofficial timelines based on what makes sense and what's "realistic" is the wrong approach, IMO.

       It's plausible. Passports are designed to withstand heat. Ever try to light a passport on fire? It's mostly plastic.

      <p>
       I don't think a random passerby that no one bothered to say hey what's your name is plausible though. When I was in the army I was military police then I went and became a CID agent before ditching the military and law enforcement for web dev. And we were always tough get the info of anyone you talk to at a crime scene.

       I think this would be especially relevant because this was evidence and you have to be able to document the chain of evidence

       I used to use Building 7 as the smoking gun to prove there's fishiness in what happened, but then I actually did more research into it, and if you really look into it, the way Building 7 fell can be explained by what actually happened. The majority of videos we see of the collapse don't show the whole thing, and the penthouse on the top starts to fall in first, which then causes the rest of the building to collapse, and nothing about it suggests that it was a controlled demo. It definitely looks that way, and trust me, I was on that train for a long time, but at this point it really just doesn't work anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying that means that the "official story" is the word of god, far from it, and we should still be investigating what happened. However, the real conspiracy isn't in "the planes were actually missiles" or "building 7 was a controlled demo", but rather who was truly responsible for what happened. And for that you just need to follow the money.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 9/11 truther movements get too worked up in stuff like Building 7 and other "anomalies" that have since been debunked, which hurts the cause of finding those who were truly accountable. Those who were funding/supporting the hijackers and their organization, and then those who were funding the funders.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        After two days of digging through what was left of the plane, they found the parts of a handgun containing six spent cartridge cases and the note on the airsickness bag written by Burke, indicating that he may have been responsible for the crash. FBI investigators were able to lift a print from a fragment of finger stuck in the pistol's trigger guard, which positively identified Burke as holding the weapon when the aircraft crashed.

       I see. Sounds like there was a lot of recoverable evidence in this case. I'll look further in to the details.

       So in your opinion, how did the passport gain the velocity (after initial impact, which soaked it in jetfuel) to eject unscathed?

       random luck. Many things survived all the crashes including baggage tags, cushions etc. When you think only a passport survived you'd be suspicious but most of the things surviving the crash were just not newsworthy. Lot's of stuff survived but were later buried under the falling towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that an experiment including worms survived the Columbia space shuttle explosion completely intact. And that explosion was fueled by much more than the planes.

       Nothing was found by the coroner. You would expect bone fragments, blood, pieces of the plane, body parts, something... nothing... just a hole with small shards of metal.

       Not typical of an air to ground collision.

       Where did you hear that they didn't find anything like bone fragments at the crash site?  The descriptions I found say that along with shards of metal, there were bones, teeth, tissue, etc at the crash site.

         Apart from, here and there, a finger, a toe or a tooth, all that remained of the 44 souls aboard, churned into the soil or hanging from the branches of nearby trees, were small pieces of tissue and bone.

        Flight 93 was carrying 7,500 pounds of mail to California – and other papers from the plane were found eight miles (13km) away from the scene of the crash.

        After two days of digging through what was left of the plane, they found the parts of a handgun containing six spent cartridge cases and the note on the airsickness bag written by Burke, indicating that he may have been responsible for the crash. FBI investigators were able to lift a print from a fragment of finger stuck in the pistol's trigger guard, which positively identified Burke as holding the weapon when the aircraft crashed.

       Also incredibly implausible. So this was bogus too. Wonder what the circumstances were around this crash? For example, in what way did it benefit Israel?

       He &amp; Comey also oversaw the bungled the Anthrax investigation, leading to the DOJ having to pay out $5mil+ to an innocent man after they decided on guilt first and the went digging for evidence to fit the narrative.

       Interestingly, part of the lawsuit centered on the fact that the FBI was leaking info to the press to make it seem like the guy was guilty.

       Muellers signitures is the final signitures on the report. Mueller was the head of FBI and the final speaker in congressional national security meetings. Muellers advice and Bush and Congress didn't want Americans to sue ISI mossad for hashing agents watch the event while not contacting the correct agencies. Its like pearl harbor. Washington got the Intel and hid it while the military was left with egg on their face.

       The only provably correct bullet point in metabunk is that the study isn't yet finalized. I'm gonna go with the team of structural engineers that have been analyzing this system for the past several years over a few rando skeptics on metabunk that think they know all the details. There are questions about the study for sure, but those will prove out as the report reaches completion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, this study never should have needed to be independently funded and researched at a university. NIST should have made the data publicly (or at least privately for research institutions) available. Their excuse for not doing so is laughable and potentially endangers the public if they've truly uncovered the magic bullet for making steel high-rise structures crumble into their own footprints with medium sized fires.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, metabunk can be an echo chamber in the same way
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       or
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       can be. Their goal is to aggressively debunk even when the data overwhelmingly point elsewhere. I'll be curious to see what they say after thorough peer reviews are complete.

       The market would collapse and the dollar sink if they did it any other way. I think Mueller is one of those agents to the echelons goals but also rogue in his own convictions. He does 1 thing good for every 1 bad thing he does. I support his holding trump accountable quest but I can never forgive him for his 9/11 actions.
