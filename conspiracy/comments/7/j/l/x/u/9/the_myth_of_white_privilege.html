       White privilege is how all my white friends from highschool got busted for drugs yet none got even a ticket when my black friends got records now for the same shit with the same officers.

       Usage among whites is equal to usage with non whites yet look at alk the incarceration/probation data.

       Crime statistics are hate facts. I think it's disingenuous to imply that the levels of degeneracy are the same within racial groups. In the black community there are far more single parent families. And far more impoverished families. How could we blame race for these judicially different outcomes when there are other factors.

       Crime stats aren't really useful if you're trying to gauge the corruptness of the justice system.

       Can confirm.  In college, my musician friends all shared an apartment.  They were all arrested after someone ratted on one them for having weed.  The only one who was held overnight was the black guy, who never did any drugs.  Meanwhile his Deadhead roommates were allowed to go home with no bail.  No drugs were found in the apartment, just some seeds in one of the Deadhead's van.

       Treatment of the public by police is a big factor of "white privelige." The term isn't an insult. Everybody knows there are plenty of white people that have it rough. Bad households, grow up poor, etc. Let me put it in a way that this community might understand. You know how a lot of people think it's fucked up that jewish folks are in powerful positions and tend to help other Jews get a leg up? Like Hollywood, the banking industry, etc. That's how many minorities feel about being white in America. The vast majority of the top CEOs, politicians, actors, doctors, lawyers are white dudes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, it's not an insult. It's just looking at the country we live in an saying man it seems like these white dudes might. E getting a few more opportunities than the rest of us.

       There's not a direct correlation between IQ and success. Intelligence is also hard to study. It's a combination of good genes and environment. George Bush sucked in school and still got a lot of opportunities because he was part of an important family. Then he became president. Did you think that had anything to do with his IQ?

       it's a fallacy of the post modernist view on culture and history.  They see our cultural values being shaped by whites -population being historically white and christian- so they obviously assume we have the privilege and anyone who doesn't except those values are excluded...when in fact their only other option is not to be excluded but just to have everyone equally valueless.

       White privilege is born out of the notion that it represents values and traditions which by nature have to exclude some individuals while the majority is included...while no one is cheering on exclusion the only alternative to this promote a society that is equally value-less.

       I'm saying it is naturally unavoidable when societies come together and agree upon a set of values and traditions.  The way you are phrasing your question is unnecessary and seems loaded.  No one HAS to do anything.  I don't see what the motive is for people who feel like they are being oppressed by this current system of values.

       It is loaded. Heavily loaded. Because it is reality for people and no amount of “rational” thinking makes it feel any better to be excluded. Their motive for thinking that way is probably a lifetime of observation, and it ain’t made up.

       I fully understand the point you are making. It is that of being a literal population minority entails less attention being paid to your individual problems as a minority, as a function of math, basically. It is completely logical.
      </p>
      <p>
       I reject it because it implies that problems have lesser value depending on the number of people experiencing them. Societal issues are not zero-sum, and I generally dislike social observations that admit problems but offer no solutions. Or especially, as in your case, decline to admit the necessity of a solution at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you did that, you would be a fool. But you’d be in an extreme minority, and not that of America, where he minorities are much larger.

       their example is much different.  Israeli Jews are favored by the law and the state.  The notion of white privilege is that minorities are kept down by a subtle, subversive system of certain values over another.

       This guy has it all wrong. But not because he says white privilege doesn't exist. It doesn't really, because it's a terrible term. The problem with the term "white privilege" is that it out of the gate implies that a white person has unduly gained something undeserved. That something was handed to the white man because of his privilege, whereas everybody else has to work for it. And the unspoken assumption then becomes, well black people can't have nice things because they don't work hard enough. And the other unspoken assumption is that because white people have this privilege, it must be their fault that brown people don't have nice things.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is not the problem of institutional racism though, which really is a thing. What people call "white privilege" is better described by a term like "brown tax". As in Brown people often have to (metaphorically) pay an extra tax to get the same thing as a white person might get simply because he's white. In other words, the Brown man has to work
       <em>
        automatically harder
       </em>
       to attain the same things.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's easy for any white person to be pissed off when white privilege is invoked, because maybe they did really work hard for everything. Maybe nothing was handed to them due to their supposed "privilege". And maybe they even have fought against racism when and where they could. And by using the term white privilege, you just lost that person in acknowledging or caring about racism, because it's an automatic accusation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we stop calling it white privilege, we can start to examine what really is institutional racism, where does it exist, why does it exist in a particular place, and if we can identify it, what can we due to eliminate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for example, imagine you have 2 resumes. One from "Bob Smith", and the other from "Laquanisha Brown". There is a very good chance that just reading those names will activate an underlying bias, and Bob Smith will get the job. Here's the thing, if they both get interviews, Laquanisha Brown will have to work twice as hard to prove she's the better candidate than Bob Smith, even if both are equally qualified. Laquanisha very likely has to pay the brown tax to get the job.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in our hypothetical example, the solution isn't to hire more Laquanisha Browns regardless of qualification to counteract Bob Smith's "white privilege". It's to remove the "Brown tax" from the equation by simply taking the names off of the resumes. That will at least put Laquanisha on equal footing with Bob for the person who reviews the resumes.

       the whole notion of this underlying bias is a theory not rooted in any fact.  Your post is thoughtful but the aforementioned theory relies on assumption.

       How can you even argue that it isn’t a real systemic issue when people were still segregated less than fifty years ago? Do you think all of the mindsets that allowed that kind of behavior just... disappeared?

       I doubt it, and even if it is true, there are almost certainly factors that make that statement only true without context. Even if that isn’t the case, segregation disallowed that net higher value from stacking up to the heights achievable by a white community.

       You’re not going to convince me that segregation was a good thing.

       Well, of the three names we are discussing the one I already said sounded like the dribblings of a retard left locked in a pantry for too long was
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       the only one that didn't mean something.  The other two have distinct meanings (IE: 'On the heath').  Just mashing some syllables together and adding an 'isha' to the end does not create an 'African' name.  I don't think it's stupid because it sounds African, I think it's stupid because it
       <em>
        doesn't
       </em>
       sound African or of any other language.  It sounds just like what it is.  A person with a low IQ trying to make up a name.

       First, it’s tough to retain much of your African heritage when you are ripped from your homeland to be enslaved, with nothing but (suppressed) oral history to account for names that “mean anything”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second,
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       names are made up. The only thing that gives them “legitimacy” is historical context. Which is, again, forcibly lacking for African Americans. Laquanisha could be a legitimate namesake meaning “she who gets jobs” in a century, if history so has it. That is how language develops, you see.
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically, you think people have low IQs if they make up a name? Nice. You know IQ levels mean little to nothing, right? It measures a very specific kind of intelligence; the IQ test taking kind of intelligence.

       You are woefully misinformed.  Most names mean something
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       because they were attributed meaning randomly which was then taken up into general language but rather because they are words that meant something
       <em>
        before they became names
       </em>
       .  That's the difference.

       I see a lot of people lately saying "IQ means nothing" which always makes me giggle.  I imagine them observing their IQ score before coming to that conclusion.

       I presume you took an IQ test and scored well, then? Whatever keeps your self esteem afloat, I guess. Stephen Hawking, even, thinks they’re bullshit. But don’t trust the appeal to authority, trust the appeal to science... which also say IQ tests are of very limited use and only describe a narrow range of intelligence factors.

       Bingo. It's not about race…it's about class. There are white people struggling every bit as hard as blacks and there are blacks doing a fuck of a lot better than many whites.

       White privilege just means that everything else being equal, life is harder the darker you are (in America).  Of course there are rich black people and poor white people, but everything considered life is easier when you're white, a man, straight, able bodied etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of white people seem to lose their shit because it implies that their achievements are less impressive and lash out against the entire idea of WP.

       It's more problematic to me that privilege works for them even as they cry that calling them privileged is oppression. Like, you're not getting scrutinized extra hard while you shop, or getting pulled over by police more often because of your color. Me pointing that out is not going to break society,  and it's not an attack on you.

       They're not terrible people, but they benefit from a terrible system.  If you were a person at the zoo looking at the animals in their cages, and a lion looked at you and said "lucky bastard, he's not in a cage", the lion is not going to be like "oh sorry man I didn't know" if you flip out and start screaming that because there's a fence around the zoo you're no better off than he us. He can see you have a greater degree of mobility in life than he's got. Playing dumb about it doesn't make that advantage invisible to people (or zoo residents).

       Ach. I just read through those comments and felt like chiming in.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the most part, I think privilege is a product of wealth/class rather than race. But, here's a story to corroborate the idea that privilege does yet exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a 14 year old, I and some friends were hanging out with some older guys (we were all white) whom had bought us beer.
      </p>
      <p>
       While drunk, wandering around our apartment complex we came across a bunch of black guys whom also lived there.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was some altercation which turned into a fight . One of the older guys we were with, hit one of the black kids with a stick and knocked him out. The police were called.
      </p>
      <p>
       We went back to the older guys apartment and continued drinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the cops came.. the older guy lied and told the cops that the black kid had called him a honkey (he had in fact used the word coon, which escalated it from an argument to a brawl)... The white cops were incensed.
      </p>
      <p>
       They left us, 14 years old, to continue our night of drinking and went and arrested all of the black kids..
      </p>
      <p>
       Tldr- guy knocks out kid with a stick, claims the attack was incited by a racial slur. Cops arrest the black guys while leaving a bunch of underage white kids to drink the night away.
      </p>
      <p>
