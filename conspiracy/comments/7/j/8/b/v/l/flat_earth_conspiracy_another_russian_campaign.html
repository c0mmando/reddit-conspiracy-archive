       I don't know the motive (perhaps distraction tactics) but is it possible accounts pushing for this flat earth conspiracy are another Russian social media interference campaign? I find it incredible that people would genuinely believe and argue for a flat earth, and I think people engaging with these people/accounts may be taking their posts too much at face value.

       The idea the flat earth model, something that has been believed by many humans for thousands of years, is a recent CIA psy-op or Russian infiltrative effort, falls flat for many reasons. Someone makes this comment in literally every thread about flat earth as if they were the first one to say so. But that idea doesn't even hold up to scrutiny. Within the "flat earth movement" are people who can only be said to be muddying the waters for the other flat-earth believers. The Flat Earth Society is the very definition of controlled opposition, and spreads ideas such as the earth rises under us at a speed of 9.80 m/s and this is what we call gravity, etc., things that are ridiculous and that even other flat-earthers say are ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if there are psy-ops or paid shills here, they are actually trying to make the flat earth concept unattractive, not make more people look into it. The same people who say flat earth is a CIA psy-op also talk about how all the arguments are "retarded" and "unscientific" and that only morons could believe in this, etc. So what is it guys? Are they trying to get people to believe in flat earth and if so, then why? And why are they doing a poor job of it?

       The people you call shills are just idiots who are unintentionally derailing a psy-op. Its a positive feedback loop: create a movement that promotes anti-science, this generates attention from dumb people, the dumb people then push the movement further and attract more dumb people.

       People are starting to increasingly notice the impotent rage with which the flat earth topic is met by people who themselves can do nothing to prove the earth is round but are so willing to castigate those who would call anti-scientific those who are actually engaged in the scientific process of questioning authority.

       Either Rogan is the only person in the history of thinking people to acknowledge and understand the Apollo hoax, then to later repent and assert that it was real, or he is a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       His association with Black Science Man further certified this.
      </p>
      <p>
       For people who are on the fence about whether flat earth is a worthwhile subject for study, they might sample some of Rogan's brilliant arguments in favor of the globe model such as "it's fucking curved," "you can see that shit," and "everyone would have to be lying."

       How many differing fields are there, where you simply will not get on if you don’t uphold the status quo? This may or may not qualify as being paid directly or be a claim that he is working with them. The facts are that Rogan is doing quite well out of his operations at the moment and that he clearly took a decision to switch sides and repent of his former opinion, to instead support the scientism narrative. His arguments in support of his current opinion are laughable.

       A couple things, the sun goes away every night. If the earth was flat, we would always be able to see the sun regardless of its size or distance from us. Also the phasing of the moon would not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the world was flat, when we go into an airplane and look out the window we should be able to see mountain ranges and major city skylines from extremely far away but that doesn't happen. We would be able to see these same tall structures with telescopes from stationary positions. Along with that, air travel routes would be completely different. A flight from Argentina to Australia would take the shorter path and cut across the US, instead it takes the "longer" path and circles around the entire flat earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Climate would be different. On a flat earth there would more tropical zones and less cooler regions due to the position of the sun and the constant sunlight.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tides would behave differently if gravity was only created by the upward movement of the flat earth. Instead, they follow the gravity of the moon.  If you believe that gravity is created by the mass of the earth, then its impossible for the earth to be a disc shape as its gravity would collapse it into a ball, like every other massive thing in the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       GPS and Latitude/Longitude would also work differently. Well first of all, theres fucking GPS satellites in the sky and I'd like to see you try to deny that. If the earth was flat, your current lat/long position would be different. The lat and long lines would be perfect squares, instead they are parallelograms that stretch to fit the curvature of the earth. In flat earth, GPS wouldnt even exist because NASA is a giant scam right? And they use CGI for everything and dont have rockets and are completely lying to us right?

       The Sun is quite close and it’s light is directional, more like a spotlight. It does not provide all the light we see.
      </p>
      <p>
       The phasing of the moon is impossible to replicate. You can try to do this yourself using a tennis ball and a football or something. You might be able to line it up to create a half moon, but it falls apart as soon as you have the moon orbit the earth whilst it is spinning and orbiting the sun. Try it. You will soon realise it can’t be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to research optics a little. Vanishing points always exist no matter whether you look with the naked eye or a telescope, there is a natural limit to just how far can be seen. The question you should be asking is ‘How come we cannot see any curvature anywhere on earth?’ When the curvature is 8” per mile squared it is actually quite significant, and should easily be seen any place you can see for a few miles in the distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody really believes the flat earth is moving upwards. The flat earth society is IMHO controlled opposition to make us look foolish.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moon does not control tides. Think about it logically. How exactly is it high tide at various times that bear no relation to the position of the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       GPS doesn’t work in the middle of oceans. Any idea why that might be? It works exactly the way the previous land based system worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Longitude is the same on flat earth. The central point is the North Pole. However latitude would only be the same as far as the equator, after which the lines being concentric would get much bigger. However as it is a minority of land that is far enough south to make much difference. That said, we don’t have a genuine map that is accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes NASA is a giant scam. Please tell me you don’t accept the moon landings as real?

       Look up the "Burned-Over District" in New York State in the early 1800's.  It's almost as if the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of freedom of religion was treated as an open invitation for various &amp; virulent forms of Christianity (as well as a few other religions/sects) to attempt to set up a dictatorial theocracy over here.
