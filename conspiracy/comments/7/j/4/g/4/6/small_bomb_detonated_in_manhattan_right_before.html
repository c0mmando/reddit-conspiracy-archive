       Just thinking about it and it seems like the perfect thing to dominate the news cycles for the next couple days and distract from the Trump accusers. The timing is just a little too convenient for me. I don't wanna throw out a sleeper cell theory but something seems fishy.

       I think it will blow over in less than 24 hrs and isn't that significant. The Port Authority bus terminal NY is the largest in the country. Real damage could have been done. But this idiot was so inept he couldn't even kill himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory, is that this is going to be used to increase bus terminal security. Currently, you can get anywhere in the country, without flashing an ID once, if you buy a greyhound ticket. It's known as the poor mans airplane for a reason. They don't want anonymous public travel, I think they will use this to start treating bus terminals like airports, and start cracking down on freedom of movement even more.

       If you honestly believe the MSM will let a non-fatal failed terror attack distract from their coverage, idk what to say. This will be a nothingburger. Worry about what they will use the attack to do instead.

       Agreed 100%. Hopefully they focus on the sexual abuse allegations.

       It’s funny, your comment is off topic for the post and seems to be talking about the distraction and not what it’s distracting from. It’s just enough text to push the other comments down, but just short enough that you can read the whole thing without scrolling:

       It's not off topic though...I disagreed with OP and their entire premise. I don't think this attack was launched to distract from Trumps abuse allegations, at all. I think what I stated is the far more important topic at hand, and I even made self-post about it.

       Hey I have alien blue too! Haven’t used it in a while though. Meant no offense with my observation, just thought it was funny that your comment was so heavily upvoted and was the ideal form to switch the topic to something else and then dissuade people from scrolling down to see the rest of the comments. Just a coincidence I’m sure!
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think the sexual assault allegations are credible? If they are, I’d still say OP’s theory is unlikely, but I could understand why someone might think they are connected.

       Well it took 9 hours to get to that point. For the first several it was about the same as the rest, pretty slow day overall on this thread. When I make comments, I just state my opinion and let the wind take it where it will.

       Time will tell, though when it first came out last year it seemed mostly politically motivated. I'm not sure why the media would drop it for more than a year and only now decide to bring it up. Will have to wait and see what is actually brought forth.

       Oh ya I think you made a good point, it was just the perfect length of it that I thought was funny. If it was a bit longer someone might have scrolled down to read the end of it, and if it was a bit shorter the next comment down would have been visible below it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I wanted to kill a discussion, I’d make a post like that and then have my bots upvote it to the top of the comments. Then ideally everyone would be talking about the bomb for example, and not if it was a distraction or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said I’m sure that wasn’t your intention, I just thought it was funny that if that was the purpose then it would have been perfectly suited to that.

       Chill out dude, I'm not saying that I believe the accusers, hell they probably are getting paid, i was just pointing out that Trump would still want to keep this whole story out of the limelight. Weather the accusers are telling the truth or not it still doesn't look good to be accused at all.

      <p>
       And he still cares about his approval rating that's why he tweeted that he had a 45% approval rating not that long ago. Don't know why you're bringing my support into this though, you lost me there.

       The only way I could see me not voting for him is if he completely went against the values I care about most.
      </p>
      <p>
       And let's say he did that. I still will never vote Democrat, even for dog catcher, after what was done to President Trump this year.

       Then why has Trump been able to stop illegal immigration and why has he been able to bring back tons of the jobs to the US?

       Why has he also been able to pull out TPP and has gotten NAFTA to the point where it can be renegotiated?

       The only trade policy Trump has enacted was a restriction on canadian timber, which we now buy from Russia. All the rest is just talk. Any company that brought jobs back in the last year has been planning it for many many years. The stock market has been going up for 10 years. If you want to use that metric, Obama was the most successful president of all time. It went up 14,000 points under Obama, and less than 2000 under trump.

       I found it really interesting how 10+ people waited anywhere from 10-30 years to make this claims public and just happened to do it all on the same day. The coincidences on that, especially during an election, have to be astronomical. Why, it's like the event was planned.

       Here is what would buy them legitimacy points:
      </p>
      <p>
       1 - Alerting authorities immediately after it happened
      </p>
      <p>
       2 - Photographs or videos of the incident
      </p>
      <p>
       Sexual Assault claims are a great gamble. Low ceiling, high reward.

       I don't know enough about the cases, but the fact that the people involved have been pretty consistent for over a decade about what went down, does give them more credibility.

       Haven't been to a play since the early 2010's and that was not under my own accord. Have probably seen less than 10 new movies total this decade.
