     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       Let's look at a timeline:
      </p>
      <p>
       April 2016:  Huma Abedin and Cheryll Mills both interviewed by FBI w/Strzok in attendance.  Deny knowledge of private server until year + after Clinton's SoS tenure.   It's actually reasonable that they may not be aware of the intricacies of server setup, but they still obviously knew they were communicating under a ".com" vs. ".gov" domain w/HRC.  The FBI interview notes never show any pressure being applied about how stunningly obvious it should've been that it wasn't a .gov setup.  So, even if they weren't lying about private server knowledge, the line of questioning is pretty soft because it's glaringly obvious they knew the email setup was outside the .gov purview.  For what it's worth Strzok was also present for other interviews and it's widely acknowledged he played a key role in the investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spring 2016:  Wording (allegedly urged by Strzok) changed from "grossly negligent", which is punishable, to "extremely careless", which is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       June 26, 2016:  Bill Clinton has impromptu 1 hour discussion with Attorney General Loretta Lynch aboard private plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       July 5, 2016:  Comey exonerates HRC while basically admitting she broke the law but it was "extremely careless" and lacked intent.
      </p>
      <p>
       July 6, 2016:  AG Lynch confirms HRC email case will not face charges.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the arrogant posters downplaying everything about the Strzok texts, please consider how you would react if you read the headline "BOMBSHELL:  Trump met with (insert Russian official) for hour a week before Russian sanctions lifted".  You'd be frothing at the mouth with rage.
      </p>
      <p>
       On to Russiagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       June 2016:  Fusion GPS hires Orbis (Superspy Chris Steele, great spy name btw) to collect information on Trump's/Trump campaign's ties to Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Near the start of July 2016":  Steele sends preliminary report of findings to contact at FBI.  Gee, how coincidental it would be if it turns out the contact is Strzok.
      </p>
      <p>
       Summer of 2016:  FBI officially opens case into "Trump Russia", allegedly signed by, you guessed it, Strzok.
      </p>
      <p>
       Summer of 2016:  FBI obtains FISA warrant to collect surveillance on Trump associate, allegedly Carter Page.  FISA warrants need to be reviewed and signed off on by a DOJ official.  AG Lynch and Deputy AG Sally Yates (praised by Strzok for defying Trump re: travel ban) are the two most likely candidates to sign off given I have to imagine surveillance on a campaign official during an election is probably not taken lightly.
      </p>
      <p>
       August 15, 2016:  Strzok texts mistress and FBI Lawyer Page "I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy's office...that there's no way he gets elected, but I'm afraid we can't take that risk...It's like an insurance policy in the event you die before you're 40."
      </p>
      <p>
       From the timeline, it's virtually certain that Strzok had knowledge of the Dossier's claims prior to sending this text.  The mention of the "insurance policy" and "can't take that risk" makes it pretty reasonable to assume that he's talking about using the Dossier against Trump in the event he wins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Early October 2016:  Steele meets FBI contact in Rome (wouldn't it be crazy if we find out it's Strzok) to discuss more Trump Russia findings.  FBI offers Steele $50,000 if he can corroborate his findings.  Steele was ultimately never paid, presumably, after being unable to corroborate findings.
      </p>
      <p>
       November 8, 2016:  Trump wins...everyone's mind, including Trump's, is collectively blown.
      </p>
      <p>
       Early Winter 2016:  Media reports anything and everything it can get its hands on tying anyone and everything connected to Trump, to Russia
      </p>
      <p>
       December 2016:  Flynn interviewed by FBI agent Strzok in attendance.  FBI already had transcript of call with Kislyak, presumably the result of another FISA warrant or similar legal instrument.
      </p>
      <p>
       January 10, 2017:  Buzzfeed publishes Trump Dossier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Early 2017:  Flynn removed from campaign over misleading statements about Kislyak call.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to continue with the timeline as recent events are probably well acknowledged.
      </p>
      <p>
       For anyone who has read the entirety of the Dossier and followed the Mueller probe, it is fairly obvious Mueller is essentially using the Dossier as a road map and attempting to corroborate its claims.  Don't believe me?  Consider that only 3 Trump officials, Page, Manafort, and Flynn are named in the Dossier and it is those 3 officials who have been under the most scrutiny by the probe, with the hopes being that those 3 have further information and can be flipped under pressure of prosecution.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, we have a Special Counsel that is using an unverified document prepared by an ex-British spy as its road map.  We also have an FBI agent who had his hands all over both the HRC email investigation and the Trump Russia investigation from the get go, before being VERY quietly dismissed from Mueller's probe.  This FBI agent was fervently anti-Trump (that's not even debatable) and made reference to an "insurance policy" to use because they "can't take that risk" (Trump winning).
      </p>
      <p>
       Very coincidental that everyone in the HRC email scandal was cleared of any wrong doing despite evidence of "misleading the FBI", yet anyone in Trump Russia is being brought up on any possible charge prosecutors can think of in the hopes that the breadcrumbs will eventually, somehow, someway, lead to the discovery that the Trump campaign willingly served as a proxy for the Russian government.
      </p>
      <p>
       To anyone saying Mueller firing Strzok bolsters his credibility to run an unbiased investigation, please consider that they did everything they could to prolong having to divulge the reason for his removal, that's not exactly transparent.  How bad is it going to look if Strzok was the FBI contact for Steele, signed off on the investigation, offered Steele $50,000 to corroborate claims, spearheaded the FISA warrant, entrapped Flynn, and was actually assigned to the Special Counsel IF the Special Counsel uncovers no reasonable grounds to believe there was any collusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there's collusion found, then great, that should absolutely come to light and you could argue this is an "ends justify the means" situation as Trump Russia is basically better than a Tom Clancy novel in terms of political intrigue and impropriety.  If it's true, then Trump deserves prison and worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Special Counsel turns up nothing...then basically you have a situation where one FBI agent used his authority to champion a year plus (at least) investigation into an elected President that has severely hampered that president's ability to govern.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you say, "great, Trump's an asshole and it's great that he's being impeded", understand that there's nothing to stop something similar from impeding the next president, perhaps with a D next to his name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strzok's texts, and his intricate involvement in both the HRC email and Trump Russia is a big deal, and I really love that stories like the one from Politico conveniently leave out the "insurance policy" part of the texts.  Fake news is more about what's omitted then just outright lying to your readers.  Politico omitted that 100% on purpose and if you don't believe that then I don't know what to tell you.  You're part of the reason why this country can't have a civil discussion on anything anymore because you only believe what you want to.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR Strzok's texts, combined with his actions and intricate involvement in two giant political scandals that have had significant consequences for this country, are a big deal whether you're a Republican or a Democrat.  If you're an American, his actions should concern you.  And they most definitely constitute a potential conspiracy.

       OK some of those things happened and some are things you've made up (or copied from t_d probably)
      </p>

       You haven't linked the alleged events together in any form never mind a convincing one.
      </p>
      <p>
       What was Strozks job title?
      </p>
      <p>
       So he was in attendance at some questioning (source?) how does his attendance at this interview implicate him? What is he implicated in here exactly? The suggestion seems to be his questions were "softball" but you admit yourself they (Clinton, Abdein) might not have been aware of the conflict. The investigation lasted months, nothing criminal was found. What do you think this guy did?
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't make sense.

       In the FBI Interview Notes he's referred to as "Section Chief Strzok", so I'll assume that's his title.  If you're going to try and argue he's some low level guy then feel free to research it yourself.  He's not "just some guy".
      </p>
      <p>
       None of those things are made up, you can piece every item in there from reporting by CNN, WaPO, etc.  You do know virtually every news outlet has covered the Dossier in great detail?  It's not like this is some obscure document from IBleedAmerican.MAGA. I do not know how to link in Reddit and the post was long, I already figured not many would read it.  This is more just venting because arrogant posts and dismissals from people who think they have a monopoly on the facts because.... they're arrogant.  Not unlike yourself in assuming I copied this from T_D.  If you want me to source it I'll upload a comment that is links.  You can piece all this together from sources you probably deem credible when the headline is "Trump Campaign received encryption key to Wikileaks website before emails released".  Even though that got retracted.  I doubt the retraction tweets got retweeted hundreds of thousands of times though.  Weird how that happens a lot recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also saying I can believe they don't know the mechanics of how email servers and domains work.  I'm saying if you're an FBI agent and you have thousands of emails to/from a .COM email account, how do you not ask "At any point did it seem strange to you that you were corresponding via a non-government email domain?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean the investigation is over a private email server and if you just take them at their word that "they didn't know till a year after" then really what have you accomplished in your questioning?
      </p>
      <p>
       "OJ, did you do it?"
"No"
"...We're done here."
      </p>
      <p>
       I provided the context in the timeline.  Strzok arguably had knowledge of the Dossier's claims prior to sending that text.  It's not that logical a leap to think "huh, maybe the Dossier is his insurance policy".  If we find out that the text about insurance was cut from a text string way later discussing actual insurance, then yeah, I'll admit this is a smear job no problem.  And I'll be just as pissed as anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the whole thing makes a lot of sense.  One guy was heavily involved in two huge investigations that had huge ramifications for either political party.  That an FBI agent key to both may be so fervently biased that he feels justified in preventing/obstructing a Trump presidency and/or doing anything he can to mitigate the blowback for Hillary's email server is a potentially serious problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't about having a private opinion, this is about taking it upon yourself to do everything in your power as an FBI agent to bring about a specific political outcome.  If you honestly don't see how that could be inferred as to what happened here then I really don't know what more could be gained from discussion.

       Just want to throw this out there, this timeline also works if the FBI had reason to think Trump was corrupted already.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the "insurance policy" was used as an analogy for life insurance before you turn 40, not saying they need insurance. That's why nobody's mentioning it, he didn't say they had an insurance policy, he said that it's important to prepare for something that would be disastrous no matter how unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that make much difference in terms of whether he was trying to sabotage Trump? Not really, but it does mean that the "insurance policy" comment is not a smoking gun.

      <p>
       Agreed 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a reasonable interpretation for a less hostile reading of the text.  It's an interesting avenue for discussion and I can see the merits of both interpretations.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the options are
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Insurance policy to push for Trump's impeachment if he actually manages to win.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Insurance policy to expose Trump given the FBI is confident he's been wittingly or unwittingly manipulated by the Russian government for their own gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really will come down to the results of Mueller's investigation.  If there's no collusion found then scenario 1 is more likely.  Maybe it wasn't purposeful, perhaps Strzok's bias lent him to confirm what he already wanted to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there's collusion found then it could very well be 2 and Strzok was correct in viewing Trump as a threat to national security.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way I wish they would just release the freaking texts in their entirety as that would go a long way towards settling the whole issue.  This trickle, trickle, trickle, is such bullshit and lends itself to political manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, if Trump Russia is proven true and this guy's texts, in their entirety, don't paint nearly as terrible a picture, I'll readily admit to being wrong about Strzok.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly just want to know what the truth of the matter is because I'm tired of "I'm not having a discussion, I read it on twitter, Trump(Franken) is a sexual assaulter, I'm right and so are all Democrats(Republicans) on all matters."

       This right here is the biggest issue I have with these texts. They weren't released in any sort of normal manor. It is quite obvious they are playing a political game with them letting reporters see them like this.

       The idea that the FBI genuinely believed that there was evidence of Russian collusion and were just WRONG doesn't even seem to enter people's minds a lot of the time, even though it's an extremely plausible option.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think there's any direct Trump/Russia collusion, I think that multiple actors both in his campaign and in Russia just worked in concert to help elect him. There was a Facebook post written by some fairly prominent Russian right after the election claiming that Trump's win was the result of years of work and planning.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if there really was a heavy campaign within Russia to help elect Trump, is it really so crazy that maybe the government thought that there was something illegal going on?

       Excellent timeline, thank you for putting that together. 
Don’t worry about the people refusing to believe, it is their choice to be deaf, dumb &amp; blind to the facts. Don’t worry about sourcing all of these items, if you provided them they would then cry about the source itself. They don’t want to admit this entire year plus has been a concocted witch hunt. HRC and her entire team were given a pass by the FBI, who then turned and tried to get Trump out of office before he even got there.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you have the ex director of the CIA openly stating the Deep State actively worked against Trump, it’s not that hard to see this for what it is. DIRTY! Every freaking ounce of it. And you’re right, would they be ok with all of this happened to Obama or some other D? Look what happened to JFK and tell me this whole Russian collusion boondoggle is that far fetched. It’s not.
      </p>
      <p>
       And before anyone chimes in with “ I can’t believe this sub has gone all right-wing propaganda mouth piece”, stop and ask yourself if this is not the very thing conspiracies are based upon! The president has been under attack from the Deep State to get him removed from office. Obama’s legalized propaganda use on US citizens on his way out the door and the MSM has been playing along every sense, repeating every lie the Deep State has fed them. Or does that not matter to you because it’s being used against a Republican president? It should matter regardless of what party is in office.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is very much at the root of conspiracies and anyone that doesn’t understand that is being willfully ignorant.

       Investigation of political influence within law enforcement is not opposed by hardly anyone.

       Now, a politically-influence investigation of political influence within law enforcement is another story.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want this investigation, commit to a parallel investigation (or, rather, a fair one) into all the anti-Clinton leak and commentary and anonymous commentary to the press from the FBI -- especially the SDNY FBI Office -- during the campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll happily get on board ANY investigation of bias that isn't simply a tool for one side to exonerate their favorite politicians from the consequences of their actions, as this one-sided push to go after the Trump investigators is shaping up to be.

       Everyone has personal politics, eve fbi agents.  2 things about the texts bother me.  1) why did the insurance text come to light?  Who exposed it and why/how?  The source if this info may be just as important as what's in it.  And 2) what was this "insurance"?  Was it the dossier?  If so it suggests the investigation was started and fueled by him.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, he was dismissed by mueller, so he did what needed to be done.  I just can't help but wonder where all of this is going.  There is 1 sealed indictment out there from this investigation,  and it has to be someone at manaforts level or higher.  It's a big one and I think mueller did this on purpose to keep it hanging over this admistration head to cause anxiety, and it's clearly working.

       His administration has literally been chaos due to officials leaking info left and right. The last year has been a continual stream of both sides leaking info to score cheap points. Not to mention there’s plenty of Republicans that are reticent to support a President’s policies given they feel there’s a genuine fear of being tied politically to Trump, who could be impeached. These people want to get re-elected, can you imagine the ads, a vote for so and so is a vote for Putin!
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not saying he’s been completely kneecapped, but I think it’s reasonable to assert that having the specter of a special counsel whose primary goal is to uncover information that would arguably lead to impeachment hanging over you might impede your ability to effectively govern. I understand Democrats don’t care because they despise Trump and his policies, but they will care if this becomes fair political sport for the future.

       He's going to have to find something someone on the left did and get an indictment on someone on the left if he really is following all the evidence strands like he would any other case. His directive is clear. Russian collusion and any other crimes he unturns.

       I was hopeful that Trump winning would force members of both parties to collectively realize that they’ve both done such a miserable job and eroded so much faith in our institutions of authority that Donald f’ing Trump was seen by many as the better choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of recognizing that the constant politicization of everything and the complete inability to bargain for an acceptable and preferable middle ground on important issues has shattered the public trust, we’re apparently blaming Russia for his election instead of the complete failure of our elected officials to govern.
      </p>
      <p>
       By scapegoating Russia completely, politicians are basically denying that it was their failure to govern that provided an opening for Trump’s populist rhetoric to catch fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie was wildly popular as well in large part because he was seen as “anti establishment”. It’s no coincidence that “anti establishment” was the prevailing desire of many long before Russia started releasing emails, if they actually did.
      </p>
      <p>
       But instead of recognizing that they must improve collectively, politicians are all “it was Russia! It’s not our failure, it’s Putin!”
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if Russia is guilty of everything its accused of, if the average American felt this country’s government was actually serving in their best interest, any attempts to “interfere” wouldn’t have been nearly as effective as is being claimed.

       First of all you have a few assumptions that really are necessary to prove before it all becomes this one agent spearheading an investigation against Trump. I'm not saying they aren't true but you are making several leaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, you are assuming his bias is just that he hates Trump politically. It could be he believes the charges are legitimate and is trying to stop a bad actor (at least in his mind) being president. Lets just hypothetically pretend this is the case; in his mind he is Jack Bauer stopping the evil person.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would you do if you thought this was the truth hypothetically?
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, the Dossier is becoming more and more correct. Mueller is using it as a road map because so far it has worked out pretty well. The only thing unusual about this investigation is that people aren't used to this level of investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democrats were trying all sorts of tricks to get Kenneth Starr removed when he was investigating Clinton. It didn't work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Republicans tried all sorts of tricks with Nixon as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately it will depend on what Mueller comes up with.

       Agreed 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a reasonable interpretation for a less hostile reading of the text.  It's an interesting avenue for discussion and I can see the merits of both interpretations.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the options are
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Insurance policy to push for Trump's impeachment if he actually manages to win.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Insurance policy to expose Trump given the FBI is confident he's been wittingly or unwittingly manipulated by the Russian government for their own gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really will come down to the results of Mueller's investigation.  If there's no collusion found then scenario 1 is more likely.  Maybe it wasn't purposeful, perhaps Strzok's bias lent him to confirm what he already wanted to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there's collusion found then it could very well be 2 and Strzok was correct in viewing Trump as a threat to national security.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way I wish they would just release the freaking texts in their entirety as that would go a long way towards settling the whole issue.  This trickle, trickle, trickle, is such bullshit and lends itself to political manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, if Trump Russia is proven true and this guy's texts, in their entirety, don't paint nearly as terrible a picture, I'll readily admit to being wrong about Strzok.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly just want to know what the truth of the matter is because I'm tired of "I'm not having a discussion, I read it on twitter, Trump(Franken) is a sexual assaulter, I'm right and so are all Democrats(Republicans) on all matters."

        You didn't really answer my question. What white-collar crime described in the dossier has proven true? Manafort has been charged for stuff that happened well before he started working for Trump, and that's the closest they've come as far as I know. The actual meat of the claims in the dossier are still unsubstantiated as far as I know, although I'd be very interested to know if I missed anything.
       </p>

       Perhaps I am incorrect about what is in the dossier. I will have to look it over again later. I will retract that statement for now.

       Yes, clearly Comey tanked her campaign because of his great bias towards her.

       Even if Stzork was biased for her he wasn't the one making  the final decisions on the case.

       Also these texts JUST came out, the investigation started nearly a year ago; so no that isn't cognitive dissonance.

       There were people searching for a path forward well before the 2016 election and most were well aware that things had been bungled fantastically for corporate greed. Trump wasn't elected because of a war of attrition, he was elected because he found the lowest common denominator in American politics and exploited it for his own benefit. My operating assumption is that he did the same with Russia, if nothing but for the fact of what a terrible piece of shit he has always been. His election has created such disturbance that it might be difficult to remember Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party, but acting like people are suddenly blaming Russia for all of our problems is bullshit.

       If your car's air conditioning is out, the windows don't roll up and you have a gas leak, you'll certainly be working towards fixing those issues. But if someone comes along and throws a match under the car, you might have to prioritize your concerns. The Trump presidency is that open flame.

       Because Combetta destroyed those emails presumably on an order that he had already received before the subpoena. Obviously that's not an excuse for him, but they gave him immunity to testify, so he didn't get charged. He basically took the blame without having to actually take the fall. As sketchy as that sounds, no one is able to specifically tie Clinton to his decision to destroy the emails after the subpoena. And as far as Clinton knew, those emails were already destroyed before the subpoena, so there was no reason for her to prevent it.

       The FBI is in the Executive Branch, the President is the Chief Executive of the Executive branch. So yes, Trump is in effect Comey’s boss. The President has authority over the FBI, that’s why Trump was able to fire him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Asking the head of the FBI to clarify to the public that he personally wasn’t under investigation is completely reasonable given the climate. Comey even admitted in his testimony that a great deal of reporting on Trump Russia was either outright false or grossly exaggerated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comey also stated in his testimony Trump stated that the investigation was a good thing and if anyone involved with the campaign was guilty of wrongdoing that it should be brought to light, Comey acknowledged Trump said that, you can read it in his testimony transcript. Trump asked that Comey clarify that he personally wasn’t under investigation, which was true according to Comey’s own testimony and which is completely reasonable given that at the time it was peak Russia hysteria and there was a new sensational headline near daily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think Trump put in his release “while I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions that I am not personally under investigation...”
      </p>
      <p>
       He put that in there to get it on record that Comey acknowledged he wasn’t personally under investigation and if Comey had just issued a clarification when requested, he wouldn’t have been fired. He got fired for refusing a reasonable request multiple times, by the head of of executive branch, that the FBI operates in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously every day was a new crack pot Russia headline, you’ve been informed you’re personally not under investigation, you want the public to know so that the media swirl of bs dies down, and the one guy who can clarify the situation for the public has refused to the three times you’ve asked him to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clarifying that he wasn’t personally under investigation wasn’t asking him to be a mouthpiece. It was asking him to help stem the tide of reporting that Comey freely admits, was mostly outright false.
