    <div class="md"><p>That is a shill slide tactic.</p>

<p>Pedophilia is inherent in the population and that is sad and there are a lot of things we can do to aid that situation.</p>

<p>The conspiracy community is more concerned with the aspect of organized pedophilia, where multiple pedophiles are working together and have provided a vast framework for forensic interruption to get away with their crimes.</p>

<p>At all costs, they cover up the extent of the crimes of people in their circles. One minor charge, like Anthony Weiner, will stick to protect the public from the truth.</p>

<p>A close facsimile is Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky... the least of Clinton&#39;s crimes gets him impeached, but we never enter the realm, in public debate, about the cooperation between the intelligence community and organized crime. He will be remembered for Lewinsky, when he should be remembered for a countless number of other scandals, starting with the Prison Blood Scandal all the way up to billions being stolen from Haiti relief money.</p>

<p>In the mainstream news, child rapists are barely a bi-line, while &quot;sexual harassers&quot; are taking all of the limelight. This is the clue that should give every normal person pause.</p>

<p>The ENTIRE NEWS CONSTRUCT is protecting and silencing stories about child rape.</p>

<p>Does it sound insane to say that there are violent, satanic, cannibal cults running around torturing and eating people? They want it to, but the truth is the Ripper Crew was a real thing. The mainstream media wants you to think that stories like this are fiction.</p>

<p>The justice system wants you to believe the False Memory Syndrome Foundation carries weight, even though there are no studies to back up their claims. In fact, it is the opposite.</p>

<p>So, when the FBI and the justice system, along with the news wants to pretend that <strong>protected political pedophilia</strong> isn&#39;t a thing.</p>

<p>According to a study of 2,709 members of the American Psychological Association; it was found that 30 percent had seen cases of ritual or religion- related abuse and 93% of the professionals believed that ritualized abuse occurred.</p>

<p>In 1992, a survey of the membership of the ISSTD, Nancy Perry concluded that 88% of 1185 mental health professionals reported belief in ritual abuse.</p>

<p>So, why aren&#39;t we doing anything about it? Because the government and the media both want you to believe that this stuff isn&#39;t happening and is just part of a &quot;Satanic Panic.&quot;</p>

<p>Point being, the fundamental issue isn&#39;t the existence of pedophiles. It is the existence of a cooperative network of pedophiles that have influence in media and in the government.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t see that I came here to stop some garbage about Doug Jones being called a pedo with no evidence to back it, I&#39;m not sure what else to say. You have your little plan of attack, that you think is so clever, all planned out and apparently cannot converse in an honest manner.

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s try this again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, I think it sounds like you are fine with hiding elite pedophilia until the victims are decades old and able to call the FBI and the press on their own accord. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of the circumstantial evidence from when Moore&#39;s abuse was occurring <strong>was third party observation of strange and suspicious behavior</strong>. If those folks had gone to the authorities, an investigation likely would have resulted, and many of those girls may not have been abused.</p>

<p>That is exactly what we see in pizzagate- a lot of strange and suspicious behavior that I believe warrants an investigation. I think it is telling that you feel it is best to ignore strange and suspicious behavior and wait thirty years for the (possible) victims to come forward. </p>
