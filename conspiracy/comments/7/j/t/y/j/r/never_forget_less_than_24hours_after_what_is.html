       First of all, they didn't report 59 dead at first. Like with any mass shootings, the numbers are always off, then they balloon, and finally they come back down.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really think this is evidence, please find any source that says 59 dead within a couple of hours of the shooting.

       Tldr; Using an estimate of expected mortality rate for age range 1-64, we should expect that out of the 23,000 involved ~53 deaths should be expected. It's only been 3 months and we have already exceeded it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on a 2014 study, the mortality rate of the US by ages [&lt;25, 25-44, 44-64, &gt;65] is [1.6, 4.6, 20.2, 73.6]. The only assumption I make is that in 2017 the US mortality rate for (44+) falls and for (&lt;44) to increase. So for 2017 we get a mortality rate(by age range) of [2, 5, 20, 73].
      </p>
      <p>
       The approximate 0.0083 mortality rate applies to all ages. So if the ages of the music festival attendees(approx 23000 involved) were evenly distributed, you would expect 194 deaths by next year; but those that attended the concerts were most likely younger than 65. (If 65+ accounts for approx. 73% of all deaths, then anyone younger only contributes 27%)
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the estimate for all ages (194) and multiply it by the mortality rate(27%) of the age range that attend the concert. You get an estimate of 53 deaths by years end for the concert attendees.
      </p>
      <p>
       In conclusion, we have already exceeded the expected 50-56 deaths (95% CI) and it isn't even 2018 yet.

Not saying nobody died in vegas just big lack of evidence collected and lack of actual investigation unless you include filong fresh bullet holes with tar days after an investigation.

       I really hate this. I understand banning them, but why hide what they said? Are we really not adult enough to read certain words? Especially when any one of us could be banned for saying the wrong thing, wouldn't it be helpful if we knew what type of things get us banned? Yes yes the rules on the side, but that doesn't give us any idea regarding moderator discretion. Not your personal problem though, thanks for keeping the place civil

       5.56 and .223 are dimensionally identical and the velocities are generally within 50ft/sec between these rounds.

       5.56 is not "deadlier". If all you know about guns came from video games, keep your mouth shut about them.

       Not necessarily. I mean, you could summarize it. Mostly I'm curious about the "holy fuck" part. Like did the user post a malicious link or go on a ridiculous rant or what? I'm quite curious.

       5.56 generates more pressure, which is why the 5.56 needs a chamber that can handle that pressure. You can shoot a 5.56 in a .223 barrel but the gun is not built to handle that kind of extra pressure, it's well known among gun enthusiasts and hunters. .223 is a weaker round, period. Guess I should have known better than to expect people of Reddit to know the basics. This isn't even a debate, I wouldn't shoot a one eyes limping squirrel with a .223, the fact remains that it isn't a very effective round

       Didn't realize you're a cop, that's very telling. In that case, I better go stock up more on 5.56 green tips, You cops should know all about the capabilities of those ;)

       Thanks for the article, didn't realize how similar they are. Doesn't change my opinion that it's a shit round that pinholes targets. 5.56 can carry heavier grains, making it deadlier. Both are extremely small rounds in the rifle world. The original comment was about how a rifle should have done more damage to the crowd. My response was that it is a light and ineffective round. You saw the need to try to flex your knowledge on the subject and started comparing 223 to 5.56, which was a tiny portion of what my comment was about. You went about it like a douchebag too. This sort of thing leads to anti-cop sentiment.
