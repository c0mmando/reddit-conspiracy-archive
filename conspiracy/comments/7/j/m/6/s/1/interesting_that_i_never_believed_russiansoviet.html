       part of it was eye-witnessing how shitty people treated me and each other in US. I noticed that mass media in US constantly stirred hate, aggression, anger whereas even in Soviet Union it was more pacifist.

       My younger brother was born in Moscow in 1960 when I was a kid,  and we came to the US in 61.   It was culture shock,  and I can relate to what you might feel.    But there was a big change in the US when JFK was killed,  and I started doubting the US propaganda.    But after 9/11 I have hated this country.   At least Russia woke up,  as fu..d up as it was and is.

       yes. US/western system is more sophisticated, Soviet system was blatant propaganda that was easy to spot even for the average person. I also think US is much more brutal than Russia/Soviet Union in its ways.

       the point about economic-ideology-as-religion is a really interesting topic - in my worldview mankind is inherently religious (not only in terms of how we think and behave but metaphysically) so in a very meaningful sense the entire history of the post-Enlightenment era has been the transfer of religious belief from the spiritual to the material, or from the belief in a higher power to the belief that Man
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a higher power (not that this doesn't open other cans of worms  concerning the blurring of lines between religious and political institutions)

       This isn’t the handsmaid tale. The country is diverse. If you don’t want to live with southern mouth breathers that tote guns and the Bible move to one of the liberal hot beds where people don’t give a shit about your moral core as long as you bring something to the table economically or socially. If that doesn’t please you there are many cities and towns that don’t adhere to these polar extremes.

      <p>
       Yeah the fed has been looting power and deceiving to maintain it. But the country is made up of people like you and I. To go on an emotionally charged rant against the USA while somehow viewing Russia as a “woke” state is so backwards. It clearly displays how uninformed you are about the economic fallout that the USSR collapse caused and the power vacuum it created in the area.

       What I mean by woke in regards to Russia is they know their oligarchs have been lying to them and playing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US isn't woke in the same way because in the US people are much more still under the spell of the two party system,  still under the spell of the ideology of exceptionalism,  still sweeping the truth under the carpet BIG TIME in a thousand ways that Russian people are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       We fall for hating Muslims,  we fall for hating Russians,  we fall for hating whoever we are told to hate,  meanwhile we hide from the truth that our government has become a genocidal war criminal,  our country has become a rogue state.    Yeah,  we were that also during Vietnam,  but we should have learned from that.    We should have learned from the lies that got us into Afghanistan,  Iraq,  Libya,  Syria,  etc.  etc.  etc.  but we did not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying that the US hasn't done some GREAT things,  it has,  but since 9/11 it hasn't and its pretending it did.    So its time to stand up and call bs what it is:   BS!!!!!

       You think Lenin was enlightened ? You do realize he referred to anyone who opposed the Marxist state as an insect that needed to be exterminated. A lot of people place blame on Stalin for many of the atrocities that occurred during the Soviet era, but if you read the Gulag Archipelago or research into a lot of the actions of Lenin, it becomes obvious that he laid the groundwork for a lot of the killings that went on in soviet Russia.

       Reading comprehension is getting to be a lost art.   Read what I said again,  a little more slowly.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The old Soviet ideology was more like a religion than I realized. Beliefs, taboos, sins, rewards, hypocrisy, suppression of truth.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       yes,  in this communist ideology,  Lenin,  also Marx,  were considered to be enlightened humans,   towering geniuses.   Based on that,   in the Soviet Union,  they ruthlessly promoted science and industry,  transforming Russia from an agricultural fuedal society of Czar Nicholas in 1917 to one of the most industrialized countries in Europe by the 50's.    At an inexcusably huge cost,  with mass genocide of their own people.    It was complicated though,  by a real fear that the US would do to them what it did in Nagasaki and Hiroshima,  the targeted audience of which was as much Stalin as it was Hirohito.   As the United States dropped its atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, 1.6 million Soviet troops launched a surprise attack on the Japanese army occupying eastern Asia. Within days, Emperor Hirohito's million-man army in the region had collapsed.    US plans to drop another half dozen bombs in Japan were cancelled due to the Soviet success and the immediate surrender of Hirohito.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I think Lenin or Marx were enlightened,  or heroes?   No.   But the Soviet ideology promoted that teaching,  as much as the US ideology rests on making heroes of scum like Ollie North and Mai Lai Vietnam mass murderer Calley,  Syria mass murderer McCain,  or  Abu Gharib low lifes "who just followed orders".

       well the basic soviet propaganda was that the West was imperialist and bad. Back then (as a kid), I didn't even understand what the heck that meant. they didn't fully explain why the west was bad, so it just seemed like soviet union was anti-western for no reason other than to make its citizens lives bad. so people viewed the soviet government as bad (which in many ways it was).
      </p>
      <p>
       as an adult, i like history, so i learned a lot of it and now i realize what type of danger the west is - because its constantly looking to enslave, overtake, colonize the whole world and i realize why soviet union was so afraid of it .. ie napoleon, nazis/etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       but i still wouldn't have believed them if i never lived in the west, probbly. eye-witnessing the brutality, shittiness of americans and USA in general made me a firm believer in their evilness tho. that and all the wars of aggression in US's recent history.

       As an American, I always thought the label 'IMPERIALIST" as odd.  It made no sense to be called something archaic.  Like a misused insult that only causes a smirk.
But when considering the charge of Imperialism, I have thought how Che Guevara probably looked right at the cause of all Latin and South American misery and couldn't adequately verbalize in a creative and descriptive way how American Corporations and Business pursuits were the source of all the misery.
This Capitalism, that we champion, is our only alternative to a threat of Communists coming and stripping the wealth and possessions away from Americans and redistributing in what we interpret as unfair to those who don't deserve it.  It runs counter to the "American Dream" of going out West and striking it rich.  It is the Successful Businessman who is the hero and icon of America,
But like Hunter S. Thompson said, "the American Dream died in Las Vegas, and it continues to die every day, one American at a time."  Everyone should point their fingers at American Corporate power  This unrestrained and unregulated beast is the culprit that consumes the world for increased profits and valuation of stocks and controls our democracies.  It seduces us all with a false hope that all us little people just might be able to get a piece of the wealth.  It's Neo Feudalism.

       I think you don't understand the basic American Foreign Policy.  1. The American Government will support American Business to the right to have access to foreign markets.  2.  The Government will prohibit the development of Nuclear weapons in other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       That isn't trying to make an Empire to rule.  It's to create monopolies where America buys and owns everything.  It's not theft.  It's Capitalism.  And Capitalism, with no decent alternative economic system, is the only game we are allowed to play by the Rich and Power Brokers of this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I think its terrible.  It is Feudalism like the Dark Ages.  Except the Rich People do not get to sleep with your wife on your marriage night.  And a bunch of assholes wearing armor do not come visit the village to beat up everybody who isn't producing enough.

       I resent that you have not comprehended anything I have written.  I never mentioned we have a "right"
       <br/>
       I attempted to present to you how this US Government behaves.  It behaves this way because Rich and Powerful Americans deem it necessary to act in ways that make them all of the money so they can continue to be Rich and Powerful.  And it will be this way regardless of how American citizens vote because our government is owned by the Rich and Powerful.  And it has been this way since WW2 and will be this way until some stronger nation comes and forces us to change.  Like the Allies made Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany change, for the benefit of the whole world.

       Well, i myself, born in the late 60's in the GDR and don't want that system back. As all current or ex-political systems it had good sides and also horrible flaws but compared to the GDR living in Germany now is a lot easier and better.
      </p>
      <p>
       But i also think Russia today is not really better than the USA. Putin and his friends are also corrupt as much of the political systems in the USA. Also they both still play their cold war games but on a much smaller scale.
