       Now that Doug Jones has won I have a feeling that the allegations are going to disappear. Was it a political hitjob? Is America at the point right now that winning a Senate seat is more important than paedophilia? Are these allegations going to keep appearing from 25+ years in the past right as elections occur, then disappear? How are you allowed to accuse people of crimes in the media and not follow through with it with the law?
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw I'm not even American. It's just that the front page of Reddit has become a cesspool of lefty politics and shills in the past 2 years. Impossible to avoid this stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's nearly impossible to find any neutral fact based evidence.

       Being elected is a privilege given by the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The accusations, in their volume, were enough in this case to tip the balance of public opinion that an alleged child abuser shouldn't be elevated to the Senate.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of Trump just over a year ago, similar accusations surprisingly weren't enough.

       So civil discourse shouldn't exist and we should divide ourselves to different parts of the internet?

       Come to the_donald. You'd be surprised how many reasonable people there are. I too actually want to hear the facts. I assume he tried dating high school girls all the time, it was just different bank then. But I don't even know if there were allegations of rape. It's like no one really went into details

       Yes, I do. And the same applies to the things you describe. We think they’re true (and I do in the specific cases you mentioned) but it’s still an opinion without evidence being presented. Because there is no evidence is exactly why there has been no legal action in these cases.

       It hasn't been fully de-bunked, the only argument against it is that the mall doesn't have records that go back that far. I'll admit that it is a rumor and that with the amount of evidence it could be true or false. But it shouldn't be dismissed completely.

       (If every accusation ever made has to be officially debunked, then this country is done.)
      </p>

       I'm not saying that, I'm just saying that it can't be written off as "fake news" just because it doesn't have physical proof. Just like it can't be considered a fact without real world eveidence. The jury is still out on this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, my biggest hang-up on dismissing this story completely is that one of the main sources for this rumor was apparently a high ranking politician that had experience working with Moore in Alabama. And (before this election) there were not many high ranking Democrats working in Alabama, so most likely a fellow Republican confirmed the story to the press off the record.

       Sure thing. Colloquially, I think it's fine to use hearsay in place of rumor. The general population uses it that way. As a legal term, it relies on there not being an original source to back up the claim.

       There was evidence. When Moore sai3d he didn’t know an accuser they provided proof that he did which was verified by an independent source. Also, police in one town were literally told to keep him out of the mall for stalking teenage girls. You also have to understand Roy Moore was a state Supreme Court judge that was forced out twice.

       There's tons of circumstantial evidence. He hit on (and fucked) very young girls all the time. Someone aged 14 at the time accused him. Tons of professional who worked around him or in the same circles confirmed that there were rumours throughout his adult life that he pursued sex with underage girls. These rumours predate any serious political aspirations on his part. So, a) there seems to me to be enough of a preponderance of circumstantial evidence to assume he probably did these things and b) it would be impossible to ever say the same about me because I'm never done anything remotely similar to what he's accused of.

       Whether I'm "fine" with it is irrelevant. If I did something shitty and people became aware of it, I'd be exposing myself to criticism. The thing you're asking me whether I would be okay with experiencing -- a public attack without any evidence whatsoever -- is not what Roy Moore is experiencing.

       I'm saying the people of Alabama decided they didn't want a representative who was alleged to have committed such crimes. The electorate doesn't need a guilty verdict to change their vote.

       Don't get me wrong they are entitled to vote in whatever way they want. And they did, and I'm ok with it, it really means nothing to me as he wasn't going to be my rep. But I think it's just another move down the slope where people forget it's supposed to be "Innocent until proven guilty"

       Let me guess... you had no problem with the people that voted against Clinton because of the accusations surrounding her... that's different, right?

       How about this little gem:

       The Clinton’s have dodged so much they are guilty to me but yet I want them to come up one one charge to have it proven one way or the other. But in a court they would be presumed innocent and we’d have to prove their guilt. Even they get it. I’m allowed to make a comment on the Clintons, sorry.  And the statement I made is true about Bill, and about the Rhos s scholar program in general.

       It's so weird how he worked as a lawyer, as a judge, for so many years.

       Runs against Democrats and suddenly he diddled kids 45 years ago.
