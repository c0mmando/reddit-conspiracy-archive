<p>Isn&#39;t it obvious what I am on about? Your idea of evidence is not the same as law enforcement&#39;s. I&#39;m all for further investigation, I was replying to your comment about calling someone a pedo without any real claim. You don&#39;t have any real claim.

<p>I mean, it&#39;s not. A pizza-related map printed on a piece of cloth. Not something you would find for sale at 7/11, but it&#39;s also not something that seems so unusual that I couldn&#39;t imagine it existing.</p>

<p>So, this article is fairly misleading. The most shocking images in it are the paintings by Biljana Djurdjevic, which depict children as victims of abuse. Controversial stuff!</p>

<p>However, the paintings shown in the link aren&#39;t actually any of the ones that Tony Podesta owns or displays. If you follow the source article: <a href="http://washingtonlife.com/2015/06/05/inside-homes-private-viewing/">http://washingtonlife.com/2015/06/05/inside-homes-private-viewing/</a></p>

<p>You&#39;ll see that the work he displays by the artist are in the same style, but are fairly benign.</p>

<p>A few days ago, you said this:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;kek will cure&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t understand what this means, so I assume &quot;kek&quot; is code for raping children. Why do you think that raping children will cure?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, Tony&#39;s favorite piece &quot;Arch of Hysteria&quot; pose one that Jeffery Dahmer was quite fond of too.</p>

<p>Could you provide a source that this piece was inspired by Jeffrey Dahmer? In all of the interviews with the artist I found, she describes it as a representation of the ancient concept of hysteria, transposed to a male form. But if you&#39;ve found another primary source that says otherwise, I&#39;d love to see it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He certainly does! So which of his proven interests are illegal? I&#39;ll wait for your sources.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because it IS code. It&#39;s malformed from &quot;lol&quot;</p>

<p>His murder victims often posed that way is not enough to show his intrigue? I don&#39;t need to repost those pics.</p>

We&#39;re definitely seeing code speak here, and Tony&#39;s art interests support intrigue with the macabre.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because it IS code. It&#39;s malformed from &quot;lol&quot;</p>

<p>What does &quot;LOL&quot; mean? I found reference that it means &quot;love our lolis,&quot; so you&#39;re not doing a very good job proving that your use of the &quot;kek&quot; code word doesn&#39;t reference deviant behavior. Also, it seems like &quot;kek&quot; comes from 4chan, a place well-known as a place people go to for child porn.</p>

<p>How would you define something as pizza related, then?</p>

<p>How often did he pose them this way? You don&#39;t need to post pics, a police report would be fine enough.</p>

<p>What leads you to this conclusion?</p>

<p>Just watch the whole thing and tell me you think she is a definitive source for the claim. She concedes it was all rumors and no complaints ever occurred in the police department and all the rumors were that he liked girls in their 20s no rumors even about girls younger. Makes no sense and she is super shifty eyed the whole interview. Not confident in claims at all and by end of video completely backed on her claims she said about rumors. </p>

<p>I might be wrong here but if my memory serves right:</p>

<p>In the US: plaintiff must prove the statements were false</p>

<p>In England: defendant must prove statements were true</p>

<p>Will look up and edit when I get home if I’m wrong</p>

<p>And just to be clear, I’m not saying I believe or don’t believe, I’m saying the evidence just doesn’t exist because we would have seen it if it did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the U.S. public figures have to show that the media knew it was false or recklessly disregarded the truth and printed it anyway. I&#39;m not sure if an accuser counts as a public figure though. Normally I would say she fits the bill of someone who &quot;have thrust themselves to the forefront of particular controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved.&quot; But she&#39;s an alleged victim of child rape, so the courts might not view her as a public figure.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, after a quick google search, <a href="https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/alabama-statutes-of-limitations-for-sexual-abuse.html">it seems like Alabama has some of the shortest statutes of limitations in the US</a>.</p>

<p>The girl who was 14 at the time might still be able to bring criminal charges, though not civil. </p>

<p>That said, civil charges are brought by an accuser to the accused. Criminal charges are filed by the state on behalf of the accuser. So it&#39;s really up to the state of Alabama to pursue the case and the accuser doesn&#39;t have much of a say in it if they decide not to.</p>

<p>But by turning personal and branding the women liars, Trump has perhaps unwittingly played into a cutting-edge strategy in the legal pursuit of sexual misconduct — claims of defamation such as those used against comedian Bill Cosby and in a lesser-known New York case, argued by two lawyers who are now representing Zervos.</p>

<p>In Alabama, there are no longer statute of limitations for child sex crimes <em>now</em>. Unfortunately, this only applies to crimes committed before 1985 (as stated in <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/alison/codeofalabama/1975/15-3-5.htm">this law</a>). Since Moore&#39;s accusations are from the 70s, there is a statute of limitations and it has expired. There&#39;s no way any of the accusations could go to civil or criminal court.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/11/roy_moore_could_alabama_senate_1.html">Here is an article explaining, if you feel like ignoring the link directly to the law above or further ignoring the variety of times I have linked to the facts in elsewhere in this post.</a></p>

Their job was to get justice the one way they could (if the allegations are true). Of course they will disappear now, there&#39;s nothing they could possibly do. There is no justice for them, so why stick around? Just to accuse Roy Moore of Bering a pedofile Everytime his nurse wipes his ass?</p>

<p>Point being, them disappearing after the election does no prove the claims were false. Stop acting like it does. There are no possible actions left for them besides accusing him untill the end of his days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the U.S. public figures have to show that the media knew it was false or recklessly disregarded the truth and printed it anyway. I&#39;m not sure if an accuser counts as a public figure though. Normally I would say she fits the bill of someone who &quot;have thrust themselves to the forefront of particular controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved.&quot; But she&#39;s an alleged victim of child rape, so the courts might not view her as a public figure.  </p>
