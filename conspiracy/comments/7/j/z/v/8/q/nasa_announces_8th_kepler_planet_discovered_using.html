       So here's the link to the story.

       They used an AI (Google to analyze) distinctive brightening and dimming patterns caused by exoplanets orbiting paths coming between us and their star.
      </p>
      <p>
       Big official story is that an AI did the analysis and technically made the discovery. But maybe there's a bit more they're not telling us?
      </p>
      <p>
       The 8 planet system had a very distinct pattern of brightening and dimming. One that was immediately noticed by the Google AI. Maybe there was something about that pattern that made it really stand out to a computer?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll suggest the possibility that the "octave pattern" created by the 8 different planetary transits could comprise a repeating message with 8-fold (8 bit?) encoding.
      </p>
      <p>
       System created as a message from (or monument to) a Kardashev level 3 civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusion: Alien contact at last... just not the way we expected?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm wrong, this would still be a great way to transmit a message over astronomical distances and periods of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's see what I can come up with tomorrow.

       There has been many people talking and predicting a body of mass, albeit small, smaller than the moon, orbiting our solar system, some like gurdjieff called it anulios, all because it would be consistent with the law of octave hypothesis.

       Two observations about this. Firstly, those creepy deceivers at NASA won't let you access that link in your post if you are using a proxy...why? NASA and Google working together is a relationship that no sane person would trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, this is  a planetary system 2,545 light years away is an almost incomprehensible distance for humans. It's meaningless in real terms. Our fastest space ship would take over 50,000,000 years to travel that distance (based on the fact that it would take 20,000 Earth years for a spaceship to travel a distance of a single light year).

       ...And we put together an expedition to go check it out. We get there, and the civilization has destroyed itself. The natives are just starting to rub sticks together again. So, it is decided just to observe their development. Tie it in to what we have happening here with ufos, zoo hypothesis stuff. I would read the shit out of that haha.

       By doing it this way, we don't get the message until we're advanced enough to recognize and interpret it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the movie Contact, the message contained the instructions on how to send a reply. I doubt that a real message would be how to send Jodie Foster into hyperspace. But it would be the most important message in all of history.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many possibilities on how people would react. Believe it or not. Fake, it's real or it's real... but it's some kind of trick. Keep it secret vs let some people know vs let everyone know.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be fun if there was a real message just to see how it would all actually play out.
