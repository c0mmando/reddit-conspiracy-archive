        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So here&#39;s the link to the story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/artificial-intelligence-nasa-data-used-to-discover-eighth-planet-circling-distant-star">https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/artificial-intelligence-nasa-data-used-to-discover-eighth-planet-circling-distant-star</a></p>

<p>They used an AI (Google to analyze) distinctive brightening and dimming patterns caused by exoplanets orbiting paths coming between us and their star.</p>

<p>Big official story is that an AI did the analysis and technically made the discovery. But maybe there&#39;s a bit more they&#39;re not telling us?</p>

<p>The 8 planet system had a very distinct pattern of brightening and dimming. One that was immediately noticed by the Google AI. Maybe there was something about that pattern that made it really stand out to a computer?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll suggest the possibility that the &quot;octave pattern&quot; created by the 8 different planetary transits could comprise a repeating message with 8-fold (8 bit?) encoding.</p>

<p>System created as a message from (or monument to) a Kardashev level 3 civilization. </p>

<p>Conclusion: Alien contact at last... just not the way we expected?</p>

<p>If I&#39;m wrong, this would still be a great way to transmit a message over astronomical distances and periods of time. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s see what I can come up with tomorrow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two observations about this. Firstly, those creepy deceivers at NASA won&#39;t let you access that link in your post if you are using a proxy...why? NASA and Google working together is a relationship that no sane person would trust.</p>

<p>Secondly, this is  a planetary system 2,545 light years away is an almost incomprehensible distance for humans. It&#39;s meaningless in real terms. Our fastest space ship would take over 50,000,000 years to travel that distance (based on the fact that it would take 20,000 Earth years for a spaceship to travel a distance of a single light year).  </p>

So, it is decided just to observe their development. Tie it in to what we have happening here with ufos, zoo hypothesis stuff. I would read the shit out of that haha.</p>

<p>Speaking of ACC, this cigar asteroid flying through our solar system right now reminds me of Rendezvous with Rama. God that guy could write.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By doing it this way, we don&#39;t get the message until we&#39;re advanced enough to recognize and interpret it.</p>

<p>In the movie Contact, the message contained the instructions on how to send a reply. I doubt that a real message would be how to send Jodie Foster into hyperspace. But it would be the most important message in all of history.</p>

<p>There are many possibilities on how people would react. Believe it or not. Fake, it&#39;s real or it&#39;s real... but it&#39;s some kind of trick. Keep it secret vs let some people know vs let everyone know. </p>

<p>It would be fun if there was a real message just to see how it would all actually play out.</p>

<p>I feel trying to entwine a <em>hypothetical</em> man made hierarchy of a behaviour of something we have never observed (aliens) is pointless. There <em>is</em> a beauty  to the concept of your post, and I do like it. But the level of speculation is beyond wild. As a conspiracy theory, I do not give it much credence. As a sci-fi franchise, however, it could be a true great with the right treatment.</p>
