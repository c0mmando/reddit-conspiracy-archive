<blockquote>
<p>Around <strong>90 per cent</strong> of weapons and ammunition 
(97 per cent and 87 per cent, respectively) 
deployed by IS forces are Warsaw Pact calibres—
<strong>originating primarily in China, Russia, and 
Eastern European producer states.</strong></p>

<p><strong>NATO-calibre 
weapons and ammunition are far less prevalent, 
comprising 3 per cent and 13 per cent of the 
total</strong>, respectively; although these proportions 
are low, IS forces captured significant quantities 
of NATO weaponry during initial assaults on Iraqi 
forces in 2014. </p>

<p><strong>Russia and China, combined, manufactured 
more than 50 per cent of the weapons and 
ammunition held by IS forces</strong>. Former Warsaw 
Pact countries that are now EU Member States 
manufactured a significant proportion of the 
remaining materiel (more than 30 per cent of 
weapons and 20 per cent of ammunition). </p>

<p>The origins of the weapons that IS forces deploy 
in Iraq differ from those of the materiel they 
use in Syria. China produced the majority of the 
materiel (weapons and ammunition combined) 
fielded by the group in both countries. However, 
Russian-manufactured weapons outnumber 
Chinese weapons deployed by IS forces in Syria presumably reflecting Russian supplies to the 
Syrian regime. Many of the group’s weapons 
mirror those of the two regimes in its respective 
countries of operation. These findings support 
widespread assumptions that the group initially 
captured much of its military materiel from Iraqi 
and Syrian government forces.</p>

<p>IS forces have relied on a steady stream of 
commercial products and explosive goods 
to construct unprecedented numbers of 
IEDs. Turkish territory is the main—although 
not exclusive—source of chemical explosive 
precursors (ammonium nitrate, potassium 
nitrate, aluminium paste, and sorbitol), 
detonating cord, detonators, containers used 
to house IED main charges, and ancillary IED 
components employed by IS forces. CAR has 
identified specific parties responsible for 
purchasing these components on the Turkish 
market and for supplying a range of opposition 
forces in northern Syria, including Salafist 
jihadist factions.</p>

<p>Following added per request of <a href="/u/TilapiaTale">/u/TilapiaTale</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Between 23 and 28 September 2017, CAR 
documented 122 Chinese Type 81 7.62 x 
39 mm light machine guns and 61 Chinese 
Type 67-2 7.62 x 54R mm medium machine 
guns, recovered from an IS cache in the Al 
Shura district, south of Mosul. Iraqi forces 
recaptured the area in October 2016. The 
serial numbers of the weapons are either 
in sequence (that is, 1, 2, 3), or close in 
sequence (such as 1, 3, 6), and indicate 
production in 2007 and 2008.</p>

<p><strong>One to three 
pouches filled with powder were affixed 
to each weapon. Presumptive analysis 
revealed that the powder was a performance-
enhancing amphetamine.</strong> The close serial 
number sequencing of 122 identical weapons 
indicates a large diversion from a single 
intended end user. It is clear that, following 
acquisition, IS forces had stockpiled the 
weapons together with individual rations of 
performance-enhancing drugs for issue to its 
fighters</p>

<p>Over the last seven years, several billion dollars’ worth of armament has been illegally introduced into Syria – a fact which in itself is enough to disprove the myth according to which this war is a democratic revolution. Numerous documents attest to the fact that the traffic was organised by General David Petraeus, first of all in public, via the CIA, of which he was the director, then privately, via the financial company KKR with the aid of certain senior civil servants. Thus the conflict, which was initially an imperialist operation by the United States and the United Kingdom, became a private capitalist operation, while in Washington, the authority of the White House was challenged by the deep state. New elements now show the secret rôle of Azerbaïdjan in the evolution of the war.</p>

<p>It is an open secret the US government fund these &quot;terror&quot; groups.</p>

<p>Rep. Thomas Massie, and Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard even tried to get the “Stop Arming Terrorists Act” bill passed that would prohibit any federal agency from supporting a terrorist group or funneling support through other countries that directly or indirectly support terror groups, this is well know how the CIA operate, I am actually surprised they didn&#39;t put a bullet in her tbh</p>

<p>More than $900 million has been contracted to be spent by 2022, and nearly $600 million more has been budgeted or requested by the Trump administration. This brings the grand total of the Pentagon’s intended spending on its Syrian allies to $2.2 billion.</p>
