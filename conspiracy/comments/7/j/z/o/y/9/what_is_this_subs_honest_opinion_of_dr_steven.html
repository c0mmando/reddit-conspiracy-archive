       Yup.  I watched the whole goddamn 3hr 50min lecture he gave in 2015.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHxGQjirV-c">

       Yes, I have too much free time, I know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, some of his revelations are literally mind-blowing.  Like how Marilyn Monroe was assassinated because she was about to blab to the press what JFK and RFK had told her about UFOs and the CIA during pillow talks (yup, she slept with both of them).  And he's got documents to prove all of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's the only one who really lays out the entire take over of the government by the military industrial complex from initial encounters with Foo Fighters (not the band but the glowing balls that flew around WW2 planes) all the way to the late 60's when they've completely taken over with Special Access Programs.  AND! He backs everything up with what looks like genuine CIA or military documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       But on the other hand, the way he talks... The way he brags about who and who he convinced, who offered him $2 billion to stay silent, the way he talks as if EVERY technology we have came from crashed UFOs and are alien tech, including fiber optics... I just don't know.  He seems way too ostentatious.  Seems like he's occupied with self-promotion than anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think?  Is he credible?

You probably should know I don't believe in space aliens. Although I have watched a few of his videos thought the years.

       Well, he does say that 99% of UFO sightings are man-made objects.  Of course, he says those objects were made using alien tech.  Curious.  How do you explain Foo Fighters?

       Have you read /listened to Bill Cooper? He first actively disseminated the UFO materials and only later realized that he was used, that the alien stuff was fabricated, a masterful psy-op. Read his book (see below), here's his
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EG3Cn1D5Uk">
        1999 "lost" interview
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Cooper, Behold a Pale Horse, 1991
       </em>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        During his first year in office, 1953, at least 10 more crashed discs were recovered along with 26 dead and 4 live aliens. Of the 10,4 were found in Arizona, 2 in Texas, 1 in New Mexico, 1 in Louisiana, 1 in Montana, and 1 in South Africa. There were hundreds of sightings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eisenhower knew that he had to wrestle and beat the alien problem. He knew that he could not do it by revealing the secret to the Congress, Early in 1953 the new President turned to his friend and fellow member of the Council on Foreign Relations Nelson Rockefeller. Eisenhower and Rockefeller began planning the secret structure of alien-task supervision, which was to become a reality within one year. The idea for MJ-12 was thus born.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was Nelson's uncle Winthrop Aldrich who had been crucial in convincing Eisenhower to run for President. The whole Rockefeller family and with them, the Rockefeller empire, had solidly backed Ike. Eisenhower belonged heart and soul to the Council on Foreign Relations and the Rockefeller family. Asking Rockefeller for help with the alien problem was to be the biggest mistake Eisenhower ever made for the future of the United States and maybe for humanity.
       </p>
       <p>
        p. 234:
(5) There is always the possibility that I was used, that the whole alien scenario is the greatest hoax in history designed to create an alien enemy from outer space in order to expedite the formation of a one-world government. I have found evidence that this could be true. I have included that evidence in the Appendix. I advise you to consider this scenario as being probable

       Interesting.  According to Greer, Eisenhower was completely locked out of the UFO tech research.  That by his Presidency, the deep state had already gained control of the govt.

       Unique personality. Trained as a medical doctor and now for several years he has spent almost all of his time talking to career military officers. These are both extreme types of personalities but close to orthogonal axes. You could live your entire life and not meet another person like him.

       I do think it's truth mixed with lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the fiber optics claim does indeed hold up. In the book, the day after Roswell, Lt Col Philip Corso (head of the R&amp;D division and directly reported to General Trudeau) explains how the Roswell coverup was indeed a coverup and a UFO craft did in fact crash. He goes on to say that fiber optics, Kevlar, night vision, and some other technologies are a result of the crashed craft they recovered.

       I do think Greer says some truths but I think he may be a gate keeper

       Hmm, I don't know dude.  Fiber optics only work because of lasers.  Lasers only work because of our success in understanding eletromagnetic radiation.  And so on and so on.  To say that fiber optics suddenly was possible because of a crashed UFO is ignoring every major scientific advancement we've had over the last century and their creator.

       Personally I always take Greer out of the picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       His national press club conference in 2001 months before 9/11 with dozens of military/intelligence officials testifying and willing to testify under oath to congress as well always struck me as credible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Graham Bethune spoke and he has my personal favorite UFO encounter ever.

       No.  I think this is his career and he's in it for money.  He went from wanting to bring this suppressed technology to the public to being some new age hippy holding seances in the desert to try and contact ET.  The one thing he hasnt changed is collecting fees to speak at conventions or writing books for cash.

       Disinfo-shill-cia was my impression when I looked into him. He takes people out on retreats to spot aliens. And if the aliens don't detect any bad thoughts in any of you they will make themselves apparent. Watched him also talk to a group of people in a circle, and all he does is try to control the narrative, denies what others offer in conversation, and continuously dominates the people around him.
The fact that he headed up the disclosure project, and that so many politicians and ex-military were involved, and that he's an obvious (to me) bullshitter just made me think the entire thing is a psy-op. Distraction. This leads me to believe that we don't have any real evidence of alien visitation and that the entire story is gov. propaganda, primarily to spook other nations into thinking america is allied with aliens, and secondly to keep conspiracy theorists looking under the wrong rocks.
But like, that's just my opinion man.

       Well, just a simple search on Youtube will give you hundreds and hundreds of videos of him talking about various subjects.  But the one I linked is kinda special because it goes from the very beginning of UFO encounters all the way to how the Deep State controls the government with corporate cabals.  So, ya, if you ever have the time, you should check the whole thing out.  It really shows how one thing led to another, then another, and so on to the present.

       Only one question for you.  Everyone in 2011 had their phones on them at all times.  Why didn't you record or photograph the object?  I'm not doubting you.  But also, that buddy that you had that smoke with, where is he?  Why isn't he collaborating your story?

       But that makes no sense.  We know exactly how the laser was invented.  By streaming light thru ruby.  It's development literally crawled towards usage in CD players for 4 decades until we could harness it.  If what Greer is saying is true, then we should have had the tech much faster without all the intermitten steps that was required for us to get the cd player.

       The wait of time involves the filtering through the military industrial complex out into commercial application. Sure mankind made some great technological strides but we need to remember this kind of technology has been around and rediscovered over and over through the ages. Benjamin Franklin is often credited with "the invention of electricity" when in reality, ancient Egypt shows signs of electrical knowledge and application.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of technology is sifted through the military and military industrial complex and then brought to commercial avenues where it is developed and forged into consumer application.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is well documented. While some of this tech may have already existed, ET crashes really facilitated and gave the inventions some much needed momentum.

       Either way I do think Greer may be a gatekeeper in a sense and might be releasing some truths mixed with disinfo given from the CIA seeing as he has admitted to visiting them.

       But all I can really do is speculate and conjecture. I am curious why there are 5,000 secret patents and I wonder what they are if they are to have such status.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowing the human factor, greed, service to self, etc it's not far to imagine that a lot of these patents could tremendously help humanity and fundamentally change the way we live as a species. This is held back from us because of power over others and wanting to control and profit and own and blah blah blah. I'm sure a handful of those patents could single handedly decimate the power industry and free up tremendous strain on the planet.

       Imo after watching days worth of interviews, documentaries and presentations by Greer and Schneider, I gotta say that I think they're both on the same page. The level and extent of subversion of all major institutions is incomprehensible and when that is fully understood, it shines a pretty fucking bright light on all that Greer and Schneider speak of. Let's also not forget that things Schneider mentioned may not even be known by Greer. The compartmentalization of these programs is insane. If you need any more proof that what greer states about the deep level subversion of institutions is true, look into Dane Wiggington and his campaign to expose weather modification. Another cause which receives constant attemots to discredit and debunk, but is also based off of sound, irrefuteable facts. The kicker, he also cites(and proves) deep level institutional subversion.
      </p>
      <p>
       People always cited these people as scammers asking for money but the fact of the matter is that if theyre to be taken seriously and advance their campaign, funds are necessary. If none are available, your productions look awful (and are discredited based off of that), you have no means to continue promoting (and are discredited based off of that), and you open yourself up to quick undermining. For instance, just because Greer (a former meditation instructor and founder of CE5 protocol) charges willing individuals for outings does not mean that he's a scam. Learn some meditation and actually practice the CE5 protocol. I was just as skeptical and decided to give it a shot, nearly shit my pants when I first made contact. Remember, there are things in this reality that are far stranger than what weve been told to believe. Start connecting dots folks...
