       Sources? I was looking into Geffen a while ago, and it seems tht he is so wealthy and powerful that no one dares speak out against him. It's widely acknowledged that he heads the Velvet Mafia (gay mafia) in Hollywood, but beyone that, I have not seen a lot in the way of pedo allgations. If you have some, dish the dirt.

        What former A+ list actor who is currently starring in a franchise but in the past has starred in two other franchises, like another franchise actor from a previous BI, is consulting with his lawyers about coming forward about that billionaire mogul raping him several decades ago? Jeremy Renner/ David Geffen
       </p>
       <p>
        The Financier: Back in the day, he was an actor. A fairly successful child actor. As he started getting a little older, he played the game the way he was told. When he wasn't old enough to drive he was hooking up with that A list movie producer and that A list mostly movie director that keeps popping up. He spent most of his time though with a guy who taught him about money while also having sex with him. I say sex, but our actor was not yet legal so lets call it what it is - rape. The money guy schooled our actor on how to make money. Meanwhile, the actor was also used to bring in young male actors for the sick fantasies of the previously mentioned and also the sick fantasies of investors. I can't tell you how many child and teen actors ended up dead from drugs or booze or just suicide because of these a-holes. It hasn't stopped. Things have just slightly changed. The mentor of the actor has to lay low all the time now. He is always watched by authorities. The actor though can move freely. He makes a ton of money which is used to finance movies for the director and the producer. Almost every movie they change the name of the finance company to keep people off the trail. Where do they get the money? Politicians, executives and anyone else who wants to have sex with young boys. The actor has a supply chain from acting schools and casting calls to model hunts and everything in between. The former actor uses his political connections to make people guardians of some of these boys. Can you imagine the sick f**k who knows what is going to happen to these boys but approves a guardianship for the boy to live with the guy who is going to rape them? The thing is, people have spoken up. People have complained. You know what happens? Nothing. The voice gets hammered back down. Maybe some cash changes hands. Maybe the troubled youth ends up dead. A victim of the drug crisis or gun violence. The guardian did everything they could say the stories. Gave the youth a loving home. If you go back a decade, you will see the fields of Hollywood littered with the dead bodies of actors who were victimized by this group. The deaths might be publicized but not the aftermath. None of the dead actors ever get in a memorial during Oscar or Emmy night. They just are child or teen actors who couldn't handle fame. No, they are actors who couldn't handle being raped and living their lives after years of abuse.
Actor: Brock Pierce
Director: Bryan Singer
Producer: David Geffen
       </p>
       <p>
        The Suicide: I don't usually do named blinds on the weekend. This will be quick. There needs to be an independent investigation into the recent suicide of this actor. It was way too much of a coincidence that he was talking to reporters about the permanent A+ list producer/icon and the A list mostly movie director and ended up dead a few days later. He had been involved with them from an early age. Brad Bufanda (David Geffen/Brett Ratner)
       </p>
       <p>
        The Cold Case Payouts: What do you do if you are one of the richest, most powerful men Hollywood has ever seen? Well, if someone does something you don't like and the entire world is discussing it and you, then you take matters into your own hands. Almost two decades ago, that is exactly what happened. The person who did the something the whole world was discussing was found dead. No reason was ever given. None. Every single person interviewed said the deceased person had been in perfect health and took no drugs. Every single person interviewed was shocked that the person died. This was not a nobody who died. Our powerful man in Hollywood had him killed. Six months after the death, the two police detectives who had been handling the case got themselves contracts paying them $500K a year for 5 years working for a shell company owned by the powerful man. Probably just a coincidence. Before they left the force, they made sure the case was closed and that they took anything that could possibly lead back to the powerful man. David Geffen/Tom King ("The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys and Sells the New Hollywood")

       These questions can always be answered by posing another one - why is a known sexual predator and pedophile sitting in the White House?

       The answer? Most people don't actually care, and a lot of the people that seem to care on places like reddit are only part of a propoganda campaign to take the heat off others.

       Usually you need victims or evidence to convict people.  In fact, much of the American legal system is based upon the idea that you are innocent until proven guilty.

       If you would like to start implementing a police state to suit your own biases, then that is fine, but don't expect people to start going along willingly.

       I've been thinking.  If the manhattan district attorney can be bought for just $10,000  to make a case vanish and have it publicly known, what chance do these guys have of going down? Worse case scenario, they have hundreds of millions at their disposal. More likely, they employ enforcers to save money and have more direct results like HW. I think the average joe will never know how deep the rabbit hole goes and what webs are spun down there unfortunately.

       Totally. I have no hesitation in saying that I think HW and all the others are being used as a front. Sure, I think they have been up to stuff. But take HW or Spacey. Their accusations were taken as truth and the train didnt stop from there. They came out and admitted it and the press havent stopped with it. Singer on the other hand, long rumored incidents, always swept under the carpet and we all know because he is connected to all the guys at the top of the pile. Honestly think Singer is going to disappear. Do drug riddled and cowardly. If his problems gain more traction then he is done for.

       I didn't hear of any rumours about him being a pedo but he was instrumental at undermining the punk rock indie music scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nirvana was a B grade band on Sub Pop who got signed by Geffen, then became the face of the Grunge genre in the early 90s. Cobain is still heavily idolized despite the fact that grunge music was completely made up by the major labels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Punk rock started in the 70s, and grew throughout the 80s in the counterculture. It was an anti-corporate movement started by cynical street kids using a DIY mentality. The music was usually socially and politically conscious while still being immature and tongue in cheek. The main thing is that it was run by 'street people' as opposed to guys like Geffen from their fancy offices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rumour is that Cobain was going to leave Geffen and take his music with him until his head got blown off. The media blames Courtney Love and Geffen is off the hook.

       Punk rock was started by a fashion boutique owner and his designer, both aspiring to be rock 'n' roll managers, in order to sell style. They each discovered a few street people, and created the bands that would lead the movement.

       New York had a thriving rock 'n' roll scene in the late '70s centered around CBGB. The Velvet Underground and New York Dolls inspired everyone with an artistic bone in their body to try out their own ideas. It was like garage rock in the '60s, where every kid started a band with his friends to rip off the British Invasion sound. The Ramones has a great look and the best songs. They were a big hit when they toured the U.K. Inspiring their own copycat movement there. McLaren's vision took the sound but also the style, and assaulted the mainstream. It made him rich.

       This is true for the British style of punk which differed from north American punk style. Westwood and Mclaren made up the Sex Pistols like a boy band really. At least Nirvana was a real band before Geffen got them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got into punk around the mid 80s and the general attitude is that the Sex Pistols weren't 'real' and they were kind of the gateway band people listened to before they discovered real punk.

      <p>
       The first wave stuff died off fairly quickly in the mainstream market but that influenced the guys who started the 2nd wave DIY version that wasn't made by big labels.
