       Mobile phone do work mid flight if you're over the US. They just say they're banned bc they interfere with insruments which is false it's just as way so we don't have to gear people yapping mid flight and so airlines can rape you on those in flight phones

       No they do not.  Please stop lying.  I flew 20+ times in 2016; domestically.  Only time my phones worked when I was on, or, close to the runway.  Two phones, AT&amp;T and Verizon.

       This dependent on altitude. Mobile towers are directed down so most of the power for the antenna gets directed to the surface of the planet. When a plane is low in the sky (like, say, flight 93) you can get reception pretty easily

       The cell phone calls from United 93 apparently placed by Tom Burnett, Jeremy Glick and Mark Bingham reportedly began about 40mins into the flight, at which point the aircraft would have been at its cruising altitude of around 30,000ft.

       Probably for that reason, the story was changed. David Ray Griffin has done a lot of work on this.

       Many of the calls that were first said to have come from cell phones were later said to have come from airphones, which is a problem because several of the people receiving the calls said they identified their loved ones from their caller ID.

       No. The electromechanical components and systems throughout a plane were never tested (validated) specifically for use near cell phones. Primarily because these components predate cell phones by decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       The components were tested for everything from lightning stikes, EMI, RF, microwave but never for cell phones. This is similar to medical devices. Hospitals restrict cell phone use because the medical equipment was not validated for service near cell phones.

       I have to speak up and debunk the cell phone one: it was not cell phones people were using to call from the planes! It was those phones that used to be set into the back of the airplane seats, that you could use a credit card to pay and call. Am I the only one who remembers these? I definitely believe that 9/11 was a massive inside job/conspiracy, but I'm not sure why people use the cell phone thing as evidence. (I myself didn't even have a cell phone yet in 2001, some of us were still carrying pagers around!)

       You could add in that the plane that crashed, was thought by people that were tracking it to be a military plane due to the way it moved. And the guy that apparently flew it couldn't even fly a single engine cessna, yet it is supposed to have pulled off a move most professional pilots couldn't even pull off.

       yeah they can. they're just worried about walking away from the plane after. when you don't care if you're gonna die, you can even barrel roll a 747.

       you're assuming i think the guy flying the plane was who they say it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think the planes were under remote control and the pilot couldn't do jack shit. there may not have been any terrorists on that plane at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       google "Wide Area Augmentation System" in 2000, it was capable of remote control and guidance of aircraft. United installed honeywells Pegasus flight management system in their 757s that could control the entire aircraft in 1997.
      </p>
      <p>
       honeywell also had their Differential GPS Satellite Landing System that they tested on UPS planes in 1998 that could take off and land themselves and stay within a 2x2 meter box around the planned flight path.
      </p>
      <p>
       i don't think the "terrorists" existed at all. i think the pilots fought it the entire time, and died under the control of a remote pilot sitting in a chair somewhere.

       but my original point was that a decent pilot CAN pull off those maneuvers in an airliner. i've seen pilots pull immelmanns and low level barrel rolls with a 747 at air shows. normal pilots don't try that kind of shit because they want to 1) keep a job and 2) live. i can see a suicidal pilot being able to do it too.
      </p>
      <p>
       i just don't think that
       <em>
        in this particular case
       </em>
       the pilot sitting in the cockpit was in control at all.

       If anything this guy had a better reason than anyone to drive normally and safely, dying on the way to what he allegedly considers the most important thing in his life is just stupid. Another stupid thing is attracting extra attention by doing something like this. Furthermore, the guy allegedly piloting the airplane was not a decent pilot, but an incredibly shitty one, which is why we are bringing this up. I agree it was drone though, this is the argument for why it was a drone!

       That's why they didn't know what to do when the plane headed for WTC7 got stuck in airport congestion, they weren't sure if they could still collect insurance on it if it went down from a controlled demolition with no plane in it.

       It was all a ritual with specific hours, numbers and dates arranged, it had to happen that day, the pentagon stuff appears to be hastily arranged to be announced the day before the big event was going to happen, so they could fake a hit in the place where the records were, the day of the attack we were attacked too kinda thing.  it is the sloppiest, the new york job was much better planned, with people in the streets and crisis actors and stuff

       Before every tall building in every major city around the world is build it has to hand in a building plan but also a demolition plan to my knowledge. To protect it's surrounding against eg. a earthquake or destructive fire.

       If you look at the footage, to me it very doubtfully looks like a plane explosion. Too small and a very brief flash. Not at all a fireball of death.

       Looks more like a missile.

       There is also some other interesting evidence, pictures can be found of the Pentagon with seemingly sheer 'cuts' where part of the building went down and the other side did not. It was so pristine that desks, chairs and other items remained upright despite the apparent 'collapse'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, I'm not sure if anybody is aware of this, whenever an airplane crashes anywhere in North America, in some cases even into the sea, the FAA literally collects all the pieces and puts it back together again to find out what went wrong. I'm sure we can all recall seeing the pictures of the wreckage tacked all back together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anybody remember this happening with either the Pentagon or Flight 93(which resembled more like a pile of garbage than a planecrash)? A lot of unprecedented events took place that day.

       My best friends family actually owns a cabin in Shanksville PA where United 93 went down and i talked to a bunch of locals a few years back who witnessed the plane flying extremely low and ultimately crashing. It’s in the middle of nowhere so when people saw a plane that low they New somthing was wrong. Alot of people in the town witnessed it so it’s pretty safe to say that there was actually a plane that crashed there.

       if there was anything to put back together they might have..... there's no conspiracy in whether or not a plane flew into the damn building, the conspiracy is whether or not the plane took the building down (i believe so) and whether or not the whole thing was a cover for an even bigger conspiracy such as OP's topic.

       He's talking about the Pentagon and the plane that crashed in the field in Pennsylvania, there's plenty of conspiracy around those. The planes that hit the twin towers were pretty well documented by amateur videos, so saying there were no planes is easily disproven.

       Are you? Are you an American? How about a Christian? Not one of those? I doubt it, cause you don't act like one.

       I admit I have the spirit of a child in me. But that has nothing to do with my own point of view based on my own research.

       They don't do that with terrorist attacks since they already know why the plane crashed iirc.

       I remember when I was researching 9/11 back in the day I found video that basically proved it wasn't a plan and more than likely a missile. I slowed videos down frame by frame and there were a couple frames that showed it as smaller than a plane, black, with no wings.... I'll see if I can dig that up again

       This seems like the video I saw long ago, but it seems different, like it's' missing an angle or frames or something. I specifically remember seeing a thin missile-like (definitely non-plane-like) object, but I don't see it in this one. I'll keep looking.

       There's a lot of stuff you can find still.
      </p>
      <p>
       I 'watched', more like listened, to a secret interview a guy conducted with a maintenance man from DC that apparently witnessed the Pentagon incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy was clearly afraid to speak on camera about any of it. The interviewer had to sneakily stick a phone in his pocket to record the guy talking about how he was 'spoken to'. It was probably a missile of some kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all speculation of course, I can't say I've studied the pentagon thing very deeply, spent most of my time with the towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel you can rationally prove the official story is garbage strictly based on the towers, how they were built and what jet fuel actually is(it sounds a lot nastier than it is).

       757’s are HUGE!!! A heavy aircraft like that would be near impossible to control that close to the ground at that speed. Especially for a pilot that only had only had one lesson in a Cessna 172.

       They were all absolutely terrible pilots, the best of BinLaden’s merry band of jihadists, Hanjour, was described by his instructor as such “I'm still to this day amazed that he could have flown into the Pentagon. He could not fly at all”. Meanwhile career pilots can’t pull off what Hanjour did to the Pentagon in simulators.

       I don’t think it’s crazy at all. It’s sane... very sane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at it from their perspective. You can’t hide 2 Trillion missing dollars forever. Too many people involved in that much money, even if all of them got paid, it’s unlikely they would of be able to cover that shit forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what do you do when the truth coming out is unacceptable? You make it so that the truth can never possibly come out, and even if nuggets of truth emerge, they are deniable.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s why murderers dissolve bodies in vats of acid. No body, no murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how do you make enough money that if you put it in cash it would fill the Grand Canyon “disappear”? Well, money is basically imaginary, so you don’t have to make the money disappear, you just have to make records of it disappear.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in this case, the records would have been in the Pentagon, one of the most secure installations on earth. You can’t just burgle the file by cabinet with the invoices. You have to think bigger than that. The pentagon has to burn.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there’s the problem... how do you burn down the most secure building on the planet? It can’t be done by normal means, but Rumsfeld et. al. had the literal Army at their disposal. They could just blow it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       How frustrating that must have been. They had the means to solve their problem in 5 minutes, but couldn’t just start lobbing artillery rounds at the Pentagon, so they got creative. They probably thought: “What is the best way to get away with a crime that can’t be hidden?”
      </p>
      <p>
       The mob does this all the time. They get a hit man to shoot someone, and the hit man just leaves the gun right next to the body. Why? To make it easier for the cops to close the case. If the investigation drags on, they may get unlucky and get the only honest cop on the force investigating it. And the thing is, investigations tend to uncover threads, and threads get followed, and pretty soon the boss has to worry about that one time 15 years ago that he was with the hit man at the mob office Christmas party xeroxing their drunken asses and putting it in everyone’s mailbox.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you just file off the serial number and drop the gun on the body. The cop gets to close the case, doesn’t have to do extra paperwork, and everybody wins. So that’s what they did. Only instead of a snub nose .38, it was a Boeing 747, or a Tomahawk cruise missile depending on who you ask. And instead of filing off the serial numbers, they left them on there, metaphorically speaking, because they knew it would lead back to their guy Osama, no love lost there...
      </p>
      <p>
       And hopefully nobody would ever find that pic of Rumsfeld and Osama xeroxing their drunken asses at the CIA Christmas party...

       Actually the reason they leave it is to eliminate a piece of evidence that could link back to the guy doing the job. I'm just theorizing that it also makes it easier to move the case to the unsolved pile. I also doubt that happens before the end of the shift.
      </p>
      <p>
       And before you ask, I also don't have evidence of Donald Rumsfeld and Osama Bin Laden having attended the same Christmas parties.

       Maybe not Osama Bin Laden himself, an maybe not GWB, but I am willing to bet Bush #1 at least attended a barbecue with some of the Bin Laden’s.

       They were fairly well off weren’t they and Bush 1, was an oilman and head of the CIA.

       There was also that photo of Rumsfeld shaking Saddam’s hand after he sold him some chemical weapons to use on Iran... That was a good one.

       Unfortunately the records for the 2.3 trillion weren't in the offices struck at the Pentagon. And the 2.3 trillion wasn't "missing" either, the accounting methods just weren't standardized so there was no way to do any type of global audit.

       So do you think it was actually a plane (vs. a missile) that hit the pentagon? I feel like a plane hitting that exact spot would be very difficult to guarantee.

       Could have been either. I don’t mean to hedge, but I only saw the debris field on TV, and it looked like a debris field. TV says it was a plane so what choice do I have but to think it was a plane? But the internet says if it was a plane, it’s unlike any from building collisions previous or since.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both are plausible I guess. Either way I have to take somebody’s word for it.

       the info that the bullet specifically hit the hard drive was completely made up by some random site. Of course now it's out there and spewed like fact. The reports even say it just struck the tower, not hard drive. They've shown the tower on TV interviews and there's a hole in the top by the CD drive and power supply. No where near the hard drive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure how it would ever reveal something you want to know. The place wasn't under any investigation so you would never know what was on it anyways. Why would they come up with some convoluted shooter plot to destroy a hard drive to begin with when they have all the time in the world to just wipe it with free software from the internet or throw it in a fire if they want to during their free time.

       In fact, no, neither of those things happened. Rumsfeld didn't say anything about missing money, he mentioned long-known accounting problems in a routine speech on 9/10/2001. And the part about "destroyed files of the missing trillions" is a hoax.

       <p>
        WASHINGTON — The military's money managers last year made almost $7 trillion in adjustments to their financial ledgers in an attempt to make them add up, the Pentagon's inspector general said in a report released Friday.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Pentagon could not show receipts for
        <strong>
         $2.3 trillion
        </strong>
        of those changes, and half a trillion dollars of it was just corrections of mistakes made in earlier adjustments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each adjustment represents a Defense Department accountant's attempt to correct a discrepancy. The military has hundreds of computer systems to run accounts as diverse as health care, payroll and inventory. But they are not integrated, don't produce numbers up to accounting standards and fail to keep running totals of what's coming in and going out, Pentagon and congressional officials said.

       The main Defense Department accounting office is the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), which has 12,000 employees, located all over the world. Most of the 2.3 trillion dollars in transactions were because of communication problems between the DFAS offices in Kansas City and Cleveland, copying transactions from the Marine Corps ledgers to the Navy ledgers (the Marine Corps is part of the Navy) in order to prepare reports.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that Kansas City and Cleveland are not in the Pentagon. Not only are the primary computers involved not in the Pentagon, the backups are not either. The Defense Department and the National Archives and Records Administration maintain an extensive system of records located all over the country.

       The reason why there are 2.3 trillion missing does not retract from the simple fact that there are circumstances within our apparent mighty government that could allow this kind of situation to take place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The simple fact remains, if this much money is 'unaccounted for' then there -is no accounting-. Any detail of why insults my intelligence - you mean to tell me, these things cannot be accounted for, they are aware of the issue and why it happens and yet it is still not resolved? Considering the amount of money we're talking about, siting 'budget restraints' would be as disconcerting.

       like it's a couple of thousand or even million dollars is in fact really insulting. It's just so much money that the everyday regular Joe can not even conceive.

       He never said 2.3T is missing.  He said there are 2.3T in transactions that are unaccounted for.  You'd have to take some business and accounting/financial classes to understand that, but it is a far cry from $2.3T being missing.  That would be the equivalent of about the 8 prior years of defense spending just being gone.  Obviously that didn't happen because it would be quite noticeable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying there's no concern for defense spending/over-spending/lost money, I'm just saying it DOES NOT MEAN $2.3T IS MISSING.

       Sounds like semantics.

      <p>
       Ultimately, what we're talking about, is as you said, misspending or worse, just flat out lies and deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether something is missing or not, I don't think that's the point most people are making. We're talking about a word. But if 2.3 T is 'unaccounted for' then there IS NO ACCCOUNTING. And that I would say is much worse.

       You still don't understand.  It's not properly accounted for using standard accounting practices (GAAP).  This is technical.  It doesn't mean that you can't find a purchase order for something.  It doesn't mean that the something wasn't received.  It means the accounting (as in bookkeeping) isn't to standard and therefore can't be reconciled normally.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was asking for upgrades to their systems to get the entire federal defense spending leviathan to accounting standards.  He wasn't telling you that people lied or deceived (although that happens, it's not his point.)

       Fair enough. Considering Donald Rumsfeld isn't exactly a bleeding heart liberal, there is probably credence to what he was saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       However. The simple fact remains - maybe Rumsfeld wasn't admitting a crime, doesn't matter - our mighty, mighty government apparently hasn't been keeping their data systems up to date. I don't give a shit how 'hard it is', they have millions, billions in resources, they have had decades to update these things. It's 2017!!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       They have NO EXCUSE. 2.3 trillion, what's that, a million millions??
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care what reasons they site for -why-, the fault is theirs - it was their system to make and fix and they failed miserably, obviously. It's their damn jobs, considering all the government does that they really shouldn't do, not in the original sense and purpose of the government and is otherwise NOT doing what they are meant and tasked to do? Zero excuse. They get no slack.
      </p>
      <p>
       And whether my judgment is just or not - this isn't on me, it's on them, why does a Christian American who takes the Constitution seriously express absolutely zero trust in any of them?

       Are you claiming there is nothing to be concerned about when we are told that 2.3 trillion of taxpayer dollars is missing? And that the day after the announcement of an investigation into said missing funds an explosion destroys the area of the Pentagon housing all the evidence and people pertaining to said investigation?

       But seriously don't play dumb. The context is this entire post, and you literally posted the whole context of the speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest flaw with your "analysis", is that you seem to make the assumption that op thinks that the trillions in missing happened literally on 9/10/01. Obviously it's a collection of debt that has accrued due to ongoing fraud and waste.
      </p>

       I understand it. Our government is highly incompetent and it's possible even that there is a conspiracy of some kind covering up government waste/fraud.

       There's a big difference between saying something fishy is going on with gov't finances, and to say that's the reason 9/11 happened are two completely different things.

       I don't think anyone who can manage things like JFK, MKUltra and Funding for ridiculous Wars are incompetent. Maybe most of politicians are incompetent and ignorant, but the
       <em>
        government
       </em>
       (the ones who actually control it) aren't.

       Your argument is essentially that he has 'too much evidence' and that's suspicious, without actually providing any evidence of your own.

       Not to mention Building 7, the command center of WTC, which was not hit by a plane and which made history by collapsing into it's own basement due to fire(excluding the Towers in this instance which did the same thing).

       Another cute little tidbit:
      </p>
      <p>
       The WTC was the largest repository of Gold in the west, possibly the globe. It was where "World Trade" occurred. If one country owes another country, some dude would wheel a big ol' cart o' gold bricks from one country's cage to another to make payments.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the towers fell, that gold was not recovered.
I remember reading a report at the time about discovery of an abandoned transport truck in the lower workings of the towers. The trailer was loaded up with about 1/8th of the total amount of gold known to be on site. The truck (and attendant escort motorcycles had been abandoned before they could be moved off-site. The other 7/8ths or whatever of the gold was never recovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 trillion in the Pentagon, God knows how many millions or billions in bullion... The dual insurance payoffs for the fallen towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       A select few people made obscene amounts of money by murdering lots of their own countrymen...

       The side the plane crashed into was under construction.  And think about it.  It happened in 2001.  Most of their files were digital.  Although 9/11 was a conspiracy,  this facet of the conspiracy is disinfo.

       Excerpt from the article; The Too-Small Engine Parts
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that the engine parts photographed at the crash site were too small to be from an engine found on a 757 is based on a failure to appreciate that different parts of a modern high-bypass turbofan engine differ dramatically in diameter. The fallacy is illustrated by a passage in one of the more popular articles purporting to prove that no 757 crashed into the Pentagon: The Missing Wings.
      </p>
      <p>
       excerpt title: The Missing Wingsauthors: A. K. Dewdney and G. W. Longspaugh
      </p>
      <p>
       Only one engine was found inside the Pentagon. The two images below show two parts of the single engine found in the Pentagon. The left-hand image shows what appears to be part of the rotor element bearing the stubs of vanes. The right-hand image shows what appears to be the compressor (front) stage of the engine encased by its housing. This engine is barely a third the diameter of a large turbofan engine that powers the Boeing 757.

      <pre><code>Big Story ? with not much media coverage ?
From One America News Network:

An economics professor at Michigan State University made a shocking discovery while reviewing the finances of the federal government.

Dr. Mark Skidmore claims he and a group of graduate students discovered $21 trillion missing in the federal budget going back to 1998.

In one instance, the team found an unauthorized transfer of $800 billion dollars from the Treasury Department to the U.S. Army.

The transfer is labeled as an “adjustment” and indicates it was to reconcile past years.

However, Skidmore says he finds it troubling since the report also shows multiple transfers of around $130 billion.

He says he tried to talk to those who created the report, but stopped when officials disabled the online links to view the documents.

“If trillions of dollars are flowing in and flowing out, it appears to be outside of our Constitution and outside of the rule of law,” said Skidmore. “If that’s the case, that really is troubling.”

The professor believes the missing funds could even be a national security issue.

He says it’s unacceptable, and is urging the American people to “stand up.”

      <p>
       After decades of waste, overpayments, trillions of missing or improperly accounted for dollars, and most recently losing track of 44,000 US soldiers, the Pentagon is about to undergo its first audit in history conducted by 2,400 auditors from independent public accounting firms to conduct reviews across the Army, Navy, Air Force and more - followed by annual audits going forward.

       Watch the entire video of that speech, at no time did he say that $2T was missing.  He eas making a statement about how hard it was to track transactions.  He talks about they’re still using old accounting HW &amp; SW and they’re in need of updates to keep up.

       This is about as stupid as the Silverstein pull it theories.  The idea that you all think these people are admitting to crime and coverup to rooms full of people and literally millions watching TV is an absurd. Thought process

       Is that actually the story? The hell? That IS suspicious. Anyone in the military can tell you stories of disgusting amounts of loss, waste and fraud. They didn't need to make a cover story, the story is just 'whoops we lost the files' and everyone would believe it because they can't even find my leave form the day after I submitted it.
