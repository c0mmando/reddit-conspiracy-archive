    <div class="md"><p>Probably for that reason, the story was changed. David Ray Griffin has done a lot of work on this. </p>

<p>Many of the calls that were first said to have come from cell phones were later said to have come from airphones, which is a problem because several of the people receiving the calls said they identified their loved ones from their caller ID. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The electromechanical components and systems throughout a plane were never tested (validated) specifically for use near cell phones. Primarily because these components predate cell phones by decades. </p>

<p>The components were tested for everything from lightning stikes, EMI, RF, microwave but never for cell phones. This is similar to medical devices. Hospitals restrict cell phone use because the medical equipment was not validated for service near cell phones.</p>

It was those phones that used to be set into the back of the airplane seats, that you could use a credit card to pay and call. Am I the only one who remembers these? I definitely believe that 9/11 was a massive inside job/conspiracy, but I&#39;m not sure why people use the cell phone thing as evidence.

<p>i think the planes were under remote control and the pilot couldn&#39;t do jack shit. there may not have been any terrorists on that plane at all. </p>

<p>google &quot;Wide Area Augmentation System&quot; in 2000, it was capable of remote control and guidance of aircraft. United installed honeywells Pegasus flight management system in their 757s that could control the entire aircraft in 1997. </p>

<p>honeywell also had their Differential GPS Satellite Landing System that they tested on UPS planes in 1998 that could take off and land themselves and stay within a 2x2 meter box around the planned flight path. </p>

<p>i don&#39;t think the &quot;terrorists&quot; existed at all. i think the pilots fought it the entire time, and died under the control of a remote pilot sitting in a chair somewhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>but my original point was that a decent pilot CAN pull off those maneuvers in an airliner. i&#39;ve seen pilots pull immelmanns and low level barrel rolls with a 747 at air shows. normal pilots don&#39;t try that kind of shit because they want to 1) keep a job and 2) live. i can see a suicidal pilot being able to do it too.  </p>

<p>i just don&#39;t think that <em>in this particular case</em> the pilot sitting in the cockpit was in control at all.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anything this guy had a better reason than anyone to drive normally and safely, dying on the way to what he allegedly considers the most important thing in his life is just stupid. Another stupid thing is attracting extra attention by doing something like this. Furthermore, the guy allegedly piloting the airplane was not a decent pilot, but an incredibly shitty one, which is why we are bringing this up. I agree it was drone though, this is the argument for why it was a drone! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could have been a missile.</p>

<p>There is also some other interesting evidence, pictures can be found of the Pentagon with seemingly sheer &#39;cuts&#39; where part of the building went down and the other side did not. It was so pristine that desks, chairs and other items remained upright despite the apparent &#39;collapse&#39;.</p>

<p>Additionally, I&#39;m not sure if anybody is aware of this, whenever an airplane crashes anywhere in North America, in some cases even into the sea, the FAA literally collects all the pieces and puts it back together again to find out what went wrong. I&#39;m sure we can all recall seeing the pictures of the wreckage tacked all back together.</p>

<p>Does anybody remember this happening with either the Pentagon or Flight 93(which resembled more like a pile of garbage than a planecrash)? A lot of unprecedented events took place that day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of stuff you can find still.</p>

<p>I &#39;watched&#39;, more like listened, to a secret interview a guy conducted with a maintenance man from DC that apparently witnessed the Pentagon incident.</p>

<p>The guy was clearly afraid to speak on camera about any of it. The interviewer had to sneakily stick a phone in his pocket to record the guy talking about how he was &#39;spoken to&#39;. It was probably a missile of some kind.</p>

<p>This is all speculation of course, I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve studied the pentagon thing very deeply, spent most of my time with the towers.</p>

<p>I feel you can rationally prove the official story is garbage strictly based on the towers, how they were built and what jet fuel actually is(it sounds a lot nastier than it is).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think it’s crazy at all. It’s sane... very sane. </p>

<p>Look at it from their perspective. You can’t hide 2 Trillion missing dollars forever. Too many people involved in that much money, even if all of them got paid, it’s unlikely they would of be able to cover that shit forever. </p>

<p>So what do you do when the truth coming out is unacceptable? You make it so that the truth can never possibly come out, and even if nuggets of truth emerge, they are deniable. </p>

<p>It’s why murderers dissolve bodies in vats of acid. No body, no murder.</p>

<p>So how do you make enough money that if you put it in cash it would fill the Grand Canyon “disappear”? Well, money is basically imaginary, so you don’t have to make the money disappear, you just have to make records of it disappear. </p>

<p>But in this case, the records would have been in the Pentagon, one of the most secure installations on earth. You can’t just burgle the file by cabinet with the invoices. You have to think bigger than that. The pentagon has to burn. </p>

<p>But there’s the problem... how do you burn down the most secure building on the planet? It can’t be done by normal means, but Rumsfeld et. al. had the literal Army at their disposal. They could just blow it up. </p>

<p>How frustrating that must have been. They had the means to solve their problem in 5 minutes, but couldn’t just start lobbing artillery rounds at the Pentagon, so they got creative. They probably thought: “What is the best way to get away with a crime that can’t be hidden?” </p>

<p>The mob does this all the time. They get a hit man to shoot someone, and the hit man just leaves the gun right next to the body. Why? To make it easier for the cops to close the case. If the investigation drags on, they may get unlucky and get the only honest cop on the force investigating it. And the thing is, investigations tend to uncover threads, and threads get followed, and pretty soon the boss has to worry about that one time 15 years ago that he was with the hit man at the mob office Christmas party xeroxing their drunken asses and putting it in everyone’s mailbox.</p>

<p>So you just file off the serial number and drop the gun on the body. The cop gets to close the case, doesn’t have to do extra paperwork, and everybody wins. So that’s what they did. Only instead of a snub nose .38, it was a Boeing 747, or a Tomahawk cruise missile depending on who you ask. And instead of filing off the serial numbers, they left them on there, metaphorically speaking, because they knew it would lead back to their guy Osama, no love lost there... </p>

<p>And hopefully nobody would ever find that pic of Rumsfeld and Osama xeroxing their drunken asses at the CIA Christmas party...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the reason they leave it is to eliminate a piece of evidence that could link back to the guy doing the job. I&#39;m just theorizing that it also makes it easier to move the case to the unsolved pile. I also doubt that happens before the end of the shift.</p>

<p>And before you ask, I also don&#39;t have evidence of Donald Rumsfeld and Osama Bin Laden having attended the same Christmas parties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the info that the bullet specifically hit the hard drive was completely made up by some random site. Of course now it&#39;s out there and spewed like fact. The reports even say it just struck the tower, not hard drive. They&#39;ve shown the tower on TV interviews and there&#39;s a hole in the top by the CD drive and power supply. No where near the hard drive.</p>

<p>Not sure how it would ever reveal something you want to know. The place wasn&#39;t under any investigation so you would never know what was on it anyways. Why would they come up with some convoluted shooter plot to destroy a hard drive to begin with when they have all the time in the world to just wipe it with free software from the internet or throw it in a fire if they want to during their free time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In fact, no, neither of those things happened. Rumsfeld didn&#39;t say anything about missing money, he mentioned long-known accounting problems in a routine speech on 9/10/2001. And the part about &quot;destroyed files of the missing trillions&quot; is a hoax.</p>

<p>Rumsfeld didn&#39;t announce anything new on September 10, 2001. He briefly mentioned accounting problems in a routine speech titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100301161721/http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=430"><em>DOD Acquisition and Logistics Excellence Week Kickoff—Bureaucracy to Battlefield</em></a>: &quot;Our financial systems are decades old. According to some estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions. We cannot share information from floor to floor in this building because it&#39;s stored on dozens of technological systems that are inaccessible or incompatible.&quot;</p>

<p>The 2.3 trillion dollar figure comes from <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2000/Aug/18/2001713967/-1/-1/1/00-179.pdf">this audit report from the year 2000 (PDF)</a> about fiscal year 1999 (Oct. 1998-Sep. 1999).</p>

<p>Even before the final report was issued, the story was in the news. From <strong>March 5, 2000</strong>, eighteen months before 9/11: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/05/news/mn-5519"><em>Pentagon&#39;s Finances Just Don&#39;t Add Up</em></a></p>

<p>Audit: Hundreds of computer systems fail to keep running totals of income and outgo. Last year, the Defense Department&#39;s bookkeeping errors totaled more than the entire federal budget.</p>

<p>March 05, 2000|JOHN M. DONNELLY | ASSOCIATED PRESS</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The military&#39;s money managers last year made almost $7 trillion in adjustments to their financial ledgers in an attempt to make them add up, the Pentagon&#39;s inspector general said in a report released Friday.</p>

<p>The Pentagon could not show receipts for <strong>$2.3 trillion</strong> of those changes, and half a trillion dollars of it was just corrections of mistakes made in earlier adjustments.</p>

<p>Each adjustment represents a Defense Department accountant&#39;s attempt to correct a discrepancy. The military has hundreds of computer systems to run accounts as diverse as health care, payroll and inventory. But they are not integrated, don&#39;t produce numbers up to accounting standards and fail to keep running totals of what&#39;s coming in and going out, Pentagon and congressional officials said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rumfeld was <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4521969/sen-byrd-rumsfeld-nominatin-hearing">asked to look into the accounting problems at his confirmation hearings</a>. That discussion was mentioned in the news, for example <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/show/politics-jan-june01-rumsfeld_01-11">on the PBS newshour</a>.</p>

<p>Other mentions of the $2.3 trillion from before 9/11 are collected here: <a href="http://www.911myths.com/html/rumsfeld__9_11_and__2_3_trilli.html">http://www.911myths.com/html/rumsfeld__9_11_and__2_3_trilli.html</a></p>

<p>As to the plane crash destroying files relating to the audit, that&#39;s a hoax. The offices involved with the audit were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Finance_and_Accounting_Service">Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS)</a>, the <a href="http://www.dodig.mil/">Office of the Inspector General</a>, and the <a href="http://comptroller.defense.gov/">Comptroller</a>.</p>

<p>None of those were in the area of the Pentagon that was hit.</p>

<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150910075856/www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/p/pentagon-9-11-footnotes.html">This book documents which offices in the Pentagon were hit.</a> (Also available <a href="http://history.defense.gov/Portals/70/Documents/pentagon/Pentagon9-11.pdf">as PDF</a>) There is no DFAS, Inspector General, or Comptroller there.</p>

<p>The Defense Department <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120414183438/http://www.defense.gov//News/NewsArticle.aspx?ID=43927">continued to work to reconcile the numbers after 9/11</a>.</p>

<p>The main Defense Department accounting office is the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), which has 12,000 employees, located all over the world. Most of the 2.3 trillion dollars in transactions were because of communication problems between the DFAS offices in Kansas City and Cleveland, copying transactions from the Marine Corps ledgers to the Navy ledgers (the Marine Corps is part of the Navy) in order to prepare reports.</p>

<p>Note that Kansas City and Cleveland are not in the Pentagon. Not only are the primary computers involved not in the Pentagon, the backups are not either. The Defense Department and the National Archives and Records Administration maintain an extensive system of records located all over the country.</p>

You&#39;d have to take some business and accounting/financial classes to understand that, but it is a far cry from $2.3T being missing.  That would be the equivalent of about the 8 prior years of defense spending just being gone.  Obviously that didn&#39;t happen because it would be quite noticeable.</p>

<p>Ultimately, what we&#39;re talking about, is as you said, misspending or worse, just flat out lies and deception.</p>

<p>Whether something is missing or not, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the point most people are making. We&#39;re talking about a word. But if 2.3 T is &#39;unaccounted for&#39; then there IS NO ACCCOUNTING. And that I would say is much worse.</p>

It doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t find a purchase order for something.  It doesn&#39;t mean that the something wasn&#39;t received.

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. Considering Donald Rumsfeld isn&#39;t exactly a bleeding heart liberal, there is probably credence to what he was saying.</p>

<p>However. The simple fact remains - maybe Rumsfeld wasn&#39;t admitting a crime, doesn&#39;t matter - our mighty, mighty government apparently hasn&#39;t been keeping their data systems up to date. I don&#39;t give a shit how &#39;hard it is&#39;, they have millions, billions in resources, they have had decades to update these things. It&#39;s 2017!!!!!</p>

<p>They have NO EXCUSE. 2.3 trillion, what&#39;s that, a million millions??</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care what reasons they site for -why-, the fault is theirs - it was their system to make and fix and they failed miserably, obviously. It&#39;s their damn jobs, considering all the government does that they really shouldn&#39;t do, not in the original sense and purpose of the government and is otherwise NOT doing what they are meant and tasked to do? Zero excuse. They get no slack.</p>

<p>And whether my judgment is just or not - this isn&#39;t on me, it&#39;s on them, why does a Christian American who takes the Constitution seriously express absolutely zero trust in any of them?</p>

<p>But seriously don&#39;t play dumb. The context is this entire post, and you literally posted the whole context of the speech. </p>

<p>The biggest flaw with your &quot;analysis&quot;, is that you seem to make the assumption that op thinks that the trillions in missing happened literally on 9/10/01. Obviously it&#39;s a collection of debt that has accrued due to ongoing fraud and waste.</p>

<p>So don&#39;t act like there &quot;nothing&quot; there. the most objective mind can see some discrepancies.... Conclusions aside</p>

<p>I understand it. Our government is highly incompetent and it&#39;s possible even that there is a conspiracy of some kind covering up government waste/fraud.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a big difference between saying something fishy is going on with gov&#39;t finances, and to say that&#39;s the reason 9/11 happened are two completely different things.</p>

<p>The WTC was the largest repository of Gold in the west, possibly the globe. It was where &quot;World Trade&quot; occurred. If one country owes another country, some dude would wheel a big ol&#39; cart o&#39; gold bricks from one country&#39;s cage to another to make payments.</p>

<p>When the towers fell, that gold was not recovered.
I remember reading a report at the time about discovery of an abandoned transport truck in the lower workings of the towers. The trailer was loaded up with about 1/8th of the total amount of gold known to be on site. The truck (and attendant escort motorcycles had been abandoned before they could be moved off-site. The other 7/8ths or whatever of the gold was never recovered.</p>

<p>2 trillion in the Pentagon, God knows how many millions or billions in bullion... The dual insurance payoffs for the fallen towers. </p>

<p>Excerpt from the article; The Too-Small Engine Parts</p>

<p>The idea that the engine parts photographed at the crash site were too small to be from an engine found on a 757 is based on a failure to appreciate that different parts of a modern high-bypass turbofan engine differ dramatically in diameter. The fallacy is illustrated by a passage in one of the more popular articles purporting to prove that no 757 crashed into the Pentagon: The Missing Wings.</p>

<p>excerpt title: The Missing Wingsauthors: A. K. Dewdney and G. W. Longspaugh</p>

<p>Only one engine was found inside the Pentagon. The two images below show two parts of the single engine found in the Pentagon. The left-hand image shows what appears to be part of the rotor element bearing the stubs of vanes. The right-hand image shows what appears to be the compressor (front) stage of the engine encased by its housing. This engine is barely a third the diameter of a large turbofan engine that powers the Boeing 757.</p>

    <div class="md"><pre><code>Big Story ? with not much media coverage ?
From One America News Network:

An economics professor at Michigan State University made a shocking discovery while reviewing the finances of the federal government.

Dr. Mark Skidmore claims he and a group of graduate students discovered $21 trillion missing in the federal budget going back to 1998.

In one instance, the team found an unauthorized transfer of $800 billion dollars from the Treasury Department to the U.S. Army.

The transfer is labeled as an “adjustment” and indicates it was to reconcile past years.

However, Skidmore says he finds it troubling since the report also shows multiple transfers of around $130 billion.

He says he tried to talk to those who created the report, but stopped when officials disabled the online links to view the documents.

“If trillions of dollars are flowing in and flowing out, it appears to be outside of our Constitution and outside of the rule of law,” said Skidmore. “If that’s the case, that really is troubling.”

The professor believes the missing funds could even be a national security issue.

He says it’s unacceptable, and is urging the American people to “stand up.”

<p>this should be good - lol - in a few years (?)</p>

<p>After decades of waste, overpayments, trillions of missing or improperly accounted for dollars, and most recently losing track of 44,000 US soldiers, the Pentagon is about to undergo its first audit in history conducted by 2,400 auditors from independent public accounting firms to conduct reviews across the Army, Navy, Air Force and more - followed by annual audits going forward. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch the entire video of that speech, at no time did he say that $2T was missing.  He eas making a statement about how hard it was to track transactions.  He talks about they’re still using old accounting HW &amp; SW and they’re in need of updates to keep up.  </p>

<p>This is about as stupid as the Silverstein pull it theories.  The idea that you all think these people are admitting to crime and coverup to rooms full of people and literally millions watching TV is an absurd. Thought process</p>
