<p>However that really doesn&#39;t get us anywhere in the way of evidence for a shooting. If there were a real shooting you could prove it or at least make a viable case for it even if you lived in Kalamazoo. </p>

<p>I will believe you in good faith that you live in Vegas. It&#39;s only when you insist that that alone is somehow &quot;proof&quot; that you know someone who was actually shot that I can dismiss all of your further claims, since they are unbanked and meaningless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started looking more into this theory of crisis actors and such not too long ago regarding the Vegas theory. While I remain skeptical, I can’t find any post LV Shooting pictures that indicate bullet damage.

    <div class="md"><p>Mass surveillance, censorship and AI. I know they&#39;re three seperate issues, but they all go hand in hand. It&#39;s crazy that people still think that all this spying is for our own security. Terrorists will just go underground, meanwhile citizens are losing their freedom and privacy. It&#39;s not all done through fear mongering though. Millenials are also selling us out by trading privacy for conveniance or stupid creature comforts. I know it&#39;s hard to get by in the modern world without services like Facebook and Google, but we can still limit what information we give them. Unfortunately the majority is fine with having all their data readily available online so they can be read like an open book. I don&#39;t have a problem with surveillance in crowded public spaces, but it&#39;s depressing that we are losing privacy in our own homes. I know mass surveillance is nothing new, but the recent adoption rate of stuff like biometrics is definitely alarming. It&#39;s frustrating that whenever I bring this up to normies they just say &quot;why worry if you have nothing to hide&quot;, or &quot;you&#39;re not that important&quot;. I think these computer illiterate people think that they will take action against us immediately, but it&#39;s clearly more a case of all this data sitting in the cloud so they can dig up dirt on you if you become a problem. To my knowledge, the main issue with &quot;Big Data&quot; is how long it takes a human to sort through it all, but with the advancements in AI the process will get much quicker.</p>

People believe that that&#39;s not a big deal since like you said they have nothing to hide, but don&#39;t realize they are essentially allowing the internet to build a virtual self that the AI knows everything about. </p>

<p>Also there is no doubt censorship is already happening but if Net Neutrality gets repealed then the ability to share useful information could really set us back. I&#39;m interested to see how this all pans out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the &quot;nothing to hide&quot; argument is getting old when you have people implying that conspiricy theorists are possible domestic terrorists, just questioning the narrative could get you in trouble. You&#39;re spot on about them building profiles on everyone too. Even if you try to keep your personal life seperate from the internet, people can still tag you in photos. It all seems so innocent at face value like them silly Snapchat filters that youngsters use, but it&#39;s scanning all their faces. Now we have tech taking the facial recognition to the next level, I mean stuff like the iPhone X where it maps a 3D model of your face. We also have cookies tracking us across the web, and they use things like font size and screen resolution as identifiers.  I don&#39;t like to sound preachy because I am guilty of using lots of these corrupt services and devices myself, not the biometric stuff, but I still use crap like Windows 10 and Android. It&#39;s getting harder and harder to boycott this mess.</p>

<p>Yep, NN getting repealed could be very problematic. I&#39;m still unsure what the knock-on effect will be like here in the UK, but it can&#39;t be good. That being said, Theresa May wants to create a new controlled internet for us Brits so we&#39;re probably going to be fucked too. It&#39;s crazy how little people care. Maybe people do in the US, I don&#39;t know. People didn&#39;t say anything when the Snoopers Charter was passed here though and that was one of the most extreme surveillance bills I have seen. I don&#39;t have much hope at all anymore. People are too busy arguing about petty shit that the media spews to keep us divided, but they don&#39;t see the prison that is being built around them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely. Many things are still done in plain view though. Take the Equifax hack back in September that was all over the headlines for example, that surely stuck in peoples subconscious brain, then surprise, a few days later the iPhone X was revealed and one of the major selling points was the biometric security. The way it all plays out is way too predictable, but it&#39;s still all a coincidence to the average Joe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a fact to us God alone Muslims, but conspiracy to mainstream Muslims that today’s Islam is completely fake and by giving all the power to mullahs to run the religion, they have simply made their own lives threatened. Going over all the things explains why today’s Muslim countries are backward and contribute very less to science followed by why it is so easy to use Islam for violence. This must be discussed so the followers can see why mullahs turn some of their children into terrorists. I understand that there might be some fake ones out there, but that doesn’t excuse the fact that Islam is being used as the reason for terrorism. 
The entire secondary source they depend upon has no relation to actual Muhammad, but politics of different sects  which came and competed against each other for power after his demise and above all, Persian Zoroastrian who were enemy to the Arabs back then. Here are some quotes from ancient scholar about that source: <a href="https://ancientmodernislam.blogspot.com/2016/01/hadiths-are-fake-truth-from.html">https://ancientmodernislam.blogspot.com/2016/01/hadiths-are-fake-truth-from.html</a>. </p>

<p>To may things worse, they influenced how one is to read Quran. Too many verses are interpreted completely wrong in the mainstream Islam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The craziest part is, real Islam is not violent:</p>

<p>&quot;It is permissible to fight against oppression and persecution. This does not apply only to Islam and Muslims, because everyone has the right to worship God. God says, “To those against whom war is made, permission is given [to fight] because they are wronged and verily God is Most Powerful for their aid. [They are] those who have been expelled from their homes in defiance of right [for no cause] except that they say, ‘Our Lord is God.’ If God did not check one set of people by means of another, there would surely have been pulled down monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, in which the name of God is commemorated in abundant measure” [Qur’an 22:39 – 40] This clearly means that Muslims must fight to protect and defend people of other faiths if they are in areas where the Muslims have effective power. The life, honor, and property of all people are considered sacred whether they are Muslim or not. All people must be free to worship God. They must be free to make their own choices. God The Guardian of Faith, explicitly says, “There is no compulsion in religion.” [Qur’an 2:256]&quot;</p>

<p>I have no clue how this could possibly be misinterpreted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that they eliminated all the limits set by Quran through the secondary source which they say has the sayings of the Prophet detailing what one needs to practice Islam and plus what the ancient scholars said about them and Quran. </p>

<p>But as I showed earlier, that’s a lie. Their so called sayings of the Prophet contradict each other. Some are gruesome and vulgar. Then there are those that promise washing of sins if the follower does some minutes of praying. The rest twist and abrogate the Quran verses. But mullahs can’t agree with each other on which one to apply. To make things worse, they are permitted to even abrogate the sayings. They also promote the lie that Quran can be interpreted in any way one likes as long as it is approved by someone from their field. In the end, you have a religion in which everything is permitted. If someone raises voice against it he risks getting jailed or murdered in most Muslim countries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>AI, more specifically, military AI </p>

<p>It&#39;s common knowledge that the US military is generally 30 years ahead of the public, tech-wise, and have had a key hand in creating and shaping the internet.  They <em>know</em> an AI would be the most powerful weapon to ever exist.  It IS being developed, we just don&#39;t know how or where.  </p>

<p>So right know, we have some pretty impressive google gadgets but whatever is being cooked up by our black budget friends is leagues ahead of what we see right now.  An AI could be impossible to discern, we like to think it would be &quot;us, but digital&quot; or some evil robot,  but that&#39;s not necessarily the case.  The internet, the information around us - THAT is the greatest potential weapon that exists.  Anything unleashed on this matrix would change our lives forever. </p>

<p>If this you wanna get REAL down the rabbithole, there are scattered theories that this AI already exists and is responsible for disinformation phenomenon such as Mandela Effect and meme magic.  But I digress.  The possible is <em>there</em> and gets closer every day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy against reality.. you&#39;re not supposed to stop and question <em>italic what it is</em>.  When you do, you find scientists can&#39;t even make up their minds on idealism (this is all happening in your head, you create the world) or materialism (the world is solid and real, it creates you).  The world looks real and solid, yet its made of atoms and they are 99.99999% empty space, everything you see is an illusion formed by electrical impulses in your brain, like a dream.</p>

<p>There&#39;s legitimate studies into the nature of reality and whether or not we exist in a digital dream or simulation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s conceivable that an A.I. has constructed this world based on all the data it has collected about humanity and we are reliving this period in history in the lead up to the technological singularity.  What has been prophesied by sci-fi writers and film makers alike is going to come to fruition..  (or based on our understanding of time; the past, present &amp; futute are all happening at once) it already has happened and it will continue to, over and over again.</p>

<p>This of course could be considered irrelevant, for if the world were a chessboard, the political theatre played out with the pieces (us being the pawns) is what matters.  What difference does it make if we know the game is made of wood or plastic?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is something I recently posted as a shower thought else where but I&#39;ll has out my idea even more here.</p>

<p>As you said it&#39;s crazy how fast AI has been coming along. Whenever I think of our technological advancements such as AI, flight, energy, etc, I always think of it from an alien perspective. Like if we humans have come this far and advanced this much, if aliens do exist then surely they too at some point advances maybe somewhat similar to use. So with our on AI growing so rapidly, while we don&#39;t even fully understand it. What if aliens too developed AI, maybe to the point there is no more &quot;organic&quot; aliens just thier sentient AI creations. </p>

<p>Now I will admit I was really high when I thought this. However besides AI, the progress of our own Virtual Reality systems makes it easier for me to believe we live in a simulation of some other sort of VR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the &quot;nothing to hide&quot; argument is getting old when you have people implying that conspiricy theorists are possible domestic terrorists, just questioning the narrative could get you in trouble. You&#39;re spot on about them building profiles on everyone too. Even if you try to keep your personal life seperate from the internet, people can still tag you in photos. It all seems so innocent at face value like them silly Snapchat filters that youngsters use, but it&#39;s scanning all their faces. Now we have tech taking the facial recognition to the next level, I mean stuff like the iPhone X where it maps a 3D model of your face. We also have cookies tracking us across the web, and they use things like font size and screen resolution as identifiers.  I don&#39;t like to sound preachy because I am guilty of using lots of these corrupt services and devices myself, not the biometric stuff, but I still use crap like Windows 10 and Android. It&#39;s getting harder and harder to boycott this mess.</p>

<p>Yep, NN getting repealed could be very problematic. I&#39;m still unsure what the knock-on effect will be like here in the UK, but it can&#39;t be good. That being said, Theresa May wants to create a new controlled internet for us Brits so we&#39;re probably going to be fucked too. It&#39;s crazy how little people care. Maybe people do in the US, I don&#39;t know. People didn&#39;t say anything when the Snoopers Charter was passed here though and that was one of the most extreme surveillance bills I have seen. I don&#39;t have much hope at all anymore. People are too busy arguing about petty shit that the media spews to keep us divided, but they don&#39;t see the prison that is being built around them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could post a censored pic of your state ID sitting behind your username scribbled on paper, pretty easily. </p>

<p>However that really doesn&#39;t get us anywhere in the way of evidence for a shooting. If there were a real shooting you could prove it or at least make a viable case for it even if you lived in Kalamazoo. </p>

<p>I will believe you in good faith that you live in Vegas. It&#39;s only when you insist that that alone is somehow &quot;proof&quot; that you know someone who was actually shot that I can dismiss all of your further claims, since they are unbanked and meaningless. </p>
