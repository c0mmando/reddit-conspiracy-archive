       Ok this is more of a rant then a conspiracy.  This is the only forum were I feel I may get some feed back. Everything is a fix. Our money our media our government,  everything. The only way I could see light at the end of the tunnel is to live off the grid and live off the land. But, you still need money and a job to get all of this started. I always read in the comments on here,  people say they don't work and don't consume, and don't. feed the machine.  Please enlighten me on how you can achieve this without having money. And I mean without living off of other peoples money.

       I am not off the grid, but I am with you on this one.  I WANT electricity, and heat, and grocery stores, running water, and cars.  I love antibiotics, vaccines, modern surgery with sterility and anesthesia.

       I think we could save our civilization if we could work together, and not allow ourselves to become isolated by the mind games.  Of course, poverty is a great way to be sucked into not caring about anything.

       You're right. We can save our civilization by producing our own society. The society we hate is a result of consent due to convenience. Current society is the default. I yearn for a small society resembling a small tribal village. Where we aren't forced to live by unknown people's rules but by our own local agreed upon rules. All you gotta do is organize and make it happen. Be a pioneer and homestead your own land. Organize with others to form your own community

       some days, hell yes. The water, air, eggs, everything organic, you just feel so much better health wise and you feel good after a long days work.

       But you need a day off, you need rest, a movie, some internet, etc. Around day 30-40 you start going a bit insane without the regular routines. If you get past that, you settle in and get used to it, then miss it after you leave

       i think if we can someone change human genetics/cells to be able to live off sunlight and/or high levels of oxygen/water, then perhaps it could be done or be easier to do to basically live in the woods/mountains somewhere.

       Is such a wide scale operation required for a small family? Or could you scale down and still have everything you need. You can still go grocery shopping. What if you decide you want to live off the grid but you still get food at the store? Isn't all that work for the growing of your own food?

       I did off grid living at friend of friends place in North Alabama, hard core everything off grid, everything hunted, fished, solar, yurts, gardens, chickens, eggs, etc and it was hard as hell, but enjoyable and my health was amazing (all my health problems cleared up)
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also stayed at a few retreats, communes, and have a small cabin in the Smoky Mountains where things are still plugged in, have access to the net, but you still have to use an outdoor bathroom (sawdust), shower, etc, and stil care for any animals, gardening, etc if you have it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My cabin is basically a small hunter cabin that is 300 Square feet with a loft where the bed is and requires 4WD to get up there on like 40+ acres. I made some decent $ off bitcoin so I went halfs on this with an uncle who is avid hunter, and we plant ginseng there in the fall, and spend late Sept to lat November there planting Sang.
      </p>
      <p>
       During these months, we buy in bulk for our food and still have access to net/electric and it makes it more bearable

       I consider myself off grid.  I have a couple acres in Alaska, on the road system.  I do have DSL, that's about it.  No power lines, sewer, water, mail delivery, gas.  I'm currently working about 9 months a year, commuting 75 miles each way.  I should be able to retire when I'm 52.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a lot of work, but you get used to it. My farming and hunting is mostly done at Costco, which makes life a lot easier.

       I hate to break it to you, OP, but sooner or later the man is gonna get you. The swiftest way is with kids. If you have kids you are controllable. You will take the shitty job and keep doing  it. You will keep your mouth shut or look away or be payed off to protect your kids. But even without kids, you're easily bought and controlled. School debt is the common route now. But no matter how far you get in life, you will answer to someone and end up spending significant time devoted to doing shit you don't want to do. And you'll be told you get what you deserve and should have just worked harder if you wanted more.

       People who do what they when they want are enslaved to their impulses. Self control has EVERYTHING to with freedom. When you can't ignore your impulses for immediate gratification then you aren't choosing anything, your impulses are choosing for you. Freedom is the ability to take action regardless of how you feel.

       Do whatever you want but hopefully you're smart enough to accept the consequences of your actions. But we should have the freedom to do whatever we want. I believe in absolute freedom. But all actions have consequences so be responsible. But it shouldn't have to be an issue. We are dumbed by our dependence on current society. Our dependence hinders our ability to understand consequences because throwing someone in jail does not cure any underlying issues. So they'll just come up with ways to avoid being caught, but if you have to face the guilt of your sins I think that has a bigger impact. I don't think people are inheritly bad. People are pushed to do things. Anyway, other examples would be if you want to do risky drugs that could be harmful to your body, use your own judgement and foresight of how addicting they are before doing it. Let's say you just need to to clear your mind and you want to go on a trip. Yeah it has consequences to your health, but you make the decision that it will also provide some benefit in altering your perspective that you feel you need when maybe stuck in a rut. So use discretion and judgement
Another example, let's say someone has a dependency issue and doesn't have good judgement. A small village is better equipped to rally around this individual with a more intimate knowledge of them to enact the proper remedies to treat them in a healthy way and for the long term

       he won't have one, because unless someone inherits a large sum of money or wins the lottery or whatever, everyone needs to work to pay for rent/food/clothes/etc.  His solution to not spending money on food is to grow vegetables in the backyard.  Backyard of what?  A house that costs money.

       While I get what you're saying, there are possibilities. Finding a store that sells the products you want, then exchanging your time and expertise for their goods is one way to get what you want. Oh wait, yeah I forgot we made up imaginary systems that act as placeholders for promises because people used to get fucked over. The problem is that there's a few people who control the imaginary numbers and dictate what they're worth. You'd be better off creating your own currency to exchange for favours, like most of the cryptocurrencies have

       What woods? All the woods are either private property or state or federal land which wouldn't allow squatting or vagrancy. You'd have to buy the land and pay taxes on it, which you probably couldn't do trading pelts or meat, or whatever else you'd do with the rifle.

       I like your attitude and examples, but you're referencing two different worlds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Living off the land, growing things in your own back yard, living off the grid and not working for a big company are one way of life, like the natives and tribes used to live. And that's great if you're into that and want to live that kind of - forgive my oversimplifcation - backward and ancient life.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then you bring up the example of man flying over an ocean, and peasants being able to board a ship or fly across the ocean on a weeks salary. This example and this ability we all have goes specifically against your previous example of living off the land, not supporting big corporations and living 'off the grid'. Ships and planes and this forum and affordable chair you're sitting on are only possible due to culminated effort and work (sometime mind-numming, office drudgery) of thousands and milliions of people working in conjuction in a sophisticated and specialized society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes it sucks that we are all becoming more and more specialized and we can't do everything we want to all the time, nor do we know how to do half the things our ancestors could do. But that's all for the 'luxuries' and comforts we take for granted while we bitch and moan on our keyboards about corporations; meanwhile we can afford to access the world on the internet affordably and take vacations across the world at an affordable price, specifically because of the complex and specialized society we've built.

       Plus an average garden can only grow so much, and provide very few calories. I like growing tomatoes and things like that, but after months of tending to it, I get maybe a few salads worth and some garnishes. Nothing beats the fresh taste, but it's not going to feed anybody for more than a few days. You'd have to have a real farm to be able to live off of.

       You cant even really grow shit in your backyard in California anymore. All our fruits and vegetables are growing and looking great on the outside, but on the inside they're rotten already. This is the first season we experienced this with our avocado's especially.

       I choose the responsibilities I want. I can grow food, have a family, have a job without it having to be a chore. It's things I want and an experience I want to go through. I don't like things handed over on a silver platter, it doesn't build character.
      </p>
      <p>
       In todays day it's your own fault if your not doing what ever the fuck you want. If you don't screw yourself over with debt early on, you can literally do what ever you want. You can choose a path you think you'll enjoy and make smart conservative choices. My goal is exactly what OP described, I choose to want those responsibilities. I don't try to make it big in the film industry because I don't want that stress, I want the stress of learning how to properly grow my crops year after year.

       I disagree with this. It doesn't have to be all or nothing. There are absolutely loads of little things you can do to diminish the impact "the man" has on your life (even if you have kids). The OP has already taken one step by being aware of whats going on - know thy enemy! Knowledge will help you to recognise the never-ending onslaught of mental pressures  "you need to do this/look like that/own one of these". A generation of youngsters are up to their eyes in debt but the real problem is the worry and stress it brings - so take the debt if its what you want but learn to keep the stress and worry under-control with the knowledge that the system is utterly rigged and corrupt. Teach your kids that we live on a busy planet and that little freedoms count for a lot in the grande scheme of things.

       Most communities require new homes to be connected to the grid. There was a woman in New Orleans (I think, I can't remember exactly where) who refused to have her utilities turned on to her home because she didn't have the money and didn't want anyone tracking her. She lost her home because of this. This is a global system and any nails that stick out are going to be hammered down one way or another. If they allow a few people to buck the system it might inspire others.

       I am working towards this, but I don't think you can get there fully without some type of income. The best would be to have your own business, live off grid as much as possible and only buy things you really need and from local sources as much as possible.

       Yep, having a service you can sell. Wether it's massage, Personal Trainer, Tutor.. It's more helping others achieve which makes you feel good, and it's constant money on your own schedule, with little start up cost. Personal trainer: certification.    Massage: Certification and a portable table.  Tutor: Knowledge.

       I know some local artists who live off of making art and selling it in various places. They just advertise on Instagram and Facebook , create a folowing and make art. They don't make a ton but they live in decent homes and have a car and everything, they just live simple lives doing what they love. I'm envious of those people, if I had any artistic ability I would try my hand at it.

       For me, I try not to sweat it too much. I want to have friends and family and participate in the parts of society I find positive. I'm working to be as self sufficient financially as I can. Right now that means supplementing my income through a side project/business but I hope to someday be fully self employed. Also down the road I want to own property, and to generate as much of my own energy and food as I can there.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all a tradeoff. I'm not willing to go full Kaczynski and live in the woods like a wild man, but I'd also like to be as self sufficient as I can be.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one person is going to change our global financial system, and even with massive support I don't see it changing radically in a lifetime. Try to concern yourself with what you can change in your own life, persue creative and satisfying endevours, have fun with your friends, and be good to your neighbors, support your community and those doing good work. There's no sense in driving oneself mad thinking about being a wage slave. Either take measures to escape that system, to change it for the better, or learn to live in it on a way that gives your life meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been accused (in this subreddit) of being the perfect wage slave for this mentality, but fuck it, I'm happy and leading what I find to be a meaningful existance. That's all I can do.

       It sucks that the most "reasonable" way to achieve this is receive, or be rewarded lump sum, put some in a bank and live off the interest. Then you're still at the mercy of banks. Very lame. I think it was T. Jeffers that said if we allow banks to control the land, children will become homeless on the land their father's conquered.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you look at property taxes on say an off the grid plot of land its horsehit. You could hand somebody theoretically 10 million dollars just for a plot of land for you to "own" and work do all your life on. I'm talking hunting, fishing, homesteading building a naturalistic life.
      </p>
      <p>
       But some asshole in a striped suit still comes by every year for his cut and if he doesn't get it, that 10 mil you payed is 'poof'. So I guess you never even owned it.

       People work to earn money to realize their dreams. If you don't want to work, then you need to dial your dreams right back. The urban homeless can get by on handouts and recycling, but that's because their dreams are extremely modest.

       You can't live without money. Even if you are off grid, the land you live on, if it is yours, will have taxes to be paid. If it is not yours, you will have to pay rent to the person that does own it.
      </p>

       Posts like this are why I talk about the need for socialism. This is literally the argument for socialism, and it's been made independently of Marx before anyone's been triggered into some tirade against me already. There are no commons. You have no means to survive. This is because all property has been made private property and is primarily being held by a privileged few. You are allowed by them to work, to produce goods that profit them the most (not which society necessarily needs), and rewarded in their money to spend at their stores and to pay to their banks and landlords as you pay your rent and mortgage. And you eat up a good 40, 50+ years of your life like this, if we'll ever be lucky enough to retire at all with the way things are going. The entire time they control your political system and given you the illusion of a chance to influence things, if you even can independently

       a choice as you're flooded with their propaganda and their education.
      </p>
      <p>
       Socialism isn't about free stuff or "other people's money," it is fundamentally about rectifying the horrific effects capitalism has on us all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine you might want to argue against me, but the only difference between my views and yours are that in my opinion,
       <strong>
        <em>
         because there is no alternative but to work for another's profit to survive
        </em>
       </strong>
       , the working man is
       <strong>
        <em>
         exploited
        </em>
       </strong>
       - not a sucker. Those who defend this state of affairs are suckers, but the rest of us should be truly outraged at how we are made to live.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before I end, I'd like to leave a quote from Peter Kropotkin's
       <em>
        The Conquest of Bread
       </em>
       . He's an anarchist philosopher who was born a Russian prince, but became a radical following his disgust with how the Russian peasantry were treated as subhuman beings. He spent the next forty or so years of his life in exile, traveling to various European countries, and generally agitating the working classes. He was
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a Marxist, by the way, he thoroughly hated Marxism and was disgusted with what the Bolsheviks did to the Soviet Union. However, he was such a respected figure that following his death he was allowed a state funeral by Lenin, marking the last time the anarchists would be allowed a public display in the USSR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the quote:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In our civilized societies we are rich. Why then are the many poor? Why this painful drudgery for the masses? Why, even to the best-paid workman, this uncertainty for the morrow, in the midst of all the wealth inherited from the past, and in spite of the powerful means of production, which could ensure comfort to all, in return for a few hours of daily toil?
       </p>
       <p>
        The socialists have said it and repeated it unwearyingly. Daily they reiterate it, demonstrating it by arguments taken from all the sciences. It is because all that is necessary for production – the land, the mines, the highways, machinery, food, shelter, education, knowledge – all have been seized by the few in the course of that long story of robbery, enforced migration and wars, of ignorance and oppression, which has been the life of the human race before it had learned to subdue the forces of Nature. It is because, taking advantage of alleged rights acquired in the past, these few appropriate today two-thirds of the products of human labour, and then squander them in the most stupid and shameful way. It is because, having reduced the masses to a point at which they have not the means of subsistence for a month, or even for a week in advance, the few can allow the many to work, only on the condition of themselves receiving the lion’s share. It is because these few prevent the remainder of men from producing the things they need, and force them to produce, not the necessaries of life for all, but whatever offers the greatest profits to the monopolists. In this is the substance of all socialism.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Before anyone tries to argue with me about socialism (since I still expect triggered pro capitalist defenders), socialism describes a wide range of economic and political philosophies primarily associated by support for the social ownership of the means of production. That organization of society each individual ideology within that range, however, varies widely, and socialism therefore does not mean "the central government owns everything like in 1984," and I'm not going to respond to arguments which ignore that. In fact, speaking of, George Orwell was himself a socialist- fighting with the anarchists in
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Catalonia">
        Revolutionary Catalonia
       </a>
       during the Spanish Civil War. 1984 was a condemnation of authoritarianism, not socialism. There are socialist ideologies which advocate a decentralization of authority more complete than any other philosophy I've encountered. Even anarcho-capitalist societies involve workers submitting to an authoritarian, exploitative dynamic, as should be clear to anyone who understands the implication of private property ownership I've explained above. An example would be the very
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism">
        anarcho-syndicalism
       </a>
       of the anarchists with whom Orwell fought.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is essentially the ownership of the means of production by the workers themselves, either directly or via trade unions, with larger political units of syndicates of these workplaces. The workers decide upon organization and operation themselves, democratically, and no- that does not mean that "everybody gets paid the same." Doesn't that sound like a point of contention upon which you could... vote? The workers could decide upon a meritocratic hierarchy of pay, and a transparent method of deciding responsibilities. It may not be perfect, but it sounds a hell of a lot better than CEOs making tens of thousands of dollars an hour, and thirty million in a golden parachute for crashing a company, while you slave away for 3% more than you made last year (don't forget that 2.2% inflation!). And since it's democratic, feel free to offer ideas of your own on how to efficiently and fairly run your workplace.
      </p>
      <p>
       In closing, please think about the things I've said, and think on whether you are truly free when a vanishingly small group of people dictate the terms of your existence and very survival.

       Great post. Maybe this goes to the heart of why the American elites hate the Russians so much (pure speculation on my part, don't take it too seriously guys).

       Those who actually understand what Socialism is, and are against it, are generally people who fantasize about becoming part of the exploititave elite, or already are part of it.

       Consider this, the most impactful thing feminism did was getting millions of women into the workforce to fulfill the income requirement of inflation which requires two incomes to appreciate the same benefits that only required one income in the past.

       Becoming self employed should be the absolute goal. Make very good $/h so that you can cover your yearly costs of humble living with very little effort. But keep your $/pa low so you have low tax burden and don't feed the machine (though that is bs anyway, government borrows however much it needs). And then just grow your own vegetables, participate in barter, use cryptocurrencies wherever possible. It's all kinda fucked tbh though... can't live a comfy life without big sacrifices. The point of progressive income tax and tax on property (as outlined in the protocols) is not even to fund socialist policies or redistribute wealth or anything like that. It's only to keep the slave class poor and reduce social mobility.

       There's some things you can't avoid living in this world. I want to talk about one of the things you can avoid. Why are the people wise to the shit in this world still bringing kids into this world? I can see the people that "woke up" after they already had kids. What about the ones that currently don't have kids and sill want to have them? Why are you going to do that to innocent lives?! Do you still enjoy this cruel lab rat experiment enough to the point where you'll drag your kids into being players in this shit?  What gives?

       I like your attitude and examples, but you're referencing two different worlds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Living off the land, growing things in your own back yard, living off the grid and not working for a big company are one way of life, like the natives and tribes used to live. And that's great if you're into that and want to live that kind of - forgive my oversimplifcation - backward and ancient life.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then you bring up the example of man flying over an ocean, and peasants being able to board a ship or fly across the ocean on a weeks salary. This example and this ability we all have goes specifically against your previous example of living off the land, not supporting big corporations and living 'off the grid'. Ships and planes and this forum and affordable chair you're sitting on are only possible due to culminated effort and work (sometime mind-numming, office drudgery) of thousands and milliions of people working in conjuction in a sophisticated and specialized society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes it sucks that we are all becoming more and more specialized and we can't do everything we want to all the time, nor do we know how to do half the things our ancestors could do. But that's all for the 'luxuries' and comforts we take for granted while we bitch and moan on our keyboards about corporations; meanwhile we can afford to access the world on the internet affordably and take vacations across the world at an affordable price, specifically because of the complex and specialized society we've built.
