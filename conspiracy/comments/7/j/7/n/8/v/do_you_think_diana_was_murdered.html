       Indeed. What people do not realize is, in Royalty, children are not children, and family is not family. Merely, assets and commodities. Expendable... Marxists should love royalty. Got to crack a few eggs to make an omelette..

       Keep kicking hornet's nests. I have a comment sitting at -50 (here), after being linked in TMOR. What a coincidence (no brigade - totes)... Speak your mind, and don't back down,

       They may or may not be, IDK (nor do I care, for that matter), but, what TPTB hate is people speaking their minds, especially if it goes against their narrative and gains traction...

       I think she was killed at a time that was very convenient for the Royal Family. I think if she had stayed alive, she might have taken the monarchy down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not convinced that she was killed for any of the reasons that the father of her boyfriend espouses, however - she wasn't pregnant, she wasn't serious with her boyfriend and about to marry him, etc.

       Mate seat belts save hundreds of thousands of lives each year. Who was the only person to survive the accident? The bloke wearing his seatbelt. If you want to put together a story involving a cast of hundreds and omit the facts and truth to produce your own narrative knock yourself out.

       I admit I can't prove anything. It's a theory. Why I post in r/conspiracy not r/news. Then with all the speed cameras and security cameras not working no one can say anything beyond reasonable doubt regarding Diana death, whether it be an accident or murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes if Diana had worn a seatbelt, she would not have suffered the injuries she suffered. No argument whatsoever. Still even with minor injuries the ambulance would have been required and that is the really suspicious and strange part of her death. I think that is where she was killed or more probable finished off.

       Can  say with Martin Luther King Jr their are allegations (which I believe as credible) that King survived gunshots in Memphis but was killed by a doctor in operating theatre. This doctor cleared the operating theatre and killed the great man.

       It was the ambulance where Diana was killed. The ambulance stopping like it did is strange -and the ambulance would have been called regardless of seat belts being worn and so the trip would have happened, and cardiac arrest still have occured. Spoken to nurses while working at a hospital and most found that trip to hospital and ambulance stopping the way it did strange.

       As for a hundred facts about Diana death I don't know as I have never counted. Just many amazing happenstances that will stop people ever knowing the truth - like a whole series of speed cams and security cams that would have shed light on the whole mess all not working on the night.

       And she wasn't wearing the seat belt cause it was not working that time. The paparazzi arrived within minutes, so they were not there when the accident occurred. The first to arrive were people who saw the accident among them a doctor.  The ambulance took over an hour to arrive, the hospital is minutes away from the tunnel. If she was having a massive heart attack why did the ambulance stop half the  away  for 15 minutes when they  we're so close to the hospital.

       I have watched, read looked and used common sense. So many of the factors that lead to the death of Di where in the hands of the people in the car. And to try and implicate those trying to save her life is misleading and without evidence. Without question some mistakes were made. But made because of her injuries and concern about stabilising her before moving her.

       Nah he lingered for a few days, however the murdered at the hospital theory is weak as fuck.  Bleeding often leads to death.  My descending aorta was torn in a car wreck luckily my own odd blood was on hand for another surgery planned for a week after the wreck.  I arrested twice and spent two weeks in a coma.Point is if given o universal donor blood my body probably goes into shock and shuts the rest of the way down rather than recuperating.
