        <h3 class="title">Peter Strzok is Andrew McCabe</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">47</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-12-12 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/starleato.html">starleato</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Peter Strzok (pronounced stroke) Strokes his Peter. That, my friends, is a fake name. Like Petraeus and &quot;betray us&quot; only this time its much more blatant.</p>

<p>&quot;Strzok&quot; is gibberish and is two letters away from &quot;stroke.&quot; By replacing the &quot;E&quot; with a &quot;Z&quot;, the DO&quot;J&quot; fools millions of people with a fake name that, one might say, is just &quot;two: E,Z&quot; (too easy) to fool you with. All under the guise of &quot;national security&quot; as per <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Mundt_Act">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithâ€“Mundt_Act</a></p>

<p>McCabe and &quot;Strzok&quot; have the EXACT same counter-intelligence backgrounds.
They gave the same &quot;dog and pony&quot; interviews to clinton mills and abedin which were unprecedented. Who gives suspects of the same investigation the SAME non-taped interview? A clintonite put-up maybe? Strzok is starting to sound like McCabe. </p>

<p>They both deliberately used fake intelligence to sabotage a sitting president by providing &quot;intel&quot; from chris steele for a FISA warrant.
Or at leat, we&#39;re &quot;suspicious&quot; of it. So is congress.</p>

<p>They were both on the mueller witch hunt.
They both are &quot;next in line&quot; counter intelligence agents
They were both recently demoted</p>

<p>Strzok changed Hillary&#39;s report from &quot;grossly negligent&quot; (the statute) to &quot;extremely careless.&quot; Those are synonymous. Which begs the question why change it? Is counter-intelligence a euphemism for espionage in the DO&quot;J&quot;? Yes.</p>

<p>Strzok was sending thousands of texts (exchanging intelligence) with &quot;Lisa Page,&quot; FBI lawyer part of Mueller&#39;s team. Lisa Page (Lease a Page (lease a dossier?)) gets intel from Mueller investigation, then texts &quot;Strzok&quot; (McCabe) who gets FISA warrant, then the intel from FISA surveillance goes back to Mueller.</p>

<p>But &quot;Strzok&quot; will never respond to the congressional subpoenas because he doesn&#39;t exist. It&#39;s Mccabe. It&#39;s definitely McCabe on paper. If you were attempting espionage via the DOJ, why would you give house oversight the opportunity to subpoena you? You wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>If you were the FBI you would make up a fake name with a wink (I Stroke my Peter EZ) and attach McCabe&#39;s credentials to corroborate the bias narrative. Then, since no one has ever heard of him, you release a stock photo of someone in a tie with an american flag to the mockingbird media. And say &quot;this is him.&quot; </p>

<p>That way, if youre a co-conspiritor in espionage (McCabe) you can discredit the russia investigation and therefore stop Flynn&#39;s (house/military/mossad intel) testimony by leaking a political bias.
At the same time, you throw off congressional subpoenas with the fake name and picture all over the &quot;news.&quot;</p>

<p>Otherwise you get caught before you impeach Trump.</p>

<p>If you get caught committing espionage (with FusionGPS) and you killed people in the process, you are an ENEMY COMBATANT OF THE STATE and will be treated as such by the military and military intel. Like pence and flynn. Betsy DeVos&#39;s brother knows where MANY bodies are buried.. 
That&#39;s why you sabotage flynns testimony.</p>

<p>4000+ sealed indictments across country..
Mueller would never publicly indict himself and his friends unless he was forced to..
Until then it&#39;s &quot;sealed&quot; from view
He&#39;d rather impeach trump for &quot;obstruction&quot; of &quot;justice.&quot;</p>

<p>TL;DR
Strzok is a fake name. It&#39;s the FBI (McCabe) hiding from congressional oversight and sabotaging Flynn&#39;s testimony against them. Otherwise they get caught for espionage.
If Trump can prove the DOJ was paid to conspire against him, then that opens a can of hellfire for the clintonites.</p>

<p>Trump helped take down bigger money than the Clintons in his ally Prince Salman&#39;s power struggle against Al Waleed bin Talal. 
Don&#39;t you think he&#39;d return the favor?
Or was the takedown part of the favor?..
No more clinton slush fund funnel from SA..
No more money means the rats turn on eachother. </p>

<p>The storm is picking up.. the house of cards is blowing down..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might be nothing, but I entered &quot;Peter Strzok&quot; in quipqiup dot com, which is an automated cryptogram solver. One of the results it came back with was &quot;state daemon&quot;. Wikipedia says a &quot;daemon&quot; is a &quot;computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user&quot;. I&#39;m not sure if this lends any credence to your theory but I thought I&#39;d share. New to reddit btw. Appreciate any points. </p>
