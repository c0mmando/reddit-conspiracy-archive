       Its not so much flat earth as it is...what are we truly able to achieve in regards to space travel?
      </p>
      <p>
       How far up can we truly go?
If we've been in "space" for X amount of years what is keeping us from going further with the ISS. From what I remember the ISS has been traveling in the same pattern at the same height since its first orbit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing that blows my mind is the shuttle docking with the ISS with never so much as a glitch while traveling 17,300 mph....this thing travels 10 x faster than a bullet fired from a gun but, docking to an object going that fast is no problem at all!
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA does a lot of fucky shit....the visible harnesses on the astronauts in clips...
      </p>
      <p>
       Air bubbles popping up out of nowhere ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Green screen use on many videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA admitting many if not all pictures of earth are composites and Photoshoped....
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=e-kUH942awQ">
        That video of that NASA guy trying to answer simple questions and falling on his face
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If people really believe we sent a rover to mars, landed flawlessly and drove around like wall-e i have a bridge and stars for sale.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the same group who went to the moon "wink-wink" 50 years ago and decided....yeah...we went there with technology from the 60s and have zero ambitions of ever going back.....
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be like finding the lost city of atlantis and saying....that was really cool to see once....no need to explore it anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not saying the earth is flat...I'm just saying NASA is full of shit and burns billions of tax dollars playing space man with zero accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think we landed on the moon then you probably believe in Santa.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe we have a rover on Mars you probably believe in the tooth fairy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe NASA uses your tax dollars wisely you probably try to find the end of rainbows and can't figure out where the fuck the pot of gold is.

       They don't even say they have zero ambition of going back; you can find things on the NASA website and an ex astronaut in an interview expressing that going "back" to the moon would be the next logical and necessary step in space exploration. Not to mention other countries with "plans" for lunar missions. So it's just all bullshit. All they do now is make "announcements" and hint at future "announcements."
      </p>
      <p>
       Even people who believe in the ISS can't even state the significance of it or any practical benefits of anything they have allegedly done up there. NASA's cover is slipping more every day, evidenced by how your very well-stated comment has already been downvoted and one of the usual NASA damage-control shills has already shown up to this thread.

       There is lots of science done on the ISS, especially pertaining to long term space living. This includes human research, space medicine, life sciences, physical sciences, astronomy and more. Things like fire suppression in space, growing plants in space, effects of space on the human body for extended periods. And more

       Grown the first plants in space, reproduced (small)animals in space, learned about how to suppress fire in space. While there is more, much more, much of it falls under medicine. We have a whole range of medicinal practices we use, now we are learning, through the ISS, what works in space and what doesn't, and how long term space living affects the human body.

       How can they admit something they never hid?

       NASA never passed off a composite without telling people. People who think they hide this are just people who havent researched it.

       NASA tells people every single time an image has been touched up or is a composite.

       Im in no way calling you a retard but do you reply to comments based on what you what someone tells you..or by what you can visually see.
I get what you're saying about the coffee thing but traveling 70mph and traveling at 17,000 mph are to different things....
      </p>

       Hey Neil...were at 10,432 mph...we need to step it up 7000 mph to get anywhere close to catching up to that garbage can.
      </p>
      <p>
       No visual documents have ever shown the process of a shuttle catching up with and docking with the ISS...no boosters firing and positioning itself to it...do you realize just how hard it would be to let's say be 1 foot away from the ISS 8tand at 17,000 mph fire your boosters to aline it to millimeters of said position?
Come on man....lets be realistic.

       I'm so for wanting to believe it to be true but ..... I've come to realize it's all smoke and mirrors.

       They never denied modifying the pics, its right in press release and right on their website. If you have a satellite only a few hundred miles above the Earth its not far enough away to take a full photo. For that you would have to look up images from the DSCOVR EPIC satellite.

       Since they take square photos of every bit of the Earth over the course of days or even weeks weather patterns will change. They stitched the pics together to make coherent images  instead of a storm being chopped up into a jumbled mess, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the size discrepancies of continents look at this image and it should make more sense.

       What an odd way to call someone retarded...

       So I met a FEer in a bar and listened to him rant about the FE and after that I did my research. Even with the absence of NASA its pretty trivial to prove the Earth is a globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       FE might explain a phenomena or two but when you put the whole thing together it contradicts itself many times over.

       What happens to test pilots when they go 7k mph? Which they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing. Its the acceleration that is felt not the speed. These are called reference frames.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you explain why going that fast would be impossible? It seems like youre saying "But its soooo fast!" without explaining what that means.

       Im not sure how much youve looked into that if you make that claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many videos of shuttles and ships docking with the ISS. Also worth noting that many positioning thrusters dont make cones like you would see on liftoff, so its not a very good test to evaluate whats going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be like saying I cant see exhaust on a  Tesla so they arent moving.

       Not if both are moving at the same speed or close to it. Yeah its hard but not impossible.
      </p>

       Seriously go look up reference frames since you dont know what they are yet.

       If you and a buddy are moving the same speed on the highway going 70 moving 1mph faster isnt that difficult.

       Yes most or all photos from any sort of scientific instrument are photoshopped. This is no secret. They are science instruments that usually image in the infrared or uv spectrums. They change the colour so it looks more like how we would see it. In some cases too, it may be multiple images are "stitched" together to make one image, due to field of view, camera resolution etc.
So they have photos showing a round earth. Where are the flat earth ones?
