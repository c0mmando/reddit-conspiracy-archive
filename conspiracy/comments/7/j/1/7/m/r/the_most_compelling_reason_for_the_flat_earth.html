    <div class="md"><p>Its not so much flat earth as it is...what are we truly able to achieve in regards to space travel?</p>

<p>How far up can we truly go?
If we&#39;ve been in &quot;space&quot; for X amount of years what is keeping us from going further with the ISS. From what I remember the ISS has been traveling in the same pattern at the same height since its first orbit.</p>

<p>The thing that blows my mind is the shuttle docking with the ISS with never so much as a glitch while traveling 17,300 mph....this thing travels 10 x faster than a bullet fired from a gun but, docking to an object going that fast is no problem at all!</p>

<p>NASA does a lot of fucky shit....the visible harnesses on the astronauts in clips...</p>

<p>Air bubbles popping up out of nowhere ...</p>

<p>Green screen use on many videos.</p>

<p>NASA admitting many if not all pictures of earth are composites and Photoshoped....</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=e-kUH942awQ">That video of that NASA guy trying to answer simple questions and falling on his face</a></p>

<p>If people really believe we sent a rover to mars, landed flawlessly and drove around like wall-e i have a bridge and stars for sale.</p>

<p>This is the same group who went to the moon &quot;wink-wink&quot; 50 years ago and decided....yeah...we went there with technology from the 60s and have zero ambitions of ever going back.....</p>

<p>It would be like finding the lost city of atlantis and saying....that was really cool to see once....no need to explore it anymore. </p>

<p>Im not saying the earth is flat...I&#39;m just saying NASA is full of shit and burns billions of tax dollars playing space man with zero accountability.</p>

<p>If you think we landed on the moon then you probably believe in Santa.</p>

<p>If you believe we have a rover on Mars you probably believe in the tooth fairy.</p>

<p>If you believe NASA uses your tax dollars wisely you probably try to find the end of rainbows and can&#39;t figure out where the fuck the pot of gold is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t even say they have zero ambition of going back; you can find things on the NASA website and an ex astronaut in an interview expressing that going &quot;back&quot; to the moon would be the next logical and necessary step in space exploration.

<p>They never denied modifying the pics, its right in press release and right on their website. If you have a satellite only a few hundred miles above the Earth its not far enough away to take a full photo. For that you would have to look up images from the DSCOVR EPIC satellite. </p>

<p><a href="https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/">https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/</a></p>

<p>Since they take square photos of every bit of the Earth over the course of days or even weeks weather patterns will change. They stitched the pics together to make coherent images  instead of a storm being chopped up into a jumbled mess, for example. </p>

<p>As for the size discrepancies of continents look at this image and it should make more sense. </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/lsuPddO">https://imgur.com/lsuPddO</a></p>

<p>Different satellites using different lenses and focal lengths, this is photography 101. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>What an odd way to call someone retarded... </p>

<p>So I met a FEer in a bar and listened to him rant about the FE and after that I did my research. Even with the absence of NASA its pretty trivial to prove the Earth is a globe. </p>

<p>FE might explain a phenomena or two but when you put the whole thing together it contradicts itself many times over. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey Neil...were at 10,432 mph...we need to step it up 7000 mph to get anywhere close to catching up to that garbage can.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What happens to test pilots when they go 7k mph? Which they do.</p>

<p>Nothing. Its the acceleration that is felt not the speed. These are called reference frames. </p>

<p>Can you explain why going that fast would be impossible? It seems like youre saying &quot;But its soooo fast!&quot; without explaining what that means. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>No visual documents have ever shown the process of a shuttle catching up with and docking with the ISS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Im not sure how much youve looked into that if you make that claim. </p>

<p>There are many videos of shuttles and ships docking with the ISS. Also worth noting that many positioning thrusters dont make cones like you would see on liftoff, so its not a very good test to evaluate whats going on. </p>

<p>It would be like saying I cant see exhaust on a  Tesla so they arent moving. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>.do you realize just how hard it would be to let&#39;s say be 1 foot away from the ISS 8tand at 17,000 mph fire your boosters to aline it to millimeters of said position?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not if both are moving at the same speed or close to it. Yeah its hard but not impossible. </p>

<p>Seriously go look up reference frames since you dont know what they are yet. </p>

<p>If you and a buddy are moving the same speed on the highway going 70 moving 1mph faster isnt that difficult. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m so for wanting to believe it to be true but ..... I&#39;ve come to realize it&#39;s all smoke and mirrors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then prove it. You are just saying things without support. Im sorry but you arent giving me any reason to not believe the things I can see with my own eyes. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m in no way trying to belittle you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are and not in a very subtle way. </p>

<p>In almost every FE debate Ive been in FEers tend to jump to ad hominems almost immediately like you have. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>NASA does so much fucky shit it causes people to question it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, we dont need NASA to figure out the shape of our planet. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moon lander was tested a couple times and each time it failed miserably..fast forward to JFK announcing it would put a man on the moon and low and behold they had zero problems achieving</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet we have man made reflectors on the moon and you can go look at the junk we left including foot and vehicle paths. </p>

<p>I dont think youve done as much research as you claim. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have clips so they can tie on at certain locations when they don&#39;t want to float away.</p>

<p>Yes most or all photos from any sort of scientific instrument are photoshopped. This is no secret. They are science instruments that usually image in the infrared or uv spectrums. They change the colour so it looks more like how we would see it. In some cases too, it may be multiple images are &quot;stitched&quot; together to make one image, due to field of view, camera resolution etc.
So they have photos showing a round earth. Where are the flat earth ones?</p>
