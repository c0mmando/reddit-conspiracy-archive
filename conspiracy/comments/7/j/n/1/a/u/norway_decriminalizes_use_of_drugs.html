    <div class="md"><p>Yes, in Finland it seems to be the same too. The professionals don&#39;t give a damn where or what you get if you&#39;re seeking help, only how much you use and when. They want a urine sample every now and then to keep track of your progress. At no point are cops involved, and sometimes not even a big drug rehab -clinic. You deal directly with a friendly young professional who you can talk to about movies, video games or comics as you discuss a personal plan to quit the drugs you use.</p>

I&#39;ve seen people be thrown in drunk tanks and stuff if they&#39;re drunk in public but that&#39;s not even a criminal thing in itself, they just let you leave when you&#39;ve sobered up. People processing drugs, especially large amounts that are likely going to be distributed are the individuals getting into trouble with the law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, sorry, I got mixed up. But they absolutely can arrest you for being high, especially if you&#39;re driving (that&#39;s what DWI is for, it&#39;s a DUI when they can&#39;t quantify HOW fucked up you are like with a breathalyzer). 
And if you&#39;re obviously/visibly high enough, you can absolutely get arrested for public intoxication. Probably not gonna happen on weed but if you&#39;re nodding really bad from dope or clearly tripping they can and absolutely will take you to jail. Again, I&#39;ve seen it happen (my city has even shittier police than most of you can&#39;t tell).  I&#39;ve seen it happen from both dxm and dope/benzoes. And tons of people o know have gotten DWI&#39;s. </p>

<p>And another thing Americans can learn from.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems to me, do let me know if I am off base though, that this exact sentiment could have been conveyed without the pseudo-intellectual, &quot;grey poop-ony&quot; air of smug superiority/dripping condescension and, FWIW, I would have merely agreed with your post 100%.</p>

<p>Instead, I almost feel compelled to ask what Norway&#39;s stance will be on drugs when Koranic Law becomes the new law of the land. Or what happens when Norway&#39;s super neato, warms the heart and looks great on paper(unless looking at the financial reality of it), super welfare financial state goes the way of Greece? As anyone merely looking at the numbers can fairly easily concluded this is a matter of when and not if -- barring a massive change in policy that will never in reality get close to occurring. But meh it&#39;s not worth the time, TBH.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah okay! Normally you would have to stay in Norway for seven years legally without citizenship, and you do that by applying for a extended visa every year I think, take norwegian classes, pass norwegian test, confirm you are who you say you are, and its more challanging if you have a criminal record.

<p>If you have traveled the usa, you know ideas nationally are just as if not more diverse than we see in europe. A single region or state in the usa adopting a policy may affect millionons more than a single nation in europe. Until the eu can be progressive enough to adopt a policy, it&#39;s laughable to think the entire US under national laws would beat them to it. Regions and cultures differ. Stares rights are on par with european nations individual rights. Be happy with the small victories and travel more.</p>

<p>You bring up a good point about population, I hadn&#39;t even considered that, I was just thinking from a culture standpoint. Just think how different the people are from west coast, to Deep South, to Midwest, etc in everything from politics, to cuisine, dialect, and religious intensity (let&#39;s face it there&#39;s not much diversity on that front in the US, it&#39;s just various shades of Christians with little pockets of other stuff, the only diversity is how bad the Christians are in an area). </p>

<p>The major problem with splitting it up though is there&#39;s a lot of states that are mostly kept afloat through federal programs, a lot of people would probably suffer even more while more wealth was further consolidated in a few cities. 
Still.. it&#39;d be really nice to not have the whole country&#39;s policies dragged down by backwards fucking fundamentalists in The south or Midwest. (And I say this as someone who lives in the south and knows first hand how terrible they are).<br/>
I guess America is just kind of fucked no matter which direction we go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of those differences in regional culture you mention in the US exist in Norway, too. Different regions speak entirely different dialects (to the point of being hard to understand), have different food customs, different folk music. Hell, they had to invent another kind of Norwegian language just to accommodate the differences in spoken language between regions of the country.</p>

<p>You know what? The US is just as culturally &#39;homogenous&#39; as Norway. The same shit is shown on TV in New York as Atlanta as LA as Seattle. The NFL dominates on Sunday. Everything gets pre-empted for the state of the Union. The Oscars are on TV in the spring.</p>

<p>What you fail to realize when you attempt to canonize this &#39;huge difference&#39; in America vs a country you&#39;ve decided is so &#39;homogenous&#39; is that what you&#39;re really saying is that there&#39;s more white people. You&#39;re saying that it wouldn&#39;t work here because there are more minorities. You may not think that&#39;s what it sounds like, but your ignorance (which isn&#39;t by definition bad) of the difference between a regional culture structure and a national culture structure makes you look foolish.</p>

Plus they also have more support (and unchecked power in every branch of government)now for things like repealing the Johnson amendment, teaching creationism in public schools, and every other shitty thing they&#39;ve been trying for the past 20 years and just barely been stopped on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for pointing out that i appear foolish and ignorant. Your assumptions aside and my now pointed out inaccuracies, i stand by my interest and hypothesis that it is easier to manage policy in a nation of 5.5 million vs 325.5 million. It would be ignorant of you (which isn&#39;t bad by definition) to believe otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, depends where you live. Drunk in public is SUPER easy to get where I live. Cops hang out outside bars and will harass you for stepping off the curb wrong even if you aren&#39;t drunk. And I think I&#39;m pretty qualified to speak on that one since I work in a bar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Unless you start a fight or otherwise break another law while being drunk in public you will more than likely just be let out in the morning. &quot; 
How many times has this good fortune happened to you? If you have never experienced this yourself and then got let out without a charge, you&#39;re just shouting an uneducated opinion. </p>
