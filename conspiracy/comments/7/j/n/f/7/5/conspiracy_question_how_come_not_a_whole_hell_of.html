       You'd think a whole lot more weirdos out there whole have done similar stuff since.. yet they haven't. What's up with that? Been a long while too. Any incidents since, you can recall, which may be more obscure?

       I'm familiar with a bit about it.. I used to listen to hard rock in the 80's.. wasn't into that Pantera stuff.. Wasn't he shot by a fan member.. For this "conspiracy" stuff.. it'd have to be more "mainstream" where the average public would give a fuck, eh. So that type of stuff doesn't really fit in. For the reason being, any changes they may do, wouldn't make much of a difference. For whatever reason.. Any of anything with whatever, is always about the "WHY". So, your dimebag stuff.. what's the WHY, about any conspiracy, right.. Doesn't really fit in to the general public even knowing who it is. That one was just some nut.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm wondering about was how come, nothing since then. Back during the Lennon time, 1980, was a few incidents.. him, Reagan.. then nobody recalls this odd occurence of the black dude.. Bob Marley.. but, that's how they make it look.. How about Bon Scott too, 1980. Was a weird time.. and oh, nobody these days, goes down like back then. hmm. Not since, well, prince, bowie, Witney.. Then goes back.. MJ.. 97.. Hutchence.. who knows who else.. hmmm.
      </p>
      <p>
       But not many "fans" going, "berzerk", where they gun one of them down. So, you'd have to "wonder" about those previous ones, back in those days, wouldn't you. Particularly these days, where you can easily track any of them down to their homes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere fact that none of this odd shit has occured since then, is the red flag.

       I think at work the other week, on the TV there, saw some kind of trailer commercial for like some movie with Ricky Martin was in it, about the Versace stuff in the 90's.. Other than that.. how come not too many "celebs" have been taken out like John Lennon. Seems to me, it probably is, haha.., "them", who does it, that's why.

       Seems like they're kinda getting away from getting rid of them in recent decades though. Everybody conforms.

       Right and left wing are just two hands to bring everyone into their system under their master: The Profit. It's an cycle of give and take played to increase long term power and controll. ... All in the name of a nebula of motivations kept in careful ballance. Sort of game of hoped for ends justify the regretable means :/

       There are great leangths that are taken to only MAKE celebrities out of those who can be controlled or fit the agenda/narrative. Dont have to gun them down if you dont allow them to be celebrities to begin with.

       Celebs do get stalkers a lot but thankfully not many murders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bjork famously had an acid bomb sent to her by a crazy fan who killed himself (vids on youtube including his suicide).
      </p>
      <p>
       Kendal Jenner had someone in her house not that long ago and there was a court case. I don’t know much about it, I think he was more just crazy and not wanting to hurt her.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we hear about failed plots quite often, like plots to kidnap celebs, and of course Kim Kardashian was target of robbery etc but I guess it is only a matter of time before there is an attack or terrorists target a celeb or something.

       British food has improved thanks to Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsey, so there is less of a reason to kill. Plus it is politically incorrect to kill people now. Kind of taboo.
