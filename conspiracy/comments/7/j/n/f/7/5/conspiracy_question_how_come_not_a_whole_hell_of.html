<p>Not that he was on lennons level of fame but dimebag dude from pantera.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m familiar with a bit about it.. I used to listen to hard rock in the 80&#39;s.. wasn&#39;t into that Pantera stuff.. Wasn&#39;t he shot by a fan member.. For this &quot;conspiracy&quot; stuff.. it&#39;d have to be more &quot;mainstream&quot; where the average public would give a fuck, eh. So that type of stuff doesn&#39;t really fit in. For the reason being, any changes they may do, wouldn&#39;t make much of a difference. For whatever reason.. Any of anything with whatever, is always about the &quot;WHY&quot;. So, your dimebag stuff.. what&#39;s the WHY, about any conspiracy, right.. Doesn&#39;t really fit in to the general public even knowing who it is. That one was just some nut. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m wondering about was how come, nothing since then. Back during the Lennon time, 1980, was a few incidents.. him, Reagan.. then nobody recalls this odd occurence of the black dude.. Bob Marley.. but, that&#39;s how they make it look.. How about Bon Scott too, 1980. Was a weird time.. and oh, nobody these days, goes down like back then. hmm. Not since, well, prince, bowie, Witney.. Then goes back.. MJ.. 97.. Hutchence.. who knows who else.. hmmm. </p>

<p>But not many &quot;fans&quot; going, &quot;berzerk&quot;, where they gun one of them down. So, you&#39;d have to &quot;wonder&quot; about those previous ones, back in those days, wouldn&#39;t you. Particularly these days, where you can easily track any of them down to their homes. </p>

<p>The mere fact that none of this odd shit has occured since then, is the red flag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think at work the other week, on the TV there, saw some kind of trailer commercial for like some movie with Ricky Martin was in it, about the Versace stuff in the 90&#39;s.. Other than that.. how come not too many &quot;celebs&quot; have been taken out like John Lennon. Seems to me, it probably is, haha.., &quot;them&quot;, who does it, that&#39;s why. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Celebs do get stalkers a lot but thankfully not many murders. </p>

<p>Bjork famously had an acid bomb sent to her by a crazy fan who killed himself (vids on youtube including his suicide). </p>

<p>Kendal Jenner had someone in her house not that long ago and there was a court case. I don’t know much about it, I think he was more just crazy and not wanting to hurt her.</p>

<p>I think we hear about failed plots quite often, like plots to kidnap celebs, and of course Kim Kardashian was target of robbery etc but I guess it is only a matter of time before there is an attack or terrorists target a celeb or something.</p>
