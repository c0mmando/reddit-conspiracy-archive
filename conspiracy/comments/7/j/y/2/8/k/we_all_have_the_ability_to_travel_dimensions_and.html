<p>SEE <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAh0r4C6Q2Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAh0r4C6Q2Q</a>
Most relevant rant from video:</p>

<p>&quot;The elites believe that its not in the 3rd dimension that we&#39;re mainly recieving transmissions. Ships don&#39;t arrive from Alpha Centuri or Geedi Prime (sp?) or wherever they&#39;re coming from. They come here through interdimensional gates that are much closer - through fold space. And so we have to discuss the different influences throughout the universe and our fact that we have free will and we decide what we want. I don&#39;t believe in any of this, I&#39;m simply telling you what the elites believe&quot; .... &quot;Our brain is able to tune into the lowest dimension to the highest dimension - humans are basically really powerful creatures that can live right close to suns that are highly radioactive and nothing else can live this close, we have very short lives because we&#39;re like a hive organism that actually lives second to second in the space time continuum so like a hundred years is a second and we transmit our data up to be able to live next to like these stargate jumpgates that are suns. So because we live so close to these suns we only have like milliseconds to be alive - so we&#39;re actually a hive organism that keeps transmitting up to the next species in our hierarchal system (meaning us third dimensional beings are transmitting to 4th dimensional beings and so on) and then down below us so we&#39;re alive right now in this continuum and we&#39;re trying to progress and make things better and the elites are trying to make sure that we don&#39;t dial into that incredible knowledge we&#39;ve got as a species and basically die as a species so that we&#39;re not competitors on the next level as the bible says of their interdimensional plane.&quot;</p>

<p>So AJ is, of course, the &quot;crazy conspiracy guy&quot; and I don&#39;t believe that is 100% accurate but basically the gist is the Elite believe in interdimensional forces and travel. Now this didn&#39;t go into actual travel but there are many others who do talk of actual travel, for example, this PHD Physicist who claims out of body travel is real and the CIA and various military groups have been utilizing it since the 70s he doesn&#39;t only claim this he actually was one of the leaders of the Stargate Program</p>

<p><a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2016/12/20/cancelled-ted-talk-physicist-contracted-by-cia-shares-everything-he-knows-about-esp/">http://www.collective-evolution.com/2016/12/20/cancelled-ted-talk-physicist-contracted-by-cia-shares-everything-he-knows-about-esp/</a> ^ Phd guys overview</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project</a> ^ read this keeping in mind they, of course, deny everything and claim it was a scam (that they bankrolled Russell Targ for his work on for 15 years) because they couldn&#39;t just come out and be like &quot;yeah psychic powers are real&quot;</p>

<p>Now onto the juicy stuff, the below document go overs the specific method they used to train their soldiers in these abilites Ill drop the best quotes now this is the mind melting shit:</p>

<p>Now lets talk about the techniques they were using, The Gateway Experience is 36 guided meditations where every meditation you repeat a mantra of &quot; I am more than my physical body&quot; with the stated end goal of Out of Body experiences.</p>

<p>I would also like to mention Bob Monroe the Creator of these tapes wrote 2 books of his personal experiences with this phenomenon which i have linked below in their entirety.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ghostcircle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Robert-Monroe-Journeys-Out-Of-The-Body.pdf">http://www.ghostcircle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Robert-Monroe-Journeys-Out-Of-The-Body.pdf</a></p>

<p>Now this was all originally a comment response to this T. Swift Music Video which blatantly shows her watching her astral for mdo whatever it wants while her physical form is wearing ceremonial robes.</p>

<p>Lyrics include:</p>

<p>In the middle of the night, </p>

<p>in my dreams </p>

<p>You should see the things we do, baby</p>

<p>In the middle of the night,</p>

<p>in my dreams</p>

<p>I know I&#39;m gonna be with you</p>

<p>So I take my time </p>

<p><strong>Are you ready for it?&quot;</strong></p>

<p>I also believe when she says &quot;are you ready for it&quot; </p>

<p>She is refferring to the coming disclosure of this phenomenon to the public through this company</p>

They have Hal Puthoff who worked with Russell targ directing the Stargate program for 15 years</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve gotten this far you&#39;re probably pretty open-minded, I am currently going through The Gateway Experience myself but am still in the early stages but from what I have already experienced I can anecdotally confirm that this stuff is real and if you would like to confirm for yourself i may be able to point you in the direction of the gateway experience</p>

<p><strong>Their is a mountain of evidence and symbolism supporting this claim in music videos, movies, and tv shows along with declassifed military documents I encourage any of you who think of anything to post it in the comments to give us all a better understanding of this phenomenon</strong></p>

<p>I encourage you to read that thread and everything they came up with but they took more of a <strong>Pizzagate</strong> angle and missed the very obvious dimensional travel themes.</p>

<ul>
<li>The &quot;monsters&quot; come from another dimension you can only access if you know one of them or already know how</li>
</ul>

<p>Quotes directly from script</p>

<p>&quot;Listen to me.
What goes on down there
is every kid&#39;s fantasy.
imagine, if you will...
imagine a world
solely of kids-
kids that just
want to have fun.
And make trouble.
Trouble?
Trouble is our code of honor.
its our blood,
our life support system.&quot;</p>

<p>Is it just me or does that sound a helluva alot like the INTERDIMENSIONAL VAMPIRES that Alex Jones is always talking about????</p>

<p>Another one</p>

<p>&quot;Brian, it&#39;s about freedom.
Freedom to live life...
the way the creators
of this planet intended&quot;</p>

<p>And another</p>

<p>&quot;This is my favorite place
on the whole planet.
Every craving
you&#39;ve ever craved...&quot;</p>

<p>and an even better one</p>

<p>&quot;You see, down here,
distance is like time.
And time is like...
it&#39;s like polyester
with an acrylon blend.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post and fascinating topic that I&#39;ve been interested in a while now.  This stuff is real...or at least the CIA has come out and said that it is.  <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00791R000100480003-3.pdf">Here</a> is the document from the CIA library describing the experiment they did with famous Israeli illusionist Uri Geller.  The conclusion of the CIA experiment was as follows:</p>

<p>&quot;As a result of Geller&#39;s success in this experimental period, we consider that he has demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner.&quot;  </p>

<p>Geller said some pretty amazing things in <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/18/uri-geller-convinced-cia-psychic-warrior/">this article</a>.  A couple of good quotes from him:</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m mind-blown they&#39;ve released this because there are still remote viewing programmes active, many intelligence agencies use them&quot;...&quot;I did many things for the CIA.  They wanted me to stand outside the Russian Embassy in Mexico, and erase a floppy disc being flown out by Russian agents.  I had to get near someone signing a nuclear deal and bombard him with &#39;sign, sign, sign&#39;&quot;.  He said one international agency, which he wouldn&#39;t name, asked him to kill a pig with his mind.  &quot;I was asked to stop a heart of a pig.  It was probably so they could stop the heart of Andropov who was head of the KGB&quot;.  </p>

<p>Another example of this stuff happening is in <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/17/1734276_re-fw-tactical-remote-viewing-.html">this Stratfor WikiLeaks email</a>.  The employee says:</p>

<p>&quot;We used Remote Viewers in our quest to find the hostages in Beirut. It was pretty interesting.&quot;</p>

<p>I think Alex Jones description is interesting and worthy of more research.  It fits in with a lot of what I personally believe and see happening in the real world.  The elites are going to use the Internet of Things and 5g to collect data on every single thing that we do.  With this data their AI supercomputers will be able to accurately predict most of the choices we make in our lives.  If you want something else to look into along those lines, check out the <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/">Dreamforce conference</a> put on every year by Salesforce.  Salesforce is an under-the-radar company who just signed on with Google to handle their cloud data.  They have also done work in the past with the Gates Foundation collecting the data in 3rd world countries for sterilizations/vaccinations.  The Dreamforce conferences are a cult-like technocratic environment where they lay out the future of tech and AI and talk about how much philanthropy they&#39;re doing in the world and how awesome they are.  Anyway, sorry for the long tangent...but I love this kind of stuff.  </p>
