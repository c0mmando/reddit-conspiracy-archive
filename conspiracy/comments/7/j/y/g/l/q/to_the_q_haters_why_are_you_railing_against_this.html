        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So many are crying Q is just a larp larp larp. Larp for days. </p>

<p>So what? </p>

<p>If we ignore the fact that Q has been dropping some <em>extremely</em> interesting breadcrumbs, and focus on the larp part, it is still very entertaining. </p>

<p>What is a larp? Live action role play, in other words a game. Even if it&#39;s all fake, people are participating willingly and are learning new things in the process. People look forward to new episodes on TV, or perhaps a new book to come out, this is just another version of that. </p>

<p>People also understand what 4chan is. It&#39;s a fucking mess, but a very interesting one at that. </p>

<p>It is baffling to me that people don&#39;t understand this.</p>

<p>Anyways, back to the title, why are you haters railing against Q so hard?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe people feel like it&#39;s toying with people&#39;s hopes, it&#39;s something to keep people occupied and always in a state of expectation that something&#39;s about to happen, good is about to triumph over evil, the world is about to be set right etc, and if it&#39;s a lie then it&#39;s cruel, and it also stops people from taking action themselves to try to set right wrongs.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve no idea if it is a larp or not, but I do believe that the majority of the people who believe in Q are people who care a great deal about injustice and are people who desperately want the world to be a better place - most of them have no idea how to enact the kind of change that&#39;s needed to do that. Most of them are different types of people- so many people don&#39;t really care about anything outside their own little bubble, but people who follow Q avidly, and the conspiracy theorists and the truthers are all people who really care beyond themselves and have a real emotional and often spiritual stake in what happens. So perhaps those who feel convinced it&#39;s all a larp think it&#39;s wrong to string such people along or that it does more harm than good by focusing the energy of those who actually care about justice and making a difference on a fruitless lie instead of on taking positive actual action to make that difference themselves. I dunno. I have no idea whether it&#39;s real or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q supporters kinda just seem like hardcore Trump supporters to me. He even talks about how Trump is the great savior. Seems like a total shill job to me, and one aimed at the conspiracy community. Not surprising considering conservatives have made a concerted effort to broaden their appeal to the conspiracy community (see: this sub)</p>

<p>And that’s also a shame, because I think people would have been far more accepting of Trump if he didn’t spend half of his time campaigning, and let’s be honest in office too, on insulting people on twitter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because he&#39;s a shit-assed cosplay that has 14 year olds worldwide drinking the koolaid. </p>

<p>Literally nothing he has predicted has come up, no connections that aren&#39;t already in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&#39;s shillbasket are made with any more convincing connections than randomly spouted location names and obscure references to unrelated court cases from two decades ago to give the veneer of legitimacy. </p>

<p>I want you to consider this:</p>

<p>The material that Q spews <em>should be right up our alley</em>. All about shadow governments and hidden agendas. </p>

<p>But near universally, when it shows up here it gets voted below zero. </p>

<p>Have you ever wondered why?</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how much dedication and time conspiracyheads pour into sifting falsehood from truth?</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how much practice this gives us in detecting obvious fabrications?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll make it easy: a whole fucking lot of practice, a whole fucking lot of dedication. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s no surprise that we recognize the Q anon bullshit for what it is: A false flag operation designed to 1) discredit actual conspiracyheads, and 2) manipulate cheetos fingered impressionable youth that will go on to be the Q anons of tomorrow. </p>

<p>Of course this is true. There are sometimes too subtle workings for us to pick up, the water slowly boiling and whatnot. </p>

<p>What I will say with q is that even if this event is an act of subversion, it has been going on for quite some time now. With no signs of stopping until it reaches the inevitable conclusion, that is if you believe in it. It is also so overt that you can&#39;t help but admire their boldness even if its all a larp. </p>
