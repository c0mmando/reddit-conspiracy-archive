        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With the fake &#39;scandal&#39; about FBI agents having private opinions it&#39;s obvious that certain people are trying to derail the investigation. I just read an article that a trump supporting super PAC has gotten behind the fire mueller band wagon as well. 
The anti-mueller folks are quick to forget that they liked him in the beginning. That he has just as many connections to republicans as democrats. 
Gingrich is an obvious case of supporting mueller in the beginning and then opposing him once he started actually investigating and not just sweeping everything under the rug.
They don&#39;t like the message so they want to &#39;kill&#39; the messenger. But that doesn&#39;t change any of the facts. 
What I don&#39;t understand is what do they think will happen? 
If the protrump alliance is able to get mueller fired, do they believe the investigation will just end? 
Who do they have waiting to take over that they believe will just drop it? 
What plans do they have in motion to just act like nothing ever happened?
Part of me believes that Mueller has a plan in place for the investigation to continue even if he is fired. Do &#39;they&#39; believe they have that plan already negated?</p>

<p>We&#39;ve already gone from &#39;no-one connected to the trump campaign had any connections to Russia&#39; 
To &#39;yes they did but there&#39;s nothing wrong with it&#39; and &#39;sure, those people who were strongly connected to the campaign have pled guilty or been indicted, but the changes didn&#39;t have anything to do with the campaign&#39; </p>

<p>How are they going to rewrite this portion of history?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did misspeak. I meant anti Clinton and anti trump. And I apologize for that. I wasn&#39;t trying to be misleading but I&#39;m having 4 different conversations on here at the same time.</p>

<p>The point I&#39;m making is that these people have opinions and regardless of those opinions they have a job to do.</p>

<p>Show me a text message or email that insinuates that these agents are ignoring their responsibilities because of those opinions and I&#39;ll hop on the bandwagon. </p>

<p>Can you explain why you feel like these text messages are such a huge deal and how they would or would not effect actual facts? </p>

<p>I believe that If something is true, it&#39;s stays true whether not the person likes the person the truth is about. And likewise if something is untrue it stays untrue regardless etc</p>

<p>Trump is a billionaire, I doubt he would need a penny from manafort. You are stretching an elaborate fairly tale.</p>

<p>What happened? What is Russia supposed to have done? The hacking voting machines turned out not to be true. A few thousand in Facebook ads? Podesta email &#39;hacking&#39;? That alone is laughable because there is no proof Russia did anything, and the DNC refused the FBI access to their servers. In any case, even if in some imaginary world it was Russia, if they were clean it would have been a non story. Instead it showed endemic corruption. I&#39;ve never heard of anyone hacking an election by increasing government transparency.</p>

<p>Later in a text from August 15, 2016, Strzok tells Page: &quot;I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy&#39;s office&quot; -- an apparent reference to Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe -- &quot;that there&#39;s no way he gets elected -- <strong>but I&#39;m afraid we can&#39;t take that risk</strong>. It&#39;s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you&#39;re 40 . . . . &quot; Page does not appear to have responded, according to records reviewed by CNN.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First he mentions not being able to &quot;take that risk&quot; that Trump won&#39;t be elected, and <em>then</em> he mentions having an &quot;insurance policy&quot;.</p>

<p>The <em>context</em> clearly implies that this agent felt something else needed to be done <em>in case Trump won the election</em>.</p>

<p>And then he turns up at the center of an investigation into Trump&#39;s &quot;collusion with the Russians&quot;.</p>

<p>What an amazing coincidence.</p>

<p>No shit dude... I didn&#39;t think this guy had actually taken out an insurance policy that would pay out if Trump was elected.</p>

<p>Of course it is a fucking <em>simile</em> - that the point. This guys is talking about &quot;not taking a chance&quot; in a way that is <em>like</em> having an insurance policy.</p>

<p>The context is clear  - he wanted something to fall back on if Trump was elected... and he found it.</p>
