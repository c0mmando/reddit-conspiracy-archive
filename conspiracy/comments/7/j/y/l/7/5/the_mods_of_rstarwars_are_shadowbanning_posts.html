    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m so tired... </p>

<p>I&#39;m tired of all of it. I&#39;m tired of the endless politics, the awful state of the world, the overflow of information and agendas and not-so-hidden messages. I&#39;m tired of not knowing what to think other than the absolute certainty that I am powerless and will likely never know the truth. I&#39;m tired of being forced by the media into a constant state of agitation about every damn thing while having programming forced on me, all wrapped up in lies and half truths. I&#39;m tired of not one single source for anything being credible anymore.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t I just go to a movie for two hours once a year and disengage without having yet more of the agenda shoved down my throat!? Can&#39;t I be allowed to just put all this aside and relax for one day?</p>

<p>Sorry. Not a productive post I know. But I <em>needed</em> to post it. </p>

<ol>

<p>[SPOILERS BELOW]</p>

<p>Apparently Finn kisses a Chinese woman in the film which will probably drive away their Chinese audiences. And the audience reception here is surprisingly bad compared to the critics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the precious Star Wars movie were far from containing a deep developed sci-fi ideology . However the manner in which the ideas were presented and the significance behind them were definitely more mature then the ones presented today.</p>

<p>I understand your explanation for the introduction of the Orphan girl. In my opinion, it is a way so that the movie can present the Star Wars universe through a basic perspective. It is a way of trying to appeal to everyone but it clearly fails at that because people who want to actually be passionate about the concepts are left with a simplistic representation of them.</p>

<p>I understand that art is art and I am not saying mine is better, I’m saying that is the reason for me no wanting so watch it.  Also categorizing something as “art” does not make it immune to criticism or leave out a hierarchy. One can draw a turd and label it art. That does not mean I should acknowledge it or refrain from discussing its flaws simply because it’s “subjective “ expression of thoughts  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize George Lucas is an extreme liberal who has been married to a black woman for 30+ years right? You realize the cast is openly liberal and vocally against Trump and white supremacists right? You realize Lucas model for the empire was Nazis, so continuing that interpretation is quite valid. So tell me more about how it was &quot;taken over&quot; by leftists when it was created by &quot;leftists&quot; and had those heavy handed messages to begin with. </p>

<p>Why is diversity so evil to You? Why is it that you are so offended when white males(who are only 31% of the population) aren&#39;t the main heroes? But liberals are the snow flakes?</p>

<p>The original inspiration for the Empire was the NSDAP (where do you think the term &quot;stormtrooper&quot; came from?). They empire have always been portrayed as xenophobic and human-supremacist. </p>

<p>But, if you peek behind the veil you can find out that on a &quot;higher&quot; level we are all one. In fact, everything is one and exist out of energy.</p>

<p>The most powerfull energies in this &quot;reality&quot; are fear and Love. Truth will show you the way through this maze we are in, trust will help you along, but Love will shine a light so we don&#39;t need to stumble too much.</p>

<p>Try to see how we are controlled, manipulated and try to find out why &quot;they&quot; do this. It is all falling apart and the veil is raveling fast.</p>
