    <div class="md"><p>I also liked Bernie in the primaries. Went for Stein in the general. I agree completely with everything here. Only thing is that I&#39;d say r/sandersforpresident wasn&#39;t co-opted, it was always intended to shepherd Bernie&#39;s supporters to Clinton once she was installed at the end of the primaries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These allegations have been out for a while now. They certainly didn&#39;t just crop up. And people like you have been bitching about the fact that his victims went away when the election was over. Now that they&#39;re back, you&#39;re bitching about them being a distraction.</p>

<p>Also, the investigation has resulted in two plea deals and two indictments so far. All four hit members of Trump&#39;s campaign team. In what world do people think the left sees the Russia investigation as going nowhere? Seriously, this spin makes no fucking sense. Who on the left is remotely acting like the investigation is over and was a failure?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember people claiming that all of the Bernie supporters would vote for Clinton. I don&#39;t recall that quote in particular anywhere, but people were definitely saying things like that. As if the independents and young people Bernie was bringing in to the Democratic Party would vote for Clinton just because Bernie said to. </p>

Whatever you do, Don&#39;t ever go quiet. Don&#39;t ever be censored. Get banned And create 15 more accounts. They want a war, let&#39;s give it to them.</p>
