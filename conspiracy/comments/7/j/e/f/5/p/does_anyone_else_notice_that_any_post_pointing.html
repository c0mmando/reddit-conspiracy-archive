Went from +20, to +7 in 4 minutes...keep protecting your little puppet and doing the bitch work shills</strong> 😂 I&#39;m getting the inclination they are going to remove this soon, so please archive.</p>

<p>EDIT: I was given gold by an angry anonymous user, who sent me this charming PM (below). He gave me gold, in an attempt to make me look &quot;stupid&quot;, by his own admission. I have never given gold, and didn&#39;t want gold on this post. I&#39;ve been skeptical of the way gold is used to add credibility and creedence to certain posts/comments, and it is money that goes towards Reddit. They are desperate now...</p>

<p>EDIT: Here is a screenshot of some of my comments in this thread being arbitrarily removed due to &quot;rule 10&quot;, which is calling a user a shill. Do these comments break the rules by your standards? Several comments of people calling me a &quot;shareblue agent&quot; in here that are still up. I&#39;m literally defending myself by asking people to look at my post history in these comments, and they were removed. </p>

<p>Keep posting about Trump and raising awareness for his sexual abuse allegations.  For a sub that claims to be non partisan, we need to hold our own president accountable for the same crimes we pursue others for. </p>

<p>Obviously the MO of the social engineers is to protect his &quot;anti establishment&quot; image on conspiracy forums and make him look trustworthy to us so he can do corrupt shit without criticism. They created a cult essentially, and we need to burn that stupid and naive pro government mentality to the fucking ground here once and for all.</p>

<p>Keep sharing about his Epstein relationship and his sexual abuse allegations. If the posts don&#39;t go anywhere (usually vote brigaded I assume), at least it proves the point that it&#39;s being censored and covered up from being a popular topic here.  The users here are the smartest on Reddit, they can see whats BS and whats real. </p>

Do we just accept things based on our own political leanings? I have no problem saying that Weinstein is a major problem for liberals. Can conservatives do the same? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t either, but I have heard innumerable tall tales from guys in similar situations. Many verifiably false, some I knew to be lies as they were being told. Exaggerating manliness is competition, exactly like fishing stories, and dudes are all about competition. Powerful dudes sleep around, wife or no wife. That we don&#39;t or can&#39;t understand the mentality doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>My personal views are murky. </p>

<p>Firstly: Were these assaults, or were these voluntary actions undertaken to further their own careers? I&#39;m not saying they were one or the other, but agreeing (possibly against your better judgement and revulsion) to sleep with a dude to get a part is in no way the same as having been raped by that same dude. And being angry about having done it is no way justification of a rape accusation.</p>

<p>Second: If it truly was rape or assault, which I in no way rule out, then I always find it strange that it can take years and decades before they decide to make their accusations. One would think that a victim would want justice and that desire would burn brightest immediately after the event. But I&#39;m not a woman (the typical, but not exclusive victims of sexual assault, and the focus of our discussion), nor have I been assaulted, so I can&#39;t claim to know the mindset. There is also the fact that the best evidence, and freshest memories will be available closest to the event.</p>

<p>All that said, if assaults were perpetrated, then investigations should be done, and if damning evidence is found then the guilty parties should face justice. Real justice, not bought-and-paid-for justice. However, no one should be upset or surprised when the investigation fizzles out because there is no conclusive evidence to examine a decade after the fact. </p>

<p>Also no-one should have their lives ruined over an unproven allegation, of any type.</p>

He&#39;s been a hot topic in New York state politics for 30 years now and is a celebrity in one of the most influential cities in the world, so almost all the ammunition had already been loaded and spent by the time he actually made his presidential run.

    <div class="md"><p>As a conspiracy theorist, I&#39;ll freely admit that I fell for believing Trump was on the side of conspiracy theorists... For a total of a couple days... During the run up to the election. The only time he had me was straight after the first drain the swamp/lock her up speech. Then I quickly realised he was simply pandering to every base. The incessant Israel lobbying discredited him very quickly after that.<br/>
I think he&#39;s a definitely a creep and likely a rapist, and if he&#39;s being blackmailed for paedo stuff then it&#39;s by Israel. I&#39;m curious of any military interests toward Trump. I remember him mentioning &quot;energies of tomorrow&quot; or something to that effect during his inauguration and that rustled some tesla/ufo disclosure jimmies, but it&#39;s clear that if that ever is Trump&#39;s aim then he&#39;s only doing it to make more money.

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. We need a new sub or something.   Shills on both sides have ruined this place and its pathetic to see so many defending a president. Its laughable to hear them saying that he hasn&#39;t been convicted in a court of law as if that mattered to them when we go after Clinton and others.  The bias is disgusting. Trump has little in common with anti establishment people. Probably nothing. He will say anything to help his position. But when it comes down to it he is an authoritarian who hates the anti establishment people and what they stand for. He is pro police state and pro military as well as pro Saudi Arabia and pro Israel.</p>

<p>Yes. A group of very brainwashed idiots. A lot of trump supporters I see are just big babies who need to have some kind of figure to &quot;lean&quot; on and have hope for defeating the elite.</p>

<p>The rest of us know better. The only way to beat them is to wake the masses. The awakening is underway, and trusting puppet politicians isn&#39;t going to speed shit up, especially if he&#39;s a plant by TPTB, which I believe he is. </p>

This also took place at a time when Trump was extremely desirable in the public eye and quite popular among the ladies.

    <div class="md"><p>Then let&#39;s return to the topic at hand. Donald Trump admitted to molesting women. Hell, by your own admission he is a sleazy prick using his status (just like Weinstein) to take advantage of women. Yet... when Trump does it, it is &quot;OK&quot;? What&#39;s your reasoning for that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never said it was ok.</p>

<p>My contention is that women throughout modern history have proven that they will allow those with wealth, power, and celebrity to get away with things us ordinary mortals would be at the very least slapped for, if not slapped with a lawsuit.  This is a fact; while obviously not every woman ever behaves like this, it happens frequently. </p>

<p>This is why I don&#39;t see this tape as &quot;admitting sexual assault&quot;, as it is a commentary on social dynamics.</p>

<p>If a person were at the club, and they started grinding up on a cute girl. Is that person a rapist? Are they as bad as Trump? Being the exact same behaviour as he describes in the video, just moves in on them. </p>

<p>If that person was at that club and did the same thing with many girls at the club, then goes home and the next day  tells buddies the story how he just went up and grinded on a bunch of hotties (grabbing them from behind, thrusting, touching, all that fun stuff), is that person admitting sexual assault on a massive scale? I mean, none of those women said &quot;yes you may dance in contact with my body&quot;, neither did they say, &quot;stop touching me&quot;.</p>

<p>Trump may do shitty things to women, but if they let him do so, who are we to say otherwise? Those claims against him should definitely be investigated, though I&#39;m not sure what they hope to accomplish now, so far after the fact. Which means they won&#39;t solve anything and you and I will still be having this conversation after the hypothetical investigation closes inconclusively.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure, is there any evidence or court proceedings against Weinstein? I know he was ousted from his company, but that&#39;s not a legal matter, I haven&#39;t heard lately if he&#39;s been charged or anything. If he hasn&#39;t yet, it leads me to believe the things that went on, while sleazy, and abusive, were tacitly consensual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While there are many valid cases where that stereotype of modern women may be applicable, that does not dismiss the actions of those who used their wealth/status/power to take that advantage in the first place.</p>

<p>While the club analogy may slightly work with only the &quot;grab them by the pussy&quot; portion of the quote, it does not work with the rest. Gropers are not rapists. There is unwelcome physical contact, and the victim may feel abused/molested, but they were not raped. That is not all Trump is implying happens, that&#39;s just an example he provides of the things a &quot;star&quot; can get away with.</p>

<p>As for things we should do about Trump being shitty to women, well, all I can say there is let&#39;s not lie to ourselves and pretend it&#39;s nothing because other people do it too.</p>

If I accuse you of sexually assaulting Trump, does it mean that you are automatically guilty?  Clearly not.  The burden of proof is on me to support my allegation.  Since I have no proof that you in fact sexually assaulted Trump, my allegation must be dismissed.  </p>

<p>This post wasn&#39;t THAT controversial that you needed to freak out and defend some fucking douchebag whose personal affairs you truly know nothing about (as do any of us).

<p>What a joke. Your ignorance doesn&#39;t make up for your indifference. Weinstein fled the country, had recordings revealed, and has a widely reported history of past and recent accusations. Weinstein&#39;s a disgusting Hollywood fatfuck, Moore served as a military captain in Nam and served as an Alabama justice. Seriously, what&#39;ve you got on Trump, a misconstrued recording where he says more about women than he says about himself. The attempts to conflate Trump/Moore with these admitted pedos and abusers is disingenuous and transparent as fuck.</p>

<p>LMAO but you have no problem calling him a fucking douchebag. So self-aware. I&#39;ll defend anyone who&#39;s falsely accused, after looking at the case of course.You&#39;re innocent before proven guilty in America, it&#39;s a principle turned legal right and what do you know, they can&#39;t prove shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There just hasn&#39;t been anything to them and the timing is super suspicious.</p>

<p>One accusation that came to mind is the Epstein accuser, who was able to describe Epstein&#39;s &quot;egg shaped&quot; penis, while had no such details about Trump.</p>

<p>Additionally, you have the complete spectrum of Roy Moore allegations versus debunked allegations so nobody who isn&#39;t partisan can really tell what is going on.</p>

<p>What used to be used as a means of forensic interruption is now trying to be swung the other way and it is so obvious, most people are just noping out of this conversation by default.</p>

<p>Worse yet, the goalposts of debate are still being dragged away from Pizzagate, because the majority of these accusations are about sexual harassment or painted as isolated incidents when <em>Pizzagate is about protected political pedophilia that has cult connections and connections to the intelligence community.</em></p>

<p>Remember, Rose McGowan was part of the Children of God cult, rife with pedophilia... but this is what she is outraged about? It is contrived.</p>

<p>One thing is for sure... and this is the problem you partisans face... the news is lying to you almost 100% of the time. Once you realize that, the common agenda reveals itself.</p>

<p>The common agenda is to assert authoritarianism.</p>

<p>You, as people, can reject partisanship and embrace two issues, to stop these psychos.</p>

<p>1) Be engagingly anti-war.</p>

<p>2) Be engagingly pro-transparency.</p>

<p>Eschew drama and attempts to bait you into being emotional and the imposition of these two philosophies at a systemic level solves a tremendous number of problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another huge difference between Moore and Franken. Moore denies the accusations. Accusations which were made only after he could not be replaced on the ballot. If the Republicans had walked away from him they would have been giving the seat away.</p>

<p>So think of the implication, any accusation means you must immediately give up. How is that remotely fair? If Allred&#39;s accusers were so outraged she could have held her press conference a month earlier. Republicans would have deserted Moore and backed someone else, who surely would have won. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like this is a new trick on her part. She pulled it on Schwarzenegger, Trump, Whitman, and those are just the ones that leap to mind. Alabama is strongly republican and some manouver like this was the only chance for the democrats to win, should that really be allowed to work? </p>

<p>Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) isn’t the most naturally gifted guy, but he’s come a long way in life by being ambitious and relentless. So, while many Democrats wanted him to fall on his sword as some sort of bankshot ploy to defeat Roy Moore in Tuesday’s Alabama Senate race and also, somehow, set a precedent to bring Trump down, you’ll notice that he hasn’t, technically speaking, actually resigned.

<p>&quot;Innocent until proven guilty&quot; is for court cases. It doesn&#39;t mean that anyone who is accused of a major crime, for which there is evidence, has to be held to that standard to hold office in the US. Holding government office is a privilege. I don&#39;t know if I would throw a person in jail based solely on the facts that they just walked out of a room covered in blood, holding a bloody knife, while smiling and saying proudly &quot;I did it, I killed them!&quot;, but I probably would not want them representing me in Washington.</p>

<p>And Trump was GREAT friends with Epstein, who not a politician himself, is believed to have potentially ran a blackmail operation on his island with other politicians. Trump has flown on the plane, and my guess is, he has visited the island before. These are business elites we&#39;re talking about. I just don&#39;t understand why you are extending the benefit of the doubt, to a corrupt billionaire creep, who has ADMITTED ON TAPE to having engaged women in a rude and abrasive fashion, &quot;grabbing them by the pussy&quot;, &quot;moving on her like a bitch&quot;....I just don&#39;t understand some of you guys.</p>

<p>Again... Epstein&#39;s accuser could describe Epstein&#39;s penis, but not Trump&#39;s. </p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, victim Virginia Roberts said Trump never did anything improper and she only saw him once at Epstein&#39;s house, which matches a Trump story about how he thought the girls were neighborhood kids at Epstein&#39;s pool.</p>

<p>Robert&#39;s attorneys subpoenaed Trump, and unlike everyone else they subpoenaed - like the Clintons - Trump didn&#39;t dodge it. He went in, answered their questions, and they determined that Trump wasn&#39;t involved with Epstein in that way - matching what Roberts had already said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right! Apparently Mark Epstein did say Trump flew on the plane.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In another deposition, Epstein’s brother Mark testified he once flew on Jeffrey Epstein’s plane with both him and Trump, who were “friends.” Asked why Trump was on board, Mark Epstein replied, “You&#39;ll have to ask Donald. I think he wanted a ride back to New York.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought it was weird he mentioned &quot;wanting a ride&quot; was the reason he gave, and nothing involving the island. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1508967-deposition-excerpts.html#document/p73/a263754">So I clicked the link in the article, and it took me to the deposition.</a></p>

<p>I want to copy and paste but it won&#39;t let me, so I will just transcribe. I am looking at this as a person that tries to be objective. Just want to say:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I think there is a clear attempt to undermine Trump in the media. I see a lot of stuff on Reddit that makes me feel compelled to defend him. I think he seems friendly enough.</p></li>
<li><p>I don&#39;t completely trust him. He&#39;s obviously a narcissist. I think Trump University sounded like a gross scam. He lies a lot about petty things to protect his ego. I dislike a lot of the people he&#39;s appointed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, so here&#39;s me transcribing the transcript, from the very end of page 72, until the transcript is cut off:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>LAWYER:</strong> Have you ever met Donald Trump?</p>

<p><strong>MARK EPSTEIN:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>LAWYER:</strong> Was that through your brother?</p>

<p><strong>MARK:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>LAWYER:</strong> Where was that?</p>

<p><strong>MARK:</strong> We flew up on my brother&#39;s plane from Florida together. Donald was on the plane.</p>

<p><strong>LAWYER:</strong> When?</p>

<p><strong>MARK:</strong> Somewhere between 5 and 10 years ago.</p>

<p><strong>LAWYER:</strong> Okay. So were are talking about --</p>

<p><strong>MARK:</strong> It&#39;s either late &#39;90s, early 2000. Probably more like late &#39;90s.</p>

<p><strong>LAWYER:</strong> Was the only time you&#39;ve met Donald Trump?</p>

<p><strong>MARK:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>LAWYER:</strong> Which plane was this of your brother&#39;s?</p>

<p><strong>MARK:</strong> I don&#39;t remember.</p>

<p><strong>LAWYER:</strong> Was this one of the big planes, the 727?</p>

<p><strong>MARK:</strong> No. It wasn&#39;t that one, no.</p>

<p><strong>LAWYER:</strong> Okay. How many people were on this airplane?</p>

<p><strong>MARK:</strong> It was my brother, myself, Doanld, the pilot, the co-pilot. I don&#39;t remember -- I don&#39;t remember if anybody else was on the plane.</p>

<p><strong>LAWYER:</strong> What was the purpose of Donald Trump riding on your brother&#39;s airplane. </p>

<p><strong>MARK:</strong> You&#39;ll have to ask Donald I think he wanted a ride back to New York.</p>

<p><strong>LAWYER:</strong> What was your understanding of the relationship of Donald Trump and your brother?</p>

<p><strong>MARK:</strong> They were friends.</p>

<p><strong>LAWYER:</strong> Do you know how they met?</p>

<p><strong>MARK:</strong> No.</p>

<p><strong>LAWYER:</strong> When you say &quot;friends,&quot; how frequently did they associate?</p>

<p><strong>MARK:</strong> I have no idea.</p>

<p><strong>LAWYER:</strong> What was your understanding -- did you ---</p>

<p><strong>MARK:</strong> I had no understanding. They were friends. They was my understanding.</p>

<p><strong>LAWYER:</strong> When they were in the airplane together, they talked as if they were friends?</p>

<p><strong>MARK:</strong> Yeah, I talked to him like he was my friend. I never met the guy. I am a friendly guy.</p>

<p><strong>LAWYER:</strong> Were there girls on the plane?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know how close Mark and Jeffrey were, and how frequently they were hanging out together, but Mark said this airplane was the only time he&#39;d ever met Trump, although Trump was characterized as Jeffrey&#39;s friend.</p>

<p>I think the most important takeaway here is, even though Trump was a passenger aboard Epstein&#39;s plane, <strong>the trip was from Florida to New York. There was no trip to the island on this flight.</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s very curious that the transcript cuts off before we hear Mark&#39;s answer to question about the girls, though! But maybe it&#39;s unimportant? He did say only he, Jeffrey, Trump, and the two pilots were aboard. But I still would have liked to hear what he said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assault can be defined as behavior that constitutes the threat of some kind of attack. It&#39;s so loosely defined that you only hurt your cause by using it as a primary filter.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that sexual assault isn&#39;t terrible unless its rape; just that it&#39;s disingenuous to lump them all together as though the claims are all of uniform severity. And the thing is, we have designations for separating them: </p>

<p>Aggravated criminal sexual assault: sexual battery, pedophilia and rape - This is the kind of sexual assault that is troubling to everyone</p>

<p>vs </p>

<p>Moderate criminal physical sexual assault: Unwanted touching and/or kissing; this kind of sexual assault is troubling to almost everyone, however, most Americans would view this as being in an entirely different ballpark than the previous class of assault. 50 instances of this second level of assault don&#39;t equate to 1 instance of rape or aggravated sexual battery.</p>

<p>vs </p>

<p>Non-physical assault - sexual/verbal harassment - typically not illegal but frequently unethical, particularly at the workplace. </p>

<p>Most people would agree that this form of assault is always wrong, and when done by someone in a position of power it becomes exponentially worse, but many would also consider it to be largely a byproduct of a culture that continually tells men how they can&#39;t behave yet fails to educate them on how to approach and communicate with potential sexual partners in a healthy, respectful manner. Technology has left us even further alienated from healthy socialization, so this issue needs to be addressed in school curriculum immediately, and not in a way that shames men for their internal drives. Shaming is never educating; in fact, it&#39;s just another form of abuse. </p>

<p>vs</p>

<p>Making sexist remarks - Not a crime, and qualifies as constitutionally protected free speech. Like above, this is something that cannot be addressed through social shaming or mass incarceration. Teaching young men to communicate better with women at an early age would essentially eliminate all but one source of sexism in the nation: Religion, especially Islam and Christianity. Removing tax exemption from any religious group that endorses sexist or racist doctrines, and imposing mandatory 6 and 7 figure fines on any organization involved in multiple instances of systemic sexual abuse would be the best way to deal with this in my opinion, but it&#39;s unlikely to happen.</p>

<p>With Trump and Moore, all 4 are being grouped as one. I think it&#39;s a byproduct of the Cosby takedown. Cosby had so many accusers, but they all basically reported the same accounts. The Trump accusations are all over the place, with an obvious attempt being made to &quot;pad&quot; the number of complaints, rather than focusing on investigating evidence behind the strongest and most severe claims. It makes it look like a contrived witch hunt and fake news.</p>

<p>Three words is all it took to make your argument, on the other side, and it is as valid as yours is. Is that coincidence? We are all arguing from different arcs on the same circle. Which, to be honest, is probably closer to the goals of the TPTB. They keep us arguing because in reality, we have them surrounded.</p>

I’m not sure where you’re going for you’re info, but I feel it’s best to use many sources and discern the truth for yourself. Besides Q anon, Mega anon, and FBI anon, there’s Robert David Steele, Benjamin Fulford, William Binney, Dr. Steve  Pieczenik, Corey Goode, David Wilcock, and many, many more. Go down these rabbit holes and the truth will begin to emerge. Happy hunting. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive read some of the q and mega posts on here. I dont buy it. </p>

<p>Its funny you call me a stubborn skeptic, but you are so quick to dimiss Trumps words and actions in favor of waiting to see behind the scenes. You let anonymous people give you leading, vague clues over actually observing Trump. Its stubborn in my eyes to listen to Trump say crooked Hillary over and over, and the when he wins he calls her a friend. And you still think he is an outsider</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were claims were made during the election, but the victims had their lives threatened by the Trump campaign until they backed down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1994, Trump went to a party with Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire who was a notorious registered sex offender, and raped a 13-year-old girl that night in what was a &quot;savage sexual attack,&quot; according to a lawsuit filed in June 2016 by &quot;Jane Doe.&quot; The account was corroborated by a witness in the suit, who claimed to have watched as the child performed various sexual acts on Trump and Epstein even after the two were advised she was a minor.</p>

<p>&quot;Immediately following this rape Defendant Trump threatened me that, were I ever to reveal any of the details of Defendant Trump’s sexual and physical abuse of me, my family and I would be physically harmed if not killed,&quot; Jane Doe wrote in the lawsuit, filed in New York.</p>

<p>The lawsuit was dropped in November 2016, just four days before the election, with Jane Doe&#39;s attorneys citing &quot;numerous threats&quot; against her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because someone posted up that it&#39;s okay to call out the President for things that other people get called out for and to resist the social engineering that is trying to paint him as anti-establishment..? </p>

<p>Classic shutdown response; calling someone a shill to try and discredit what they&#39;re saying, while ignoring the words. </p>

<p>Trump is dripping with angles for conspiracy theorists to dig into - from mafia links to his ties to Wall Street and the banks. Russia is solid gold - from Flynn to Manafort to his steadfast refusal to release tax returns... </p>

<p>You can&#39;t be a conspiracy theorist and pro-Trump as this stage, it makes no sense. Even if many of these are blind alleys, there&#39;s a fascinating story in how people like Bannon and the Russian bots tried to shape and sell a narrative to the American public.</p>

<p>Why would you want that kind of discussion to be shutdown..? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course we shouldn&#39;t trust Trump. Only an idiot would blindly follow him. It&#39;s not a partisan issue. Just because DC is riddled with corruption doesn&#39;t make Trump suddenly squeaky clean - it&#39;s not an either or situation. Trump is fair game for conspiracies, along with everything else. You don&#39;t have distrust the media and therefore support Trump. You can do both. </p>

<p>Obviously when I say you I mean normal folk. You spend your entire time defending Trump and parroting the party line. You&#39;re a fan in a fan club and that&#39;s probably great (?) and you can stick your head in the sane all you want, but r/conspiracy is kind of for people who don&#39;t want to stick their head in their sand. </p>

<p>It&#39;s for people who want to ask questions about want to question the millions of dollars the Clinton Foundation received from foreign powers when HC when Secretary of State <em>and</em> Trump&#39;s ties to men like Viktor Vekselberg <em>and</em> whether the hexagon on Saturn that Voyager took images of really could be a natural formation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But so what if the establishment attack Trump..? As I said before that doesn&#39;t magically make him clean and ethical. It&#39;s not an either or situation. You don&#39;t just judge a man by his critics. You judge him by his actions, words and the company he keeps.</p>

<p>Like I said before, I get it. You&#39;re on the Trump defense force and that means you have to toe the line and you can&#39;t have free speech or free thought. But even someone who as indoctrinated as you can see the problem with turning everything into a partisan issue. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t watch CNN - I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s on my cable network - so I can&#39;t really help you with the rest of it. But I can promise you that if you start to think for yourself, your life will get better. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>wait lol</p>

<p>you’re saying it’s no big deal that the very politicians and media talking heads (who have run this country into the ground) are against trump?</p>

<p>never mind the numerous campaign promises kept</p>

<p>never mind he’s been in politics officially for a year</p>

<p>i think the issue here is that i DO think for myself.  it is what led me to where i am now</p>

<p>trump is afforded the benefit of the doubt when things don’t go 100% the way that was planned at first.  i afforded the same to clinton, bush, and obama because i was loyal to no party.  someday you might understand sitting on the fence is just another form of lacking the ability to stand up for values that you believe in.  no one fully tows the party line.  all that tells me is the level of ignorance i’m currently dealing with here </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish you were ideologically diverse. I really do. All you do is parrot the same party line, over and over again. Rather than tackle someone before on their actual words you just called them a shareblue shill, just like you&#39;ve been taught to do. You&#39;re predictable to the point of parody. </p>

<p>C&#39;mon, man. You enthusiastically post in T_D. when you&#39;re not even allowed to criticize the President there. How is that thinking for yourself when you deliberately agree to suppress all dissenting opinions? </p>

<p>Can you honestly say, hand on heart, that if Hilary had got into power and her campaign chairman, her national security adviser and campaign adviser were all indicted that you would have just brushed it off and said it was nothing and that she had nothing to do with it..? </p>

<p>If so, fair enough. You&#39;re a bigger man than me because I would have been all over that and wondering what the hell was going on. </p>

<p>Do me a favor though. Show me a bit of this ideological diversity. Tell me what you don&#39;t like about Trump. What you think he&#39;s doing wrong. Just something that breaks free from the party line of constant praise and contrast defense.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>edit: at this point it’s just an attack so i’m responding here rather than feeding another possible shill. there are some values i don’t agree with when it comes to the MAGA movement, but they are the usual minimal debates that mean nothing in the grand scheme of things. the positives far outweigh the very few negatives
do me a favor and tell me how you explain activist movements and their obvious ties to the DNC party, and what your ideal candidate looks like</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Classic response : call someone a shill and ignore what they say. I&#39;ll happily explain activist movements and their ties to the DNC - the DNC sponsors many activist movements. </p>

<p>And my ideal candidate would be one who prioritised the good of the people and the future over the short-term gain of corporations and banks. They&#39;d also be honest and open about who is funding them and what their financial ties are, as well as being wiling to be held to a higher standard of ethical behavior than the average Joe. </p>

<p>There you go. Now you can return the favor and tell me what it is that you&#39;re actually critical about when it comes to Trump. No worming out of it and trying to hand-wave it away. Something which shows you&#39;re not sitting there, scared of going against the party-line and being banned from your clubhouse. </p>

<p>So let&#39;s hear you say one negative thing about Trump. </p>

<p>&quot;there are some values i don’t agree with when it comes to the MAGA movement&quot;</p>

<p>Like what..? Let&#39;s hear it. Show me that ideological diversity that you&#39;ve boasted about. Cheers. </p>

<p>(Also I have zero idea how saying that partisan politics is a bad thing makes me a shill. it&#39;s almost like it&#39;s an automated defense you have to avoid every answering questions. Someone says something that requires thought? Must be a shill. Must be shareblue. Whole at the same time your entire post history is pretty much you, defending Trump in every subreddit you post in. I&#39;d never accuse anyone of being a shill because I think it&#39;s lazy and obvious tactic to avoid debate - but I&#39;ll give you this; you&#39;re very dedicated.)</p>

<p>Hey u/all4gibs - happily did your favor. </p>

<p>Now you can return that favor and tell me what criticisms of the President you have - I know how you&#39;ve talked about how you do think for yourself so it&#39;d be great to hear what that means. </p>

<p>Every real-world Trump voter I know has their own genuine criticisms of the President and his policies (and some of them are quite vocal and strong about it) - it&#39;s only online that you ever come across people who seem oddly scared to voice any dissenting views. But, like you said, you&#39;re ideologically diverse so it&#39;d be cool to hear the other side of the coin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well first of all stop using rape interchangeably with sexual assault. They are not the same thing and you just confuse people while simultaneously making yourself appear as a hyperbolic partisan. </p>

<p>Sexual assault is an umbrella of unwanted sexual contact, under which rape falls. Rape is forced penetration.</p>

<p>Trump has been accused of sexual assault in 21 (as of today) instances with only 3 of them (Ivana Trump, Jill Harth and &quot;Jane Doe&quot;/Katie Johnson) being classified as rapes according to most outlets.</p>

<p>Newest List: <a href="https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_57ffae1fe4b0162c043a7212/amp">https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_57ffae1fe4b0162c043a7212/amp</a></p>

<p><a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/12/what-happened-to-trumps-16-sexual-misconduct-accusers.html">http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/12/what-happened-to-trumps-16-sexual-misconduct-accusers.html</a></p>

<p>Ivana Trump didn&#39;t file rape charges against him and made these statements:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I referred to this as a ‘rape,’ but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.” </p>

<p>Ivana issued another statement after the allegations resurfaced in 2015:</p>

<p>I have recently read some comments attributed to me from nearly 30 years ago at a time of very high tension during my divorce from Donald. The story is totally without merit Donald and I are the best of friends and together have raised three children that we love and are very proud of. I have nothing but fondness for Donald and wish him the best of luck on his campaign. Incidentally, I think he would make an incredible president.</p>

<p>In 1997 Harth and Houraney sued Trump for breach of contract, and she filed a separate sexual-harassment suit, accusing him of “attempted rape.” They reached a confidential settlement in the contract suit, and as part of the agreement Harth withdrew her suit.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The court papers offer no corroborative evidence that her claims are true. </p>

<p>On Wednesday, Johnson suddenly cancelled a press conference at which she was set to reveal herself for the first time, saying she was &#39;too afraid&#39; following a series of &#39;threats&#39; against her. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of the rape charges filed against him have been dropped, so as far as the judicial system is concerned Trump hasn&#39;t raped anyone. So of the 3 actual rape allegations none of them were ever proven to have occurred but your still pushing this baseless 12+ rape allegations narrative. </p>

<p>Sexual Assault/misconduct is not RAPE. </p>

<p>These type of posts get downvoted because Trump has been constantly vilified ever since he got into office. At this point many people are just tired of the daily calls for impeachment when there is no credible basis to support one (so far). Lots of people disapprove of the idea of subverting the will of the people displayed in the election and especially with the President you need a damn good reason and evidence in support of it, to remove him from office. The sexual allegations appeared in a highly charged political climate and are inherently hard to prove because many of them allegedly happened years ago so they are nearly impossible to verify. Its a bunch of he-said/she-said situations and for most people its really fucking annoying to be bombarded with posts acting as if these accusations are 100% true and verified. No amount of talking/posting/arguing is going to lead us to the knowledge of whether or not the events involving sexual assault actually occured or not. There is no slam-dunk proof to any of the allegations and without that hes not going to be impeached, plain and simple. At this point, unless you have substantial relevant evidence your just wasting others time trying to promote hard to validate narratives that support your political ideology. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are missing the point of the Trump sex allegations.  They are allegations with no empirical evidence at this point.  Franken had empirical evidence and he admitted to it.  He should go.</p>

<p>Conyers, a Democrat, never admitted to it and no evidence was given.  He should not have resigned.  </p>

<p>The point isn&#39;t that people are Trump puppets, but I would ascertain that these people believe in the Constitution, and that everyone is innocent until proven guilty.</p>

<p>Also, check his post history for yourselves. Then there are these other people who have the same marching orders, making up unsubstantiatable claims against Judge Moore. </p>

<p>The claims made against Moore are basically the same ones being made against Trump, where all this crazy shit happened, like Moore was banned from a mall, when no he was not. They claim Moore said &quot;it&#39;s ok that I dated an 8-yo girl, cause I got her parent&#39;s consent&quot;, when no he didn&#39;t date or even know the 8-yo girl, not when she was 8, and not when she was any other age, and Moore never met or said these things, nor met the accuser&#39;s parents.</p>

<p>The facts in all of these cases are clear. Sort of. Trump knew and was buddies with Epstein a convicted child rapist. However, Epstein was one of Bill and Hillary Clinton&#39;s biggest donors.</p>

<p>Google &quot;Statement of Defendant Bradley J. Edwards - undisputed facts case <em>Epstein vs Edwards, et alia</em> case no. 50 2009 CA 040800xxxxMBAG&quot;</p>

<p>These showcase the trips Bill took to one of the islands where Epstein kept his child sex slaves and it&#39;s all documented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus, this garbage thread being gilded rofl.</p>

<p>Your getting banned and remove for proper reasons.</p>

<p>A pressure point? Their were dozens of <strong>ACCUSATIONS</strong> during the election, all investigated and turned out to be fake, this is a billionaire with an entourage with him at all times, if he did something fucky, there would already be hard evidence, there is no evidence and there are no sexual assaults. </p>

<p>There are real pedophiles out there, and Trump went into power and all this shit is started to get weeded out. </p>

<p>&quot;The users here are the smartest on Reddit, they can see whats BS and whats real.&quot; Well your sadly not one of them, making a post providing absolutely no evidence on Trump, and never will because their isn&#39;t anything. </p>

<p>You are clearly breaking rule 10 with your attitude: &quot;Keep posting about Trump and raising awareness for his sexual abuse allegations&quot; </p>

<p>So you want to keep posting fake information, on a sub devoted to conspiracies? Go post on r/twoxchromosomes (Or whatever the hell it is), or r/politics. </p>

<p>The reason you were guilded is because you actually look fucking stupid to anyone who is remotely intelligent, and its great to keep this post up as a reminder of how far you people are willing to go to push a fake message, with no evidence, repeatedly, while attacking users and getting your comments removed for it. </p>

<p>There is no reason for you to go on, you were hired on 4 weeks ago, or this account was hacked 4 weeks ago.</p>

<p>You ask people to archive a post about making an accusation with no evidence, are you actually stupid? </p>

<p>With all the real pedophiles going down, your going to still try to pretend Trump sexually assaulted anyone? There is no evidence, proof, and every single accusation during the election was 100% investigated, of course they wanted anything they could get to take trump down, they found nothing, stop trying to push a fake agenda. </p>

<p>This thread is so stupid it hurts. </p>

You basically claimed the shills are treating trumps sexual allegations similar to pizzagate? Come on dude, not even close in its significance if it even made sense. Trumps sexual allegations have been in the news and talked about before. Pizzagate is hush hush and shut down before any conversation gets started Furthermore you didn&#39;t even post a single one of the allegations.

    <div class="md"><p>Blatant coordinated attack from Shareblue. OP saying Pizzagate is real and yet I haven&#39;t seen 1 (ONE) comment arguing against Pizzagate when normally every single top comment would be bashing OP for it. In case you can&#39;t figure it out their &quot;Sacrificing&quot; the admittance of Pizzagate just to get any fucking people they can against Trump in the second election. Just remember that Trump is literally our last chance to beat the deepstate. They won&#39;t EVER allow a outsider to win again. And no a rebellion isn&#39;t feasible at all. In order for it to even <em>possibly</em> happen the MSM can&#39;t be controlled by the deepstate.</p>

<p>Remember it&#39;s been long proven Shareblue exist from many things. (Nerd virgins email is one example).</p>

<p>Also Remember their is ZERO evidence of any Russian/Rightwing shilling except the CIA/FBI&#39;s <em>word</em>. Ya know the people who have been caught lieing and manipulating things multiple times?</p>

<p>Also dunno about any of you guys, But if Trump really was part of the deepstate do you not realize how good of an actor he would have to be? (Also won the white woman vote if you don&#39;t believe my reading skills).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We didn&#39;t even have Trump supporters here until the DNC leak came down. Really, back then, it wasn&#39;t so bad. Most of them were well mannered and open minded. Then the podesta leak happened and a lot of heat started coming down on CF. That&#39;s when Shareblue started showing up, manipulating votes, sliding posts from new, and derailing conversations. Coincidentally, once we started getting somewhere with CF, suddenly pizzagate happened, and the &quot;Fake News&quot; term went mainstream. I still think &quot;Pizzagate&quot; is just a manufactured scandal. I don&#39;t stand in the way of it, because any allegation that serious bears investigation, but it is undeniable that it significantly reduced the clout of the sub. I&#39;m glad it&#39;s been moved to voat.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s the background I am looking at this from. Since the election, this has become the_donald v2. I would say that at least 40 percent of the users here adamantly and blindly support a sitting president. For a conspiracy sub, that&#39;s fucking crazy. As if a billionaire real estate mogul is going to make america great again. Trump represents everything that is wrong with america. I mean, let&#39;s put aside the extreme likelyhood that he is using real estate to launder money, as those are just allegations. He frequently uses bankruptcy laws to nullify debt. We&#39;re not talking about debt to banks, we&#39;re talking about debt to private contractors he&#39;s hired to help build the buildings he&#39;s filing bankruptcy on. That&#39;s him assfucking middle class americans. You expect this guy to do anything for you? Listen to him talk. He&#39;s talking down to you, down to all americans. He&#39;s a crooked used car salesman, and anyone who follows him is as much of a sheep as anyone who still supports hillary.</p>

<p>Knowing this, you must understand that your posting anything negative about trump here is basically futile. The vapid supporters of the oompaloompa in chief are not going to suddenly change their mind. They cling to the lifeline of hope that is trump and the republican party like the last bottle of water in the sahara. Without it, they know the doom that waits for them, yet are blinded by the fact that they&#39;re in the middle of the sahara with nothing but a bottle of russian vodka.</p>

<p>And Trump was GREAT friends with Epstein, who not a politician himself, is believed to have potentially ran a blackmail operation on his island with other politicians. Trump has flown on the plane, and my guess is, he has visited the island before. These are business elites we&#39;re talking about. I just don&#39;t understand why you are extending the benefit of the doubt, to a corrupt billionaire creep, who has ADMITTED ON TAPE to having engaged women in a rude and abrasive fashion, &quot;grabbing them by the pussy&quot;, &quot;moving on her like a bitch&quot;....I just don&#39;t understand some of you guys.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to try to tie Trump to Epstein beyond the black book, then now&#39;s the time to tell us about it because I just had someone spend 20 posts trying to convince me he was in the flight logs, but then wouldn&#39;t give me a date.</p>

<p>Again... Epstein&#39;s accuser could describe Epstein&#39;s penis, but not Trump&#39;s. </p>
