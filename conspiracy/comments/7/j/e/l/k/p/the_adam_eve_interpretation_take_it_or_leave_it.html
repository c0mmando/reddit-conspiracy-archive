        Serpent of Genesis
       </a>
       is usually depicted as being wrapped around the Tree of Knowledge. Tree is a perfect metaphor for time due to the way they branch into three physical dimensions, such as timelines. 
Eating from the Tree of Knowledge implies incarnation into the third dimension. 
(Light &amp; Dark / Duality)
      </p>
      <p>
       Sin in the original Hebrew meaning of the word
       <br/>
       means “Missing” or “the absence of knowledge”.
       <br/>
       Sin in Spanish means “Without”.
In occultism, 'born in sin' means to be born without knowledge. Jesus said “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." This means "sinners" are actually unconscious people who lack knowledge or are not conscious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cost was forgetting who you really were, and to now live in primitive/violent conditions for billions of lifetimes. What they gained most was wisdom which was not possible to obtain prior to entering the third dimension.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one (of many) interpretation of the Adam and Eve story. All religions must be decoded and not to be taken literally because thats the thin line of becoming enslaved or liberated.

       Recommended reading: On The Origin Of The World, untitled text, Nag Hammadi
      </p>
      <p>
       It is an alternate version of the story of Genesis; if I remember rightly, there is no serpent, only the Beast who is the Wisest of All Beasts. He is a teacher and benefactor to humankind, where god is a jealous god, who is unaware that there are many gods, but he sees that humanity has a spark that makes them capable of becoming as powerful as the gods; this makes him afraid and jealous. That is why he throws man out of Paradise,

       Yes, everyone should read the Nag Hammadi manuscripts.  Very interesting!  The manuscripts were not corrupted by humans, so they are authentic.

       Right, but who knows the intent they were written, bad translation, Pages are torn and incomprehensible, one could say those were purposefully weathered/torn by higher ups. There's just know way to be certain. But again, I do at least agree people should read what's available.

       I do not have a link to them. However they are known discoveries, and they are very numerous discoveries. Present day translations of the New Testament are done by referencing these materials, that is, by referencing the oldest and most consistent known copies of the original texts. I am sure there is somewhere you could look to learn more if you really wanted to dig into it. I'm sorry for not being more helpful.

       Fair enough.  Lol.  You are honest, so no problem.

       I am vaguely familiar with Bart Ehrman's work.  Are you?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess my issue is that scribes can modify the manuscripts,as,they copy them.  He Nag Hammadi manuscripts were sealed and unchanged for 1700 to 1800 years (I think).   They were not modified during that time.  That is the point I am wanting to make.

       Have you read the Nag Hammadi manuscripts?

       I've read some of the material from them. They are largely Gnostic. Mind you, I do not reject Gnosticism because it is some buzz word; I do not reject it because I heard from some authority or some book that I should reject it. I am however familiar with the spiritual path that is espoused in Gnostic teachings; I have my own experiences and my own understanding of that path and I have judged that it is not the way.

       Generally speaking, when we have discovered New Testament manuscripts, they are judged to be accurate on the basis of their similarity to other copies of the same manuscripts. Meaning, we can evaluate the possibility of their being modified in the copying process by comparing them against other renditions of the same documents. This doesn't completely rule out that they were modified at some unknown point, but it rules out a lot and it reduces the likelihood.

       It's not really meaningful to say that the Nag Hammadi documents were "sealed" - the reason is, whether or not they were sealed, we can still date them by various markers to determine their age, and we can still inspect them for signs that they were altered. So, even if they weren't sealed at all, we could still have the same confidence in their historicity.

       Interesting take... 
I somewhat agree , but what I'm trying to understand , is knowledge really the same as awareness? What if one obtains knowledge but rejects it?

       Sin means to miss when you shoot an arrow. Jesus meant it as a sin as in you missed the mark of love: you aimed for something and you didn't do it loving, or you as a person are not moving towards love i.e. the bullseye of god's creation.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Jesus says to forgive them they do not know what they are doing he literally just means that most people are not aware of their own sin.

       I don’t agree.

       The English word “sin” does not come from Hebrew and is not connected linguistically to Spanish.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Spanish word
       <strong>
        sin
       </strong>
       comes from the Latin
       <strong>
        sine
       </strong>
       , meaning without, and there is no Hebrew word used for sin that can be translated to
       <strong>
        without
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       From etymonline.com,
      </p>
      <p>
       sin (n.)
Old English synn "moral wrongdoing, injury, mischief, enmity, feud, guilt, crime, offense against God, misdeed," from Proto-Germanic *sun(d)jo- "sin" (source also of Old Saxon sundia, Old Frisian sende, Middle Dutch sonde, Dutch zonde, German Sünde "sin, transgression, trespass, offense," extended forms), probably ultimately "it is true," i.e. "the sin is real" (compare Gothic sonjis, Old Norse sannr "true"), from PIE *snt-ya-, a collective form from *es-ont- "becoming," present participle of root *es- "to be."
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the word is translated to English as sin, the original Hebrew is generally something along the lines of “transgression”, or “trespass” in the sense rebelliousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikipedia has a thorough, though somewhat poorly written, on the vocabulary of sin:

       When we are born we are in the garden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is provided to us by god and his angels (parents, family)
      </p>
      <p>
       As we grow we start to see these snakes that tell us what is wrong and right.
      </p>
      <p>
       We get kicked out of the garden when we start to live based off of what people have taught us. No longer listening to the voice of god. No loner creating from the force of creation of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our gentle nature accepted the snake. But it was a necessary union. For without knowledge of such things we’d be lost.
