    <div class="md"><p>Are you sure he was banned from this sub? I had actually made a comment at the time asking why he wasn&#39;t being banned after calling people who disagreed with him &quot;faggy bitches&quot;. Moments later his account was completely suspended, but that had to have been by admins and not the mods here. There were no more than ten minutes between his comments and the suspension, so I&#39;m pretty sure he hadn&#39;t been banned from the sub yet. And admins don&#39;t suspend accounts over shit like that, so there had to be something else going on. Maybe there was some truth to the alt accounts theory? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ban was in modlog, I didn&#39;t notice he was gone for about 2 days, checked the log when someone mentioed they were banned, saw the ban, then noticed the account was suspended.  I had thought it was all odd timing, but from what you said, sounds like his actions may have gotten him banned, but the suspension is the surprising part of all this to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh, that is interesting then. Can you ban an account after it&#39;s already been suspended? Because I swear I didn&#39;t see anything in the modlog at the time of the suspension. And his rule-breaking comments definitely weren&#39;t removed until after his account had already been suspended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure, I&#39;m glad you noticed it all go down, because my time line was a ban and then with I  that 48hrs he was suspended.  I honestly thought reddit was trying to remove any users they thought might be a Russian shill in the lead up to the 13 indictments.  Not saying he was a shill, but the timing is what got me.  Now with your info, sounds like they may have brought it on them selves and was just a coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It still really doesn&#39;t explain the site-wide suspension though. Just calling people names won&#39;t get your account suspended, and even breaking Reddit rules usually takes a while to get the admins involved. I&#39;ve reported spam bots and people making death threats to the admins before and it usually takes at least a day or two before they act, so I&#39;m guessing whatever peyote did was a couple days before his ban/suspension. </p>

<p>is that its just a place to let your confirmation bias run off leash with no fear of challenge</p>

<p>i mean, are people so afraid of blue team shills? if they are &#39;shills&#39; arent they being paid to argue from a place of falsehood?  shouldnt that be easy to debunk? running away from them and banning any commentary that doesnt fit along ideological lines seems terrible for the human brain. in fact it reeks of a safeplace for snowflakes.</p>
