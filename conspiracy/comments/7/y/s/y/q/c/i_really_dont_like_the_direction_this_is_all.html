       I don't destroy the lives of children. Those who know I'm a pedo have no issue with me being around children, even close relatives, because they know I'm not a danger to them. Just because I have a sexual attraction to them doesn't mean I'm going to do anything sexual with them. And just because someone is not a pedophile doesn't mean they're not going to molest children.

       That's what I'm talking about. I'm not saying mentally ill are pedos. I'm saying the mentally ill are being blamed for all the gun violence. This is a slippery slope and we'll soon be crucifying the mental ill as we do pedos.

       But criminals do something to "deserve" their treatment. Pedophiles just have a different sexual orientation. Sorta like some people have a mental disorder. Doesn't mean they're gonna shoot up a school. Just like being a pedophile doesn't mean you're going to molest a child.

       Let me clarify something for you, animal torture is not a sexual orientation nor is pedofilia. Pedos are sadists who get aroused at the idea of hurting a child. That is just as sick as a necrophiliac.dont you dare lump pedofilia, necrophiliacs or animal abuser with homosexuality. 
Children suffer from vaginal and anal fissures, scar tissue, impacted feces, kidney and bladder infections from sexual torture to their undersized and undeveloped privates. Anyone who is aroused at the idea is as bad as someone who thinks torturing an animal is arrousing. What u are advocating is criminal and violent and very threatening to the most vulneraravle if society: children.

       Obviously not. Torture is an action. Actions are never a sexual orientation. If you meant zoophilia, I'll have to admit I'm not well read in this area. Being a zoophile doens't mean you torture animals though.

      <p>
       Not true. There's a few pedo sadists, just like there are a few non-pedo sadists. But its certainly is not the norm. Most pedos have no interest in hurting children. Such would be a turn off.

       Why do you care so much about what random people are attracted to? So what if someone happens to like bodies?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If you mean zoophilia rather than animal abuser, what's wrong with lumping them with homosexuality or heterosexuality in the sense that all of them are sexually preferences. At the very least, I know pedophilia comes with many of the same biological markers permanence as homo/heterosexuality. So it makes sense to be called an orientation as well. I don't know about the other two.

      <p>
       That has nothing to do with the discussion. Whether or not someone has sexual intercourse with children doesn't relate to their sexual orientation. Most LGBT allies make this same argument when they say that homosexuals don't molest children at a higher rate: that most rapists are doing it for power and/or convenience, not because of what the person is wearing. Assuming you accept people who are not attracted to males molest boys because its convenience and its a way to have power over them, it should be obvious that its just as wrong to assume they're pedophiles. The majority of child molesters are not pedophiles.

       I'm not a predator, I don't enjoy victimizing or torturing children. I just enjoy playing with them. I have difficulty even accepting a kiss on the cheek from a child offering it. Pretty sure I don't do anything sexual with them...

       There is a reason zombie movies and events are so popular. The retards and degenerates are the future of our World, and demand worship, via minimum wage paid nurses. Never under estimate the power of mind scrambling, mass prescribed pills. The future won't be as stylish, but even more grueling and gross.

       This is their goal, first get lumped together with a normalized subculture. They are not only trying to get conflated with the mentally ill but also with homosexuals. It will not only stigmatize those groups who have been stigmatized historically. Pedofiles are nothing like gays, or mentally ill. They are aroused by inflicting pain on children. That takes a level of evil that is beyond comprehension for most. This is why they are so desperate to be combined with other groups. Rapists, animal torturers, and child predators are criminals. Mentally ill are legally unable to be held accountable for their crimes, this is why pedos want the mentally Ill category.

       Discrimination will happen everywhere. I'm not so much worried about being rounded up, but I am worried about a background check showing my medical history and being denied a job for that. If they open up that door for gun control it will be used for everything not just guns.
