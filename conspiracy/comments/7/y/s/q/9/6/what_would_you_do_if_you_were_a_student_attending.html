    <div class="md"><p>Here is a comment from mine, on another post that was talking about something similar:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Really, all it would take is to maybe have one, two, or three teachers trained and armed, and have a sign saying: &quot;Notice: This school is secured by TWCFC - Teachers with concealed firearm carry&quot;. Kind of like how putting an ADT sign outside your house would prevent people from robbing it, whether or not you actually have a security system installed - to risky for the robber.</p>

<p>I mean the signs saying: &quot;This is a gun free zone&quot; is like putting a sign up at your house saying: &quot;No one is home and the back window doesn&#39;t lock&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really is, and thanks. </p>

<p>I mean, it&#39;s mind numbing how simple shit really is or could be. If I was a kid (or had a kid in school), I&#39;d much rather have something like that, over armed guards. Which would resemble a prison, too much, imo and kids shouldn&#39;t feel like they are inmates. </p>

<p>By implementing a solution like mine, everyone knows there is <strong>at least one</strong> well trained and armed person there, and signs expressing that to &quot;would be psychopaths&quot;. They (kids) don&#39;t know who is, and nor would the other teachers (imo, do not make who is and who isn&#39;t - better for everyone and acts as a buffer for outside forces). It&#39;s a psychological thing that works in favor of the teachers and students, but not in the favor of the potential gun man/woman.</p>

<p>It would be a &quot;common sense&quot; solution, but that phrase has been inverted, like everything TPTB do/say. They love their inversions...</p>

Australia, UK, and Japan are all examples of what can happen if the country pulls together and enacts some common sense gun regulations.

<p>We are the only country, to have this in our Constitution, and we stand by this. Plain and simple. Those &quot;laws&quot; have not proven to work. It&#39;s a band-aid, on a shotgun wound, to make you feel &quot;safe&quot;, just the &quot;gun free zone&quot; signs. Asinine, to say the least.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Time we put our children ahead of the NRA and recognize this. </p>

<p>Fuck the NRA. Furthermore, restricting people from arms could put children at risk, when there homes get broken into, and there mother or father is disarmed, because of a &quot;technicality&quot; in the &quot;law&quot;, you ignoramuses would like to implement. Where will you be then? Face it, you don&#39;t care about children, you just care about delusions peddled to you by Maddow and such, which ultimately, would be TPTB.</p>

<p>Now, I shall ask... Are you a US citizen, and do you own a firearm?</p>

<p>No, because it&#39;s not about the 2nd amendment, it&#39;s about Natural Law, and the Creator given right to self defense/protection. This cannot be taken away by &quot;government&quot;, being it&#39;s not a right granted by the &quot;government&quot;.</p>

<p>Laws do not stop criminals. You could ban all guns, but they&#39;d still be there, because of the market for such, whether criminal or just someone wanting one to hunt. We saw this with prohibition and alcohol. We also see this with the &quot;war on drugs&quot;. Criminals don&#39;t care about laws. Creating laws only affects law abiding citizens. Take away their guns, and the only ones left are criminals and the government, and boy... those two are one in the same ;)</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, and no law would stop those from being in circulation. You could machine all of those, if you had the knowledge and tools. Just like how you could go to any hardware store and make yourself some IED&#39;s. Crazy people will always find a way. It&#39;s not the &quot;tool&quot;, it&#39;s the person... We should address the &quot;person&quot; aspect to it. The former has been tried with the laws on the books. The latter? Not so much, being that mental health is now: &quot;Just give them SSRI&#39;s&quot;. It&#39;s insanity...</p>

It seems sadly clear a lot of Americans can&#39;t be trusted with guns. Especially the poor young ones being fed pharmaceuticals. With people not willing to budge on gun laws it seems all that&#39;s going to happen is you are going to be put under more surveillance, more heavily armed police, metal detectors etc.You will get to keep your guns, but if you try to use it a drone will blow your face off. They will probably make a reality tv show about it. Made by child rapists. Whatever way you look at it kids are gonna get fucked. </p>

<p>Dont most schools have at least one cop always hanging around? Let him sit in the control room for the video surveillance of the school, give it some basic AI threat detection for suspicious persons or movements, and you could stop these things quite easily from happening.</p>

<p>Schools have cameras and wifi networks already. Not hard to give it the AI alerting system. Linus Tech Tips has it in his office ffs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>just playing devils advocate and i understand the debate, but i’m not sure if more guns are the answer. i just fear that there’s too much potential for a “Zimmerman” incident where guns can give people a false sense of power and willingness to create deadly confrontations not prevent them. They might be trained to use guns properly but real life situations with real people are a different story. and if cops can get rattled in stressful situations and shoot people recklessly, what is a 65 yr old teacher or some mall cop going to do? obviously there’s not just one answer but i just don’t see how arming more people will make people safer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points.  I don&#39;t want to get into Zimmerman because that situation as a whole isn&#39;t relative to school shootings. </p>

<p>Would you go shoot up a school that is protected by armed staff/guards or target the unprotected school that says &quot;gun free zone?&quot; Just having a sign that armed staff and security are present is a strong deterrent. Its been proven that 90% of home invasions are deterred by placing a sign and sticker that you have a security system.  The signage alone will prevent attacks.</p>

<p>You say real life situations are different story.  True.  Then you asked what is a mall cop or old man going to do? Good question but what is being proposed as an alternative? What is a gun free zone or tougher gun laws gonna do? Having no protection is what people are suggesting as a solution.  They think by preventing access to purchase will prevent shootings.  People will find guns.  So to your question, having defense such as old man with a gun or mall cop is better than nothing at all.  Besides who said it will be some old man or mall cop? Could be retired policemen or vets.  </p>

<p>Every year we hear stories of women and men of all ages and sizes who have concealed permits defending themselves, their family and others by just firing back.  It is harder to shoot people when someone is shooting back at you.  Instead of shooting at many the shooter focuses on 1 with a gun.  Having 2 or more staff with a gun makes the defense stronger.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent points and thanks for responding with respect, I know how these conversations can go.  I understand the deterrent a warning sign can have as I used to sell and install security cameras and dummy cams were a good bulk of our sales. I agree that providing gun safety and training for teachers is a good idea but still a bit hesitant on permitting them to carry on campus. Perhaps an alternative would be an armed police officer on site as a better option as they are professionally equipped to handle the freakiest of situations. We had one at my high school back in the late 90’s and not only did he provide that sense of security but was a pretty cool dude and even got along with the “gang banger” types. I definitely think that these incidents can start to be tackled with more common sense actions at the community level without the need to escalate to the very top which seem to spark debates that divide the country and nothing gets done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you and I appreciate your responses, opinion and courtesy as well.  Its funny I grew up in the 90&#39;s and did sales for security systems for a summer job once.  I think the arm police man is still risky.  1 person for a whole school is a lot of coverage for 1.  I think having some guns in safes and only available to those trained is an alternative to consider.  Like you we had all kinds of gang violence, drive by&#39;s and shootings on campus when I was in school.  It never made national news.  Anyways we had cops start to drive around and patrol heavily but they rarely left the vehicle.  The campus layout supported vehicles driving through the entire campus so it worked.  I could see some good relationships and mentoring with the right person.  However there are always bad apples. </p>

<p>Totally agree with common sense action over protest.  Seems the media jumps in and facilitates the division.  It is really getting old.  1 week everyone wants to fight Russia/Trump next week its ban guns and still hate on Trump.  Never ending soap opera. </p>
