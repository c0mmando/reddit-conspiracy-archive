       Um.
Yes, I had to take a minute to process this when I heard it too! 
I'm an amateur beginner in the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories, but 9/11 has way to many facts that don't align with what happened that day. I'm posting this for a better understanding of the events that occurred that day; hoping there's facts that I'm just not aware of. In my opinion, it's almost anti-patriotic to not question the events of that day. Either way, the fact is that our country was attacked...either internally or externally...Terror happens through agendas internationally, but it's tough to accept terror happens domestically too by our own leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few questions for those who believe our governments investigation outcome was the truth...
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Where the heck was the plane that crashed in the field in PA? A huge commercial plane weighing tons disappeared and we were told it just burnt to a crisp? I call BS on that!
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Pentagon...look carefully at the single hole at the impact zone...wouldn't the 1 ton turbines on the wings cause much more destruction and holes? No plane. We're asked to believe that jet fuel burned so hot that it cause the plane to turned to vapor?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Two towers built with a titanium steel core; durable enough to take the impact of two commercial airliners when they were first constructed turned to powder in less than an hour? Anyone that's ever gone camping and dumped white gas into the campfire knows the fuel only caused a poof mushroom cloud that burns right out. Jet fuel would have exploded on impact and immediately burnt out...leaving small fires on the floors of impact until they burn out. I can see how the flames could've started burning much hotter over a few hours, but they would burn straight up with the infrastructure in tact. Each floor had 4" thick concrete slabs that would have stopped the fire from burning down cuz heat rises...right?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         At 4:21 on the afternoon of 9/11/01 WTC 7 crumbled to powder in six seconds. All of the government workers in the building coincidentally were given the day off. Side Note: This building also held the historical stock records for Enron.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mayor Giuliani was out in the streets all smiles calm and collected like nothing happened. Soaking up the media attention for being a politician that cares about the welfare of his people. It's strict protocol when a terrorist attack occurs that the mayor be moved to safety in a bomb proof shelter in the city...he was out smiling and making jokes in the streets...carefree was scary.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I have so many more, just want to hear other opinions on a few of the facts that still haunt me. I know we should respect the victims  families and allow them closure, but we owe it to the ones that didn't survive to find the real truth for closure...

       Building 7 collapsing in free fall after a series of visible charges being blown is smoking gun #1. The trade centers falling in free fall collapsing on its own footprint while again visible charges being blown all the way down. It’s heart breaking, it’s not a conspiracy and it means our Government will go to any length to get what they want. it’s devastating on so many levels!

       .. It fell in its own footprint at free fall rate. This is an implosion. The building free falling after you can plainly see charges going off, windows breaking where the charge goes off before it collapses in onto itself. It is what it is. You should really accept it.

       Those windows break because the internal structures is warping and collapsing, as can be seen by watching the roof collapsing before the rest goes down.

        Where the heck was the plane that crashed in the field in PA? A huge commercial plane weighing tons disappeared and we were told it just burnt to a crisp? I call BS on that!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Maybe a pre existing hole but there were witnesses (See Youtube) that saw little low flying planes zoom past them towards the crash site. Best guess couple of cruise missiles to give the illusion of 1 plane crashing, hence not much debris.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The Pentagon...look carefully at the single hole at the impact zone...wouldn't the 1 ton turbines on the wings cause much more destruction and holes? No plane. We're asked to believe that jet fuel burned so hot that it cause the plane to turned to vapor?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I can only say it was a cruise missile. (Plenty of youtubers have analysed this.)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Two towers built with a titanium steel core; durable enough to take the impact of two commercial airliners when they were first constructed turned to powder in less than an hour? Anyone that's ever gone camping and dumped white gas into the campfire knows the fuel only caused a poof mushroom cloud that burns right out. Jet fuel would have exploded on impact and immediately burnt out...leaving small fires on the floors of impact until they burn out. I can see how the flames could've started burning much hotter over a few hours, but they would burn straight up with the infrastructure in tact. Each floor had 4" thick concrete slabs that would have stopped the fire from burning down cuz heat rises...right?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        There are many "theories" about this including the Nuclear demolition from below and Dr. Judy Woods directed energy weapons to effectively dustify the towers. I don't think you need to know how but know that the NIST story was BS. (Look how many first responders have cancers now and make your own judgement.)

       <em>
        At 4:21 on the afternoon of 9/11/01 WTC 7 crumbled to powder in six seconds. All of the government workers in the building coincidentally were given the day off. Side Note: This building also held the historical stock records for Enron.
       </em>

      <p>
       <strong>
        First 3 buildings in history to fall into their own footprints from fires. Follow the money for the real motives and players. Look at 911 trillions on youtube for that. Daddy Bush ,Brady bonds and so much there.

        Mayor Giuliani was out in the streets all smiles calm and collected like nothing happened. Soaking up the media attention for being a politician that cares about the welfare of his people. It's strict protocol when a terrorist attack occurs that the mayor be moved to safety in a bomb proof shelter in the city...he was out smiling and making jokes in the streets...carefree was scary.
       </em>
       **
Never knew what to make of Giuliani, look at his police handler at the presser. He found a perfectly intact passport of Mohammed Atta (Supposed ringleader + Pilot) a couple of blocks from the trade center. He later went to jail, something unrelated.**

       Last answer about Giuliani, he is a connected player but more interesting was his poice handler that day.

       He found pilot and ringleader "Mohammed Atta's" passport a couple of blocks from the trade center.

       Apparently Mo rolled down the window of the plane and tossed it right before hitting the TC at 550 ish MPH. Yup. GO down the rabbit hole much to discover.

       Please listen to one interview with her and tell me how you can actually buy into anything she says. She is absolutely insane and reacts like a 9 year old when confronted. Her "scientific" explanation and reasoning is comparitible to someone claiming the earth is flat.

       I liked her view on it. The lack of concrete debris from the buildings and cars on the street burned were interesting. Personally I believe the buildings were just imploded but her take on it is eye opening.
