<p>Georgia Guidestones... </p>

<p>First item mentioned is to &quot;Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.&quot; </p>

<p>From what we&#39;re told, AI is coming quickly and it will take over much of the &#39;intellectual labor&#39;. Much of the physical labor has already been replaced by machines, the best example is agriculture. So the question is, do the elites need or want a bunch of &#39;useless eaters&#39; roaming around and always demanding more, more, more... of course not. A huge population is more difficult to manage and more difficult to keep in control. </p>

<p>Additionally, this population requires immense energy demands. If you ignore the moral implications of killing billions of people, &#39;culling the herd&#39; makes all the sense in the world from purely cold, calculated, consequentialist point of view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think there will ever be a plan similar to China&#39;s OCP? The plan was supposed to reduce China&#39;s population to 700M by 2080, assuming no other changes were made.   </p>

<p>Wealthier countries tend to have a lower birth rate, but longer life expectancy. Poorer countries have high birth rates, but lower life expectancy. If the whole world adopted this policy, some areas like Africa and South America will suffer greatly. China and India&#39;s growth could also be slowed down. But guess who that all benefits?   </p>

<p>Of course this would be difficult to regulate on a global scale, but what&#39;s stopping the ones in power to just kidnap thousands of African children and just say the parents violated the OCP? These kids then become adoptable for the richer countries, where you can have more than one kid; if you&#39;re willing to pay. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thinking recently, what if one of the biggest things being downplayed is population? We&#39;re going on 8 billion in a few years. Eight fucking billion people. More than one and a half people for every year the earth&#39;s apparently been around. Wrap your head around that. Too many! We&#39;re going to destroy everything. Something has to happen. Besides, they probably have just about everything they want from us. Just wrapping up the last finishing touches on the underground bases. Or off world bases. Maybe waiting for the final form of AI. Who the fuck knows. But something is going to happen sooner or later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Population control is something Imo we need to implement. </p>

<p>Having a child is a human right even though what amount of our population in this world is in extreme poverty? Or just poverty alone? Also the number of those uneducated or unfit to have a child? Yet no classes are needed. No standards need to be met. And then when these people fail to raise their children it&#39;s the children that suffer through out life or in foster care etc etc. </p>

<p>Not to mention the small percentage of population here in the U.S. alone who believe having a child after child is a right but use gov benefits to raise or pay for said child. Here where I am I&#39;ve been in groups of people who literally have no job, 3 kids with another on the way and just refuse to work or to better their standard of living. This number isn&#39;t a big deal, but it&#39;s the mindset that still exists for some. </p>

<p>We need comprehensive sexual education. Abuse education. Support programs. </p>

<p>Our population is increasingly uneducated and unable to either A)get a proper education or are B)unwilling. </p>

Y2K (year 2000), 2012, and like 10 others (two were in November, and a third around 1998).

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m convinced population control is just an ever-present part of the agenda when it comes to those in power. Wars, famine, and disease have most likely been orchestrated throughout human history to keep the masses in check. </p>

<p>Just look at the state of Europe after the bubonic plague. There was so much land, work, and food available that the rich had trouble keeping indentured slaves around. Which is great for those already in power if your rich rivals are too busy doing real work to plot your demise.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve always just been cannon fodder to those at the top. Subterfuge is a way of life when your peers expect you to lead the masses astray from the bigger picture. You say it&#39;s a war not democide or a plague instead of biological warfare. </p>

I think people who are self sufficient are harder to control, and people who rely on the local or federal government are easy to control.  Its hard to be self sufficient in a highly populated area.  Its literally set up so that you have to rely on the government&#39;s infrastructure.</p>
