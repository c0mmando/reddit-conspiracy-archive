       <strong>
        I would like to indicate that this is not a "Fuck the Police Rant or discussion". I am by no means saying that all cops in US are bad or cowards. I would like to discuss how this ruling has impacted the US police culture, how US society sees police as a whole, why it has not been put in to the constitution. I would also like to discuss how this ruling contects to the current problems of US society. And what can Americans do to change this ruling.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like state that I am from Canada and in Canada &amp; almost every other 1st world country the police are obligated by law to protect and help their citizens, to uphold the law, and society as a whole, even if it means sacrificing your own life. When I first heard about this I was fucking angry, and frustrated that US government does not care about its own citizens enough to protect them. I am still speechless at the stupidity of this ruling, how much pain a suffering could be avoided, how many lives could be saved etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TDLR; The US government has decided that those who cannot protect themselves, do not deserve protection. They decided that the police do not have to constitutionally protect and help the individual citizens of the United States. They are obiligated to uphold the law, and society as a whole.  The US has no constitutional laws that make it mandatory, regardless of personal bias to protect you. For those who think that the police of the right to choose who to protect etc... hopefully when it becomes apart of the constitution they can include the ability for current Cops who are not willing to fucking protect their citizens,regardless of personal beliefs and opions to resign with a severence package.

        My thoughts and Questions
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       üî∑Ô∏èIs current state of the US, due to one protecting its citizens?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        üî∑Ô∏è** There seems to be primitive, and unrealistic cultural notion in the US, that citizens should defend themselves. That is why they shouldn't police. This ignorant belief seems to be unqiue to the US. Everyone should have the right to be protected and to protect themselves.  Those who can protect themselves should continue to do so, but that shouldn't mean that those who are defenseless should not be protected. Children, and those who are  severely disable, the elderly, and many others cannot protect themselves, so do we just allow crimes to happen to them, to be abused, and taken advantage of?**
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       üî∑Ô∏èCould this be one of contributing factors of the unbelievable high crime rates in cities like Detroit, and Chicago? How would those societies  and societies like them improve with the law was change?
      </p>
      <p>
       üî∑Ô∏èIs it a form of population control? Kill off the citizens who cant protect themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       üî∑Ô∏èIs it because of the CIA, NSA, DOJ, or another 3 letter department? Is this how the CIA got away with drug smuggling? Why there is no regulation and accountability for CIA?
      </p>
      <p>
       üî∑Ô∏è Is it the Elite? To prevent the success and prosperity of the general population?
      </p>
      <p>
       üî∑Ô∏è Is it to keep America divide, sectionalized, and in choas?
      </p>
      <p>
       üî∑Ô∏èIs it Big Pharma? Why? To prevent the arrest of companies that produce harmful medication.
      </p>
      <p>
       üî∑Ô∏èEPA and Government officials? So that hey cannot get arrest? Could this be why Flint got so bad?
      </p>
      <p>
       üî∑Ô∏èIs it Corporations and Big Oil?
      </p>
      <p>
       üî∑Ô∏è Is it the
       <strong>
        Prison industrial complex?

       More crimes commited means more prisoners.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Warren, Taliaferro, and Douglas
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        In the early morning hours of Sunday, March 16, 1975, Carolyn Warren and Joan Taliaferro, who shared a room on the third floor of their rooming house at 1112 Lamont Street Northwest in the District of Columbia, and Miriam Douglas, who shared a room on the second floor with her four-year-old daughter, were asleep. The women were awakened by the sound of the back door being broken down by two men later identified as Marvin Kent and James Morse. The men entered Douglas' second floor room, where Kent forced Douglas to perform¬†oral sex¬†on him and Morse raped her.
       </p>
       <p>
        Warren and Taliaferro heard Douglas' screams from the floor below. Warren called¬†9-1-1¬†and told the dispatcher that the house was being burglarized, and requested immediate assistance. The department employee told her to remain quiet and assured her that police assistance would be dispatched promptly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Warren's call was received at Metropolitan Police Department Headquarters at 0623 hours, and was recorded as a burglary-in-progress. At 0626, a call was dispatched to officers on the street as a "Code 2" assignment, although calls of a crime in progress should be given priority and designated as "Code 1." Four police cruisers responded to the broadcast; three to the Lamont Street address and one to another address to investigate a possible suspect.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meanwhile, Warren and Taliaferro crawled from their window onto an adjoining roof and waited for the police to arrive. While there, they observed one policeman drive through the alley behind their house and proceed to the front of the residence without stopping, leaning out the window, or getting out of the car to check the back entrance of the house. A second officer apparently knocked on the door in front of the residence, but left when he received no answer. The three officers departed the scene at 0633, five minutes after they arrived.
       </p>
       <p>
        Warren and Taliaferro crawled back inside their room. They again heard Douglas' continuing screams; again called the police; told the officer that the intruders had entered the home, and requested immediate assistance. Once again, a police officer assured them that help was on the way. This second call was received at 0642 and recorded merely as "investigate the trouble;" it was never dispatched to any police officers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Believing the police might be in the house, Warren and Taliaferro called down to Douglas, thereby alerting Kent to their presence. At knife point, Kent and Morse then forced all three women to accompany them to Kent's apartment. For the next fourteen hours the captive women were raped, robbed, beaten, forced to commit sexual acts upon one another, and made to submit to the sexual demands of Kent and Morse.
       </p>
       <p>
        Warren, Taliaferro, and Douglas brought the following claims of negligence against the District of Columbia and the Metropolitan Police Department: (1) the dispatcher's failure to forward the 6:23 a. m. call with the proper degree of urgency; (2) the responding officers' failure to follow standard police investigative procedures, specifically their failure to check the rear entrance and position themselves properly near the doors and windows to ascertain whether there was any activity inside; and (3) the dispatcher's failure to dispatch the 6:42 a. m. call.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Nichol
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        On April 30, 1978, at approximately 11:30 p. m., appellant Nichol stopped his car for a red light at the intersection of Missouri Avenue and Sixteenth Street, N.W. Unknown occupants in a vehicle directly behind appellant struck his car in the rear several times, and then proceeded to beat appellant about the face and head, breaking his jaw.
       </p>
       <p>
        A Metropolitan Police Department officer arrived at the scene. In response to the officer's direction, appellant's companion ceased any further efforts to obtain identification information of the assailants. When the officer then failed to get the information, leaving Nichol unable to institute legal action against his assailants, Nichol brought a negligence action against the officer, the Metropolitan Police Department and the District of Columbia.

       <strong>
        THE VERDICT
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In a 4-3 decision, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed the trial courts' dismissal of the complaints against the District of Columbia and individual members of the Metropolitan Police Department based on the¬†public duty doctrine¬†ruling that *
        <em>
         "[t]he duty to provide public services is owed to the public at large, and, absent a special relationship between the police and an individual, no specific legal duty exists". *
        </em>
        The Court thus adopted the trial court's determination that no special relationship existed between the police and appellants, and therefore no specific legal duty existed between the police and the appellants.

       This isn‚Äôt a conspiracy, this is what they‚Äôve always been. Law enforcement officials are not personal bodyguards, their job is to enforce law, not protect individuals, sometimes those 2 things coincide and sometimes they don‚Äôt. No conspiracy here.

       Source: my dad was a law enforcement officer for 30 years and he always told me this.

       Ever consider that they brainwashed their own law enforcement to think that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Canada, France, England, Germany, Switzerland, Norway basically any first world country has it in their constitution to protect individual citizens. Why doesn't the US?
      </p>
      <p>
       What does that say about the Gov. And how it views their citizens?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about those who cant defend themselves? Fuck em and leave them to die, or be raped, tortured and killed?

       If you knew my dad you wouldn‚Äôt ask that. He‚Äôs a bigger conspiracy nut than any of you guys. Also the role of LAW ENFORCEMENT around the world is to ENFORCE THE LAW, not be personal body guards to individual members of society. Like I said, a lot of times they do overlap but not always.
