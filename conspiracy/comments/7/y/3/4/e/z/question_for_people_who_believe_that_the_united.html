        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just wanna say that I’m not on anyone’s side on this conspiracy, I just had a question for the people who think that the Apollo moon missions were faked.</p>

<p>When it comes to motives, one that always comes up is that America just had to show their superiority over Communist Russia.  Which honestly given how much the American government has been proven to lie, I really wouldn’t be surprised if they did something like fake the moon landings just to stick it to the communists.</p>

<p>But then again, this is the Cold War we’re talking here.  Would the Soviets not have kept a close eye on the whole ordeal?  If the Soviet Union didn’t find reason to believe the Apollo moon landings were faked, than to me that’s pretty compelling evidence that they were not faked.  The Soviet Union more than anyone else would benefit at exposing the United States if they in fact did such a thing.  Or is my question totally moot because they kept the knowledge of the moon landings from their people (like in modern day North Korea) although I bet that’d be way harder to do cause the Soviet Union was freaking massive while NK is real small.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Soviet Union and modern day Russia is always trying to minimize the international standing of the U.S and the west and also sow division both between the western nation&#39;s and internally. </p>

<p>For example, they spread conspiracy theories in the wake of the Kennedy assassination.</p>

<p>Russia has this concept called mushkova or something, basically translates to deception. They seriously embrace it both internally and externally in their foreign policy. One U.S official described the old KGB as &quot;deceptions within deceptions&quot;. </p>

<p>I would be surprised if they haven&#39;t attempted to push conspiracy theories about the Apollo missions.</p>

<p>Indeed in my opinion they probably have, some of the most &quot;technical&quot; appearing disparaging claims on the Apollo missions is a website depicting &quot;photograph analysis&quot; on the subject of stereographic / parallax by a fake Russian PhD candidate.  (it&#39;s not a real analysis of course). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So supposedly around the time of the Moon landings. America was helping build a oil pipeline from Northern Russia down the Baltic to Germany. Just like the Nordstream 2 that is being built now. The Soviets needed Western Technology (Turbines) for the pipeline to have enough pressure. America was supplying these &amp; the USSR really needed the oil revenues as Western Europe paid full price for oil. Soviet States got it dirt cheap or free in some cases. So the theory goes that because the USSR really needed this pipeline &amp; revenue the kept quiet about the Moon Landings. </p>

<p>(I’m not saying this is what I believe, I don’t)</p>

<p>This is just the most logical explanation I have came across. </p>
