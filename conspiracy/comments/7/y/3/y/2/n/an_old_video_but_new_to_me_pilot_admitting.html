       It's called cloud seeding, they do it all over the world. Not the same as"chemtrails". Chemtrails aren't real, cloud seeding happens during thunderstorm season.

       You see contrails. This video had nothing to do with what people think are chemtrails, it's cloud seeding which has the purpose of reducing the size of hail to reduce damage to property.

       Oh ok gotcha, so those crazy gridwork patterns being made in the sky are just commercial flights criss-crossing and flying way above the usual airspace. Makes sense! Especially since these planes are always small, pure white, and marked with no commercial logos. And it's so weird because when I see a Delta plane flying above my head, their contrails usually dissipate. Guess I'm just an idiot ;) Yeahhhh... Thanks bud!

       Wow, almost as if there are thousands of planes flying along published routes called airways, aka "highways in the sky" and are too high to make out any markings with the naked eye. Ever heard of flight aware or flightradar24? Every time someone brings up chemtrails, they always claim it's secret military planes yet cannot be bothered to actually check to see what's flying overhead.

       Commercial airliners don't leave lasting trails. Your strategy to take advantage of what is left unclear about my statements is quite sly and political. Obviously the grid patterns left in the sky by these unique and non-commercial planes are not consistent with air traffic patterns, but why am I even arguing with you? You have an emotional (or financial, or karmic) attachment to untruth so that's not my problem and I don't care what conclusion you make of me based on my decision not to argue with you over what I have seen. Thanks for recommending that app though. Might come in handy.

       You're completely wrong it's not even worth debating with someone as gullible as you. I work in the aviation industry, you trying to tell me they aren't regular air traffic patterns would be like me telling a mechanic that my car's engine doesn't require oil to operate.

       Again, taking advantage of the subjective parts of my statements and making them seem outlandish. Pepper in some ad hominem attacks and you have your false sense of triumph. You haven't seen an image of what I am describing, and you make the distinctly un-critical assumption that my eyesight is faulty. Logic is not on your side, buddy. Stop playing Einstein cause no one is worshipping you for telling them how to use their brains and eyeballs. You deserve all the downvotes.

       Ah, so you're now accusing me of being in on the conspiracy only because I'm part of a massive industry that this supposed conspiracy takes place in. Nice to see you have such a deep rooted core belief that you'd make a religious extremist blush. But you're the one to call me closed minded and asleep when you haven't offered anything of value here, just your own opinion and accusations.

       Don't put words in my mouth. You are very dramatic. Go to bed. Whatever core belief you think I hold is your own delusion. Stop attacking people on the internet. It doesn't make you more of a man. People know about shit whether or not you invest your entire ego trying to stop it. Now quit this harassment.

       Go clutch your gun under your pillow and try to fight off the nightmare that a bunch of flatearthers are coming to attack you.

      <p>
       Can't wait to see how you gracefully tie up your argument with some nice personal attacks and ridiculous accusations. As if what you have already written is not clear enough. If you're really losing sleep over this, then God be with ye.

       You still have yet to bring anything of value to the conversation. All I've seen from you is the same old thing from other chemtrail believers, which is "I see these trails and I don't think they are natural therefore they aren't." Then something along the lines of "it never used to be like this, obviously something fishy is going on" being completely ignorant to the fact that air travel has been steadily increasing year after year. In fact, bombers in WW2 had problems with contrails due to the fact that they had strength in numbers but on particularly humid days, those massive trails were like a huge beacon to the enemy basically saying "here I am!"

       Yes they do. Contrails last as long as conditions allow. Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin (kerosene); it is a hydrocarbon - a complex mix of carbon and hydrogen. When it burns in air it breaks apart and the carbon combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (H2O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 3.5 kilos of CO2 gas and 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding hot gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes where the temperature is minus 50 degrees the steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is dry the crystals will disappear in seconds through
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition">
        sublimation
       </a>
       , but if the air is saturated with water vapour then the crystals will grow many times in size into snowflakes through the opposite process called
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(phase_transition">
        deposition
       </a>
       and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else. A 747 burns around 11 tons of fuel per hour, which convert to around 13 tons of ice, which is around 24 kg per mile. It is a tiny amount compared with the thousands of tons of ice in a contrail, but only 0.003% of the water in a persistent contrail comes from the burnt fuel; the other 99.997% is from the atmosphere itself. It's not hard to see how a jet liner spewing fire and ice can leave a huge spectacular cloud behind it.

       That is great science, and awesome to share your knowledge like that. Thank you for informing me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately the details of your explanation don't stand up to mine and others' experience. That is that these chemtrails occur during every season, they dissipate in such a way as to create an artificial haze serving as cloud cover, and they occur at various levels in the atmosphere regardless of temperature, humidity, or any other condition. It should be relatively easy to catch a moment in the sky where a chemtrail aircraft is spewing while a commercial aircraft flies by without emitting any trace of cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I have already pointed out these planes are distinctly different from commercial airliners and your argument that my vision is poor is simply baseless. Weather manipulation/spraying by special planes has been proven, not only in the above video but also in
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWqJ9XvJ_X8">
        weather reports
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       That is all the energy I have to devote to the topic. It is up to people to decide their interpretation of events, so I would suggest that if you want to change people's minds, you do it in a way that does not include calling them out as "morons".

       defending a proposition by baldly asserting that it is "just how it is" distorts the argument by opting out of it entirely: the claimant declares an issue to be intrinsic, and not changeable.

       You've shown me that cloud seeding exists. Congratulations, I already knew that, I have a friend who used to be a cloud seeding pilot. Where you go wrong is thinking the thick trails in the sky from commercial airliners are the same thing. They are not and you haven't shown any evidence for it, just a false comparison.

       I've shown you those clouds are laced with silver iodide which is a hazardous chemical. Those cloud trails are filled with chemicals hence they are chemtrails. There you go. Proven.

       He was attenpting to say the contrails left by commercial planes are the chemtrails that are left in the sky. They are not. Those are left by white unmarked planes under the guise of cloud-seeding. Those are not naturally occuring contrails as he states.

       Alright, so to be clear, you think that the trails coming from a high flying aircraft's engine contain these chemicals? Because they don't and they aren't unmarked. What you're talking about doesn't condense like that into water. You seem to have skipped that part in chemistry about hydrocarbon combustion.

       That's weird when I called the CSIRO here in Australia they told me it was to bring in the rain. ABC here also had a news bit about farmers doing it themselves also to bring in rain in areas in drought.. Seems like we might have some contradictory info here from our officials?

       Reducing hail is not contradictory to inducing rain. In fact, they could go hand in hand. By preventing ice crystals from expanding, it might make condensation more likely to fall as rain instead.

       The point is to inject condensation nuclei into the clouds. In Canada, we don't have the fear of drought, we're more concerned about hail. The insurance companies pay a lot of money for these preventative programs, so the aircraft spray these particles in front of a storm front in the hopes the ice will get heavy enough to drop before it gets bigger and more destructive.

       A chemtrail is supposedly a trail of chemicals or metals sprayed from an aircrafts engine where the supposedly "tell tale" sign they're spraying is if the trail from the aircraft persists instead of dissipating quickly. What it actually is is a contrail in humid air where the water vapour from the engine, a byproduct of hydrocarbon combustion, freezes into ice crystals and remains. In dry air, these ice crystals immediately sublimate, thus having a short trail if one at all.

       Look young fella... I've lived this particular puppy for twenty adult years. You go out in wide open country day after day, look up at the sky, and watch what happens. Millions of people have this "scientific" opportunity to watch a half dozen aircraft turn a blue sky into grey haze. But what they do with their eye-witness account is classic psyop internalization - they cannot talk about it because they are told by seemingly expert authorities like you that they must be stupid, unscientific, illogical, naive, misled, over-exaggerating dipshits. This induces classic cognitive dissonance due to abuse. And you're the abuser. Just stop it. Send back the money and feel a little better about yourself.

       What I know and you do not is this meteorological effect of creating sun-blocking cirrus clouds by aircraft exhaust of some kind, had a beginning. There was a time when they did not. It was not just a gradual increase in air traffic. There was a point in time in the late 90's when it all started, aside from the early testing which had been on-going for decades. I watched it. I was aware of it. You can't just wave your self-certainty wand at me and make these realities disappear. But it will work on newbies. That's why...

       OK. Seen those. There's a massive difference between plain jet fuel contrails and nucleated micro or nano metals or metaloids which cause the characteristic chemtrail spread and meet and persist as a made-to-order "sun screen" cloud - which is what the global warmists insist we must do to reduce insolation and therefore expect to officially "start geoengineering" soon.  They just don't add that we've already tested it thoroughly. Good luck with your project, tho. And, if they pay you by the word - I think I should get a cut.

       It's not that at all and there is no evidence for any of those things. Contrails last as long as conditions allow. Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin (kerosene); it is a hydrocarbon - a complex mix of carbon and hydrogen. When it burns in air it breaks apart and the carbon combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (H2O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 3.5 kilos of CO2 gas and 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding hot gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes where the temperature is minus 50 degrees the steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is dry the crystals will disappear in seconds through
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition">
        sublimation
       </a>
       , but if the air is saturated with water vapour then the crystals will grow many times in size into snowflakes through the opposite process called
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(phase_transition">
        deposition
       </a>
       and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation or merge into a solid layer of haze. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else. A 747 burns around 11 tons of fuel per hour, which convert to around 13 tons of ice, which is around 24 kg per mile. It is a tiny amount compared with the thousands of tons of ice in a contrail, but only 0.003% of the water in a persistent contrail comes from the burnt fuel; the other 99.997% is from the atmosphere itself. It's not hard to see how a jet liner spewing fire and ice can leave a huge spectacular cloud behind it.

       Do you want my help with your science? Because its a famous 50-50 that you actually believe that your premises lead to your conclusions. I honestly don't want to have a science throw down with you - not getting paid for that as I have mentioned numerously. Plus many other projects to shed brain neurons on. I knew your intelligence level immediately - bot or human - you can see through the charade if you choose.

       Get over yourself. You're not Captain Chembuster and there's no conspiracy to poison the planet with chemtrails. If you wanna get angry about shit happening in the sky learn about what they want to do with Stratospheric Aerosol Injection. It is insanity.

       Right. You remember when many US cities were hurting from excess ozone? The project was to clear that out by "pressing" air masses away from urban centers, along with the ozone burden. I do not know the details, how it was managed, etc. but I do know that urban ozone diminished.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Multi-decadal model calculations for the 1990–2010 period are performed with the coupled WRF-CMAQ modeling system over a domain encompassing the northern hemisphere and a nested domain over the continental U.S. Simulated trends in ozone and precursor species concentrations across the U.S. over the past two decades are compared with those inferred from available measurements during this period. The model results suggest large and contrasting changes in tropospheric composition over the northern hemisphere with significant reductions in air pollution over North America and Western Europe and increase in large portions of Asia. The model is able to capture the changing seasonal distributions in surface O3 in the U.S. during 1990–2010 arising from changing emissions and long-range transport.

       Not getting into any debate, just have a question. If contrails require humid air, why are there variations in visibility on days when weather conditions are consistent in the desert? For example, if say, one is in a desert type environment and today the sky is grid marked, but tomorrow in similar to near identical conditions it is crystal clear. Say both days are weekdays, with similar flight patterns. I've witnessed this and I'm genuinely curious.

       The conditions near the ground are completely different than at higher altitudes. It's not like a big block of air is the same extending from the ground up into the sky, winds aloft, especially the jet stream, have a lot to do with what's going on than what you can see and feel around you. In fact, for thunderstorms to form, they need high humidity, unstable air and convective currents to a high altitude to form those big clouds, all of which might not be felt on the ground until the storm occurs.

       For the sake of argument, chemtrails are synonymous with the persistent contrails from high flying jet aircraft. These cloud seeders aren't going to leave a distinct trail like what you'd see from an airliner.

       I see what you're saying.   So you have to see the trail for it to be defined as a chemtrail.  I honestly don't know enough about humidity levels and how contrails work enough to argue the point very deeply but I know I have seen contrails so thick  and low I couldn't even see through them and they took about 4 hours to dissipate.  At 2am Dec 21, 2012 I saw the largest contrail of my life.  There were about 4 of them that blocked out the entire Western sky where I lived.  I could not even see the moon behind them, only the rays of light shooting out between them.  I made a joke about the end of the world when my wife and I saw the phenomenon.  I'm not sure if it was a contrail but I had never seen anything like it and have never seen anything like it since...

       It was a contrail. The conspiracy lies in people thinking if they persist that it's full of toxic metals and chemicals. It's literally a cloud coming from an engine. Just like how regular clouds form on humid days. You can try it out for yourself on a cool day. If it's humid, bring out a hot glass of water and you'll see the water vapour persist. In dry air, that vapour disappears pretty quickly.

       Sure, in high quantities it is. People directly involved with these programs haven't been reported to have ill effects from it even if they handled it enough for their hands to stain yellow for weeks, suggesting you'd need to ingest it in high quantities before being affected. By the time it reaches the ground, it would be hardly noticeable from the other toxins in the air getting collected by the rain from industry.

       Maybe research a little more before taking the word of TPTB and assuming something is harmless because they say so.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Silver iodide (AgI) is a yellow, inorganic, photosensitive iodide of silver used in photography, in medicine as an antiseptic, and in rainmaking for cloud seeding.  The crystalline structure of AgI is similar to that of ice, allowing it to induce freezing in cloud seeding for the purpose of rainmaking. Approximately 50,000 kg/year are used for this purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the guidelines of the United States Environmental Protection Agency Clean Water Act, silver iodide is considered a hazardous substance, a priority pollutant, and a toxic pollutant.
      </p>
      <p>
       A key manufacturer of silver iodide for weather modification, Deepwater Chemicals, warns of potential health effects of silver iodide in their Material Safety Data Sheet as follows:  Chronic ingestion of iodides may produce “iodism”, (chronic poisoning by iodine or iodides) which may be manifested by skin rash, running nose, headache, irritation of the mucous membranes, weakness, anemia, loss of weight and general depression. Chronic inhalation, ingestion or skin contact with silver compounds may cause argyria characterized by blue-gray discoloration of the eyes, skin and mucous membranes."

       You are implying that one needs to ingest a great amount of silver iodide in order to be harmed and that is incorrect. It states chronic inhalation...pretty sure we all breathe air every day correct? Then you factor in the impact of sliver iodide collecting in the water supply, farmland, and ecosystem and you can begin to see it is nowhere near as harmless as you are implying.

       It seems like you didn't bother to look through what I linked to. You're making it sound like any contact with it at all will kill you when the fact is that it takes extreme exposure to have any ill effects. There is no merit to what you posted when it's a site that shares the same narrative as you to prove your point.

       Are you serious? I don't think you even looked at tge link. Nowhere does it state the amount. It even says chronic effects on humans unknown. Guess it's considered safe as it hasn't been studied long enough to know what it will do with longterm exposure. The sheet does state it is toxic when inhaled or ingested or when coming into contact with skin and/or eyes. You are just making things up as you go along as you have no way of disproving what I posted. Nice try bud.

       It also says to call the poison control centre if you swallow toothpaste. How many times have you had to do that? And you seem to think that I'm suggesting this isn't a toxic chemical. I never said anywhere that it isn't.

       You are implying it is as harmless as toothpaste (which is harmful with flouride but that's a whole different debate). You have shown no evidence it has to be large quantities to be toxic ir that it is safe for long-term exposure. I've provided sources showing numerous toxic effects on humans as well as missing safety information on long-term chronic exposure on a chemical which we are being doused with on a nearly daily basis.

       In July, the state’s minister of revenue, Eknath Khadse, took a gamble: He hired Koliwad to carry out a $4.5 million cloud-seeding program over three months and across 100 square miles in the middle of the state, the largest campaign of this kind ever attempted in India.
      </p>
      <p>
       AND
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the uncertainty, the industry is on the rise. According to the World Meteorological Organization, more than 52 countries have active cloud-seeding operations—up from 42 four years ago. In the U.S. last year, 55 cloud-seeding projects were reported to NOAA. There’s even a luxury cloud-seeding market emerging—one European company, for instance, charges a minimum of $150,000 to guarantee good wedding weather by forcing clouds to rain in the days before the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       AND
      </p>
      <p>
       They do have competitors. There are 34 private companies worldwide that do weather modification, but there’s no bigger rival in aerial cloud seeding than the Chinese government, which spends hundreds of millions a year seeding clouds in 22 of its 23 provinces, both to clear pollution above cities and to enhance rainfall for farming. China has yet to allow private companies to enter its market, but Sweeney is making inroads; he sold his first cloud-seeding plane to Beijing last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       (These companies aren't sitting on their asses all day long).

      <p>

       Since he got his pilot’s license in 1974, he’s flown more than 6,000 hours of cloud-seeding expeditions.

       The latest data from the World Meteorological Organization compiled in 2000 listed 74 projects ongoing in 23 countries worldwide (WMO, 2000). In 2001 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) documented 66 projects conducted in the western U.S. Project objectives included fog dispersal, snowpack and rainfall enhancement, and hail suppression.

       The UAE’s NCMS last year had six pilots and six Beechcraft King Air c90 aircraft for its cloud seeding drills, which commence as soon as meteorologists forecast cloudy weather.
      </p>
      <p>
       (All it takes is cloudy weather, but we know they do it on crystal clear days as well).
      </p>
      <p>
       "Arabian Business can reveal that the UAE conducted 101 cloud seeding operations in the first quarter of 2017, compared to 77 in the same period last year. Thirty-one flights were made during the last week of rain from March 20-28, says the NCMS, while the average number of cloud seeding flights made in the UAE each year is between 160 and 200."

      <p>

      <p>
       "The UAE spent $558,000 on cloud seeding operations in 2015, Farrah told Arabian Business last year, but, with the uptick in operations since, this year’s budget is likely to be higher. The NCMS declines to reveal its budget for 2017, but provides information on the value of water produced from cloud seeding."

       You asked for sources on my claim that this was being done nearly every day. Glad you admit it is being done and tgat silver iodide is a harmful chemical. Chemtrails are the trails left by cloud-seeding which contains silver iodide as well as other harmful chemicals that are being measured in vast amounts in farm soil.

       No it's more than semantics. It's a trick called 'Bait and switch'. In this case, using real evidence of cloud seeding to claim that chemtrails are real, even though they are completely different and happen in different parts of the sky.

       Huh? Wouldn't it be easier just to control the narrative and the ppl that would talk about the narrative (media, academia), then spend millions on coming up with a new chemical formula???

       I don't need to prove it's wrong if it doesn't have any sources to support it's side. I don't know why you seem to not understand that empty claims are fallacious.

       So you're whole argument is based on how cloud seeding is a thing so therefore commercial airliners also spray these chemicals? That's a false equivalence.

       Alright, so to be clear, you think that the trails coming from a high flying aircraft's engine contain these chemicals? Because they don't and they aren't unmarked. What you're talking about doesn't condense like that into water. You seem to have skipped that part in chemistry about hydrocarbon combustion.
