       My answer to that question, is that it had no influence whatsoever. Of course, neither did any of the campaign ads or any other manipulative attempts made by all parties to try and sway voters. I have an immunity to obvious propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you answered yes, please explain how you were duped.

       Well you to kind of clarify what you mean by influence. If you were already against Hillary, and you continue to see a stream of anti Hillary rhetoric, it probably reinforces your position, which is "influence."

       Propaganda and advertisement doesn't work that way. People don't say, "Hey, you know I saw two Burger King ads this week and they made some really good points about the quality of their burgers, so I think today I will choose Burger King over McDonald's."

       If you have enough self-awareness of your own decision-making, you should be able to answer this.

       Saying, "I don't know", just means you haven't examined why you make certain decisions.

       How can one really be sure they were not influenced in such a way?

       That's simply not true at all. There's no way for you to know that you didn't read a post that was a Russian planted story and it didn't affect you. You may have your own reasons now for having supported Donald Trump, but to say with certainty that you were never affected by something that you did not realize was Russian misinformation is insane.

       So, in other words, if millions of dollars spent by the elites have little to no impact on the choices people make, the notion that these so-called Russian trolls had any impact is laughable.

       Propaganda is not good at swaying an opinion.

      <p>
       Reinforcing people's opinions, or ensuring they don't "swing" during an election is still an affect.

       BTW, when I initially responded to your comment above, all I saw was, "poor guy", and I didn't get the rest for some reason until just now.

       Sorry about your anxiety. I do happen to have a lot of experience with that affliction. Two things to try:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Focus your energy on helping other people. This will change your perspective, redirect your attention, and really help you get out of your own head.
      </p>
      <p>
       -and-
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Get a good NLP program to work on retraining how your mind thinks (i.e. the stories, images, words and thoughts you focus on and tell yourself every day). It's powerful stuff. And, as crazy as this sounds, Tony Robbins knows what he's talking about and his info can really help. Also, check out George Hutton.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just thought I'd throw that out there, as I know how debilitating anxiety can be.

       You're a smart guy and I suspected this was why you weren't understanding me. Yes, I was either subjected to the Russian propaganda or not. That's a yes or no answer.

      <p>
       But to get that answer, I would need to be aware of EVERY talking point, EVERY social media hashtag trend, EVERY banner ad, and the identity of EVERY person I've interacted with since 2013.

       Well I didn't vote for Trump and I think he's a Zionist and he's not draining the swamp, but I firmly believe that the Russia collusion narrative was thought up because the democrats lost the election and they needed some kind of explanation, and now they are so deluded that they actually believe it... but I just don't think it's actually real, if it was they would have been able to prove it by now and Trump would be out of the office. I just said that I would accept it if he said it because I don't think he would ever say it, unless we are talking about some kind of bizarro world.

       New evidence surfaces almost every week, but you stopped caring to hear it long ago. Trump has now admitted that Russia sought to interfere in our elections. What will he admit to next? What will he pull a total 180 on next?

       This isn't a new thing. For example, consider Hillary Clinton helping Bush gain support for invading Iraq from her seat in the Senate. Things have gotten worse, but they've been bad for decades. Do you remember that we also bombed Iraq when Bill Clinton was president?

       Well, considering my vote for Trump was very much different from most others, I don’t think I was influenced at all.  (Worth mentioning, I was actually pretty amused to see that with the Wikileaks texts, “Assange’s view” was very similar to my own.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I chose Trump because the two
       <em>
        unique
       </em>
       possibilities that he presented were:
      </p>
      <p>
       A.  He is telling the truth and will actually work to fix things like he says.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or
      </p>
      <p>
       B.  He will be the terrible, authoritarian, right-wing despot that the Democrats accused him of in the worst case scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both of these I was good with.  The first one because of obvious reasons, the second one because
       <em>
        that would ensure that we don’t get another consolation prize fake progressive like Obama or Hillary, but would make the country swing towards someone like what Sanders campaigned on.
       </em>
       (Though Sanders is questionable now that we get a better look at him, and the Establishment is fighting
       <em>
        hard
       </em>
       to pull people back to mainstream candidates.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The other possibility, of Trump just being a generic conservative neocon wasn’t really worth worrying about because (ignoring all conspiracy theories or negative portrayals entirely) we
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       that is what Hillary offered.  It was explicitly her campaign, more of the same.  If she had won, it would have crushed the ability for outsiders and independent candidates because like Obama, she would keep things
       <em>
        just comfortable enough
       </em>
       that people may complain but they wouldn’t take action.  And the establishment would win this challenge and be secure for another 20 years or more.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, even the people who totally buy into the mainstream narrative are a gross benefit to the people.  Even if initial motivations are media hysteria against Trump, there are
       <em>
        to s
       </em>
       of people who are shaking off the chains of complacency and becoming politically active, paying attention to policy, noticing the small local elections.  Because of Trump, an entire generation is getting involved in politics in ways that haven’t happened in the modern age.  Even if right now they are being manipulated, it won’t hold them forever because even
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       next election the media steers them to vote for a Soros candidate, when shit is still fucked up, or if it gets worse, they are now active and aware.  They have “tasted blood.”  It is easier to continually perpetuate a scam on complacent and ignorant people.  Once they are aware and active like now, the scam may work once, but they have seen their power to affect change and if the exercise of  that power doesn’t get the results they wanted, they will not continue to donate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Democratic primaries were held
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       instead of 2 years ago, Hillary
       <em>
        could not
       </em>
       pull what she did, the people won’t settle for a consolation prize anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the conservative side, the fact that Trump
       <em>
        won
       </em>
       has already shown the voters their power;  they defied the efforts of
       <em>
        the entire political and media establishment of this country
       </em>
       .

       Lol. No.  But it is also to say that I think a large number of Trump or Hillary or anyone else’s supporters fell for some form of propaganda.
       <em>
        None of it was Russian
       </em>
       but the post about the coin pimp and reddit manipulation (even if that account is bullshit, that is still exactly how marketing on reddit or 4chan is done) shows just how pervasive influence peddling is.  And look at any sub, it is mostly glaringly obvious, but the better ones make it more hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was the long explanation, I doubt anyone is immune to it.  I may not be, but I am not very aware of a propaganda campaign during the elections that really pushed that angle because it is the opposite of what any politician wants anyone to be thinking.

       How much did they spend in ads? $100k? How is that going to influence an entire population when the two party "choices" were spending millions of dollars and attacking each other? This conspiracy never made any sense to me. They're just trying to make excuses for Hillary losing it seems. I didn't vote for the that witch nor did I for the bafoon that won and I wasn't brainwashed by ads from anyone, it was just common sense.

       If I was in America, I would most likely of been influenced by the “news” outlets. Some were saying Hillary had 98%+ chance of winning. I don’t think I saw many predicting Hillary would lose, and if it was, it certainly was not 98% in favour of Trump.

       What a dumb post. If you truly believe that you are capable of remembering every post, every comment, every talking point that you ever encountered before presidential election then you must be the smartest m*********** on this planet
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like Russians sent Scheels door-to-door to argue in favor of trump. Their angle was creating social media trends and pushing talking points at Key moments. They organized rallies posing as true Americans. They cultivated social media presence is pretending to be Americans. They reached out to news agencies with talking points to push agendas.

       Read my reply to ThorVonHammerdong on the binary nature of reality if you'd like to debate this, as it sounds to me like you're a victim of postmodernist ideology. Which also would explain your anxiety, btw.

       Ahh, yes, you'd like to get into a philosophical debate. Okay, if you're game, this'll be fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you look deeper into the nature of reality, you'll find it's binary (up/down, right/wrong, start/stop, black/white, male/female, dark/light, good/evil, good/bad, objective/subjective, positive/negative, hot/cold, happy/sad, alive/dead, thesis/antithesis, true/false, etc. etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, saying something is, "mostly true" or "mostly false", is simply playing around with semantics to avoid the uncomfortable commitment to one or the other. Something can't be mostly true, and partly false. Or, mostly false, and partly true. It either is or it isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have a very hard time with this. This is due to the indoctrination of postmodernist thinking that says that there's no such thing as ultimate truth and everything is relative, blah blah blah. This is a false ideology when you break it down and very destructive. It's also a big reason why people are confused and don't know who or what to believe in anymore. But getting into the details of that requires a whole separate discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, back to the argument of a binary reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, some people will say, but there are exceptions to every rule. Again, this is semantic game people play to try and explain mutations, misfits, etc., and is due to the limitations of language - an imperfect invention if there ever was one. But, it's all we have to communicate these ideas, so it will have to suffice for now. Yes, there are visual, auditory, and kinesthetic, etc. ways of communicating, but they follow the same rules. Exceptions, in other words, don't negate the rules, they're simply examples of things that don't follow them. Why? Because nature, language, life, the universe, everything is imperfect/perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, everything is contradiction. That's what makes this so difficult and easy to understand once you grok it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the Schrodinger's Cat experiment, for example. This is a beautifully simple explanation for how two things can exist simultaneously (the cat being both alive and dead) until, that is, you observe it and find out one way or the other. In the quantum world, the potentiality for either exists, but collapses into one possibility or the other in the real world of conscious interaction (i.e. observation).
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, what about the example of black/white, hot/cold? Aren't there shades of gray or degrees of temperature? Yes, and they're still on the binary spectrum. Let me explain. Say something is warm. That's a degree of hot. Say something is cool. That's a degree of cold. White is all light combined, and the absence of color. Black is the absence of light, and the combination of all colors. So, if you're speaking strictly of color, each one is either adding or subtracting to the polarity of opposites. (Btw, applying these terms to racial identity is not only a gross misuse of the words, it serves to divide people by something that is in reality indistinguishable under close observation.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I know what you're thinking. He's say that things are true and false simultaneously, so it's both. The Russians did and did not influence people's decisions. Exactly. Which is why I asked the question in the first place. And if you observe your own thoughts on this matter, and be honest with yourself, you'll be able to answer the question with a yes or no. Any other answer would be due to a lack of examination on your part. "I don't know" is a cop out to avoid answering. In short, it's fear of commitment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me give you another example. Let's say someone asks you if you like something, or want to do something, and you answer, "maybe". The word itself connotes a wishy-washy lack of commitment. In reality, you want to say no, but you don't want to offend, so you say maybe instead. Everyone (again, if they're being honest) knows that it means you really don't want to do (or like) something, but we play this little game and say, "well 'maybe' he/she really wants to, or would like to, but just isn't saying it, and will change their mind and say yes." One thing I've learned over the years and, admittedly, I haven't learned a lot, is that if it's a maybe or I don't know, then it's a no in disguise. If someone were to ask you if you like a song or a movie, and you say maybe or I don't know (or the worst chickenshit word of them all, "kinda"), what you're really doing is lying to the person to avoid hurting their feelings or avoid the uncomfortable feeling yourself of being decisive. And, for a lot of people, being decisive is uncomfortable. Now, you can always change your mind later, for whatever reason, but the answer will always be (or should be) one or the other. Binary.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, reality is that simple. And complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       One final thing I'd like to address. Computers use a binary system of 1's and 0's to digitally recreate pictures, sound, and text. And the technology is advancing to the point where it may eventually be able to create a world nearly indistinguishable from actual reality. And wouldn't you know it, recently a theoretical physicist has even discovered that the universe may in fact just be an incredibly advanced simulation (using binary computer code) by an as yet unknown designer.

       Russians duped me into supporting Bernie back in '03 when Hillary voted for the Iraq War.  Then when Hillary called TPP the "gold standard", once again Russians convinced me to support Bernie.  When Clinton got paid all that money for speeches to Goldman-Sachs is when Russians convinced me Stein would be a valid choice if Bernie was unavailable.  Russians sold me on Stein when Hillary backed 3rd party access for encryption.  Hillary's friendship with Henry Kissinger worked well for the Russians who wanted to cement my support for Stein.  I didn't even need Russians to remind me of Hillary's support for NSA spying, the "patriot" ACT and continuously trying to re-animate the SOPA/CISPA/PIPA zombie.  Though they did send a flyer, Russia didn't need to remind me of Hillary's resistance to core issues of the left like universal healthcare and a better minimum wage.

       My conversations with the Kremlin didn't really involve Trump, so I can't speak to any of those allegations.

       I grew up with my parents watching news and constantly yelling bullshit at the TV box.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I grew older I realized why they kept watching news knowing it's mostly bullshit, it's so enticing and surreal that people can get addicted to stories (false or not) and although I can't prove it I just know that media likes to create more and more stories to keep people running in circles.
      </p>
      <p>
       News is like a drug, why do they call it the red PILL, even in conspiracy world they want your ideas to fit their red/blue paradigm. There's usually an agenda behind major stories cuz they don't like people finding out the truth and when media starts talking too much about weirder conspiracies I feel like it's cuz the old kind of news wasn't working so much to keep people in a comatose state and it's just new programming.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't personally affected by Russiagate but something probably happened collectively, thankfully more and more people are discerning bullshit better in their LIVES now. News isn't very relevant anymore, people starting to realize we all affect the whole and these are just projections to alter our perception of how living our life should really be like. I feel they're losing control and just pushing any news stories they can hoping someone will cling to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I even look at 9/11 and wars as psychological attempts to manipulate our thoughts cuz our thoughts affect our perception and reality, warring together on one planet over resources(?)...I don't even know what they're
       <em>
        supposedly
       </em>
       fighting for, with the controlling forces behind wars depleting our nonrenewable resources is retarded and kinda obvious there's a connected intelligence group behind all the suffering cuz normal people get along just fine in the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: News is bullshit.

       Difficult to say, since the infiltration was so pervasive. I voted for Clinton but did so feeling like there was a proverbial gun to my head. My loathing for her had nothing to do with the disinformation campaign; I simply remember the fiasco when her husband was in the oval office. I voted Sanders in the primaries, but here in Arizona our primary elections were a joke, too. THAT is fact. My DIL is one of the people who had been registered for over a decade and never failed to vote, but magically her voter registration went "poof" when it came time for this election.

       Nobody was duped. Even DEMS have huge numbers of Hillary haters. Face it, she’s not likeable. Never has been. Read the Wikileaks emails....even her own minions hate her and think she smells like boiled cabbage urine and farts. (Thanks for that Pedosta, it never gets old).  Hillary lost all on her own. Russian trolls were probably hired by her to trash Bernie. She then used Alinsky tactics 101 (accuse the enemy of that which you are guilty) to start a Trump Russia narrative.
