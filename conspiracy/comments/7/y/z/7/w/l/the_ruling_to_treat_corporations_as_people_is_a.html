       Before I start, let me just say I have no proof for this.  Also I can't believe that this is a systemic desire, but only one wanted by a limited few.  That said:
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't conceive that ruling corporations as people by the supreme court was in any way protecting the citizens of the US.  So why?  My thought:  it is so it will be justifiably revoked opening the door to revoking the status of "personhood" from any or all subcultures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our culture has been advancing the "us vs them" narrative.  This has happened in the past... But usually it was the result of a threat.  Unless you consider people looking for safe haven a threat, this division seems unprovoked.  So why push the agenda?  So that people will demote themselves willingly if the option is available.  This is why decision makers will actively grant mindless entities "presonhood"... So that when it's revoked, being a person will be suspect for interpretation.

       Thanks for proving my point.  What about them?  Should they be a "person" should they not?  The line gets fuzzy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not here to define a "person", although I think any "group" should not be treated as an individual entity (lest we open the floodgates).  I'm just here to allow you to make your own observation on this topic.

       Should corporations like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have the right to freedom so speech?
      </p>
      <p>
       According to your logic, it would be best to all the government to censor the ACLU because it is just a corporation.  In addition, the ALCU, because it would have no rights, could not represent people in Court or lobby Congress to change the laws.  Because it would have no rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using your logic, only individual people, who happen to have the millions of dollars necessary to sustain national legislative agendas should be allowed to have rights.  When poor people band together to implement national policy, they do so as a corporation, and you want that corporation to have no rights.

       If that's your take, I can understand why you support this.  Personally I think it's a false dichotomy: ensuring freedoms are limited only to people does not mean that the rich are the only ones with influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to get into one of the other horrible decisions made by the supreme court (that money is a form of speech) we can, but I think it should be sufficient to say that our government is easily too dependent on being paid off and I see that as an easy misdirect from what we should actually be talking about.

       Perhaps you can site a single poor person who has influenced national politics without the use of a corporation.  MLK?  Nope.  Susan B. Anthony? Nope.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, every single major political movement has been associated and championed by corporations.  This includes, Abolition, Womens Vote, Black Rights, Prohibition, and Voting Rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as soon as you eliminate a corporation's right to fee speech, you eliminte the tax free deduction.  If you give money to another individual to speak freely for you, you do not get to deduct it on your taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, your proposal would be horrible for any social causes and merely entrench the establishment.

         I assume that only applies to citizens.  If corporations aren't citizens then they laws can be written to indicate that corporations must pay taxes "period".

      <p>
       Yeah... and that was before they were considered "citizens".  Why give them more influence?  If a cause should be pushed forward, then let the corporations fund it and the people's speech carry it forward.  If you have corporations doing the whole thing then you should expect indentured servitude to be close behind (if it's not already here).
      </p>
      <p>
       But again... these are my own personal views that have nothing to do with the opening topic.  Disagree with them if you want.  Ultimately I don't want to be demoted to the same legal classification as a toaster.

       so no source then?  At least I see what you mean now: you can't write off taxes for employing someone (even though this happens all the time with "under the table" payments).  Although I'm still a bit perplexed on how this applies to the necessity for corporations to have free speech.  Further explanation would be nice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if this is what you were referring to with the Dunning Kruger effect, then you seem to be shooting yourself in the foot.  The study shows that people expect that most individuals not only have the same knowledge base as they have themselves, but will know it better than others relative to their actual understanding.  For this reason, the uninformed think they know more than they do and the informed think everyone else should understand the nuance they are addressing.  I've attempted to ask you about the things I'm ignorant of.  You in turn have provided sarcastic answers (leading me to believe you fall into the first category of individuals).  I hope I'm wrong.

       There is a general level of basic knowledge and problem solving skills that people need.  You ask for a "source."  Sure, I'll get to that in a second.  The issue is that this "source" is so commonly known, the fact you are asking for it makes me question your motivation.  In addition, you could easily google "tax deductions to organizations" and it would tell you the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, the source is IRC 501(c)(3).  IRC stands for Internal Revenue Code. That is the tax code for the United States.  It is so common that organization refer to their 501c3 status -- which means the donations are tax exempt.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, you can see on the Souther Poverty Law Centers page, it says its is a 501c3.
       <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/about/financial-information">
        https://www.splcenter.org/about/financial-information
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Southern Poverty Law Center is a tax-exempt, charitable organization incorporated in 1971 under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. All contributions, grants and bequests are tax deductible. Our tax identification number is 63-0598743.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If you like libertarian or neo-con type of charities, there is The Federalist Society.
       <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/The_Federalist_Society">
        https://ballotpedia.org/The_Federalist_Society
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies (The Federalist Society) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., that aims to challenge what the group considers to be "a form of orthodox liberal ideology which advocates a centralized and uniform society" in the legal profession.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As such, organizations that seek to advance various social causes frequently incorporate and comply with IRC 501(c)(3) so that people can pool their money together on a tax-free basis.  If you and 10,000 other people wanted to pool your money together to advance public understanding of the Dunning Kruger effect, when you transferred the money to the individual (non-corporation) who was going to handle the money, that would not be tax deductible.  In addition, there would be numerous problems with supervision of the spending of the money and dealing with bizarre events, such as the person dying, going insane, etc.  Because of all these well known problems, corporations were created.

       If you want to take rights away from corporations, it will only help those who are already rich and powerful and new groups who wish to pool their money to fight for a common goal will be at a disadvantage. A lack of new organizations to advocate for important social causes supports the status quo.

       That makes your point much more clear.  Thank you.

       Although you (like many others here) are making a claim of false dichotomy.  You say "either corporations exist or we can't pull our money together".  You leave out the fact that we could set up a general trust and contract it to be used for one reason.  No corporations are needed.  No new entities are introduced into the definition of "personhood", and no freedom of speech is needed for the trust (since all arrangements are made by people).
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'm not going to argue which of us is right, you have your view which works for you and I have mine that (I feel) could be implemented with the right motivation.  I don't care which path we take as long as the rights of the common man are not degraded -
 whether that be due to overshadowing (from the rich or the corperate powerhouses) or reclassification (because revoking "personhood" is an option).

       If you look at the IRS scandal in which small non-profit corporations were targeted because of their political affiliations, it should be obvious that small corporations are a threat to the establishment.  The fact that the government specifically targeted the 501(c)(3) corporations and attempted to deny them 501(c)(3) status is a clear indication that the need for 501(c)(3) is critical to these types of small citizen-interest groups having a voice in the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       While trust and contracts can mimic corporations to a large degree, people today can chose between those two options. People overwhelming chose corporations because they are much easier to administer and manager.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also do not follow your argument that currently the law is that government is restricted from regulating the free speech of corporations.  You feel that by removing that restriction on government power will further the freedom on the citizens.  Increasing government's power will never increase the rights of the citizens.

       It's not restricted... But I doubt it will exercise that authority.  Like you said, corporations are a threat to the establishment... except I would go further to state that big corporations already control it.  And yes I do believe that using the government as the tool that it was designed for (to protect its citzens) is in the people's best interest.  It is much better than the alternative: letting the amoral, economy consuming corporations to run wild.

       Wanna know a secret? The supreme court never voted to ratify that corporations are people under the 14th amendment. In fact, they struck down cases that argued corporations aren't 'artificial people' something like 200 times the year before that was ratified. How it was ratified was: A court reporter that had ties to one of the railroad corporations wrote in the margins of an unrelated ruling on fencing that 'corporations are people as put forth by the 14th amendment'. The judge never said that, a court reporter wrote it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since we have a commonlaw system, some other lawyer successfully cited that reporters scribbles in a different case, and that created a precedent they ran with.
      </p>

       It was a dirty trick. Done 100 years ago. We're still paying for it today.

       You're link is a blog post with a single source:  The book you listed previously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something I find interesting is that the article fails to mention that
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscoe_Conkling">
        Roscoe Conkling
       </a>
       , a US Congressman and lawyer is one of the people who argued before the Supreme Court that the 14th Amendment applied to corporations.  Roscoe Conkling helped draft the 14 Amendment.
      </p>
      <p>
       But all that is kind of irrelevant anyway, because corporate personhood existed long before the 14th Amendment, or the case the article and book you linked are talking about.

       Corporations were 'artificial' persons previously. 14th amendment was created to stop discrimination against blacks and mexicans in reconstruction era south. That was it's purpose. How corporations could ever think an amendment like that would apply to them is fucked up in of itself.

       People are treated as corporations.  Something to do that coincides with our name being printed in ALL CAPS.  It's just another one of those out of site things that no one talks about and ultimately fucks people over.  I never looked into it real deep because it is just depressing but people are not people as far as laws that protect the rights of people are concerned.

       What ruling are you talking about?  The legal principle of corporate personhood goes back a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1819 a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_corporate_law">
        US Supreme Court case, Trustees of Dartmouth College v Woodward,[4] went so far as to say that once a corporation was established a state legislature (in this case, New Hampshire) could not amend it. States quickly reacted by reserving the right to regulate future dealings by corporations.[5] Generally speaking, corporations were treated as "legal persons" with separate legal personality from its shareholders, directors or employees. Corporations were the subject of legal rights and duties: they could make contracts, hold property or commission torts,[6] but there was no necessary requirement to treat a corporation as favorably as a real person.
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I can't conceive that ruling corporations as people by the supreme court was in any way protecting the citizens of the US.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Corporate personhood what's known as a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_fiction#Corporate_personhood">
        "legal fiction."
       </a>
       A legal fiction is an assertion accepted as true, though probably fictitious, to achieve a particular goal in a legal matter.  In the instance of corporate personhood this is done so a corporation can own property, enter into contracts, sue and be sued, etc.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        My thought: it is so it will be justifiably revoked opening the door to revoking the status of "personhood" from any or all subcultures.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't see how this would be possible.  There's 200 years of case law supporting corporate personhood, and Title 1 Chapter 1 of the United States Code includes corporations in its definition of legal persons.

       Do you know the background for Citizens United?  The TL;DR is that a group called Citizens United made a video critical of Hillary Clinton and started distributing it.  Hillary had the FEC ban the video.  It went to court, and the court ruled that the government cannot ban speech just because it is an election year.  The decision did not allow corporations to donate to campaigns, it did not create the idea of corporate personhood, it just stated that speech, by individuals, corporations, unions, whatever, could not be banned simply for occurring in a specific time frame preceding an election.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the right decision.

       I don't know if the Supreme Court could do it, but even if it were possible, there is no way that corporate personhood will ever be revoked.  If it were, every contract signed by a corporation would become null and void instantly.  Every piece of property owned by a corporation would fall into an unknown state of ownership.  Our legal system would be overloaded with lawsuits trying to sort it all out, our economy would collapse because corporations could no longer function, and society in general would be thrown into chaos.

       Well I'm glad corporations don't sign contracts... employees do.  As such the law can be amended (if the desire was there) to keep contracts legally binding since the signer (a person with rights) was given authority to speak for a group of people.

       I'm trying to be reasonable here, but your making it hard to do that.  This statement is not only ignorant of the necessary precautions the legislative branch makes while drafting laws but you assume that decision would be made in one huge step instead of tearing it down piece by piece.

       I don't claim correctness here.  Your claims seem on par with his given the right context.  He may have used incorrect terminology, but it doesn't seem far off to think that the supreme court was ensuring that the decision to have personal rights didn't fall to the corporations.  I think this is what he was meaning by "ratify" but you'll have to check that with him.

       I'm not as well versed on the law as you are, but I know that corporations were not always explicitly imbued with "free speech" or "individual rights".  It was the interpretation of the courts that allowed this shift in "personhood" to happen and it was a mistake (possibly well intended, but a mistake none-the-less).

       You seem to be under the impression that a corporation must have these rights or our society would crumble.  You might be right, but that's only because of the house of cards built on top of this foundation.  Regardless of our ability slowly undo this decision (which I think needs to happen if we are ever going to regain a influential voice again), changing the definition of "person" to exclude different entities - or at least reclassify them to take away some rights - is a stepping stone to removing rights from the common man.

       You seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of what corporate personhood is and why it exists.

        Well I'm glad corporations don't sign contracts... employees do. 
As such the law can be amended (if the desire was there) to keep contracts legally binding since the signer (a person with rights) was given temporary authority to speak for a group of people.

       You are basically describing what corporate personhood is, and you don't even realize it.

       What "necessary precautions" will prevent the chaos caused by overturning 200 years of legal precedent?  How, exactly, do you "tear it down piece by piece?"

       No.  The Supreme Court does not ratify amendments, ever.  And they're not my claims, the process is laid out in the Constitution.

       This is the crux of the matter.  You think corporate personhood is bad, so it doesn't matter what I say, or the reasoning behind the court decisions, or anything else.  You want it gone and that's that.

       "In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, "I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away." To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: "If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it."  - G.K. Ghesterton

       Oh I see a use for it (as I described before), but I see the law as using a sledgehammer when they should have used a scalpel.  They don't need to give corperations rights to allow them to be accountable or to "agree" to things via contracts.  They don't need to be allowed to have a voice (via campaign contrabution) to allow people to be given equal treatment.  Alternatives exist that treat corporations as the legal inanimate objects they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is my transparent distain to this ruling correct?  Possibly, possibly not.  Many people share it (which in itself is not meaningful... But it should be noted) so if the government is supposed to do the will of the people, they should consider these alternatives.  Regardless that is not what this thread is about.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, this conversation is irrelevant for the point given.  As I said before: if this personhood was ever dismissed or recategorized, we need to ensure this doesn't effect the common man.  Again (for the final time) that is an "if" that may never happen or never need to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again (for the final time) if corperations remain able to make legal decisions as people, it is only matter of time before they gain a leadership role or push for the decision that their rights are more important than mine and yours  (which is already happening).  There are alternatives to this and shutting down the conversation on the basis of president is not only I'll informed, but dangerous.
