       despite the warnings from Mueller, despite the warnings from Facebook, Twitter and Google, Trump has said nothing. Trump has done nothing to protect us from future election meddling.

       <p>
        In the four days since we learned chilling details about the full scale of Russia’s attack on our democracy, Donald Trump has issued a stream of unhinged and dishonest tweets attacking everyone and everything from Oprah [Winfrey] to Pennsylvania’s redistricting map. What he hasn’t done is condemn the Kremlin’s attack on our democracy or vow to defend our elections against future attacks.

       So you're not bothered the Russia spending millions per month to pay trolls to influence our social media? You're not bothered by Russian hackers infiltrating our voter roll system? You're not bothered by Russian hackers stealing our politioning emails and weaponizing them to help their guy and hurt their opponent? Fine by you?

       I’m just not naive enough to believe it had any impact on the election, and even if it did it doesn’t matter- we got one of two evils.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m curious why no one has made a big deal about the US doing this for the better part of the last century and suddenly people care. It’s clearly fake outrage, people don’t actually care but if the fake outrage helps their side they’re all about it.

       You have any evidence any of this supposed Russian interference swayed enough people to "steal" the election?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I find it kind of insulting that people actually believe Americans are so stupid that we are easily influenced to vote one way or the other due to memes on social media. Is no one smart enough to make a well-informed decision in this country? It's not like we were given two shining examples to pick from. For most, it was picking who they thought was the lesser of two evils.

       I have not heard anyone except right wing talk radio make this claim. No one claims Russia changed a vote. That is a perfect strawman. What is true is that Russian hackered did successfully penatrate some state voter roll system. And Trump let them get away with it.

       Obama was right then. And with people like you defending Trump with this crap. If we do nothing, maybe it will be true in 2018 or 2020.

       Are you stupid? The first link is a picture of Trump with the Saudi leader. Saudi Arabia and Iran absolutely hate each other they are involved in a lot of Sunni Shia conflict.

       Second of all even if they did warn Russia about the Syrian missile strikes, Russia still vehemently disapproved of Trumps action and they came out against him for it.

       And Trump is actually not against Syria and Iran even though Iran’s leaders say that the US needs to withdraw their troops from Syria because it is a violation of international law, yet Trump continues to have troops stationed in Syria against the will of Iran and the Syrian government?

       Yes, the US has slapped economic sanctions against Iran and their military presence in the Middle East is against Iran’s interests, and their extreme support for Saudi Arabia and Israel goes against Iran’s interests and i for one believe that an invasion is on the table. We have to wait and see the future but it is clear as daylight that the United States and Iranian leaders are not “in bed” with each other

       I told you. His rhetoric towards Iran has been very threatening. And the things listed above are things I consider harsh, but maybe you don’t.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the crux of my argument here is that Trump is not a Russian agent controlled by Putin. Just because he hasn’t blown Iran into pieces yet or hasn’t overthrown a leader or hasn’t invaded Iran yet or whatever you consider to be “harsh”, doesn’t mean that he is completely in bed with Iran so therefore he must be a Russian agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       It almost seems like you want Trump to launch a nuke at Iran just so we can finally put the question of him being a Russian agent to rest

       Even now, Trump is backpedaling from his position so far that Russia had no effect on the election, to a new position which is that he never denied it but only said he didn't collude with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would he backpedal like this, if the writing wasn't on the wall that there indeed was interference?
      </p>
      <p>
       Given this tacit admission, I can imagine exactly three reasons why he hasn't publicly condemned Russia for the meddling:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         He's in Russia's pocket and is running interference
         <em>
          for
         </em>
         their interference.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He knows Russia interfered, but doesn't want to give an inch to this fact in public because this would dent the legitimacy of his election and mandate.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He made so much "Russia is our friend!" talk during the campaign that he doesn't want to flip flop by imposing sanctions or being tough on them.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He doesn't want to condemn Russia until all the facts are in and he's 100% sure they interfered.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       1 and 2 would both explain his actions over the past year. 3 is a tough sell because Trump flip flops pretty readily, I don't think 3 would explain his behaviour unless it was mixed with a little bit of 1 or 2. 4 is obviously not the case, it doesn't fit Trump's spontaneous, fast-and-loose-with-facts personality.

       Taking your point on its own, you have to consider the spin as what prompts his anger. He DID say a long time ago that "meddling" could have been a 300lb guy in a basement. He said it could have been a combination of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media is saying he absolutely denies Russian Interference, and the Americans watching that see it as an obvious sign of guilt. That is intentional. He denied being a part of it and was on  the record a year ago saying we need to find out WHO did it.
      </p>

       Do you kind of get what I mean? There's no way to deny CNN-Trump hate each other. They want the misinterpretation

       These very same people, were saying that Trump was mental because he was going to start WWIII with NK because of a tweet. Now, they are saying we should start WWIII with mother fuckin' Russia, because of FB and twitter "ads".

       Hypocrites. It is absolutely ridiculous that they believe we should be so easily angered and outraged based on flimsy evidence and ludicrous charges to begin with.

       Meanwhile DNC has same issues it had for the past 5 years.  They will continue to lose by ignoring their own problems and boring agenda.  Stay focused on Trump though.  We like winning.
