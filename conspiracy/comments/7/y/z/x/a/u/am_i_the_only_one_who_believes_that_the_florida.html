Along with Vegas being a false flag, no video recording of him, and he got all of those weapons up there without being noticed? It seems like a lot of people on this sub are grasping for straws regarding Florida but, when you shoot the theory that it was a mentally disturbed individual, this sub makes it seem like you are now believing everything the media tells you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Them as well.  But Hypernormalisation talks specifically about Putin&#39;s strategy and his rise to power using that strategy to maintain power.  And it&#39;s interesting that we can see him almost openly doing it in the US.  The difference with Putin that is covered in Hypernormalisation is that Putin doesn&#39;t hide it.  Which makes people question everything even more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given a choice I would not allow my kid to go through a &quot;shooting drill&quot;. I&#39;ve never heard of such a thing. Seriously, I&#39;m 36 years old, I&#39;ve heard of a lot of school shootings over the years unfortunately, but never a drill for one. How in the fuck does that become something that is good for those kids. subjected to fear and paranoia and violence. Just to clarify also, no matter if this is the biggest batshit conspiracy since bigfoot fkd the mothman, at the end of the day our superiors, the police, the government, the school system think it is a good thing to expose young developing minds to the fear of a school shooting via a shooting drill.. I&#39;m just sayin i&#39;ts an exercise in futility, are you trying to make people behave more efficiently in a mass shooting environment?? seriously.. even if you were trying to get data, or evacuation times, or emergency response times, these things can be obtained in other ways than exposing kids to some looming threat of possible violence.. I just dont fkng understand I guess.. and the fact that the drill was supposedly going to occur the day of the shooting? but the shooting occurred instead? Can someone please interject </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s the other way around.  I think the NRA and the arms manufacturing lobby has bought out republican politicians and use them to obstruct any meaningful reform on gun laws.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m all for the second amendment and the right to defend yourself from tyranny, but the US needs a much better process for gun ownership.  </p>

<p>Canada also has a very high rate of gun ownership per capita, and I know a lot of people with guns, but they all had to take a course beforehand, fill out a good deal of paperwork, and then buy a gun afterwards.  You can also get automatic weapons here, but you have to take more courses and do more paperwork.  I&#39;ve heard the mental screening for automatic weapons is very rigorous, as it should be.  </p>

<p>Canada has a similar rate of mental illness, we have a lot of guns, but our mass shooting rate is <em>way</em> lower than the US because we have stricter gun ownership laws.  The only reason why your country doesn&#39;t have a more reasonable stance on gun ownership is because the gun lobby doesn&#39;t want any regulation interfering with their bottom line, even if it means psychos get easy access to automatic weapons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is the USA oligarchy does not want to make any type of commitment to helping out mentally ill people. Mentally ill people are their false flag ammo, their hobo sent in to stab a target in an alley, their discardable humans to use as they see fit. Not only that, but people are losing their second amendment rights for smoking pot legally! So having some kind of clause about mental health to be interpreted by a government that wants to disarm us is a scary fucking thing because it can and will be abused.</p>

<p>Mental health is a very, very very fine line to walk on because it is.... wait for it.... SUBJECTIVE.... and based on opinions of people who believe they know more about you than yourself because they read some books on how people behave. Once it gets rolling it becomes a nightmare of censorship, throwing people into hospitals and violating their rights as a human being to being able to say what goes in and out of their body. Shit like the baker act and involuntary hospitalization is criminal in my eyes and only necessary when there is a literal danger to society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s a bit more than that though. Any ground lost is ground ceded. Forever. And while I&#39;m sure there is quite a bit of money at play here, I think this is also a consideration of the NRA. I don&#39;t know the details very well of how this kid in Florida was able to get the guns, so maybe better gun laws will help. But I&#39;m pretty sure in the Vegas incident those guns were purchased legally and even tougher background checks wouldn&#39;t have made a difference. The mental health angle is something we should be looking at. If the mother of the sick fuck who shot up Sandy Hook would have had to at the very least had her shit locked up, that nightmare may have been avoided. I&#39;m not saying that we shouldn&#39;t have better gun laws. Not at all. I just don&#39;t believe that there is an easy fix for this type of shit. I truly believe we should be looking at the many variables that played a role in this and other mass shootings here. Because again, it can&#39;t be just one thing that went wrong. Life&#39;s entirely too complicated and shit like this even more so.</p>

<p>Not saying I believe it. I would think, if TPTB had anything to do with it occurring, they just didn’t do anything to prevent it. Look at how many people are saying they alerted [XYZ Authority] about this kid and he STILL legally bought the weapons and did this. </p>

<p>BUT, if you want to bring up regulations as is all the rage in msm now, what do you do? Get the guy to legally buy the guns. Now we have a real demon to tackle, no?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So 17 children just got fabricated into existence for the sake of the shooting?</p>

<p>Well now you have to make birth records, SS numbers. ALSO, you still need a coroner since someone has to sign a death certificate, which requires them to see a body and provide cause. You also now need to convince an entire schools worth of children to be complicit to your conspiracy, since they would sure as hell realise if absolutely no one knew these 17 children that were killed. And teachers, and the entire administrative board would need to be silenced aswell. </p>

<p>Your alternative method would actually result in a larger amount of people needing to be in on it then before. 1 &quot;non existent body&quot; is a pretty tough trick to pull. 17 is impossible in my opinion.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to talk about regulations, I&#39;ve already put the idea of convincing Americans to restrict killing tools to reasonable levels to bed. They just don&#39;t want to in most cases, and the ones who do are almost always called out ad hominem for it. No problem for me, not my countries kids who keep getting murdered.</p>

If 3000 birth records were missing from people who died at 9/11 then there would be articles, blogs, someone writing about it and documenting that oddity sometime in the past 20 years.

Vegas was a mix of tricking crisis actors into being in a live false flag in my opnion. People died, but they had layers of deception to fool everybody and throw off the conspiracy community. </p>

<p>I believe they are going to go with this type of blueprint from now on. As it seems this Parkland shooting has both signs of being real and signs of fakery as well. Drill on same day? FBI warned about this person multiple times but no action? But real kids died as well? See the coincidences there? Truth mixed with lies works the best at fooling people.</p>

I am very sure my friends who were there were not crisis actors</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But how much can you &quot;mold&quot; a story around a school shooting. What are you changing? Unless you mean the witnesses are being coached or such like?</p>

<p>Although I do agree the news  definitely plays a role in dividing people, I don&#39;t know where I would strictly put the blame. Its a chicken and egg scenario since we all know divisive news sells well, and that encourages papers to write divisive news, or move towards more radical positions. Because it gets viewers.</p>

<p>Although along with that when many news outlets take their hints from places such as twitter, you can certainly make a case that one of the key affects of shills in places like twitter is that it presents a false image to news outlets that there is a higher demand for divisive / extreme news then their actually is.</p>

<p>I appreciate the analogy, and I do agree that what you&#39;re say is plausible. I just don&#39;t consider it that conspiratorial, and more a modern problem in journalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, in the example of a school shooting you have two ongoing dialogue about violence, control restriction and this dialogue angers people to the point they don’t want to discuss the issue with each other. So if your goal is to fragment the population then you want to focus on the mental health or the gun control but only focus on the conflicts and never on actual solutions. That way the whole incident becomes a polarized “meme” In which any meaningful change is sideline.</p>

<p>For example no meaningful change will come out of this last shooting. Except for people hating each other that much more because of their political views on guns or violence or the president. So if your goal is to fracture the group mind into tiny hateful pieces then the school shooting is the perfect frame for those agendas.

<p>Someone advising Nancy Grace telling her OK Nancy, next time we have a school shooting we’ve got to get these people really whipped up into a frenzy. Now that’s emotional manipulation. And it would be based on a true fact but it’s nothing to resemble journalism.</p>

<p>So rather than just a school shooting it becomes a propagandized take on a school shooting. And then that feels insincere and cast doubt on the integrity of the process</p>

<p>Now somebody who is distrustful of their honesty is going to be watching the news closely for facts. But instead of facts they get opinion bending facts. On the ‘news’.</p>

<p>I can see how this could encourage somebody with conspiratorial thoughts to believe that they are only seeing fake news or manufactured events. When an event like this happens and opinion pieces are released immediately it is obvious that they are ready already waiting for the names and dates and numbers of deaths to be filled in.</p>

<p>It is a form of manipulation of information and if you didn’t trust the system might make you see everything as a manufactured event. But it’s really just propaganda and spin if that makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got the idea behind it what I&#39;m getting at is the logistics of pulling it off. Who paid is the easier piece of the puzzle. Who gets paid is the real question to answer because there&#39;s a lot of people that would need to get paid and not leak later. Idk how that could even be accomplished. Shooter, witnesses, investigators, parents. You&#39;d have to keep the real emts out of the school. You&#39;d have to have someone lie about where the bodies were taken. Crisis actor kids pretending to have witnessed murder, etc</p>

<p>And then you either have to have fake teachers/coaches no one has heard of at the school or have the real teachers disappear forever. I mean it&#39;s silly</p>

<p>You and I both know releasing the security footage would do nothing to help the investigation, and would do nothing to quell the minds of people who think it&#39;s a false flag or whatever.

    <div class="md"><p>This is also a likely explanation for Jesus Campos&#39;s &quot;disappearance&quot; and controlled appearance on Ellen afterward. They&#39;re a multi-billion dollar company operating in a corrupt industry in a corrupt city, and they&#39;re facing hundreds or thousands of lawsuits including dozens for wrongful death. They have both the power and the incentive to make a witness disappear and only reappear with handlers, but it doesn&#39;t mean the shooting didn&#39;t happen the way police say it did. It just means they&#39;re afraid the guy will say something that will open them up to even more liability.</p>

<p>With that said, I still have several reasons to be skeptical about the Vegas shooting. The discrepancies between in the LVPD&#39;s various accounts of the timeline, Paddock&#39;s background and income sources, the disappearing hard drive re-appearing with child porn, his house being burglarized while under FBI surveillance, etc.</p>

There are rules in place to make sure people and their room numbers aren&#39;t linked by other guests unless the guests themselves disclose that information. We can&#39;t even tell you if your brother Steve Unique is in house, let alone if he&#39;s due in or checked out. Even if you have a valid ID with Bob Unique on it, you aren&#39;t getting any info about Steve Unique from a trained employee.</p>

<p>That being said, this could be the exact reason the footage isn&#39;t being leaked. It might not just be him on the film (likely isn&#39;t just him). There are probably parts they could show without revealing other folks but I imagine the footage of the hallway, like... idk, Right after the shit hit the fan?/s That footage might be worth having a look at.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s say I&#39;m part of MGM ownership/upper management. </p>

<p>The choices in my court: 
1) Not publicly release any images of the perpetrator of the deadliest mass shooting in US history on my MGM-owned property, 
or 
2) release images to be plastered all over the news, where viewers directly associate images of gunman/shooting to Mandalay Bay/MGM.</p>

<p>From a simple business and PR perspective - I&#39;m going to pick the option that mitigates public association and impressions of my brand and property with the shooting. You&#39;re inviting nothing but risk to your business by doing so. Imagine tourists reenacting photos in the exact places Paddock was depicted and sharing via social media - it&#39;s a PR nightmare. That&#39;s not even taking into account any liability risks associated with images as well. </p>

<p>The investigative authorities already have the security footage, why damage my brand further by releasing it publically? Who would want to have their casino/hotel - a place people go to for leisure, entertainment, and fun- be further marred with images directly linking it to a deadly massacre?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One time, when I was a kid, I heard a crash in the front part of my house and heard someone shout. I thought someone was breaking into the house and ran out the back door. Turns out a tree fell on our house. I didn&#39;t maintain that someone broke in when I found that out. </p>

<p>The media gathers facts from both witness accounts and the police investigation. Witnesses don&#39;t always know what&#39;s exactly going on. They might see a guy with a gun at street level and think there&#39;s a second shooter, but it&#39;s a cop. The cop doesn&#39;t become a second shooter because of a mistaken account. In fact, the cops didn&#39;t even know if there were other shooters until the situation began to calm down. Witness accounts can be very unreliable, especially in situations that most of them haven&#39;t been in before. It&#39;s easy to think you&#39;d be in that scenario and be able to judge everything that&#39;s going on accurately. </p>

<p>Also, this took place in the middle of the strip. There&#39;s a bump stock+the sound echoing off of other buildings. Despite there being thousands of people in the area, many of whom were recording videos and taking pictures, no one recorded any other gunmen. </p>

Let’s raise that to 9 for Paddock’s ARs, cause they had longer barrels and those bump stocks are heavier than Magpul MOEs. So, figure 9 lbs per Paddock rifle. 3 of them in one suitcase and he’s not even clearing 30 lbs. Two smallish suitcases on a luggage dolly, and wham bam thank ya m’am, he has six AR-15’s in his room. Two trips and he has 12. Four trips over the course of 3 hours, which f-king <em>no one</em> would notice, especially in the damn service elevator, and there ya go.</p>

<p>4chan attempted to curb this by spreading a fake story about him being tied to a specific white nationalist group and therefore undermining the credibility of &quot;fake news&quot;. This backfired when the outlets who reported it did the fact-checking that all real news sites do and then issued the retraction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said he was after Jews, but that first article literally says he hated and wanted to kill everything from latinos to small animals. He wasn&#39;t just after a specific race or religion. You can certainly infer that he was racist from comments , but it&#39;s also clear he hated everyone and everything. He had mental health issues, clearly. My problem with your approach is that you are not acknowledging his mental health, but choosing to solely focus on his extremist comments leading up to the event. If he was not mentally ill, this likely would have never happened. For example the people in his group said they were racist too, but they also said they would never take it as far as killing others. His mental health allowed him to take it over the edge, not his hatred for everyone and everything. </p>

<p>On the other hand we have one of the largest hate sites in the world, if not the largest, 4chan. When I first browsed the site it was fairly new and the vitriol seemed to be ironic. Many years later it&#39;s now a primary hub for white nationalism and acts of violence are celebrated. The Day of the Rope is the stated endgame and those who murder liberals and ethnics are hailed as heroes.</p>

<p>Are we to believe that the rise of racial extremism has nothing to do with violence against targets these types of people claim to want dead? White supremacists are now the deadliest extremist faction in the nation. They are far more of a threat than ISIS but those same people who claim to want to keep us safe with Muslim travel bans refuse to even look at the elephant in the room. Instead they throw up boogeymen like &quot;mental illness&quot; despite evidence to the contrary glaring them in the face.</p>

<p>step2thejep thinks no one died in 9/11, or sandyhook or any mass shooting... actually he does not believe that anyone died in Syria or any war in general... actually he does not believe neither dinosaurs nor ancient greeks nor Tesla existed... or that space, the moon, the sun, a round earth, atoms, gravity, relativity, missiles, or evolution exist...</p>

<p>He has a website, the he used to try to shill on reddit that charges $20/mo, that he now has stopped because he was banned from some subreddits and warned to stop on others... but anyways he calls himself &quot;the world&#39;s leading skeptic&quot;...</p>

<p>Which roughly translates to if he cannot see it, its not real... or whatever other impossible standard of proof he sets under a misunderstanding of basic science or research...</p>

<p>Which leads us the point the he is the best example of a the Dunning Krueger effect that I have ever run across. </p>

<p>But anyways he now comes here to ask for evidence like a 3 yearold playing the &quot;why&quot; game so I would save your efforts.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s known that orchestrated mass shootings and false flags are often precipitated by &quot;terror drills&quot; done in the area days or weeks before an event.</p>

<p>Secret service were at the school giving training about a possible active shooter situation a couple weeks prior to the shooting.</p>

<p>On the day of the shooting, teachers were told there would be a “code red” or “lockdown” drill in the near future but had not been told the date.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s not at least a little suspicious, I don&#39;t know what would be. </p>

<p>My feeling is that they are using &quot;targeted individuals&quot; as shooters. </p>

<p>Well some sick minds, bearing a lot of anger and violent fantasies in them would perhaps take this idea to an real event.
Not unlikely that the shooter heard of those things and then deceided to do it in reality.</p>

<p>The USS Maine did blow up.</p>

<p>The Reichstag did burn down.</p>

<p>The Gleiwitz incident did actually occur.</p>

<p>There really were actual terrorist attacks in Iran that helped install the Shah.</p>

<p>The thing about a false flag is not that the event did not happen, it&#39;s that who were told was behind the event was not the ones who actually did it, but the ones telling us it was <em>those</em> guys.</p>

<p>A Mentally disturbed kid did acquire weapons and went out and killed 17 people. That happened.</p>

<p>Did certain parties nudge it along, or (purposely) allow it to happen? That is what determines if this is a false flag or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A naval board of inquiry concluded that the blast was caused by a mine placed outside the ship.    Lots of people go with this.    Even on this,  some claim it was an act of self sabotage in order to justify war with Spain,  while others say it was actually done by the Spanish.</p>

<p>There have been a lot of books based on researching the incident with various conclusions,   including the one you mentioned,   but no &quot;agreed&quot; to settled explanation,   except perhaps in HS textbooks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my overly cynical view of this sub. <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> is part of Reddit and, as part of that system, people have an implicit desire to seek rewards that the system has to offer. Each sub is a marketplace of ideas and, as conspiracies go, there is a certain limitation in terms of good content because, well, there are only so many conspiracies and it&#39;s not like someone can provide &quot;original content&quot; for conspiracies in the same way that someone can create original content in other subs. Sure, you can have new videos or theories <em>about</em> conspiracies, but it&#39;s considerably more difficult finding <em>new</em> conspiracies and related content than in other subs. So, that creates a rush to be the first to post about anything that <em>could</em> be a conspiracy to reap the sweet internet validation--it creates a culture of looking for conspiracies in every conceivable place in order to fit into the crowd, to benefit from the niche. And that&#39;s not saying that what people find or post are wrong (however you define that), but <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> definitely breeds a culture of looking for conspiracies wherever someone can find them. The Florida shooting is just one instance--stick around the sub and literally any time there is an act of mass violence in the U.S., someone will inevitably try to connect the conspiratorial dots and how it&#39;s somehow a false flag...because <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a niche and people want content in that niche, so there&#39;s a feedback loop in creating content for that niche. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if that makes a lick of sense, but that&#39;s where my heads been at since this whole mess happened recently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was 95% certain that this was an unorchestrated event. Then, out of nowhere, the improbable started stacking up.</p>

<p>In a staged event:
1. It is typical for central figures to have a criminal history that can be used to control their actions. Does David have a criminal record? Was the shooter on the FBI&#39;s radar?
2. It is typical for there to be drills before the event. Were their drills for this event?
3. It is typical for central figures to have a connection to the FBI. There are only 35k FBI in the US, out of 320 million people. That&#39;s one in a thousand. Does David have any family in the FBI?
4. It is typical for CNN to focus on a few witnesses, out of hundreds? Did that happen? Have we seen the same people over and over?
5. It is typical for central figures to ignore the pharma connections and focus on gun control. Did that happen? In a country where a majority of people are pro-gun, did anyone who was interviewed say, &quot;We wish we had armed security or armed teachers to deal with this menace&quot;?
6. References to Sandy Hook and Columbine are a MUST. Did that happen?
7. It is typical that no one cries or loses their shit (anger). In my High School, a person died in a drunk driving accident, and a quarter of the students were either apoplectic or bawling. Do these kids seem like they went through a school shooting?</p>

<p>I think it is correct to question this event, now.﻿</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on. Why were they having a drill and they were told cops would be firing blanks? Or people would be taken out of stretchers--but still, it&#39;s just a drill? There&#39;s something a little off about this. It almost seems like they ignored the Cruz kid on purpose, though, doesn&#39;t it? I&#39;m waiting for more proof of what happened to make up my mind. I just don&#39;t know. I think there&#39;s something hinky going on here. But it could just be that a mentally ill kid was ignored to give someone the talking points they desired. I mean, a kid hearing voices--think how easy it would be to manipulate that kid. One of the other kids interviewed even mentioned he would do whatever someone asked of him--either part of his mental illness or he was so desperate for a friend. </p>

<p>My real, real hunch here is that some fake broadcasts are being put up as well. That would be a play. All this shit flies onto the internet unverified through social media, news outlets pick it up in their frenzy for ratings and those pictures become canonized into the event. Wouldn&#39;t take much for a bad actor to start the narratives about crisis actors or fake a CNN broadcast. These events are a known vulnerability in our culture, we become extremely easy to manipulate while we process our grief and disbelief.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I&#39;d be doing if it was my job to fuck up a country. Worth thinking about at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well look it does not help that the four spokes children made to be the leaders of this attempt at taking away other American&#39;s civil liberties are  one white male/female, a black girl and androgynous queer multi racial zhe. Dressed in hip teen fashions and a make up job that makes them look about ready to do a photoshoot.</p>

<p>They have made these four look so perfect for a ready made production they have triggered the uncanny valley effect in millions of people. That in turn is driving people to start making up conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>For the record I do not believe its a false flag, hoax, or any other term as you said in your text. However you would be disingenuous to tell me this is not a production run by Gun Control groups and the News Media enablers at this point going forward.  Brian Williams interviewed one young person who did not support taking people&#39;s firearms and that only happened because MSNBC was desperate for someone to go on the air and he surprised him. </p>

<p>Want to bet how often you will be seeing children who do not support gun control now compared to the ones being pushed into the front of the media storm that support gun control? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that there is an organized machinery that moves in RIGHT AFTER a crisis, and either invents stories from scratch or coaches people there. So you have a real crisis, but at the same time you have these idiots who are so fake and obvious, that people start wondering, wait a second.... what&#39;s going on here, and the low hanging fruit is that it&#39;s a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Now, This might have been real, but you can&#39;t look at Sandy Hook videos and think those people were NOT actors. </p>

<p>So either way, we&#39;re left with the REAL conspiracy which is, who is organizing these massive events RIGHT AFTER a crisis like this happens. Obviously people like GEORGE SOROS and his SON.</p>

<p>If the kid had mental health problems, then perhaps we need to look into the cause of that and how we can identify the signs of a troubled teen earlier. Or maybe we should concentrate on security measures at schools or public buildings.  I don&#39;t think that these logical, and possible solutions to preventing tragedies like Florida from happening again will be the flagship, Mainstream, consensual result. I personally think citizen gun ownership will take the hit, and as an American who&#39;s rights are in a constant state of limbo and erosion I would like to see a more intelligent and thoughtful proposition... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you look at all the evidence compiled against the official narrative, it makes sense to believe something different happened. Multiple kids saying the administration told them there would be blanks used. Multiple people reporting more than one gunman. Not to even mention the kids they use for these interviews are actors. Its all a show, the media is allowed to use weaponized propaganda against the citizens. Thats legal now (Thanks obama).</p>

<p>Youre not the only one who believes that, but you are limiting yourself because you stopped asking relevant questions, like why are multiple kids saying school admin told them there would be blanks used? Why is the David Hogg kid interviewing a girl in the MIDDLE of the shooting? wtf? Why is David Hogg rehearsing lines for the news and being fed lines by the guy off camera? I could go on and on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracies are like religions - people have to have faith in something.  To some it is a great and all powerful government without incompetence.</p>

<p>The idea that some random people can take a jet and nock down tall buildings. . is too scary to be believed</p>

<p>the idea that some kid, mad that his mom spent to much time at a school, shot up a bunch of 5-6 year olds is too horrible to believe</p>

<p>this goes on and on and on</p>

<p>For some its easier to have faith in a great and controlling comfort of a government where nothing bad happens, unless the government says so</p>

<p>that is a odd form of comfort. . .and not entirely rationale in my book</p>

<p>This kid, like the others, is a bit deranged but probably sane.  he had access to a lot of weapons.  He bought ammo without anyone noticing. A Uber driver $#@$ dropped him off at the school with his bags of guns.</p>

<p>It is scary to some that can happen</p>

<p>better to blame the govt.</p>

But, if you aren&#39;t willing to concede to that, I might as well put the Overton window between this and false flag, because that&#39;s what I&#39;ve seen other do, in the opposite direction.  </p>

<p>So, it&#39;s somewhere between a mental health issue, or, we&#39;ll start looking for the connection between those murders, and the other from the Clintons.  </p>

Let’s raise that to 9 for Paddock’s ARs, cause they had longer barrels and those bump stocks are heavier than Magpul MOEs. So, figure 9 lbs per Paddock rifle. 3 of them in one suitcase and he’s not even clearing 30 lbs. Two smallish suitcases on a luggage dolly, and wham bam thank ya m’am, he has six AR-15’s in his room. Two trips and he has 12. Four trips over the course of 3 hours, which f-king <em>no one</em> would notice, especially in the damn service elevator, and there ya go.</p>
