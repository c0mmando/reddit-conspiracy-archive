       I don't hate the Jews.  I want them to get saved.  They will be saved by the grace of God in the future when he puts them through wrath.  They are still his chosen people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rom 11:25  For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in. 
Rom 11:26  And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: 
Rom 11:27  For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins. 
Rom 11:28  As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Them currently working with the spirit of Antichrist is just a Biblical fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Jn_2:22  Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Jn_4:3  And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.

       I didn't ask for your beliefs. It's honestly still the dark times for some people. Thinking others need to be saved and their religion is "correct". Maybe you are the one going to hell for not being music or Jewish or believing in some other god

       1Co_1:18  For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.

       You are a sinner as we all are.

       Repent and believe this to be saved:

       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise this is your future:
      </p>
      <p>
       Rev 20:11  And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. 
Rev 20:12  And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. 
Rev 20:13  And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. 
Rev 20:14  And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. 
Rev 20:15  And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

       You cannot comprehend these spiritual things until you get saved.  Focus on the fact you are a sinner with an eternal soul headed to a lake of fire unless you get your debt paid.  You need a savior and God came as Jesus Christ and died for you personally to pay that debt.  All you need to do to receive the blood atonement is repent of your current state and believe that.

       Please explain to me what verses in the King James Bible would lead you to believe it is the "government version of events."
      </p>
      <p>
       The most common argument I hear is that King James used to make people want to obey Kngs because he was a King.  Yet the Bible teaches that God didn't want us to have any King but himself and he told Israel if he gave them a King he would, use them, abuse them, steal from them, and put them in bondage.  Yet they persisted so God gave them what they wanted.  Sometimes you got to let your kids touch the hot stove to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Sa 8:4  Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah, 
1Sa 8:5  And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. 
1Sa 8:6  But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD. 
1Sa 8:7  And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them. 
1Sa 8:8  According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. 
1Sa 8:9  Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Sa 8:10  And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king. 
1Sa 8:11  And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots. 
1Sa 8:12  And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots. 
1Sa 8:13  And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. 
1Sa 8:14  And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. 
1Sa 8:15  And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. 
1Sa 8:16  And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. 
1Sa 8:17  He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants. 
1Sa 8:18  And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Sa 8:19  Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us; 
1Sa 8:20  That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles. 
1Sa 8:21  And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD. 
1Sa 8:22  And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.

       It was comissioned by a king. Basically government. And whenever they remake something it's never the same as the original, like the new Jumanji film.

       You can quote a 1500 year old book as much as you want. It isn't the word of God, it's the word of man.

       So you just used the exact argument that I refuted by showing you how the King James Bible teaches that having any King other than God is a terrible idea and goes on to explain what will happen under a King which is exactly what happened under Kings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand where you are coming from because I was just like you not even a year ago.  We have been so programmed to reject out of hand what is inside the King James Bible that we do so with little investigation and believe whatever has been placed in front of us to support that rejection.

       All the best finding the truth.

       You can't quote your religious book and claim it to be the truth. Maybe if rapture happens some day. If Christ rises once again. In the meantime don't claim to call it the truth.

       Jesus Christ is already risen.  The catching away (rapture) will happen but if you are denying the truth now you will likely believe whatever lie they tell you.  Perhaps it will be an alien abduction.  Perhaps some new age lie about vibrating at a higher level.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you see Jesus Christ again (if your flesh lives until then) it will be much too late.  He will be drenched in blood and coming in the purity of his perfect wrath.  He will mock you when you try to call to him:
      </p>
      <p>
       Pro 1:26  I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;
 
Pro 1:27  When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.
 
Pro 1:28  Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
 
Pro 1:29  For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:

       Hard to say if it was real or LARP but someone on /pol/ claimed to be one. Abridged version, paid cash, told they were to be victim in staged attack, don't break character, signed non disclosure agreements.  If I can find the post I will link it. I feel it was a LARP though.
