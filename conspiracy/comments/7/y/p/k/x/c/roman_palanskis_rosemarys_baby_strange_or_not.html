       osemary's baby by Roman Palanski is something to do with sacrificing a guy who sacrifices his baby to the devil for fame, I think. 
In real life a year after the film, Roman palanski  pregnant girlfriend with his child got murdered by Charles Mason. Charles mansion said he heard messages from Beatles telling him about helter skelter and to do the murders. Roman palanski was good friends with the Beatles.  Where was palanski that night of the murders and why does this happen after Bringing out a film of a similar story line? This film is what made palanski. Have I got this all wrong, because there's not much info on this?

       It's certainly a very dark and confusing point in American culture/history. The baby doesn't get sacrificed in the film or book, though - technically, the mother is offered by her husband to serve as the vessel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Polanski was in in London at the time of the murder, if I'm not mistaken. He was investigated pretty thoroughly immediately following the crimes because he seemed a very likely suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Manson wasn't "told" by "Helter Skelter" to do the murders - "Helter Skelter" represented, to Manson, a sort of story of racial disharmony and violence. He believed that, by murdering Tate and the other victims and penning it on black people, he'd help to usher in a civil war of sorts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very good questions though! And again, one of the most fascinating and dark periods of American history.

       I haven't seen the film in a good year, but have seen it a couple of times. My interpretation was that she was gave birth to the son or spawn of Satan. The husband was alive through the end of the movie, and I am sure if the husband was after fame or notoriety.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I love thinking about this stuff, and will rewatch it in the near future to see if I see any of that.

       ...sort of. From what I remember, the husband is an actor who's trying to get a break out big role in some Broadway play. They move into this creepy New York apartment building where they meet these kind of kooky/crazy next-door neighbors who turn out to be satanists. They convince the husband to let them have Satan impregnate his wife in order to birth the antichrist. In exchange, the husband gets the role in the play. The wife ends up birthing the baby and, instead of killing it, she lets it live and chooses to mother it.

       And he becomes famous after this play? I'm going to have to give this film a watch. I thought it was about a baby sitter who tries to still a kid she is looking after...

       Well, the book/film never really goes into that. We can assume that he does, since the actor that was originally up for the part is stricken blind. That's all part of the story, but the crux is really about Rosemary and the child/antichrist. You should definitely watch the film - and read the book if you can. It's much more detailed/developed.

       That's true - "Rosemary's Baby", the book, which predated the film and certainly the Tate/LaBianca murders, was published in March of '67.

       Yes, I've read the book - it's definitely on par with the film.

       I'm pretty sure Polanski is hiding out, trying to avoid extradition. I believe he is still wanted for rape charges in the US.

       Satanism came from the bible. Before that, evil and wickedness was the opposite of good, Ying and yang. Now, satanism is apparently just doing as you please without hurting anyone, and what Christians and religion believe.

       I don't really know TOO much about satanism.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what I've realized is that our idea of pedophiles as creepy guys by the playground, or pastors in the church, or boyscout leaders is incorrect. They're not weirdos that are 'attracted' to children....they're psychopaths that get off on the domination and destruction of something innocent. Killing a puppy would give them the same 'thrill' they get when they horrifically abuse children.
      </p>
      <p>
       This classification, as pedophiles as more as pedo-sadists, is what made me reconsider all the satanist stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we know it now, at least 20% of fourtune 500 CEOs are psychopathic.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are people that don't feel 'emotion' in the same way most humans do. They feel nothing. The sense of 'power' is the closest thing to an emotion that they have. With that in mind, are their 'desires' simply sated by 'winning' in their industry? We're all human, we all have sexual urges....I find it hard to believe they can just sublimate their innate urges into normal sex. I think it makes sense that they'd be attracted to this destruction of small children.

       We're not talking about random creeps, we're talking about Patrick Bateman's that run our society.

       That this is something that pre-dates our modern era. That 'pedogate' as it were has been around for much longer than us and our parents have been around.

       I know that sounds crazy, but I'm working on a full-write up, with sources. It'll probably just be best if I link you when I'm done.

       Yeah I would like to see your work on paedo gate.  I too believe Paedophilia has been around for along time. Like what's in pizzagate/paedogate James Alephantis's instagram profile picture of the Greek paedo statue, it was a legal thing in ancient Greece. I'm not sure if all paedophiles get off on power and pain, I thought they mainly just had an attraction towards children. I know some people are sick and twisted, and get off on sadism (is that the right word?) (Pain and torture). I think i can see where you are going with this. The belief of satanism and sacrificing children to the devil, which you believe has gone on for longer than we know? Have you seen the film Rosemary's baby?

       What if they're watching videos of babies getting raped to death? Do you still believe they're 'innocent, non-offenders'?

       There's definitely people who have been molested, who have had their sexual template 'structured' by their early abuse. There's a secondary group of sadists that aren't 'pedophiles' in our current way of thinking about it. The venn-diagram overlap is in the pornography both groups consume.

       I think this is one of the more typical profiles for pedo-sadists.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm sorry, I didn't really specify where 'Satanism' comes into this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satanism, as a philosophy, encourages the individual to 'be their own god'. To essentially BE Nietzsche's 'Ubermensch'. Disregard societies morals and be your own god. There's good and bad implications for that line of thought....I can imagine psychopaths adopting that ideology as their preferred justification for their crimes.

       Lacan has more to say about 'perverse' vs. 'neurotic' psychic structures that makes sense of this type of behavior:

       I watched the video you sent me. He is no-one now he has been caught. Acting like he is big and powerful towards children online, but a total coward with the police. If I was having them kind of thoughts, I would do anything I could to stop them. I have no idea why people have these fantasies of children. Why does it even have to be a thing in life, why does it exist? There seems to be a lot of them that don't care about acting on these thoughts, obviously they don't think these thoughts are bad and will make any excuse to justify them. Not sure if it's worth mentioning, but I am female, I wish people with sexual thoughts against children would know they are wrong to and do anything to not act on these thoughts or make them a reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get what you are saying about pain and that now. If I was to see a child being sexual abused, I would find it horrific, and those parts of my brain dealing with seeing something horrific light up. With a paedophile, their brains light up to something good when seeing child porn and maybe some types of sadism?

       So I watched the film. The main devil worshipper in the film was called Roman. The husband of Rosemary let the devil rape her (after drugging her) and pregnate her with his spawn, in order for her husband to have success in his acting career. In the end, like previously said, she accepted the baby as her own.

       I thought the film was going to be a basic horror type film, where there is blood and people acting possessed, but it was more than that. 
It shows more of the occult side, with rituals and people around her all being in on it, people you wouldn't expect. Them killing off people that tried to out them.

       What surprised me the most about the film has nothing to do with any theories, and I'm not sure if it was supposed to shock or was just accepted for its time. When Rosemary was raped by the devil, the following morning after she told her husband that she felt like she'd  been raped by something demonic, Her husband told her that it was just himself having sex with her after she passed out asleep, she was just expected to accept this seen as it is her husband and not a stranger. I believe she did accept it, she showed that she didn't like it, but it wasn't majorly frowned upon or made into a bigger deal like it should of been.

       Well, the book/film never really goes into that. We can assume that he does, since the actor that was originally up for the part is stricken blind. That's all part of the story, but the crux is really about Rosemary and the child/antichrist. You should definitely watch the film - and read the book if you can. It's much more detailed/developed.
