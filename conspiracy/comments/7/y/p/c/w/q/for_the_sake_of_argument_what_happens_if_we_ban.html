    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to see a case where there is a &quot;mass stabbing&quot; that kills and injures to the same degree as say for example,  the most recent Las Vegas shootings. Stabbings are a one on one, or even one on five (maybe?) scenarios. Stabbing are up, and the I&#39;d wager the numbers, even in all of freaking Europe still don&#39;t match the shooting deaths in a year. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure,  crazy gonna crazy.  I absolutely agree.  If someone is set on getting a gun to commit atrocities, it&#39;s going to happen.  But if there are 10 people intent on mayhem and 1000 guns accessible to them, it&#39;s going to be fairly simple. If there are those 10 people but only 1 gun, it&#39;s going to be far more challenging to get it. </p>

<p>If you can show me a case study where a country had equally easy access to guns but doesn&#39;t have the same gun crime, I&#39;m happy to read it! So far though, the vast weight of statistics point towards higher standards of access equals lower gun crime. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree completely. But at the same time, if just 1 bad person has the gun, whether they took a very long time to get it or got it very easily, goes up against innocent people that are also armed, the result will be drastically different than if those innocent people had no means to defend themselves. Unarmed citizens = fish in a barrel. Armed citizens = a very tough fight for the bad guy. Especially if he&#39;s outnumbered. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>“A gun is a tool it’s the person behind it”...common statement. Why then have we banned automatic rifles?? (Granted they aren’t banned but it’s a process of proving the historical importance generally to truly own one). You’re so concerned about your 2nd amendment, why then are you okay with you not having a browning .50 cal? Why aren’t you pissed the government took away your right to an M1 abrams? That’s an arm isn’t it? You’re only pissed liberals want to take way your precious AR-15 (or separate manufacturer variant, I know you gun nuts get triggered when people call the exact same gun from separate manufavtureres the same thing) because the NRA has brainwashed you. Want to know the real conspiracy in all this? It’s the GOP and the NRA’s money bud</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just one event in 2014. Between 2010 and 2012 and additional  25 killed and 115 injured in similar knife/hammer/cleaver attacks in China.</p>

<p>So, we have 58 dead and 245 in non-firearm attacks in a span of 4 years. Interestingly, these events were no blamed on knives or hammers, but instead blamed on mental illness and &quot;rapid social change, mass migrations, increasing disparities in wealth and weakening of traditions&quot;. Funny how much of that we have in the US, but our problems are always blamed on the weapon and not on the attacker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for actaully providing something.  I appreciate when folks can answer a question with actual proof. Those numbers are indeed high in this individual indent. </p>

<p>A follow-up then: do you think that all deaths from stabbings added up, are equal to those from gun violence? In the last 1870 days there have been 1624 <em>mass shootings</em> (as defined by 4 or more people shot, not including the shooter). Thats nine out of ten days i  average. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/oct/02/america-mass-shootings-gun-violence">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/oct/02/america-mass-shootings-gun-violence</a> </p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t include other gun stats. </p>

<p>As I said in another post, crazy gonna crazy if they are set on it, but when it&#39;s so easy to access the tools to wreck such havoc, folks might want to consider if they are safer when everyone has the killing capacity, or if a restricted few have it. </p>

<p>I realize also that I may have an opinion I think is in the minority in this sub, but I&#39;m happy to have well backed, reasonable debates with other grownups here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry in advance for the long reply.</p>

<p>Definitely not. There&#39;s no doubt guns kill more, way more.  In another post I explained that roughly 90% of attackers/terrorists in the US and overseas were taking SSRI antidepressants. It&#39;s a known fact they can cause extreme violence including suicides and murders. This is basically being ignored. I believe this is what puts these killers over the edge.</p>

<p>I own guns and had to go through several background checks and multiple people had to speak with the police to clear me for a purchase. I have no problem with that at all. Fully automatic guns , assault rifles, are virtually banned and extremely difficult to actually own one. Almost every other gun out there is semi auto, so banning the AR is pointless.</p>

<p>I&#39;m against banning them or changing the 2nd amendment at all. It has nothing to do with hunting or sporting. I have the inalienable right to defend myself and my family, period. The police have no legal responsibility to protect you if you call them for help. You are literally on your own.  It&#39;s our responsibility to protect our family.</p>

<p>As an American it&#39;s our responsibility to keep the government in check if they become tyrannical. In the 20th century, 265 million innocent, unarmed civilians were murdered by their own government. That&#39;s more than all wars combined.  If guns were banned we&#39;d be handing them over to men wearing fully automatic weapons. These are the same type of men that murdered 265 million people. We would literally be a the mercy of the govt, and history has repeatedly shown they don&#39;t have the best track record for peace. </p>

<p>Look at Katrina or the LA riots. People were acting like animals. Someone will kill another person for some change right now. Imagine what people would do if they couldn&#39;t feed their kids for a week. The unarmed would be slaughtered.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some people, young and old, die because a crazy person shot them.. My uncle was shot and killed when he was 10yo. But still, I&#39;ll take my chances because I won&#39;t watch my sisters be raped and killed because I couldn&#39;t protect them from a pack of these shit people that turn into animals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something that drives me nuts to no end, is the demonization of the word &quot;semiautomatic&quot;. Outside of shotguns and high powered long rifles, every firearm is a semiautomatic.  (Truth be told I&#39;d be more afraid of a nut job with a 308 and a high powered scope that I can&#39;t see.)  It all boils down to wordplay and fear tactics. My biggest question is why are we still not calling out big pharma for this? Is there not a common thread between events like this and SSRIs?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand it fine, thanks. What I&#39;m saying is that the masses talk only about AR and AK style weapons, probably due to popularity and abundance. Someone says &quot;let&#39;s ban ar-15s, they are weapons of war&quot; - what they really should say is &quot;semi auto rifles/shotguns&quot;.</p>

<p>Let me restate myself: the lack of knowledge that most anti-2nd amendment (or those pro-gun laws) have towards that which they want to ban is mind boggling.  You can&#39;t ban 1 without banning them all, it won&#39;t work, it can&#39;t work work. Then, that opens the door to semi auto pistols. There is no stop. If you give a mouse a cookie...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah absolutely. This society system we&#39;re living in is literally destroying people&#39;s spirit. I truly understand how people feel. Thankfully I don&#39;t need to take anything like that. I&#39;m extremely mentally tough and am mostly unaffected by everything. I adapt quickly.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve said it before but if you can take an honest look at society and the state of the world and be perfectly content and happy, you are probably a sociopath. It&#39;s really fucked up out there and I get why so many people self medicate with drugs and alcohol. It&#39;s soul crushing. Humanity needs a massive period of enlightenment to change people&#39;s lives. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t see it happening unless something biblical happens and it wakes everyone up.</p>

Yes, there is bad and yes there are some problems, but the world is not as full of hate and evil as much as they shove it down our throats. There has to be a balance when navigating this world and I find many have a hard time finding that balance. This society seems to have an envious and hate issue that manifests in some really unhealthy ways, like mass shootings. </p>

<p>I’m a happy person, I hope that doesn’t make me a sociopath. But I also don’t drink or do drugs. I did for a long time, it made things worse. I know I have a good life and it could be much, much worse, so I choose to be grateful for what I do have. </p>

<p>I was thinking more about the corruption, greed, destruction of the planet, poisoned drinking water, the homeless problem, child abuse, joke of a legal system, outrageous medical costs etc etc. And that&#39;s just a few things i can think of in the US. Forget even talking worldwide issues.</p>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely right, envy and hate dominate this society. I believe it&#39;s the massive egos and rampant narcissism (those god-damned selfies) that are encouraged by the media.

    <div class="md"><p>I know from experience that they give these psych meds out like candy.  I believe the vast majority of people on them should not be on them.  The vast majority of psychiatrists don&#39;t even believe things like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder can be cured.  They don&#39;t believe its caused by some type of trauma or unresolved issues.  They believe its simply a chemical imbalance in the brain, and the drugs help fix the imbalance, and therefore people need to be on these crazy drugs for life.  They even prescribe them for PTSD for God sake.  I know someone who came back from Vietnam with PTSD, and was prescribed psych drugs, and is still on them today!  </p>

<p>We&#39;re not trying to help people with psychological issues.  We&#39;re trying to drug them so they&#39;re calm and hopefully forget about their problems if the dose is high enough.  Its kind of hard for a doctor to heal somebody when the doctor doesn&#39;t even believe the illness can be cured.</p>

<p>Most insurance doesn&#39;t even pay for therapy, but it will pay for every psych drug you could ever want.  People used to have support networks like church groups to talk to.  Hell, even going to confession with a priest is basically a form of therapy.  Now people don&#39;t ever talk about their problems with a professional, or anyone for that matter.  They just eat junk and take psych meds until they fucking snap.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also not convinced that these people are just psychopaths who want to kill as many people as possible.  Psychopaths become serial killers.  These shootings are like the opposite of a slow, methodical killer who takes pleasure in every stop of the process, and can carry it out over and over again.  I really believe the drugs are a huge part of all of this </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the point that .00009 percent of Americans are killed by guns annually. .01% of deaths per year are gun related. About half of those are suicide and most of the rest are gang related. That&#39;s a pretty small number to take away those rights.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assume it would be volunteer based, so most likely previously armed teachers would apply. Gun ownership is pretty common in the U.S. Schools usually have 20-50 teachers so odds are at least one owns a gun. I&#39;ll add some napkin math here:  </p>

<p>We&#39;ll assume 20 teachers in a school. 2015 Gallup poll had 43% of Americans owning guns. I&#39;ll drop it to 30% since we&#39;re looking at pistols (most popular firearm) but I couldn&#39;t  find a number on that. So that&#39;s ~1/3 of Americans. The chance that not a single American out of 20 owns a pistol would be (2/3)<sup>20,</sup> or .3%.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s how it works in some Texas schools where teachers can carry (those schools have also never had a shooting). The mere deterrence of there <em>most likely</em> being an armed teacher in the school would most likely cut back on school shootings. Mass shooters want maximum casualties, so they go places where no one is armed or where no one can shoot back.  </p>

<p>Our current set-up has big targets painted on schools in the form of &quot;gun free zone&quot; signs on the front door. This could be changed with minimal expense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. I will simply have to disagree with arming teachers as I think it sets a dangerous precedent up (I really REALLY hate to use this examples honestly I do: that black student was being aggressive and I feared for my life when he stood up so I shot him) but I see that you have fully shut down my cost issue, so I’ll definitely admit defeat on that one. </p>

<p>My main concern would be unhinged teachers, as well as simply promoting more guns by arming teachers. I’m sure, from what I gather, that you see more guns as at least a partial way to solve the problem. I simply disagree. But nothing wrong with that in discourse :)</p>

<p>As far as your Texas example, as a (rare) native houstonian, would you mind pointing me to state legislation that allows teachers to concealed carry? I have not heard anything about that or similar other than UT Austin allowing campus carry, though granted I’ve been out of state for a few years. </p>

<p>Additionally, if we were to train teachers in firearms, would you want them to take full on police marksman training? What exactly would the type of training be for them? It seems to me that they would essentially have to take this training over the summer break right?</p>

<p>I would also imagine the process would be based on the judgement of the administration so that would curtail the unhinged teacher. Although, if a teacher is unhinged enough to start shooting students it probably doesn&#39;t matter whether they&#39;re allowed to conceal carry.  </p>

<p>As to the hypothetical teacher fearing for their life I would hope that any legislation/training would explicitly state that they are not allowed to use a firearm unless they are threatened with a firearm or under an active shooter/killer situation. I would want the rules on teacher action to be strict and strictly enforced.  </p>

<p>For the training, I would say let a group of people that know a lot more than me about the subject decide what training course would be necessary for a teacher to meet the requirements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh!! Your third paragraph is genuinely what I was hoping for!! I could at least somewhat agree with them truthfully only being armed if under the explicit order to draw a weapon only if there was an active shooter!! Thank you for that. </p>

<p>As for follow-up, I have none. I really disagree with arming teachers, but I fully understand the argument and very VERY unfortunately, without legitimate gun control reform it may be the best answer. Again not that I agree with it at all. Thanks for the discourse sir. And thanks for linking the article for me. Have a good evening and let’s hope and pray this shit never happens again. I know the one thing we can agree on is that no child should be gunned down in a school. ?</p>

<p>The solution is easy. Prohibit the media from releasing the shooter&#39;s identity and body count. Most of these shooter&#39;s seek fame and the MSM sees that they get it to ensure that there is another mass shooting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like most things they take from us, there will always be another way. </p>

<p>Biological warfare, bombs, brutality ... don&#39;t matter. If someone wants to do something bad enough, no law will stop them. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t own guns, or care to do so, but, I do realize it&#39;s not the guns fault that people are sick and want to do retarded things. The kid shouldn&#39;t have had a gun anyways, and he had one. How many people should not have them but have them?! Many. I&#39;m not saying that this isn&#39;t a tragedy, any life lost is really too bad.</p>

<p>How about trying out an honest government, where money is shared amongst the nation, so that people grow up not having to do what they can to survive, so that there is less illness because the quality of food is better and medicine is readily available, how about we embrace that we&#39;re all different and address each others needs ... What about trying to be a leader among nations, not a war hungry, power seeking, cry baby when they don&#39;t get their way?! There are far worse things happening to your country than guns ... Guns in the hands of the people are probably the only thing keeping the US Govt at bay from absolutely doing what they like. </p>

<p>The next time someone goes on a rampage in a vehicle and runs someone over, will there be 700 threads on banning cars?! Probably not, because you use it personally and don&#39;t see the harm in a 2000 piece of machinery that can wipe out hundreds of people in the blink of an eye. Where are the threads on letting fast food outlets come into your city, destroying family run business, spreading their dirty, shitty food around, giving half the world cancer? I&#39;m also wondering where are the threads about the lack of investment into sustainability and growth as a people, versus nations.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a hater, I just honesty believe that people are the issue, not whats in their hands. Anything can be a means to carry out destruction. </p>

<p>The 2nd Amendment doesn&#39;t imply that whatsoever, which is why it doesn&#39;t say that. What it specifically states in no uncertain terms is that the right to bear arms shall not be infringed.

<p>That&#39;s a bunch of bullshit.  There have been tons of studies on voter fraud and they didnt find any major problem.  In fact, the large number of voter fraud took place by poll workers, not voters.</p>

<p>You&#39;re contradicting your position.  On one hand you say the second amendment is a constitutionally protected right, even with the words &quot;a well regulated militia&quot; implying regulation is needed.  The right to an unimpeded vote is encoded in 6 different amendments, one of them specifically saying a poll tax (paying for a special ID) is prohibited.</p>

<p>You&#39;re fine with adding regulations to voting, but not any regulation to gun rights.  Voters are not killing people.  Legally purchased guns are killing people because of a swiss cheese regulatory framework that differs from state to state.  The 2nd amendment says &quot;well regulated&quot; implying regulations are necessary for the safety of the general public.  Clearly none of us believe nuclear weapons, which are arms, should be available for sale at the local Wal Mart.  At some point we all see the need for sensible arms restrictions.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve gone full retard here. A well regulated militia doesnt imply gun control or any other type of infringement of the 2nd Amendment. It doesn&#39;t say firearm ownership is to be regulated at all. </p>

<p>The right to an unimpeded vote is encoded in 6 different amendments, one of them specifically saying a poll tax (paying for a special ID) is prohibited.</p>

<p>Irrelevant. Again. </p>

<p>Nuclear weapons are not firearms. More retardation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s completely relevant to your original argument of gun ownership being a Constitutionally protected right versus a privilege like driving.  Voting is a Constitutionally protected, written in 6 different amendments, and includes the specific language of an &quot;unimpeded&quot; vote and a vote free from a poll tax.  You want to regulate voting, which is Constitutionally protected, the reason you gave for why we shouldn&#39;t regulate guns. </p>

<p>The second amendment implies that the right to bear arms needs to be well regulated for the security of the state.  Gun control is not an infringement on your 2nd amendment rights.  Limiting the sale of some types of weapons, or putting regulations in place for gun ownership is not only a part of the 2nd amendment as written, it&#39;s for the general protection of all citizens.  The 2nd amendment doesnt make distinctions between firearms and nuclear arms.  When the 2nd amendment was written machines guns hadnt even been invented.</p>

<p>&quot;A well regulated militia&quot; does indeed suggest gun control.  In fact, for over 100 years we had multiple Militia acts to define who could actually bear arms because it did not include every citizen in America.  Once we allowed all citizens to purchase arms, we allowed the states to set regulation of gun sales.  This is why there is a problem as these regulations vary from state to state.  The Supreme Court has not overturned the rights of states to regulate guns.  We need federal regulations to provide standardized licensing and testing for gun ownership, just as you want to pass Voter ID laws to regulate voting despite it being a Constitutionally protected right, because the 2nd amendment tells us we need to regulate the militia of people who bear arms for the security of the state.</p>

<p>Regulating voting, which you want to do, is the same as regulating arms, except for the fact regulation is written as a requirement into the 2nd amendment.</p>

<p>The voting rights was your argument. It is an irrelevant deflection. Voting rights and gun rights are exclusive, despite your somewhat absurd efforts to conflate the two. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The second amendment implies that the right to bear arms needs to be well regulated for the security of the state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it says the militia needs to be well regulated. Is the army a firearm? No, because that would be retarded, as is your claim. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 2nd amendment doesnt make distinctions between firearms and nuclear arms. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The phrase &quot;keep and bear arms&quot; implies personal weapons that an individual can bear personally. Nuclear weapons don&#39;t fall into this classification. Machines guns arent prohibited, but the ability to buy them has been grossly infringed upon. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not in the Constitution we didnt, so this is irrelevant. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You are required to have identification regardless of whether you vote. There is no license to vote or a test for voting. Again, your comparison is irrelevant. The right to bear arms is to provide security from the state, not for it. You conveniently omitted the word free, which makes all the difference. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regulating voting, which you want to do, is the same as regulating arms, except for the fact regulation is written as a requirement into the 2nd amendment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More irrelevance. Voting isnt being regulated. When you have to pass an IQ test or a background check to vote, you will have something to talk about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You wanting to regulate voting rights is the same as regulating gun rights.  If they are both Constitutionally and exclusive rights, than your position that arms should not be regulated should also apply to voting.  They are inconsistent positions if n fact you believe they are both exclusive rights.  So if you do believe we should regulate voting with a Voter ID because of the unfounded suspicion of voter fraud that hasnt been proven, it follows you should be amenable to sensible gun control regulations since we have legally acquired firearms ending up in the actual deaths of hundreds of civilians, many of them children and the costs of that carnage being paid for by taxpayers.</p>

<p>After all those militia acts, Congress finally made the National Guard the official &quot;militia&quot; after allowing all citizens to own guns.  Just because it didnt make it into the Constitution doesnt mean it didnt happen.  There is historical precedent for the regulation of arms.  Nonetheless, the 2nd amendment still begins with &quot;A WELL REGULATED MILITIA&quot;.  The first part of the amendment states arms should be regulated.  Again, the Supreme Court has not overturned states that apply arms regulations for violating the 2nd amendment, because in the absence of Federal regulations for gun ownership (which is what I said we needed in the very beginning) the states are allowed to make their own laws under the 10th amendment.  These state by state laws are the problem, where some states like Louisiana have the laxest laws compared to states like California.  There needs to be national standards and licensing.</p>

<p>No, actually, you are not required to have identification at all.  There is no law requiring you to carry ID.  The only time you need ID is when driving.  You claim gun ownership is an exclusive right, implying that any regulation violates your Constitutionally rights.  The same logic should apply to mandatory voter ID.  Again, your argument was voting was an exclusive and Constitutionally protected right.  The comparison is completely relevant that you want to sensibly regulate voting but not gun ownership when both are exclusive rights. </p>

<p>Voting is being regulated when people are being denied the exclusive, Constitutionally protected right to an unimpeded vote because they dont have a state mandated voter ID that they had to pay for or take time off work to acquire.  Maybe thats why the Supreme Court keeps calling those voter ID laws unconstitutional.  Notice the Supreme Court hasnt said state by state gun regulation is unconstitutional according to the 2nd amendment.  That means they dont see the 2nd amendment as an absolute right, that in fact regulation is implied and in the absence of Federal regulations its up to the states according to the 10th.</p>

<p>It&#39;s ironic that you keep calling me retarded when I seem to know the Constitution better than you.</p>

How are we to pay for CCL and the training, as well as what I assume would be a glock 17 or something comparable, for teachers when their funding is already being slashed to the bone and they’re ALREADY (in most/many cases) having to pay for a portion of their school supplies?</p>
