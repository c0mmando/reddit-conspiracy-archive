<p>If you&#39;re so sure this is a real shooting, let this be a depository of irrefutable proof that couldn&#39;t possibly be faked. You can reference it later when we crazies come along and say that it might be a hoax, proving that real shots were fired and real children were shot.</p>

<p>Edit: Mods, sticky this post! It is sure to fill up with convincing and undeniable evidence so we can establish a real shooting occurred!!</p>

<p>He moves goal posts, does not recognize that a negative also requires proof, nit picks about isolated details while ignoring your argument as a whole, and demands really impossible proof...</p>

<p>He does not believe it atoms, dinosaurs, a round earth, missiles, nukes, space, planets, the sun, etc... call himself the world&#39;s leading skeptic and makes fun of &quot;normies&quot; and &quot;conspiritards&quot; (what he calls people on this reddit) alike. </p>

<p>Most of his argument is that he did not see it with his own eyes since he will cry fakery on any video, witness account or other evidence you supply... you might even know someone who died and he will demand names and other personal details. </p>

<p>The rest of his arguments stem from not understanding basic science or tenants of research leading me to conclude his a combination of ass and the Dunning–Kruger effect...</p>

<p>So save your breath, you won&#39;t convince him, hell I think you could strap him to a rocket headed for the sun and he will still find a a way to cry fakery...</p>

He&#39;s saying you can&#39;t know something occurred for sure simply by trusting someone who said they were a witness to the event.

So if they&#39;ve lied in the past and they made lying to the public legal, what would motivate them to tell the truth? Applied behavioral analysis says there is no reason for them to change their bad behavior, especially when lying gets reinforced by an uneducated public that refuses to hold the government accountable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I&#39;m asking, how can one demand &quot;proof&quot; if any proof one offers can be immediately discounted and cast aside? That&#39;s the silly part. Why ask would one ask if they won&#39;t listen?</p>

<p>It&#39;s like me say &quot;prove to me that Europe actually exists&quot;, but here&#39;s my caveats:</p>

<p>You can&#39;t show me maps, because maps are just drawings and anyone can draw anything. </p>

<p>I also won&#39;t take the word of someone that&#39;s been there, because how do I know that they&#39;ve been there. They could just be an actor telling me they&#39;ve been there.</p>

<p>I also won&#39;t take the word of someone who&#39;s currently there, because how do I know that they&#39;re REALLY there? You can make a Skype call from anywhere, after all. They could point their webcam out the window to show me the Leaning Tower of Pisa, but since I clearly want to believe that Europe doesn&#39;t exist, that&#39;s not acceptable proof - after all, I&#39;ve never seen it in person, it could just be in Canada but Canadians aren&#39;t allowed there, to keep up the conspiracy.</p>

<p>I could go on. My point is, demanding &quot;proof&quot; with the caveat that any proof one supplies doesn&#39;t count doesn&#39;t make someone appear enlightened, simply stubborn for no other reason than to be stubborn. It doesn&#39;t prove anything.</p>

<p>As for this tragedy in America, why would one ask strangers for &quot;proof&quot; when we&#39;re all operating with the same set of knowledge. Some (most) of us believe it. A few apparently don&#39;t. None of us can possibly sway them, since they&#39;ve seen the same exact information we&#39;ve all seen.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve suggested, in my plethora of replies to him, that if the &quot;facts&quot; that most of us agree on aren&#39;t sufficient, the only real alternative is for the questioner to go visit the scene themselves. Interview the witnesses themselves. But of course they won&#39;t. They&#39;ed rather sit at their computer practicing their trolling skills in their attempt to belittle a tragedy.</p>

<p>And yes, I will agree with you as well. The government isn&#39;t to be trusted unquestioningly, no matter who the leadership is. But that doesn&#39;t mean that every occurrence in the country is the result of a government conspiracy.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the &quot;why&quot;. What does the government have to gain out of this? With the current congressional and White House leadership, there&#39;s no fear of them going door to door collecting peoples guns.  The NRA-funded GOP isn&#39;t going to try to use a school shooting to advance their hidden anti-gun narrative, because they don&#39;t have that hidden narrative. They&#39;re rather blatantly against that, in fact.</p>

<p>And your other tidbit: <em>So if they&#39;ve lied in the past and they made lying to the public legal, what would motivate them to tell the truth?</em></p>

<p>I would say the functional motivation for telling the truth is simple. If everything you ever say is a lie, everyone will figure it out and never believe a word you say. But if 99% of what you say is true, and only 1% is a lie, those lies will slip right by, since people have learned that what you say is generally believable.</p>

<p>In other words, lying at every possible attempt to do so does no benefit to the liar.</p>

<p>All that said, this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. I think its extremely lazy, disingenuous to try to create a conspiracy simply by taking a known even and demanding &quot;proof&quot;. The known facts are the only proofs they have. If someone wants to lay out an alternative theory, it should be on them to provide new facts that back up that reality. Loose Change wasn&#39;t a video saying &quot;Prove to me that 9/11 occurred the way the government said&quot;, Dylan presented the governments story and went on to address each shortcoming on his own. He took responsibility for laying out an alternative narrative, which caused many people to scratch their heads and ask more questions. He didn&#39;t just go &quot;nuh-uh&quot;, which is essentially what OP and his cheerleader were doing here.</p>

<p>Not sure if you&#39;ll agree or disagree, but I liked the tone of your response so I thought I&#39;d write back. But beyond that, I&#39;m doing running in verbal circles in this thread :) </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s how you do conspiracies properly.
What does this even mean?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Conspiracy theories (at least, good ones, ones that make you think or realize you&#39;re onto something) don&#39;t start out by some numb nut picking an event at random and telling strangers &quot;prove to me this really happened&quot;. They&#39;re born when someone smart figures something out and then shows the rest of us what they&#39;re on to.</p>

<p>OP can&#39;t even figure that out. He hasn&#39;t figured out a damn thing, only asking that each of us provides him <strong>evidence</strong>. None of us have access to any more evidence than he does, so obviously we&#39;ll never meet his burden of proof. What a stupid way to go about things. You can create a &quot;conspiracy&quot; about anything you want. Not because you found out something that was suppressed (&quot;eyewitnesses claim they heard gunshots from the grassy knoll, but the commission never examined that&quot;), but from outright rejection of the testimony we all hear.</p>

<p>Obviously, unless we were there, none of us are eyewitnesses to the event, so OP can reject anything we say on those grounds. And even if we were, there&#39;s likely no way we can prove to OP&#39;s satisfaction that we were. </p>

<p>My &quot;evidence&quot; is based on the testimony I&#39;ve read (and i&#39;m using testimony not as in it was in the court of law, but rather by people on Twitter, interviewed on the news, the words of the president, the sheriff, and so forth and so on). I am believing that. I don&#39;t need to fly down to Florida to walk through the school for myself. </p>

<p>So this bolding of evidence, just what the hell? None of us have video or pictures or snapchats. We&#39;re relying on what we&#39;ve seen the children, the parents, and many others who were affected by the event. That&#39;s how things work. </p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing OP wants to try to be a new Alex Jones vis a vis Sandy Hook. But he can&#39;t even be bothered to make an claim, can&#39;t be bothered to present us their alternative line of facts for us to weigh against what&#39;ve already heard about the incident, nothing. OP is lazy. Instead, they just say &quot;Yeah, that event we&#39;ve all heard about, all seen interviews about... prove to me it happened, i need evidence&quot;. We&#39;re all operating on the same exact playing field, here - if they&#39;ve rejected what we&#39;ve all seen and believe, there&#39;s nothing further we can provide.</p>

<p>But again, the onus isn&#39;t on me to prove anything to OP. If OP has a different theory, it&#39;s on them to outline this theory and provide evidence for us to evaluate.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve enjoyed lots what I&#39;ve read in this sub. Usually I just like lurking and reading things that make me go &quot;hmmm&quot;?. But lately, its been amateur hour around here. Sad, really.</p>

<p>And besides, I did post a link for OP.</p>

<p>But how about this. If television interviews with children and parents aren&#39;t enough, if the words from the police aren&#39;t enough, the words from the liar but definitely not from the swamp president aren&#39;t enough, if the tweets and pictures from inside the school aren&#39;t enough, what exactly do you hope one of us will post for you? The shooter was arrested at the scene. To my knowledge, he&#39;s admitted to doing it. The FBI has been chastised by all for not taking action sooner, since he&#39;d been reported previously.</p>

<p>That&#39;s our proof. That&#39;s all any random person on the internet can provide. But that&#39;s been accepted as truth by nearly all of us. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(philosophy)#Proving_a_negative">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(philosophy)#Proving_a_negative</a></p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, it has been said whoever makes a claim carries the burden of proof regardless of positive or negative content in the claim.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Given all that, if you or OP wants to argue against the events, the onus is now on you to provide evidence that counters everything we&#39;ve all seen, and everything you and OP has access. THat&#39;s our evidence. What&#39;s there to dispute? That I can&#39;t personally attest that the parent I saw on TV was really a parent and really had a student at Parkland? I can&#39;t personally attest that that student really is a student, and isn&#39;t a CG effect?</p>

<p>Sorry. This is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Why don&#39;t you make a minimal amount of effort to prove whatever alternative version of &quot;facts&quot; that you think exist?</p>

<p>I saw your other link. It had a tweet from Trump, a tweet from Melania, a picture of two upset-looking women,  and a student describing the sound of gunshots as &quot;like fireworks.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is what I see in that video: jerky, blurry images (especially in second half) show undetermined forms laying on floor. One is conveniently laid behind a podium, with only legs showing. Lots of backs of people’s heads, view blockage and light glare. Blurred &quot;red liquid&quot; is on floor. Then we see the standard blurred jerky filming of the floor on the way out. Who has a camera like this in 2018?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ITT: people who don&#39;t realize the difference between evidence and assumption. If there was a clear liquid on my body and I said I just took a shower, you would assume the liquid was water. There would be no evidence unless you actually took a sample of it or if it interacted with other matter in ways that no other liquid would. Even then there is still room to doubt the accuracy of the test and to doubt that we know all substances and all their behaviors. Basically, we shouldn&#39;t ever really say we know anything because true knowing can&#39;t be done in our world of imperfection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok then all the bodies and eyewitnesses should be good for you then and so this shooting actually happened. </p>

<p>Also there is no extraordinary claim from reality.  The extraordinary claim is that 1000&#39;s of people are willing participants in a lifelong hoax to fake a shooting that never happened. That dead children aren&#39;t dead and their families will spend the rest of their lives pretending that the child they raised actually died when they didn&#39;t, that all the students of the school are lying. etc etc .  Your evidence for this appears to be......that you think it&#39;s true and all the actual evidence is fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, eyewitness is supplementary not evidence. Ive seen no bodies, nor has anyone who wasnt there. And yes its an extraordinary claim. And may all be true, but it still has tp be proven regardless and i dont care enough ti believe any thing without actually evidence. Thats just called be discerning. What youve derived of my opinion is conjecture, untrue, and perfect evidence for just how an eyewitness can be wrong. You have plenty of time to read what i wrote, but instead you glossed it and made assumptions
 You put no thought into at all. In fact, i only responded to highlight that for other people reading as youve shown no interest in staying neutral.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve seen plenty of bodies, you&#39;re just ignoring them because it doesn&#39;t fit your narrative. You are literally, literally, suggesting that those bodies are fake and that 100&#39;s if not thousands of people are willing participating in a hoax to pretend they are real. </p>

<p>There is literally no evidence that you would accept, mainly because your brain doesn&#39;t appear to work properly and you won&#39;t accept anything as evidence of an event that disagrees with what you have already decided is true.  You then claim that because there is no evidence you accept that reality didn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>Any facts presented about this incident you will dismiss as fake. </p>

<p>Will you state that you believe every child who died, every family member, every cop, first responder, neighbour and other student is a liar and willing participant in a hoax school shooting?  Simply saying you do not believe any evidence presented means you think it was a hoax. Obviously you will try and weasel out of it with some variant of &quot;I&#39;m just asking questions&quot; or &quot;you carry on believing the MSM sheep&quot; but logically if you don&#39;t believe the reported events you must believe these people are liars.</p>

<p>Keep up the good work. You are dealing with people who are desperate to hold on to their belief that the TV is their friend that people would not lie about something as serious as a school shooting.</p>

<p>Your chances of changing their minds are somewhere between &#39;slim&#39; and &#39;nil&#39;, but others who read these exchanges will be able to recoginse that your questions are fair and honest, and the replies are no different to those of normies who still believe Osama dun 9/11.</p>

<p>Then maybe tell your beloved FBI to stop letting school shooters &quot;accidentally&quot; slip through their hands. Heartless? Oh please.

    <div class="md"><p>The theory that shootings may be false flags is one thing. Your position of,  evidence that&#39;s not irrefutable is worthless 
because you&#39;ve arbitrarily proclaimed the more likely truth to be yours is ridiculous.  </p>

<p>So is the way you reference Occam&#39;s razor. Do you think the school doesn&#39;t exist? The kids? The parents? You seem to imply that in the comments which would basically be the least likely scenario imaginable but you don&#39;t defend it at all. You just say you &quot;know&quot; other fake shootings happened, again without evidence, and therefore it must be assumed this one was fake. </p>

<p>This is exactly the type of post made by people arguing in bad faith. Even your cheeky little edit is sarcastic and designed as a barb at people you disagree with and not as a conversation starter. You&#39;re like a child telling your sibling you&#39;re not touching them in the car.</p>

<p>I have no proof of anything but I recently got a text from my boss who recently retired and said her niece went to that school and she&#39;s pretty shook up and hasn&#39;t talked to her dad much about it. </p>

<p>Last night I texted her this video.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=681&amp;amp;v=mh0vLii-gBU">https://m.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=681&amp;amp;v=mh0vLii-gBU</a></p>

<p>I told her it seems something shady is going on and if she could have her niece check it out and give me info I would appreciate it.</p>

<p>My thoughts are it was a false flag. People died but there&#39;s much more to the story. Same with Vegas. Sandy Hook on the other hand I believe was a hoax. No dead kids.</p>

<p>Keep on researching fellas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s try this again: I&#39;m looking for extraordinary evidence that New Zealand exists and is not possibly an elaborate globalist conspiracy. For those who seem sure it is NOT A HOAX, please post your &quot;proof&quot; here:I tried this yesterday with this thread and pretty much the best anyone could do was post the patented vertical shitty quality &quot;Oy Mate&quot; cell phone video and link to an AMA that a supposed New Zealander did.
If you&#39;re so sure this is a real country, let this be a depository of irrefutable proof that couldn&#39;t possibly be faked. You can reference it later when we crazies come along and say that it might be a hoax, proving that real Kiwis exist and people have met them.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never been to New Zealand. Have you seen pictures? Faked. Met someone from New Zealand? Government agent. You&#39;ve been? Shill. Bought goods from New Zealand? Don&#39;t think so, it doesn&#39;t exist. PROVIDE ME WITH EVIDENCE NEW ZEALAND EXISTS THAT ISN&#39;T FROM THE MSM. Our history books, our news, it&#39;s all doctored to create this fake country. </p>

<p>See how easy that is? What is &quot;evidence&quot; beyond you having witnessed the event first hand? Anything anyone brings up you&#39;re calling fake or fakeable - EVERYTHING could be faked. Nothing could exist. You&#39;re making your best guess, and if your best guess at this point is that this is actually fake, you&#39;re not very good at guessing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>New Zealand is of course a fictional entity that describes the contents of a fictional border around a factual landmass. New Zealand is therefore no more real than say Harry Potter, except in terms of what we choose to believe is real... To stand within the borders of New Zealand would be to believe that such a place exists. Unfortunately this is a bad example if your point, as New Zealand can only be proven by examining a chain of documents, the originator of said chain being a document that someone just ‘made up’ with a name, New Zealand, that was a manifestation of the human mind... hence... fiction.</p>

<p>But as for the concept of your post... this’s right here is the real question... I would argue that because everything can be faked, an even higher degree of vigilance is required when assessing claims that have the capacity to change opinions of entire nations, such as 9/11, school shootings, or any emotionally charged event. It’s a matter of public interest, and the public should have enough access to verify the accuracy of reporting, lest we get led down a dark path by nefarious ‘actors’.</p>

<p>There is a high value placed on an ability to manipulate the beliefs and emotions of large groups of people. If you can do that, people will pay for it. Groups of people who have specialised and trained for this activity are probably present in each country’s intelligence program, but are most common in mass media. It’s what they do. It’s what their customers pay them to do. Bullshit wars. Complete with technological-bullshit-arm-race. Deepfake etc. We love fiction so much they made CGI almost indistinguishable from reality, and I’m not sure people comprehend the danger in that.</p>

<p>It is even more important in today’s modern world, where theatre, media, editing, graphics software have been perfected over decades to deliver convincing lies to us in the form of ‘entertainment, it’s not so hard to believe these mechanisms could be used easily to convince us a lie is real. One simply cannot just believe what they see or hear on TV, or read in an article from someone who has watched something on TV.</p>

<p>The result is that EVERYTHINGmust be looked at critically. I feel bad for folks who are ceirtain of things, nowadays... best to just deal in probability.</p>

<p>I can see how a large number of impressionable kids (and teachers) could be fooled into thinking a shooting was going on, and indeed all “evidence” so far seems to be of circumstantial quality, indistinguishable from a staged scene, as is so often the case.</p>

<p>Where are the eyewitnesses to a person or persons shooting?</p>

<p>You do not know that. Many of us are skeptical of these &#39;mass shootings&#39; because we understand how easy it is for TV and government to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmfVs3WaE9Y">lie about events like this</a> <strong>and get away with it</strong>.</p>

<p>Instead of shooting the messenger (or in the case, they with the courage to ask a simple question), why not produce the evidence which convinced you this event was real?</p>
