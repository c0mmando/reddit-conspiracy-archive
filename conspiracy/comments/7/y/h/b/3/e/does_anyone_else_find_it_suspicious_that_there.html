    <div class="md"><p>That’s pretty racist. /s</p>

<p>Lots of people are poor not just black kids. Some of the poorest cities are white redneck Republican areas. Half the country is living in poverty. I would love to have a free movie ticket. Have you noticed who these free movie tickets are mainly geared towards?</p>

<p>The problem here is businesses and non-profits are buying a bunch of tickets that normally wouldn’t be bought. That increases the box office numbers.</p>

<p>SJWs have been hyping this movie and promising to break box office records for almost a year. They have an agenda. This is just another corporate Marvel movie that appropriates black culture but they’re making it out like Dr. King is in it.</p>

<p>This is like an author’s publishing company buying up all of his books to hit the NYT best seller list.</p>

<p><a href="http://stateofworkingamerica.org/fact-sheets/poverty/">It&#39;s not racist.  It&#39;s just the facts.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>45.8 percent of young black children (under age 6) live in poverty, compared to 14.5 percent of white children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a huge disparity.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Among racial and ethnic groups, African Americans had the highest poverty rate, 27.4 percent, followed by Hispanics at 26.6 percent and whites at 9.9 percent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It could be a giant conspiracy to inflate the numbers of Black Panther.  Or it could be people trying to make sure black kids can see Black Panther&#39;s first movie and the first superhero movie with a mostly black cast.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also unlikely the viewing parties inflated the numbers very much.</p>

<p>Some data storage company was handing out free tickets to see Blade Runner 2049 if you sit through their spiel. Not the same thing.</p>

<p>I’m talking about special interest groups that are buying blocks of tickets to inflate the box office because the movie supports their agenda.</p>

<p>With Passion, it was obviously religious groups and with Black Panther, it is SJW groups. They’ve compared Black Panther to Obama’s election fer Chris sakes. You’re in a conspiracy forum. Are you trying to tell me this sort of thing doesn’t go on? Do you remember Ghostbusters?</p>

<p>Rotten Tomatoes shouldn’t be involved in inflating box office numbers by handing out free tickets. Especially after what happened with Last Jedi, another SJW tentpole. This is just one of the groups doing this. $40,000 may not seem like a lot but it adds up when you have groups all across the US doing the same.</p>

<p>So once again, if none of these groups were handing out free tickets, pre-purchased by companies and non-profits, would it have done the same numbers?</p>

<p>Obviously not.</p>

<p>Would it have been number one. Sure, I can admit to that but the numbers have been artificially inflated to promote SJW politics.</p>
