        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>SS: This is a question for everyone who believes the official narrative that the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting was a legitimate tragedy and not a farce. Why have no pictures been released to the public of Adam Lanza at Sandy Hook elementary school on the day of the shooting? It would put this entire controversy to rest and it wouldn&#39;t be disrespectful to any of the grieving families whatsoever. By the way, the video of a boy that&#39;s supposedly Adam Lanza playing Dance Dance Revolution where we can&#39;t see his face doesn&#39;t count as proof of his existence. <a href="https://youtu.be/N0tnYfBfzB0">As far as I can tell, he is a fictional character</a>. But I would like to hear from the naysayers about this one. Surely by late 2012 there were multiple cameras at all schools. There was surveillance footage from the parking lot at Sandy Hook... but we didn&#39;t see hundreds of students being evacuated from the school. If anyone could produce just one still image of Adam Lanza at Sandy Hook on the day of the shooting, then I will give my respectful apologies and admit that I have been wrong about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an implication that Dunblane was another suspicious psy-op. From the wikipedia article introduction on Dunblane: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Public debate about the killings centred on gun control laws, including public petitions calling for a ban on private ownership of handguns and an official inquiry, which produced the 1996 Cullen Reports. In response to this debate, two new Firearms Acts were passed, which greatly restricted private ownership of firearms in Great Britain.</p>

<p>Even if there were zero, that&#39;s not the way you decide if it&#39;s real or not. You look at the evidence and decide if it seems more like an authentic shooting or more like staged bullshit.</p>

<p>As far as Newtown goes, it&#39;s a strange place. For example the author of the <em>Twilight</em> series lived there. Many houses in that neighborhood were listed as sold on Christmas Day in the year or so before the event for $0.00. Many think that the entire neighborhood was basically a CIA setup. This is not unheard of, if you investigate such things. The school itself was not functioning at the time, which should be obvious just by looking at the moldy walls, safety hazards, and overall state of dilapidation in such an affluent neighborhood.</p>

I had this theory a few years back that touched on the idea of mafioso and other gangsters getting kids at a young age and raising them in the life so it is all they know and everyone outside of it the enemy. We (for the most part we refers to all of us) know that happens, so again it would not be a stretch to think that this corporations alphabets are not doing the same thing. </p>

<p>An one other fringe idea (Idea in before Pgate was brought to light) It may also not to be too far of a  stretch to guess that the Sandy Hook people are all victims of abuse themselves. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=paul+bonacci">Paul Bonacci</a> discusses how they got the kids to commit felonies an held those felonies over their heads to get them to keep complying.

<p>Strawman. Why would the whole town need to be in on anything. An overwhelming majority of victim families were brand new to the community.</p>

<p>A small handful of officials were allowed into the school. Even paramedics were kept out.</p>

<p>The school itself was set back and down in a secluded spot that couldn&#39;t even be seen/viewed from the main street and the neighbourhood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, Let’s say the whole thing was REAL. Most adults that lived in Newtown did NOT work in Newtown, they were mostly commuters and they were mostly professional types. And I bring that up because, how does a professional dress when he or she goes to work? A suit of some sort? Now let’s say that there is an emergency, a shooting at their child’s school in the middle of their work day and they are notified to come and get their children from the school. Kind of nerve racking, right? Especially for a commuter who is working relatively far away from home! Now explain two things: A) how fast the parents showed up to the school. Combined with B) notice everyone’s attire in all of the post shooting footage and pictures. Do you see many suits and ties? Did the parents go home and change into more casual attire and then go tend to their child’s emergency? Unlikely. Based off what you see with your own eyes, is it more likely that perhaps most parents did not go to work that day?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying this to say one way or another whether it was true or fake, but I just wanted to point out.</p>

<p>Many &quot;professionals&quot; don&#39;t wear suits any longer in the US unless they&#39;re pretty high up on the totem pole or are meeting with clients. Additionally, the shooting happened on a Friday and many companies allow &quot;business casual&quot;, jeans, or other altered dress code for most employees.</p>

<p>In 2000, the census showed the median household income as $90,193.  While they may have been professionals, I don&#39;t think they were all in jobs that required suits and ties every day. </p>

<p>Because there was a camera at the school…and you&#39;re wrong. Feel free to read the letter announcing the camera by Hochsprung</p>
