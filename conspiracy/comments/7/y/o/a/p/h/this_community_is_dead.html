It was a strategy that Cass Sunstein proposed the US government should infiltrate conspiracy communities to mess with them.  That was 10 years ago and I tend to believe It&#39;s still in operations today.  With that said, there&#39;s also just users who are real who just want to get their rocks off and fuck with people.

Trump isn&#39;t fighting the fight the T_D crowd thinks he&#39;s fighting, but I also don&#39;t buy the Russia-Trump collusion story either.  I personally think his win scared everyone, the deep state went on the attack because he ran on a non-interventionist platform, but now Trump is leading us into <a href="http://archive.is/vSlrd">war in the Pacific</a> and the MIC like him.  The Trump-Russia story is now just cover so #resist won&#39;t talk about real issues like the US increasing the Afghanistan war, domestic surveillance, confronting China &amp; Russia in the Pacific, or any domestic policy.  Shit the Dems aren&#39;t offing anything different, where was their tax plan.  I remember when one side would actually oppose the other with legislation and ideas, now it&#39;s &quot;We&#39;re not Trump, so... Yeah!&quot;.  It&#39;s all so fucked up now a days.    </p>

<p>I remember a lot of people starting to realize it though when it came out we were arming &quot;rebels&quot; in Syria, and realizing those rebels were actually ISIS. Which is also the same time a lot of the other shit hit the fan and led us to the way things currently are. </p>

<p>But it gives me hope that people will come around and start researching on their own. Especially after the IG report comes out. But there have been bigger stories that got buried before, so...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been in this rabbits hole for 15+ years at least, but it&#39;s interesting to hear how people were woken up by certain events.  If the media actually did their job, I&#39;m sure the Syria situation would wake a lot of people up.  To me, it was clear as day that ISIS had to be a US supported group.  Just the initial story of them taking crude oil, transporting it, refining it and sell it on a black market and making 3 million a day, while fighting a war was pretty incredible. Especially when you add in they only had 20,000 members.  It was laughable in my mind, especially if you followed everything that went down in Libya before hand and how those rebels moved onto Syria in 2012 and that&#39;s what kicked everything off.  You also didn&#39;t see any US news outlets cover the fact that <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/hillary-clinton-wikileaks-email-isis-saudi-arabia-qatar-us-allies-funding-barack-obama-knew-all-a7362071.html">Obama &amp; Hillary both knew</a> that Qatar &amp; Saudi were supporting ISIS directly, and we just so happened to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber_Sycamore">CIA program that ran weapons, financial support and training through those countries</a> that started at the same time ISIS popped up.... Sorry for the rant...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too many people in this sub have this idea that everything is a conspiracy and nothing is ever a simple explanation. I posted one personal story about being at a school where a school shooting occurred and I stated that there was nothing fishy about it. It was just a “normal” school shooting.

    <div class="md"><p>That is not even remotely applicable. I talked about a shooting at a school that I went to and stated my first hand knowledge of the situation, as well as people in the room where it happened and many other people involved. I then relayed how I knew what I knew and why it wasn’t fishy. Then people who had no knowledge of it started questioning but based on what? Nothing. There should be reason to question something. If a part of the official narrative didn’t make sense to them or they didn’t believe a certain “fact” then sure, challenge the narrative.</p>

<p>That wasn’t the case. They didn’t have any information or actual questions or concerns of the narrative. They just blurted out “yOu Dnt HavE thE same Facs as the KopS sO hoW do u no it Wuznt a conspiraCY”. That’s why people don’t take other seriously when they question the official narrative of an event. It’s baseless and senseless tin-foil hat shit. It makes them look very unintelligent. </p>

It&#39;s easy to push the problem onto some conspiracy instead of just really seeing or dealing with the problem.</p>

<p>People get post happy without fact checking themselves. People also get mean. Doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s a conspiracy. </p>

<p>People are also other times very knowledgeable and nice. Is that a conspiracy, too?</p>

<p>If a poster doesn&#39;t see their own errors or isn&#39;t open to back and forth well, then they don&#39;t understand the point of the sub and we should hold people accountable for being mean on our own by just getting over it and leaving the conversation.</p>

<p>And you also have to look at it from your side. Maybe someone is being mean to you but maybe it escalated because you&#39;re wasting your time and keep commenting back over and over when it&#39;s not changing anything but just adding to your own stress and also amplifying the fire of the fight.</p>

<p>Even if you&#39;re right and you&#39;re correcting what they posted for the sake of the truth---you shouldn&#39;t be playing the fight game though, either. You got to know when to step away. If you&#39;re goal is to change their mind it can&#39;t be done by force, and why would you want to force someone, anyway? If a thread is just blatantly wrong, don&#39;t give it more power. </p>

<p>Sometimes silence is all that&#39;s needed. When something doesn&#39;t get reception or attention it&#39;s less likely to happen because that is the goal usually: attention. People want upvotes and comments and the like and then it becomes no different than other social media. That&#39;s why some posters react so badly when you call them out because they want so hard to be right. That&#39;s the part that matters to them. That they were right. Not that they were necessarily calling out a real problem or a conspiracy. They might not even know that could be their motive deep down. It feels nice when you feel smart and saw something no one else did and you can get lost and carried away with that.</p>

<p>The TL;DR: anyone who has good intentions will not fight with you, even if they don&#39;t agree. If they fight, just back off. Can&#39;t force people to drink the truth. Water kills if shoved down your throat for you. You have to drink it yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. OP here describes a situation in their post. Here&#39;s the situation:</p>

<p>A generic OP to a generic conspiracy thread writes a post. Reader disagrees or have proof to why their proofs or conspiracies are not correct or not as they saw it. Reader comments. Generic OP gets mad and instead of considering what reader, now commenter, has to say. Tells them off or they are stupid, whatever.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying at that point you shouldn&#39;t fight back with them. I&#39;m not saying to operate on Reddit in complete silence. I&#39;m saying to not feed people who are being mean. Stop commenting. Stop giving their thread more traction if it&#39;s completely false or somewhat bogus and they are being mean about it.</p>

<p>You commented and gave them what they needed to see to show them new info or how theirs doesn&#39;t add up and if they don&#39;t like the advice, you shouldn&#39;t keep fighting about it. Even if they started first, better person doesn&#39;t finish it. They realize when it&#39;s time to stop taking part and move on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats your choice, its situational. Im not here trying to give you an end all be all solution to shills. But there is a point were the legitimacy of a post is reduced to zero by no ones fault but the OP. Once this can be seen by anyone reading through it, continuing to comment becomes useless. You suggest that if you were being shilled by msm that there is a point you should give up, but that is a situation that doesnt apply. Defending your post in a non derogatory way is the solution in that case. When the dust settles there will be what is clearly shilling, and the solid defence you established. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, exactly! It&#39;s like when a kid cries for a toy. You can give them the toy, take them out of the store, try to be rational with them or you can just stop rewarding the behavior with any attention cause sometimes that&#39;s all it is. I&#39;m not saying we should call people or or rather, enlighten them, when they are wrong because yeah, you can come to real stuff that way.</p>

<p>But, if you comment to the OP why they are wrong or you believe they are wrong and are met with rudeness, yeah, their fault for being rude but it&#39;s your fault for staying after that and continuing it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying to think of whether you&#39;re helping it escalate. We are reading text on a screen and it doesn&#39;t always read the same in our heads or mean what it meant to OP or another commenter/reader. And what one person takes as mean, maybe it&#39;s too vague to be. Some people take being told their wrong as mean when it&#39;s not.</p>

<p>And if you keep feeding it after that you&#39;re not really any better. Cause if the point was to educate someone you didn&#39;t do it but made it worse. I&#39;m saying comment, say what needs to be said civil, and leave it at that. If the discussion continues, and it&#39;s fine for it to do so, but if OP gets butt hurt you should just stop after that. Don&#39;t make yourself a victim or play the victim. I think after you realize someone isn&#39;t listening to you and you keep poking at them you end up doing something wrong yourself, even if they started it.</p>

<p>What does that have to do with secret plans by groups of people to do something unlawful or harmful? Because that&#39;s the definition of the word &quot;conspiracy&quot;. If a topic doesn&#39;t involve groups of people secretly doing bad shit, it&#39;s not a conspiracy. Only reason weird things like aliens, cryptids, psychics, etc., are connected to this community is because of the idea that there are cover-ups related to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the two years leading up to Trump&#39;s election, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was gunning for him, hard... if only to keep Hillary out.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know a single &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; in real life that voted for Hillary. A few voted for Stein. No one voted Libertarian. A couple Bernie boys, and a lot of Trumpies. My brother is in this sub. He voted for Obama, and then after reading <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for a couple years... voted for Trump... to beat Hillary.</p>

<p>Very few people here like Trump. He&#39;s a hawk. He&#39;s a bombast. He&#39;s 75.19% better than Hillary, and that&#39;s why we stumped for him on this sub. It seems strange anyone who was on this sub would doubt this fact. When T_D got shut down for a day, we invited them here.</p>

<p>The change in tone around here is obviously manufactured.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was wondering why you were being so salty, so I took a look at your history. I didn&#39;t quite find what I was looking for, but I found this interesting thread: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7xrtn7/question_has_the_usefulness_of_reddit_to_act_as/duamd6y/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7xrtn7/question_has_the_usefulness_of_reddit_to_act_as/duamd6y/</a></p>

<p>The top level comment there says &quot;Nothubg3 but a bunch of hateful, uneducated, closed minded bullies here&quot; and you responded by repeatedly trolling this person. I&#39;d say you were right to &quot;call bullshit on that one&quot;, but look at the tone your comments took as you kept it up going back and forth with nothing of value from anyone being said. Pithy insults and a clear effort to rope that other idiot in to a stupid argument. What were you hoping to accomplish by feeding that troll with your own troll bullshit? Do you think anyone wants to read a conversation where one troll trolls another troll? </p>

<p>Furthermore, the person you replied to was broadly insulting the entire community. That&#39;s dumb and it&#39;s appropriate to call out people who would do that. You said that was &quot;bullshit&quot;, but then you turn around and make a self-post here broadly insulting the entire community. Are you aware of what you are doing? You&#39;re partaking in the same kind of behavior here that you were trolling that other user over. What were you hoping to accomplish with this post? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate to bring it up, but there are shills who are here specifically to forum slide, provide disinfi or ridicule.  It was a strategy that Cass Sunstein proposed the US government should infiltrate conspiracy communities to mess with them.  That was 10 years ago and I tend to believe It&#39;s still in operations today.  With that said, there&#39;s also just users who are real who just want to get their rocks off and fuck with people.  Just keep doing you and call out the BS or ignore it, but it&#39;s nothing new in this community and it&#39;s far from dead imo.</p>
