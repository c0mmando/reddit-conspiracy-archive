       I come from a small island in the Caribbean. The US supported a guy who ended up being a dictator for 30 years, directly and by proxy through his family. The CIA then aided the locals in plotting, financing and arming for his assassination. The ensuing elections got a guy elected that had a “for the people” type campaign (early 60s, height of the Cold War), he was, of course, deemed by the US to be too dangerously close to communist rhetoric and had a US military intervention (it was really an invasion). Most of the people wanted that guy in power, the US did not. After they successfully completed the coupe, they helped “monitor” new elections and guess who won? The young right hand of the first guy that stayed for 30 years and they helped assassinate. This new guy ruled in a similar way, having a secret police torture and kill critics and especially scholars and journalists. He ruled for another 16 years or so and favored the US with imports and exports, basically “yes sir”ing everything they said.

       This naturally goes both ways. If people don't give a fuck that Russia involved themselves in our election then you shouldn't care if we do.  It's not like the US is gonna sit here and say "well we've fucked around in other people's stuff so it's just fine if anybody wants to fuck with us."

       Fake Russia collusion? Why did Trump hire a bunch of criminals working for Russia? Because he's a retard? Is that that argument then? And the DNC Bernie thing is an entirely different issue. Wasn't illegal at all just a super lame thing to do.

       It's just a case that any governemnt that has the resources is going to spy on and attempt to influence any other country.

      <p>
       I'm disgusted, to be honest, by all the fake naivety of the crowd running around crying and moaning about 'Russia was trying to interfere in our election!'
      </p>
      <p>
       As if they haven't tried to influence every single election we've had since world war II and probably before.  And yes, as if the good ol cowboys from the Ewue ess aye haven't plunged numerous countries into actual civil way to further very dubious goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the goddamned Russians tried to influence our elections.  Them and every other country that has the means to try it.

       Just curious, of Pakistan did the same thing for Hillary, you'd say that was fine? Let's say Pakistan hacked Trumps emails and set up troll farms to push bullshit about Trump online and try to hack into our voter data bases. Then Hillary ends up winning. The country says woah, we shouldn't let Pakistan influence our election process. You'd be sitting here defending them?

       Lets get back to Russian Dossiers.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if Trump had been the outgoing president in control of the justice department at the time and really wanted Pence to win the presidential election...he could have gotten warrants to spy on the Democrat Candidate's campaign by lying to the Judges inthe secret court and presenting false evidence that he purchased from let's say...Hmmmm...North Korea maybe?

       So I guess you'll completely ignore what I asked you. Obama didn't get warrants to spy on Carter Page. The FBI decided to renew a warrant on Carter Page because Trump stacked his campaign full of criminals working on behalf of Russian interests. What false evidence? Absolutely nothing in that dossier has been proven false. Not one part.

       But see to me, Russian Dossiers are just fascinating.  Just like to you unproven allegations of russians hacking the DNC (must have been them that kills Seth Rich too) is endlessly fascinating to you.

      <p>
       And as I'm sure you know, it's nearly impossible to prove something didn't happen.  But we know a lot of things about Russian dossiers and how they were obtained and what was done with them.

       It's a fact that the Russians were pushing for Trump during the election. Trump knows that too. And all of the heads of every department that he appointed know the russians hacked the DNC. They only people who don't are Trump supporters for some reason.

       I googled it.  Saw that some say yes others say no.  then a bunch of 'well we think it's likely...' but they can't name a single person that did anything but share stories from main stream media outlets.

       The director of the CIA actually met with an official who was investigating the matter and claims it was an inside job.  Glad he isn't as dismissive as you are!

       Best thing you and I can do is not to get our panties in a wad.  Just let things play out and see what happens.  In the end the real story is going to come out but it isn't going to happen anytime soon.

       What I don't get is why you're so concerned with this meddling in the form of memes and facebook ads.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever heard of Israel? It's this illegal country overseas. It more or less owns your political machine. Would you be interested in a special counsel to investigate that too?
      </p>
      <p>
       All this Russia-fad is doing is showing that political meddling happens between nations all the time (and the US is one of the worst). If anyone was actually concerned about the foreign undermining of American democracy, they'd actually be calling for investigations of all politicians' ties to all foreign nationals and governments, this includes dual citizenship politicos.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's not worry about that. "TV said hate trump and Russia and they are the same thing so I hate that thing."

      <p>
       It's not a fad.  It's a militarized LARP attack with bots and people from Russia that is 24/7 now.

       “The bots focus on anything that is divisive for Americans. Almost systematically.”
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the most divisive issues in the nation is how to handle guns, pitting Second Amendment advocates against proponents of gun control. And the messages from these automated accounts, or bots, were designed to widen the divide and make compromise even more difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any news event — no matter how tragic — has become fodder to spread inflammatory messages in what is believed to be a far-reaching Russian disinformation campaign. The disinformation comes in various forms: conspiracy videos on YouTube, fake interest groups on Facebook, and armies of bot accounts that can hijack a topic or discussion on Twitter.

       Ok.

      <p>
       First, if the educational state of the American People is such that they can be brainwashed by a low-energy ad campaign, then Russia isn't the problem here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, what about all the other countries doing the same thing to you? Gonna invade Israel? China? Or is it just Russia, because it's all over the news (like a campaign of information, that may be disingenuous), and that the TV keeps telling you that you want to go to war with them filthy commie Reds?

       Declaring Russia's apparent actions as a war crime is ridiculous. Comparing it to
       <em>
        any actual attack
