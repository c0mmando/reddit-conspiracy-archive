<p>I&#39;m calling out to the lurkers here. We need you. We are being out gunned on our own sub. </p>

<p>We are seeing non stop official narrative pushers upvoted very high while anyone challenging their flimsy assertions are downvoted out of sight.</p>

I&#39;ve had a discussion with <a href="/u/joeybulgaria">/u/joeybulgaria</a> and at least he/she seems to at least have some actual leftist ideals but if all you saw was comments on here you would think you were all part of a group.  Just because y&#39;all believe in the Trump/Russia narrative so hard does not necessarily mean that is reality and everyone that says otherwise is wrong.  Also be weary of the CIA being the good guys.  Don&#39;t be quick to let the MSM dictate your reality and what you should believe as if you take a break from it for a while you go back and you will see it is clearly presented in a way meant to manipulate you into feeling a certain way about it. Memos aren&#39;t the only propaganda pieces with material omissions of fact like that Russia is only a single player in the public manipulation game yet they would have us believing they are the only entity doing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are obviously a bunch of folks that think any Trump Russia connection is complete nonsense and anyone who believes in the theory is a sheep. I don&#39;t assume they are part of some group. For me, I think it&#39;s possibly the juiciest real conspiracy going on right now. It&#39;s possible that a foreign adversary has our president by the balls. We are watching it unfold right in front of our eyes. indictments left and right. An on going FBI investigation that involves sex, money laundering and possible collusion to get elected. </p>

<p>This shit is juicy as hell. I think it&#39;s dumb for people to keep pretending I&#39;m the idiot for following this theory. It&#39;s one of the only current ones that we discuss here that has produced multiple criminal indictments. And I&#39;m the idiot? When many other people are discussing shit that hasn&#39;t produced anything of substance at all. It&#39;s also the only theory that dozens of people aggressively try to shut down every single day. So I&#39;ll keep following it until the end. And it&#39;s fine if people want to complain about it non stop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like the sitcom of conspiracy theories honestly and has been fp discussion for over a year with really no indictments that have anything to do with collusion itself.  Like you realize the indictments that have happened have nothing to do with collusion right?  They&#39;re also not special crimes that people aren&#39;t convicted of every day.  The only way I think this conspiracy would be juicy/significant at all is if Trump really was a Putin puppet which I find to be pretty far fetched.  So personally I just have to roll my eyes when people are screaming about it everyday and claiming any other subject to be a distraction.  Also why does Reddit have such a hard on for sanctions against Russia. As if that would be an effective deterrence.  The whole situation just doesn&#39;t taste right.  How rabid this has some people when even in a worst case scenario it is nothing even close to 9/11 has me doubting.  Calling it the biggest conspiracy ever if pretty fucking ridiculous I think.  Yeah we charged 13 Russians for fraud or whatever.  Whoop-de-doo.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just reddit that wants sanctions on Russia. Our entire Congress voted overwhelmingly for new sanctions in response to them fucking with us. It&#39;s fine if you think the criminal indictments don&#39;t matter. A lot of people think they do matter. Why was Trumps whole cabinet lying to the FBI about their Russian connections?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at all these other theories that aren&#39;t ridiculed the same way the Russia stuff is</p>

<p>Pizzagate - 0 arrests, 0 indictments. </p>

<p>Clinton Foundation - 0 arrests, 0 indictments </p>

<p>Clinton murdering 100 people over the years - 0 evidence, 0 indictments </p>

<p>Seth Rich - nothing, no arrests </p>

<p>Russia Trump connection - 4 criminal indictments + 13 indictments for Russian trolls working on Trumps behalf</p>

<p>For fuck sake. Why is this the only theory that makes you a sheep if you think there&#39;s something to it? It&#39;s literally one of the only theories that we talk about around here that has produced real results. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey I don&#39;t think you are a sheep.  I support others having their own beliefs.  I just get frustrated when others feel the need to force their beliefs on me as if it is proven fact.  And really arrests don&#39;t mean shit to me as proving the legitimacy of a conspiracy.  I&#39;m not denying &quot;Russians&quot; influenced our election I just don&#39;t think it is anywhere near as significant of an impact as some are led to believe.  No one has been arrested for 9/11 either.  When people are really good at evil shit they <em>know how to get away with it.</em>  Just because someone effectively covered their tracks doesn&#39;t mean there is nothing there.  That is why I&#39;m not worried about this Trump/Russia narrative.  The FBI is fucking on it.  If Trump actually is guilty he WILL go down for it.  Now like the other conspiracy theories you mentioned NO ON is on it.  No one is looking and if they are guilty we will never see justice.  This is the kind of shit that worries me more than things we have a special counsel taking care of already.  People who are one with the shadows and no strangers to awful atrocities who most likely won&#39;t get caught where our attention to detail might actually make a difference, that&#39;s what I see as a real conspiracy.  Every conspiracy you listed zero arrests meets this criteria.  If there was a special counsel looking into the Seth Rich murder that would make me very happy.  Sadly his family will never see justice.  </p>

<p>Then we have Trump/Russia where worst case scenario Trump made a deal with some Russians for legitimate dirt on Clinton.  This is completely insignificant compared to the other conspiracies you listed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your logic is backwards. The reason posts get a bunch of upvotes and then have what you call &quot;narrative pushers&quot; being upvoted in the comments would presumably be because people actually reading the article and being able to discuss it are finding the OPs to be misleading.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just with regards to shareblue and the political issues we deal with here, Reddit admins have been complicit in allowing brigading and other site-wide rule violations for a long time. For example, a user named demmian is a mod of basically every major feminist subreddit. He likes to ban feminists for posting feminist things that he disagrees with. It&#39;s a widely documented phenomena, the admins are obviously aware, but check his user page and you&#39;ll find that he&#39;s still a mod. There is an article published by Buzzfeed about this person, it came out six years ago in 2012, and he&#39;s still a mod of every major feminist subreddit. </p>

I’m just simply trying to say that, and really I should’ve been more clear, just cause some people downvote or disagree doesn’t make them a “shill” or a narrative pusher or an operative.

<p>I comment in here (DOES NOT EQUAL) Interest in conspiracies.</p>

<p>Your interest is berating others who DO have a genuine interest in conspiracies.</p>

<p>I just scrolled through your comment history. What a mess.</p>

<p>Do us all a favour and stop equating commenting here with anything other than what it is - trolling.</p>
