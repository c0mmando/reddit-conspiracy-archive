       Why do we as a subreddit allow brigading? Why do we allow very well received (and upvoted) posts to be run into the ground by outsiders or by operatives? Why do we have posts that are 85 percent upvotes yet all the comments inside are official narrative pushers???
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm calling out to the lurkers here. We need you. We are being out gunned on our own sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are seeing non stop official narrative pushers upvoted very high while anyone challenging their flimsy assertions are downvoted out of sight.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've always had this to some degree but the upvote/downvote counts are getting ridiculous at this point.

      <p>
       Why are the users of this sub allowing it to happen?

       Of course it is.  Every day someone posts this same nonsense, convinced that
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       are the only one who can see clearly, it's their job to educate the rest of us, and everyone who disagrees is a shill or some kind of operative.  Nothing ever gets downvoted without a conspiracy.

       and at least he/she seems to at least have some actual leftist ideals but if all you saw was comments on here you would think you were all part of a group.  Just because y'all believe in the Trump/Russia narrative so hard does not necessarily mean that is reality and everyone that says otherwise is wrong.  Also be weary of the CIA being the good guys.  Don't be quick to let the MSM dictate your reality and what you should believe as if you take a break from it for a while you go back and you will see it is clearly presented in a way meant to manipulate you into feeling a certain way about it. Memos aren't the only propaganda pieces with material omissions of fact like that Russia is only a single player in the public manipulation game yet they would have us believing they are the only entity doing it.

       There are obviously a bunch of folks that think any Trump Russia connection is complete nonsense and anyone who believes in the theory is a sheep. I don't assume they are part of some group. For me, I think it's possibly the juiciest real conspiracy going on right now. It's possible that a foreign adversary has our president by the balls. We are watching it unfold right in front of our eyes. indictments left and right. An on going FBI investigation that involves sex, money laundering and possible collusion to get elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       This shit is juicy as hell. I think it's dumb for people to keep pretending I'm the idiot for following this theory. It's one of the only current ones that we discuss here that has produced multiple criminal indictments. And I'm the idiot? When many other people are discussing shit that hasn't produced anything of substance at all. It's also the only theory that dozens of people aggressively try to shut down every single day. So I'll keep following it until the end. And it's fine if people want to complain about it non stop.

       It's like the sitcom of conspiracy theories honestly and has been fp discussion for over a year with really no indictments that have anything to do with collusion itself.  Like you realize the indictments that have happened have nothing to do with collusion right?  They're also not special crimes that people aren't convicted of every day.  The only way I think this conspiracy would be juicy/significant at all is if Trump really was a Putin puppet which I find to be pretty far fetched.  So personally I just have to roll my eyes when people are screaming about it everyday and claiming any other subject to be a distraction.  Also why does Reddit have such a hard on for sanctions against Russia. As if that would be an effective deterrence.  The whole situation just doesn't taste right.  How rabid this has some people when even in a worst case scenario it is nothing even close to 9/11 has me doubting.  Calling it the biggest conspiracy ever if pretty fucking ridiculous I think.  Yeah we charged 13 Russians for fraud or whatever.  Whoop-de-doo.

       It's not just reddit that wants sanctions on Russia. Our entire Congress voted overwhelmingly for new sanctions in response to them fucking with us. It's fine if you think the criminal indictments don't matter. A lot of people think they do matter. Why was Trumps whole cabinet lying to the FBI about their Russian connections?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's take a look at all these other theories that aren't ridiculed the same way the Russia stuff is
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate - 0 arrests, 0 indictments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton Foundation - 0 arrests, 0 indictments
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton murdering 100 people over the years - 0 evidence, 0 indictments
      </p>
      <p>
       Seth Rich - nothing, no arrests
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia Trump connection - 4 criminal indictments + 13 indictments for Russian trolls working on Trumps behalf
      </p>
      <p>
       For fuck sake. Why is this the only theory that makes you a sheep if you think there's something to it? It's literally one of the only theories that we talk about around here that has produced real results.

       Hey I don't think you are a sheep.  I support others having their own beliefs.  I just get frustrated when others feel the need to force their beliefs on me as if it is proven fact.  And really arrests don't mean shit to me as proving the legitimacy of a conspiracy.  I'm not denying "Russians" influenced our election I just don't think it is anywhere near as significant of an impact as some are led to believe.  No one has been arrested for 9/11 either.  When people are really good at evil shit they
       <em>
        know how to get away with it.
       </em>
       Just because someone effectively covered their tracks doesn't mean there is nothing there.  That is why I'm not worried about this Trump/Russia narrative.  The FBI is fucking on it.  If Trump actually is guilty he WILL go down for it.  Now like the other conspiracy theories you mentioned NO ON is on it.  No one is looking and if they are guilty we will never see justice.  This is the kind of shit that worries me more than things we have a special counsel taking care of already.  People who are one with the shadows and no strangers to awful atrocities who most likely won't get caught where our attention to detail might actually make a difference, that's what I see as a real conspiracy.  Every conspiracy you listed zero arrests meets this criteria.  If there was a special counsel looking into the Seth Rich murder that would make me very happy.  Sadly his family will never see justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we have Trump/Russia where worst case scenario Trump made a deal with some Russians for legitimate dirt on Clinton.  This is completely insignificant compared to the other conspiracies you listed.

       The brigading is never going to stop. Conspiracy theorists are prime targets. Just look at the constant deluge of headlines insulting conspiracies, calling them a problem on social media, etc.

       It's not that all the theories here are true, it's the ability to continually entertain every event's alternative that is the problem,

       They always lock people they disagree with at -1, for the sole purpose of kicking off the dogpile. It is surreal that more users cannot fathom the amount of votes on a comment, matching completely with at least 75 votes on it locking it at negative 1, whilst the other user is bolstered by 20-30 EVERY SINGLE TIME.

       Ain't no way to stop it, really. Can't 'out gun' bought votes, and kicking up a big fuss just plays into the strategy of tension, gets them closer to the goal: uninhabitable sub -&gt; admin intervention -&gt; Taco Bell™ presents r/conspiracy

       All there is to do is chill, really. Speak your mind, ignore the vote numbers, don't let anyone wind you up.

       Yes, this is huge. Eventually, only genuine users will be talking to each other. Of course that doesn't mean you should just block anyone you disagree with, but there are many obvious shills who never contribute anything to the sub, and we're all better off if we all just block them.

       There are valid times to block another user, and having a difference of opinion isn’t really one of them. Some people refuse to acknowledge anything you say and will continue replying with a repeat of the same statement, continuously.

       Your logic is backwards. The reason posts get a bunch of upvotes and then have what you call "narrative pushers" being upvoted in the comments would presumably be because people actually reading the article and being able to discuss it are finding the OPs to be misleading. Whereas the narrative pushers upvote and move on. That would seem more likely to me at least.

       Your own post is alleging the 'skeptics' are the ones making posts and talking in the threads whereas people who are upvoting are not posting. I would consider people discussing the subject in the thread and explaining their reasoning to be as much conspiracy users as anyone. You're the one defining people who who upvote and move on 'as actual conspiracy users.' If discussion of a theory you believe in or questioning it makes you uncomfortable consider why.

       This is a lie. I can't imagine how a member of this community could even come to that completely erroneous conclusion. We might see a topic titled "Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal", have it be massively upvoted by the community who proactively hates the Clinton Foundation's corruption, and then have all the top comments be users with histories in r/politics saying "This is a nothingburger" and trolling anyone who would honestly discuss the real facts of the conspiracy. Regulars in this community hate corruption, and we don't defend it, especially when it comes from the Clintons, but that's exactly what is frequently upvoted in brigaded threads.

       The issue with your premise is you assume you're 100% correctwithout any room for consideration. You sound like you want everyone to upvote your theoretical title because they should 'know' Clinton is bad and agree with the op unless they're a shill. Many people would disagree with your premise and then they being labelled a shill kind of makes it hard for the discussion to move from there.

       Same thing happened to r/politics but it was more of a full-scale attack. I used to post there and have good back and forth, respectful debates with people without getting downvoted in the double digits, and often getting upvoted even when I went against the narrative.

       That all changed very quickly, they took that place over hard. Now its mostly just shills and bots and the rest are just very naive, easily manipulated people.

       It's not just with regards to shareblue and the political issues we deal with here, Reddit admins have been complicit in allowing brigading and other site-wide rule violations for a long time. For example, a user named demmian is a mod of basically every major feminist subreddit. He likes to ban feminists for posting feminist things that he disagrees with. It's a widely documented phenomena, the admins are obviously aware, but check his user page and you'll find that he's still a mod. There is an article published by Buzzfeed about this person, it came out six years ago in 2012, and he's still a mod of every major feminist subreddit.

       No Rules, so I just type whatever makes for the most comfortable typing.  It has only been the last three years that anyone has commented on it.  And since I have been typing person to person since 1988 having this brought up around 2015 is weird.

       Is it in any way possible that people have discovered this sub, that don’t believe in your conspiracy theories, that have come here for discourse/entertainment/laughing at these ridiculous theories? Like me? And maybe we believe the “official narrative” because we simply find it to be the most logical and fact based? And we are not paid operatives but just normal people that don’t think that LITERALLY ANYTHING BAD IS THA DEEP STATE TRYING TO LIE TO ME TO TAKE MUH GUNS OR FREEDUM? Is that possible?

       As was the FIRST (aka: at least when I typed it, most important in my eyes) point I made...discourse. Can I not be contrarian and engaged in discourse while still being entertained and laughing? I enjoy this sub, literally discovered it like yesterday. I read it for the entertainment, and occasionally offer my dissenting viewpoints (admittedly with a heavy dose of snarky-ness). I’m just simply trying to say that, and really I should’ve been more clear, just cause some people downvote or disagree doesn’t make them a “shill” or a narrative pusher or an operative. It’s possible some of us genuinely disagree in the same way that you guys aren’t crazy. You simply believe these conspiracies you put forward to be true, I simply believe most are not.

       As I said, I come here for the discourse first. If I laugh along the way is that not allowed? And as I feel I made clear in my previous comment, calling you guys crazy is as useless as you calling me crazy. We have our own beliefs. I never called you crazy, what I SAID was that calling you crazy is just as ‘wrong’ as calling non-conspiracy believers “operatives” or “narrative pushers”. If you disagree, feel free to report me as a troll. But I feel I engage in civil discourse on this sub and if laughing (btw, had I never used the word laughing you would have never known) behind my computer/phone screen is a ban-able offense then I’m sure the mods will agree with you. Otherwise stop getting your panties in a bunch over dissenting views
