        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Aldous Huxley published Brave New World in 1931. He also published a much less known book called Brave New World Revisited in 1958.</p>

<p>Its free to read the whole thing online, and it is quite short. I can&#39;t help thinking of the section I have quoted below with all this talk of mental illness. Keep in mind how long ago Dr. Erich Fromm said these things and and Huxley wrote on them. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.huxley.net/bnw-revisited/">https://www.huxley.net/bnw-revisited/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Our contemporary Western society, in spite of its material, intellectual and political progress, is in­creasingly less conducive to mental health, and tends to undermine the inner security, happiness, reason and the capacity for love in the individual; it tends to turn him into an automaton who pays for his human failure with increasing mental sickness, and with despair hidden under a frantic drive for work and so-called pleasure.</p>

<p>Our &quot;increasing mental sickness&quot; may find expres­sion in neurotic symptoms. These symptoms are con­spicuous and extremely distressing. But &quot;let us beware,&quot; says Dr. Fromm, &quot;of defining mental hygiene as the prevention of symptoms. Symptoms as such are not our enemy, but our friend; where there are symp­toms there is conflict, and conflict always indicates that the forces of life which strive for integration and happiness are still fighting.&quot; The really hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. &quot;Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been si­lenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does.&quot; They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their per­fect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted, still cherish &quot;the illusion of indi­viduality,&quot; but in fact they have been to a great extent deindividualized. Their conformity is developing into something like uniformity. But &quot;uniformity and free­dom are incompatible. Uniformity and mental health are incompatible too. . . . Man is not made to be an automaton, and if he becomes one, the basis for mental health is destroyed&quot;.</p>

<p>Basically, intelligent people have been expressing the view that our society is sick for centuries, that if you&#39;re comfortable being livestock and well acclimated to a corrupt and broken society, it is <em>you</em> who are damaged goods.</p>

<p>People who are actually still <em>human</em> show symptoms of maladjustment to living in such a society as the one described by Huxley, and sadly Huxley&#39;s dystopia is all but realized in the world today. </p>

<p>School is no longer for learning and people are dependent on &quot;Soma&quot; to cope with living in a way that humans were never intended or equipped to live. People no longer live as people should. It is disturbing, distressing and goes against the very best of what makes us human beings.</p>

<p>There probably arent a lot of &quot;well adjusted&quot; sheeple normies on this sub to trigger with this post, but hopefully this post will give you strength if you are suffering in this damaged and morally bankrupt world. Reading Dr. Erich Fromm and  Huxley&#39;s words gave me some measure of comfort from the realization that, throughout history, there have been others like me who see what is wrong with the world and how to be considered &quot;normal&quot; nowadays, one must forfeit that which makes them human.</p>

<p>The great conspiracy here is one to keep slavery alive and well. To turn people into livestock or robots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like a goose. Not sure about the picture but thanks for the post. I have worked for a mental health institution for about 12 years and whenever I finally get down to the nuts and bolts of the world with my patients I find the nuts and bolts to be to just live by the golden rule. It might not get you far in this depressed world but at least it’s easier to get rest when you need it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is hilarious logic. The people who don&#39;t go to school, don&#39;t get good jobs, and don&#39;t feel properly adjusted to modern society are the &quot;true&quot; humans? The ones who couldn&#39;t do what makes humans one of the best apex predators that ever existed, adapt, are really living like humans? People who are happy with life are wrong and should feel sad about the way things are because you do? No, people achieve things in life because they adapt and overcome, not sit at home making conspiracy theories about why people are happy and you are not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So true. Read Huxley in my teens and even befriended Huxley&#39;s grandson, Pierre, when I was 20 and Huxley&#39;s son-in-law visited me in France.</p>

<p>They were really living up to Aldous&#39; standards, in a beautiful ranch in the middle of the forest in Pennsylvania, with huge colourful paintings on the wooden buildings, peacocks and sheep walking around, and a 4-meter pond in the middle with a rowboat on it.
They told me, go there for a nap after lunch, close your eyes and imagine that you are in the middle of a huge, quiet lake.</p>

<p>It worked and it blew my mind: I was really at peace and slept like a baby.</p>

<p>To get back to the subject, I later took my best friend out of depression by explaining him that he was such an exceptional, high potential person that he was suffering from inadaptation with this sick society. It made him feel better, and later he married a friend of mine, former model and army lieutenant. They have 3 beautiful boys and run a family organic farm.
For myself I have relocated to a small coastal, catholic south-east asian community, as far away from the psychosphere as I can, but still able to enjoy most of our civilization&#39;s benefits.
I sincerely hope that all of this can help some struggling people on this board.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As i was coming down from cocaine the other day i was thinking about my experiences in third world countries, mental illness &amp; the possibility of it being far more prevalent in western society. As somebody who suffers from depression, anxiety, ADHD &amp; probably a bunch of undiagnosed garbage, ive never been a fan of how society works &amp; frustrated by the fact everything seems just out of reach while at the same time we are bombarded by media that makes out like life is this happy go lucky experince where everything is easily obtained with just a bit of knuckling down &amp; &quot;hard work&quot; when in reality thats so far from the truth.</p>

<p>I dunno society is sick &amp; i really do try to just make the best of my situation despite it being so frustrating to see things being run in such a backwards way. </p>

<p>People are being domesticated. It is my belief that the rise in mental health issues is because the human animal was never meant to be domesticated and people are lashing out in response to it (unconsciously most of the time). Just my two cents.</p>

<p>Real tired of mentally broken boomers telling me that I need help, while in reality projecting their own inner turmoil. The topics I cover here on reddit, rattle some people so much that they dive into the warm embrace of &quot;you&#39;re crazy&quot; and &quot;make it go away&quot;, because they cannot begin to wrap their feeble minds around an alternate explanation.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been calling normal the &quot;other 6-letter N word&quot;, as I feel it <em>should</em> be that offensive to people.</p>
