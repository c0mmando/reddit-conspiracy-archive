    <div class="md"><p>True, and I think that&#39;s definitely important. </p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t fall for all the blame don&#39;t rely on the applause.&quot; Do it for yourself. I think what I&#39;m getting at is why do people feel the need to expose every part of their life all the time?  Seems like a product of the social media psy op telling us &quot;SHARE EVERY MOMENT WITH EVERYONE... not because we want your data...&quot;.  Like the movie The Circle, what&#39;s the point of all of that/lack of privacy.  What do we get vs what do we lose when we make choices like that?</p>

I used to work at a school that had a fully fledged news studio with accompanying production room with all the boards, monitors, and everything else you&#39;d have in a real studio.  just saying. many people don&#39;t realize the level of technology available to many high school students these days.</p>

<p>Never said that. I said that the fact that most shootings get followed by evidence showing that those are kinda false flag or whatever made me even more unwilling to believe already existing conspircaies.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t believe it makes sense anylonger. Every time something big happens you guys find a vid somewhere or a pic that is supposed to unearth the truth. Just not buying it.</p>

<p>A guy liking to be in front of a camera for whatever reason is no evidence for anything. ACtually it is more evidence against your implications. Why would they who apparently pull of so much stuff are so stupid to use the guy twice.</p>

<p>That is what I said. Never said what you claim which again shows that folks like you appear not that confident in their positions. Why lie about stuff like that.</p>

<p>CTR is in and of itself a conspiracy theory made up by the far-right wing radicals as an excuse for being heavily downvoted.  CTR employed 20 people.  The chances you even came across one of these 20 people on the entire internet is extremely small.  Yet, somehow the far-right wing radicals used it as an excuse for being downvoted.  You are a tin foil hat wearing nutjob if you think CTR is the problem with you being downvoted by logical people.  Especially when CTR ceased operations in December of 2016.  </p>

<p>CTR is alive is well. Its now called Shareblue </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shareblue Media, formerly known as Blue Nation Review or Shareblue, is an American progressive[3] news website owned by the journalist and political activist David Brock. Shareblue is within a consortium of political groups in Democratic strategist David Brock’s network that will raise a roughly $40 million budget to oppose President Donald Trump&#39;s policies.[4][5] Shareblue&#39;s monthly reach is reported to be 140 million across platforms.[6] In December 2017, Shareblue announced a partnership with SiriusXM Progress.[6]</p>

<p>Shareblue&#39;s website archive.is/EQVNF was registered by their Chief Operating Officer Joshua Nerpel on behalf of True Blue Media LLC <a href="http://archive.is/eGYtL">http://archive.is/eGYtL</a>. True Blue Media LLC is owned by David Brock and was used to purchase Shareblue&#39;s political commentary platform when it was known as Blue Nation Review.

<p><strong>The Holding Company Which Owned Blue Nation Review Retains A 20% Stake In Shareblue, Board Members Include Figures in Australian Mining Industry With Deep Ties To China</strong></p>

<p>Brock purchased an 80% stake in Blue Nation Review from Moko Social Media Ltd., <a href="http://archive.is/XomHw">http://archive.is/XomHw</a> who retained a 20% equity stake <a href="http://archive.is/eGYtL">http://archive.is/eGYtL</a>. Moko Social Media Ltd. is a holding company located in Arlington, VA. Oddly for a social media company <a href="http://archive.is/kUtY7">http://archive.is/kUtY7</a>, Moko Social Media&#39;s Board of Directors <a href="http://archive.is/1xzLd">http://archive.is/1xzLd</a> includes &quot;Non Executive Chairman&quot; by the name of Malcolm Raymond Scott James, an Australian mining project manager. Mr. James serves as Non Executive Finance Director at Eureka Mining PLC archive.is/0jZrV, a mining group located in the City of London. Since 2002, James has also acted as an Executive Director at Tianshan Goldfields Ltd.

Tianshan Goldfields is registered in Australia holding various exploration projects in China archive.is/IIpkM. Its largest asset was the Gold Mountain Project located in the Tian Shan Gold Belt in Xinjiang, China. Gold Mountain (Jinshan), in Mandarin, is a commonly used Chinese nickname historically for the western region of North America, specifically California due to the state&#39;s historic gold rush.</p>

<p>The kids dad is FBI, he&#39;s been interviewed on the news twice in 5 months. The first one was a completely &quot;believable&quot; situation where a lifeguard yelled at his buddy for no reason. Incidents were on opposite sides of the country. A conspiracy theorist could say he&#39;s being groomed to be a professional tragedy actor. Being in two different places where he was clearly filmed doesn&#39;t debunk that conspiracy theory.</p>

You don&#39;t even have to pinpoint &quot;when&quot; just give me something I should be, searching for other than just saying &quot;look at his Twitter&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Well in most cases, to most people, something major happens and we look closely and see what we can see. Now some people are so trigger-happy-paranoid they come up with a CONCLUSION first and THEN go looking for evidence to support it. That&#39;s not how any kind of legitimate investigation takes place, which is why you have submissions like this that prove absolutely nothing. They prove a kid exists who has been on camera before.</p>

<p>What I think is incredible that people would believe that the &quot;deep state&quot; are such masters of deception and managing information YET they would make such a dumb error as hiring some &quot;crisis actor&quot; kid who&#39;s already been on the news about some petty lifeguard confrontation. </p>

<p>Some weird belief that there are open spots to any random young kid to be a &quot;crisis actor&quot; -yet they all manage to keep their mouths shut forever and no one ever blows the lid on it all. And they all accept that in an age of people combing over every video with a critical eye, their faces are allowed to be shared, destroying any chance of them ever acting again.</p>

<p>Sure ask questions. Be critical. But this is not worth a post. It&#39;s a tenuous suggestion. It takes some serious mental gymnastics to be this full-on paranoid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honesty have no idea what to think about a lot of things lately but thinking of the so called &quot;deep state&quot; as unified and on the same page with the same directive is a mistake(think Manhattan Project). The proliferation of the term deep state in recent years is probably by design for the purpose of misrepresentation. So you&#39;ve probably heard of MK Ultra. There are multiple elements to an operation outside of an actual incident. Each element is not aware of the others role and possibly even of their existence. The propagandist who use shootings to influence policy probably don&#39;t know they are connect to the incidents, they just get a directive to exploit, and can run the risk of a few thousand people catching a mockingbird. </p>

<p>Prepare for downvotes. The kid lives in my town (Coral Springs/Parkland), and attends the school. His reddit and twitter are proof that he summer&#39;d there, but people still want to believe there&#39;s something bigger. I love this sub-reddit, but the straw-grasping is absolutely un-real, but I may be a little biased since it&#39;s my town now that has another shooting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion: this is completely unremarkable. It&#39;s barely even a coincidence.If it had turned out that the August 2017 incident had some &#39;gun control&#39; aspect to it, or if the whole thing turned out to be some weird hoax using actors, then that would certainly furrow my brow.</p>

<p>But some kid get involved in an argument on a beach, and someone happens to turn up with a TV camera? Nah, this doesn&#39;t even make the needle flicker on the suspicious-o-scope.</p>

<p>Surprised that no-one has yet noticed the coincidence of the name &quot;Parkland&quot; being shared with the hospital where the mortally-stricken JFK was taken. Of course, <em>Parkland</em> was also the name of that Tom Hanks movie about the JFK assassination, which heavily pushed the &#39;lone gunman&#39; narrative of that murder. Fuel for speculation there!</p>
