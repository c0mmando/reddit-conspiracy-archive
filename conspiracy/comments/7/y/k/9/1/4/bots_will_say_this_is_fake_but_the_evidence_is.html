<p>So lets talk about Billys Pizza Joint,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Exhibit A:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Literally Next door to a <a href="https://imgur.com/a/qj0oO">Masonic Lodge</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Exhibit B:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look at their <a href="https://imgur.com/a/qXaDc">official logo</a></p>

<p>Tell me it doesn&#39;t give you a very odd feeling, greyscale, unappealing, unrelated to Pizza.</p>

<p>Look at this image of from their official site with the logo baby with one eye covered, and smeared with some very unappealing &quot;chocolate mousse&quot; Im sure you are all familiar with this classic occultic symbolism </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/3s9dg">https://imgur.com/a/3s9dg</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Exhibit C:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seemingly child themed Pizza Joint has a special called <a href="https://imgur.com/a/I8ZLr">&quot;tight ass Tuesdays&quot;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Exhibit D:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Menu Item titled <a href="https://imgur.com/a/UQKQ8">&quot;Babi&quot;</a></p>

<p>Babi the Egyptian Baboon god was considered the god of virility of the dead. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babi_(mythology)4">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babi_(mythology)4</a></p>

<p>People are claiming this simply means pork, google it yourself, i found no references to pork and many vulgar references </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Exhibit E:
Look at this exchange on social media</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Customer: Give me your buns!
Billys Pizza: We are working on bringing in a new line of &quot;burgers&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/2S8zL">https://imgur.com/a/2S8zL</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Exhibit F:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Menu Item translated from spanish &quot;Your daughter on a Plate&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/XeVBQ">https://imgur.com/a/XeVBQ</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Exhibit G:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a collection of reviews that show a distintinct pattern of behavior that seems specifically geared to turn away &quot;regular&quot; customers</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/h1cif">https://imgur.com/a/h1cif</a></p>

<p>Exhibit H:</p>

I&#39;m a reasonable person who, as most people, believes in child sex rings and I even subscribe to a bunch of conspiracy theories but you&#39;re literally pulling the same shit that those Illuminati parody clips make fun of people like you for - the one eye thing, Babi, you&#39;re even presenting a fucking 4chan thread as evidence, this just looks like satire.

<p>Honestly all I could think of.</p>

<p>Got a pizza place here that seems like one.  Says they deliver yet has a driver never.  Doesn&#39;t have a help wanted sign.  Food is just there but doesn&#39;t seem like anything special.  Shit pizza in NY feels wrong.</p>

<p>OK maybe I&#39;m basing it on that.  But still it seems weird they can stay open without delivery when I have 4 places that will deliver to me.</p>

<p>You&#39;re joking, right? Have you ever lived in a city? I&#39;ve lived in a number of US cities, and one thing that ties all of the dense ones together (speaking from my North East experience) is the string of crappy pizza places throughout them that don&#39;t give a shit about looking good or marketing. They make money by being low cost (little/no marketing) and just selling to the poor suckers who happen to be near by and it is an easy, cheap place to get something to eat.</p>

<p>There was a pizza place right near where I lived in NYC. It was a run-down, hole in the wall, and the pizza was mediocre, but it was steps from my apartment and it was cheap. I ate there all the time. If the &quot;only way to succeed&quot; was by making to as attractive as possible, then not only would this place have long since gone under, it certainly wouldn&#39;t be a chain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pizza parlor OP is referring to and showing pics of sit&#39;s right next door to a well kept Masonic Temple on a piece of what is undoubtedly a more expensive piece of landscape in a respectable and well kept Australian town, not some run-down inner-city slum/tenement in the rotted-out cores of far too many ageing and disintegrating US cities plagued with crime and violence.</p>

<p>When you have severely depressed land values and high commercial vacancy rates you can probably get a cheap &quot;hole in the wall&quot; where you&#39;re surrounded by poor people that will have other things going on around those &quot;hole in the wall&quot; operations like drug peddling, prostitution, and street crime those places also provide a convenient front for. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what to say about that. It&#39;s &quot;typical&quot; where it&#39;s typical and just as &quot;untypical&quot; and unexpected in other places where you have healthy, economically viable, and well-kept neighbourhoods and communities where there are no &quot;hole in the wall&quot; or greasy spoon type dives to found anywhere.</p>

<p>LOL. Manhattan has some of the most expensive real estate in the world, and these types of pizza places are all over the place there.</p>

<p>None of the places I&#39;ve lived have been &quot;slums,&quot; my wife and I both make well north of 6 figures, and it has been a staple of everywhere I&#39;ve lived <em>except</em> Houston, but that was a driving city and it isn&#39;t a huge pizza city, so it doesn&#39;t surprise me that they are not as common there.</p>

<p>But my main point isn&#39;t that this is one of those pizza places, it is to point out the ridiculous notion that restaurants, especially in cities, have to spare no expense when it comes to image. It&#39;s simply untrue. Even with that said, their image is pretty clean.</p>

<p>I question whether or not you&#39;ve ever spent time in any major city in America, at least in the NE.  Even in the nice areas, little shitty stores that make money by selling a ton of crap have their place, because not everyone who spends time in the rich areas (mostly many of the people who work there) can spend ridiculous sums of money on food/goods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well my disingenuous critic let me simply point out to you that pizza is a 38 billion dollar business in the United States and the top ten national chains account for more than 32 billion dollars worth of that. And there are other national chains besides those, all of which is to say that about 95% of all of the pizza that is bought and consumed in the United States comes from those corporate entities an not any small independents that you still happen to think are so ubiquitous. </p>

<p>They stopped being that decades ago as did the local greasy spoons whose main claim to fame was burgers, fries, and a coke.</p>

<p>And those corporates are all big on the idea of their product looking good and regularly mass mailing pretty circulars and coupons and having them inserted in local papers. Not important to you of course trying to make a petty point. I&#39;m just pointing out to you that it is petty and that there are millions of Americans who&#39;ve only ever seen or eaten a pizza that comes from those corporate sources and that is all they&#39;ve ever known.</p>

So we are still talking about a pretty sizeable market here.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m not talking about the average American, I&#39;m talking about those that exist in dense/walkable cities, which represents a smaller fraction of the population. I even alluded to this when I talked about my experience in Houston.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not denying the existence of the market for heavily marketed pizza, I understand that it exists, you are the one trying to deny that the other market exists because it doesn&#39;t fit the narrative that you want to paint.</p>

<p>I was talking about general public perceptions that you took exception to. It&#39;s not me but rather you that is attempting to deny and downplay the impact that corporate control over the entire fast food industry and the image it steadily reinforces in countless ways as not having the kind of major effect that I simply said it has and they have not only gone to inordinate lengths to paint that appetizing and alluring picture they have commandeered and taken over virtually the entire market because that is the expectation they have created.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not some narrative of mine that&#39;s simply a very obvious and patent reality.</p>

<p>Well, I find it is hard to argue that a currently 14 billion dollar industry is half-way out the door. Also that, in the foreseeable future, there won&#39;t be a market for good pizza. But that&#39;s besides the point. It seems you agree, these places exist, which was my point: we both agree that these types of places currently exist (regardless of how far they are from extinction) and so your initial point that this place must be super mindful of their image because that is the only way to survive, is an extremely weak point.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>LOL. All I did was point out that this idea that you have to carefully craft your image to survive is pure nonsense, at least when it comes to a pizza place in a city. I said nothing about corporate pizza places, you brought them into the discussion.</p>

<p>LOL. This is classic. I get it that presentation is important, but to claim that it is more important than how the food tastes is ridiculous and no chef worth is salt would tell you that.</p>

<p>The reality is that these pizza places exist, you have even admitted it yourself, and they aren&#39;t based on pretty pictures and mass marketing, but cheap and easily accessible food with low overheads. There are many ways to skin a cat, which you don&#39;t seem to understand.</p>

<p>And, besides, it&#39;s not even like this place looks like a dingy pizza place. It looks pretty clean with a crisp image.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why? I really don&#39;t get it.</p>

<p>The evidence:</p>

<ol>
<li>They found a pizza place next to a Masonic Temple.</li>
<li>OMG! A restaurant used a kid in their brand! This makes the restaurant &quot;child themed!&quot;</li>
<li>One of their hundreds of marketing pictures has an eye covered. Spooooooky.</li>
<li>If we approach this with the made up claim that the restaurant is &quot;child themed&quot; and that it is sexual in nature, the double entendre we can make from the alliteration they use for a tuesday special sounds really perverted!</li>
<li>There is a food known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babi_panggang">Babi</a> that contains pork, and this dish has pork. But, hey, it makes more sense to believe that this must be a reference to some Egyptian god with an erection.</li>
<li>They posted a picture of the hamburgers they are about to sell, and someone said &quot;give me your buns&quot; Wow! I&#39;m convinced. Totally a child sex ring.</li>
<li>(Honestly, this is the only one that seems weird to me, but it might be a lack of understanding of Spanish)</li>
<li>I cherry-picked 8 reviews out of 48 to paint the narrative that I want you to see. Big surprise that a mediocre pizza place has some shitty reviews. <em>Obviously</em> trying to turn away customers, despite marketing extensively on both twitter (500+ tweets) and 7 times in the past week on facebook.</li>
</ol>

<p>Seriously, only one piece of evidence in their entire list doesn&#39;t reek of being ridiculously strained, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the only reason I don&#39;t understand it is that there is some colloquialism in Spanish that I don&#39;t know, being an English speaker.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get why a reasonable person, who looks at the evidence objectively, would see anything other than someone cherry-picking information.</p>

I mean, what if this is what OP thinks it is? Why is your go to, knee jerk reaction to ridicule his intelligence and systematically try to discredit everything he pointed out in a bulleted list?

<p>LOL, you&#39;re joking, right?  The OP points to absolutely <em>zero</em> evidence of any type of child sex ring. None. Not one thing. It is, itself, just &quot;wildly assumptive&quot; list of cherry-picked information, misrepresentations, and &quot;coincidences.&quot;  None of my position was &quot;wildly assumptive,&quot; I simply pointed out why each of the claims was a stretch.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you’re trying SO hard to discredit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t have to try hard. The evidence put forth immediately falls apart under even the lightest of scrutiny. Accusations of sexual child abuse are very serious. Even just the accusation itself can absolutely screw someone or their business (see Comet and the guy going in and discharging a gun) and it is scary that people would actually think that the &quot;wildly assumptive&quot; argument put forth by the OP holds any water what-so-ever. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Because I am on the side of reason, rather than combing through information trying to create some narrative. Seriously, the person provides no actual evidence. How can you not see that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Think of the consequences if you’re wrong, and then look in to this with an open mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only position I took was that their argument didn&#39;t hold any water. They could be absolutely right and that this place is a cover for a child sex ring, but if you approach their argument with an objective, open-mind, you see that there is zero substance to the argument.</p>

<p>Yes, of course I did. Did you? Or did you just read their cherry-picked selection of reviews (if you even did that much) and just assume that they were being fair?</p>

<p>I looked at the reviews he screenshotted, and saw that one of them references &quot;Zomato&quot; so I went to the site myself. It took less than a second to google, <a href="https://www.zomato.com/melbourne/billys-pizza-joint-abbotsford/reviews">I&#39;m not sure why they didn&#39;t just link to the review page itself.</a> It&#39;s got north of 3 out of 5 stars, which is why I referred to it as a &quot;mediocre&quot; pizza place and puts it &#39;middle of the road&#39; review wise.</p>

<p>But the most damaging part about this is that it shows a pattern of not wanting &quot;regulars&quot; which I don&#39;t think their screen-shotted reviews even show (not even all of them are negative reviews), but the reality is that this site tweets and posts on facebook a lot. If they are trying to discourage regulars from actually coming there, why are you marketing to them on your facebook page that they have to actively opt into?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read a well-cited blog post by a professor (which I unfortunately cant find atm)</p>

<p>Basically it claims with the extent of Child Sex Trafficking (cited number of missing children, average amount of CP found on pedos&#39; computers and FBI estimates of percent of missing children getting coerced into this industry) </p>

<p>Their should be 10s of thousands if not more children who were abused in an organized fashion by these pedophile rings who are now adults and should be willing to come forward yet the number of actual reports is extremely low despite hard proof that the industry and abuse is there</p>

<p>This means either they are being brainwashed ( not unlikely) or being killed and disposed of (more relevant to your point)</p>

<p>He goes on to show that Human DNA has been found in pork products.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/hot-dog-sausages-contain-human-dna-study-says-and-many-vegetarian-ones-contain-meat-a6710341.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/hot-dog-sausages-contain-human-dna-study-says-and-many-vegetarian-ones-contain-meat-a6710341.html</a></p>

<p>The claim is that it is simple contamination, but if that was the case we would see a similar amount of human DNA in for example ground chicken or ground beef but for some reason we do not.</p>

<p>Getting to the point,</p>

<p>A group of 4 pigs can eat an adult male in a matter of 2 hours bones and all and turn it into fertilizer, no evidence left behind.</p>

<p>Please dont call me anti-semetic but Judaism prohibits the eating of pork products and gives no real reason, </p>

<p>My guess is organized child abuse has been a thing for thousands of years among both the Catholic church and Jewish Faith (of course your average catholic or jew is fine im sure, im talking about the higher up elites within each organization and likely even the lower priesthoods)</p>

<p>And for thousands of years pigs have been the go-to method for disposal of the victims bodies,  therefore human dna gets incorporated into the fat cells of Pigs making it a form of cannibalism which is why these religions banned eating pork and also why human DNA is proven to appear in pork products.</p>

<p>that&#39;s not how that works. like, at all lmao. if your little theory is right (big if) it would basically need to involve undigested human remains being ground up alongside the pork, which, on the part of all of these evil elite pig farmers around the world, would either be extremely lazy (not cleaning pig properly before turning it into sausage) or extremely dumb (since, you know, forensic evidence). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>not sure if you replied to the right thing but if a professor claimed that human DNA would get incorporated into fat cells if eaten by a pig then he was also wrong lol never mind the digestive enzymes specifically in place to break down nucleic acids in the stomach, just the hydrochloric acid alone would cause the chains to break down to the point that you would not be able to identify any piece of it that made it out of the digestive tract into the pig&#39;s own cells as having come from a human. as it turns out having foreign DNA drifting around in your system is a very bad thing</p>

<p>Bruh, that article doesn&#39;t differentiate between the different types of hot dogs and sausages. It even says that some contained pork that weren&#39;t supposed to. You do know that most hot dogs (especially the cheaper ones) in the US are made from chicken and/or beef?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or maybe the picture was faked? The menu pictures for it on Zomoto don&#39;t have that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty easy to Inspect Element the site&#39;s menu and type whatever you want in there: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/w8FX1O7.png">https://i.imgur.com/w8FX1O7.png</a></p>

<p>You can look up the menu on the Internet Archive and it has always been Del Mare:
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/Cwo75c1.png">https://i.imgur.com/Cwo75c1.png</a>
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/6Qp6d81.png">https://i.imgur.com/6Qp6d81.png</a></p>

<p>So either this pedo conspiracy is so deep that they hacked the internet archive and changed the website&#39;s history, or the picture is fake and the OP is most likely BS copied from 4chan with no verification.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is extremely unsettling. I’ve been on the internet for 20 years, half of that on conspiracy boards, reading four chan and whatever and have never accidentally stumbled across nude photos of a child, I am sick to my stomach. The chances of that being an accident seem slim at best. </p>

<p>That by itself is awful, however the implications are menacing indeed. I would hazard a guess that if the links were purposely being changed to dupe or confuse the poster or us, that whomever is able to do that has a lot of power and is either obviously trying to cover up what is happening, or it is most likely some kind of a psyop being performed on op or, you and I. </p>

<p>Either way I am going to be far more wary of what imgur links I click on for now on, and I advise you to do the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I believe there are child sex rings.  Yes, I believe that some of these sex rings involve very powerful people.</p>

<p>That&#39;s probably where we part ways.</p>

<p>You can tie together a net of &#39;sheer coincidences&#39; of anything if you&#39;re  willing to bend the truth or consider more-likely conclusions.</p>

<p>Drawing conclusions like, Babi being an Egyption God with an erection undermines my ability to lend credence to a lot of what you have to say.</p>

<p>Babi means pork in Malay and Indonesian languages.</p>

<p>To bizarrely need to tie this to the Egyptian Baboon God is nonsensical when there&#39;s a much more obvious reason <em>right there in front of you</em>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, what&#39;s the fucking point?  These are powerful people with a lot to lose, why they hell would they use some Australian restaurant for the disposal of human meat?</p>

<p>They would still have to deal with the bones, teeth, hair and organs.</p>

<p>And what happens when someone gets food poisoning?  Are they going to have to disappear someone <em>EVERY</em> time that the place has to be checked out because of food poisoning complaints because the ground chuck from a little raped girl&#39;s body went bad between her murder in some mansion and transport to Australia?</p>

<p>I get angrier as I write this not because I want to defend the animals who are out there, preying on children, but because this type of nonsense de-legitimizes future valid attempts by citizens taking action to investigate.</p>

<p>And what, the fuck, is the fascination with tying it all to restaurants?</p>

<p>The mind boggles why any of the people who are rich and powerful enough to procure a child to rape, torture and kill would need to go through all this cutesy shit to dispose of a body.  It just makes no sense at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Narcisstical Psychopaths,</p>

<p>I understand your point of view 100% I would have agreed with it a year ago,</p>

<p>It isnt any individual restaurant, it isnt even specifically restaurants, it isnt even specifically body disposal.</p>

<p>Its front businesses to launder money for organized pedophilic activities</p>

<p>Restaurants have a lot more wiggle room when it comes to their expenses and profits compared to other businesses.</p>

<p>Im not saying the pizza sauce is made with blood, It may be that  their is no human in any of their food or even in any of the similar locations such as comet.</p>

<p>But  the idea is that these locations are legal front companies operating as covers for illicit human trafficking organizations that are multi-national in nature.</p>

<p>The previous sentence is about as cut and dry as it gets, their ARE horrible criminals operating out of legal businesses to launder their illicit gains regardless if this specific restaurant is one of them (high chance it is) the previous statement is true.</p>

<p>The type of people invovled in these type of operations would be extremely high functioning but extremely mentally unwell.</p>

<p>They would likely be millionaires and cocky that they are able to operate in plain site, and a narciscists in this type of field would likely put little in your face &quot;clues&quot; such as discussed in the OP as it would give them a kind of power high over all the &quot;sheep&quot; who they are able to trick.</p>

<p>Is this just a hunch, or is this a known tactic that’s been used before or something? Or does this all tie back to pizzagate which, while certainly suspicious, has never really been proven as far as I know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding Babi. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>when there&#39;s a much more obvious reason right there in front of you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s exactly why... This kinda shit is often tied to the occult. It&#39;s not really a reach when it&#39;s an alternate definition. Just in the regular old straight sex world hookers commonly use definitions like Greek or Spanish sex, and then some BDSM scenes use alot of Greek and Latin names for particular acts, as well as things like cock worshipping. And that&#39;s straight out of the Sunday paper. It&#39;s not a stretch to imagine this extends further into the darker parts of the sex scene, where historical languages are used as code... It&#39;s easy to write it off such as you have done, and I&#39;m not particularly saying anything nefarious is taking place, it&#39;s just that that&#39;s a perfect example of a double cover, the definition is clear but you explicitly defend it because it&#39;s so obvious, allowing you to chastise anyone that doesn&#39;t agree to that one version of the definition. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>These are powerful people with a lot to lose... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who are powerful people? We don&#39;t know who the owner of the business is, nor do we have any idea who runs actual pedophile rings. You&#39;d&#39;ve been called crazy for thinking the church had a pedophile ring, and you&#39;d be shocked Daves Uncle Jim who keeps to himself has been distributing thousands of illegal photos for years... It&#39;s morally tough to think in the mind of a scumbag, but at the end of the day, it&#39;s a business to some people, and business comes in all shapes and sizes, from Daves uncle Jim, to an entire ring of churches, to the Internet and beyond. In this mind, you could imagine creating a shop front to establish your nefarious activities. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And what, the fuck, is the fascination with tying it all to restaurants?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Historically, restaurants/bars have been utilised as a financial cover up for the accounts of illegal activities. Restaurants are one of the most prolific businesses and can be hidden well from gaining any attention from both the public and agencies and institutions. The tax man doesn&#39;t need to see where every penny goes and comes in, and a health inspector does one check a year so you can keep your business license. A couple of genuine reviews and the ability to detract locals and visitors, keep an unappealing interior etc etc. and you have a &quot;front&quot;. It&#39;s common. Super common. That&#39;s why &quot;the obsession&quot;. Because it&#39;s legitimate.</p>

Masons often incorporate Egyptian mythology into their stuff. If the place is located next to a Masonic lodge and has Masonic imagery on their website, then it&#39;s not a stretch that Babi is a reference to an Egyptian god.</p>

<p>&quot;Human meat has often been referred to as &quot;long-pig&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A diet that may include dare I say? Humans?&quot;</p>

<p>Asked about restaurants as a means of body disposal: &quot;bodies degenerate and feet and stuff can wash up on shores, restaurants like this are likely located world wide catering to local groups or &quot;chapters&quot; of a larger organization&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a million better ways to do that. Don&#39;t be stupid. If this is some elite pedophile ring, you think they need to advertise that they too like to fuck kids? Why make it obvious to possible law enforcement? You think you&#39;re smarter than the police? Why not just the internet like everyone else? Think about this critically and wonder why they&#39;re not using a much easier means of communication. Who are they even advertising to? A possible pedo? Does he just walk in and ask for a special pizza and get taken into a dungeon? You&#39;re a sperglord mate.</p>

<p>Dude, who hear claimed it was fact? Who here actually claimed that they confidently believe this? I have yet to find that comment. No one here is “automatically believing” anything. OP found something (s)he thought was interesting, and shared it with us. Now we’re having a discussion about it. What are you so high-strung about?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you really think the pizza place thing was the first episode of &quot;Pedos in Power?&quot; It&#39;s not the first instance, far from it. Before people were given the pizza meme to rail against there was the Franklin coverup, Jimmy Saville, Woody Allen, Epsteins Lolita express. I don&#39;t follow Aussie culture whatsoever but if I did I could easily point out some powerful pedos without a doubt, and I don&#39;t need a pizza place to string my case together. </p>

<p>Whatever you may think about pizzagate, understand that the abuse of power and pedophilia are rampant all across the world in high-reaching places and it&#39;s far from conspiracy theory. </p>

<p>Long before &quot;pizzagate&quot;, we knew about this stuff. When pizzagate came along, everything on this topic was immediately discredited. Now you are likely to be accused of believing in pizzagate if you bring it up. We have a huge population of people who want more solid information on this topic, so I will provide that here.</p>

<li><p>Kevin Spacey apologizes, comes out as gay to confuse the public after allegation of sexual advance on 14-year-old <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/choose-now-live-gay-man-kevin-spacey-emotional/story?id=50804057">http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/choose-now-live-gay-man-kevin-spacey-emotional/story?id=50804057</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, this is so common in Hollywood that it&#39;s considered &quot;an open secret.&quot; </p>

<p>I highly recommend this documentary <em>An Open Secret</em> (on Pedos in Hollywood with testimony from stars, court cases, etc, 1:40:00): <a href="https://vimeo.com/142444429">https://vimeo.com/142444429</a></p>

<p>Several people are named, but more importantly, it explains why most stars don&#39;t name abusers for years, if ever, because it ruins their chances at a successful career. The documentary calls for people who have been abused to rise up and try to put an end to this. </p>

<p>Also see - &quot;Who Took Johnny&quot; on Netflix. It&#39;s a documentary on pedo rings in the government, child abductions, and the mechanics of coverup. It also goes through the history of child abductions and how the laws have changed over the years since Johnny Gosch was abducted. This is a follow-up doc on Conspiracy of Silence. </p>

<p>Why don&#39;t people speak up about this more often? There are a lot of reasons. Probably the biggest reason was revealed in an article on Harvey Weinstein (not a pedo, but still relevant to this). He used some really shady tactics to silence his accusers. </p>

<ul>
<li>Harvey Weinstein’s Army of Spies. The film executive hired private investigators, including ex-Mossad agents, to track actresses and journalists. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies">https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are also fears of being sued and spending too much money defending yourself in court if the man accused decides to take it to court. </p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Unfortunately California conveniently enough has a statute of limitations that prevents that from happening. Because if I were to go and mention anybody’s name, I would be the one that would be in legal problems and I’m the one that would be sued.&quot; <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/hollywoods-other-open-secret-besides-harvey-weinstein-preying-on-young-boys">https://www.thedailybeast.com/hollywoods-other-open-secret-besides-harvey-weinstein-preying-on-young-boys</a></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Exhibit A: I don&#39;t know why everyone is so concerned about Masons when they can, with no effort whatsoever, become a Mason and infiltrate the organization. You know all you have to do to become a Mason is ask an existing Mason, right? In the instance of the Lodge you&#39;re speaking about, you can <a href="http://join.fmv.org.au/">LITERALLY sign up online.</a></p>

<p>Exhibit B: I don&#39;t see how a child in a logo of a family restaurant raises flags. Honestly, the logo is probably the only thing that tickles my &#39;weird&#39; sense. But there are many restaurants in my town named after the children of their founders. Maybe That picture is a picture of Billy?</p>

<p>Exhibit C: Pretty sure Tight Ass Tuesday is implying that the person who gets this item wants to be lean considering it is a Small pizza. Portion control.</p>

<p>Exhibit D: Babi is Pork. You linked many Wikis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babi_panggang">but didn&#39;t link this one.</a></p>

<p>Exhibit E: actual bread, perhaps the kind that is served in restaurants. The &quot;burgers&quot; in parentheses may mean they are working on non-traditional burgers - chicken, turkey, etc. I also don&#39;t see why, if you&#39;re right, they&#39;d air it out on Social Media.</p>

<p>Exhibit F: As other users pointed out, this is fake unless the all-powerful people at this Pizza Place can alter archive.org</p>

<p>Exhibit G: Ordering food is a pain in the ass. Tonight I ordered from THREE different places because the first one &quot;forgot about my order&quot; and the second one told me it was &quot;on the way&quot; for over 2 hours. This stuff just happens. Maybe they&#39;re just a lousy business.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not asking you to see it the way I see it, I&#39;m asking you to think and ask yourself if these explanations are as plausible as your own.</p>

<p>What I see is a lot of confirmation bias. I think you can make a TON of posts like this with everything from Comedy Clubs to Laundromats. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember a horrible thing that happened just up the road 6 miles. I don&#39;t know much about the family except they were well known and their place was called House of the rising sun. It was discovered they kept a mentally challenged family member in a cave on the property. The saddest part was the Enquirer picked up the story. Got most of the facts right, actually. Then when it came time for motive thats when they boarded the crazy train. They reported that a book on the table indicated they were deep into the occult and Satanic worship. The book shown was an instruction manual for Magic the Gathering. I guess &quot;Family keeps relative chained in cave&quot; wasn&#39;t a shocking enough headline. </p>

<p>Firstly...it is next to a Masonic Hall. So are a lot of other places in the world. It is hardly evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah. I live pretty close to the largest masonic hall I&#39;ve ever seen in my life(the thing looks like a huge church as opposed to the one room crap-fests I usually see them having), and due to my work schedule I&#39;m probably a really weird creepy looking dude from the perspective of my neighbors. Proximity and oddness does not mean guilt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Secondly...the logo is the owner&#39;s kid. Hardly that creepy to name a business after your son and use his picture as the logo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah. I think the worst thing this guy is guilty of is having a fairly bad logo that I assume he made himself. In which case that explains the chocolate mousse thing as being someone without much of a concept of framing or design doing their own work there. Though I don&#39;t think the mousse picture looks terrible, if you couldn&#39;t see at least one of the eyes it would have looked imbalanced to most people.</p>

<p>On the topic of the reviews: when sorting them on google from lowest to highest it appears that quite a few few of the lowest scorers either have only left 1 star reviews on things or reviewed things all over the world(and thus are probably fake).</p>

<p>[erases the restaurant menu blackboard]</p>

<p>Black Dynamite: What else melts in your mouth?</p>

<p>Cream Corn: M&amp;M&#39;s!</p>

<p>Black Dynamite: Exactly. And not in your hands. And who makes M&amp;M&#39;s?</p>

<p>Militant #3: Mars Candy Company make it. Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>Black Dynamite: And Mars is also...</p>

<p>Saheed: The Roman God of War.</p>

<p>Black Dynamite: Who is the Greek God of War?</p>

<p>Militant 2: Ares.</p>

<p>Black Dynamite: Now, you take Mars and spell it backwards, drop the S.</p>

<p>Cream Corn: Ram. That&#39;s right. And ram is the zodialogical sign for Aries. Oh! Now dig. Ares&#39; half-sister is Athena.</p>

<p>Black Dynamite: Now you&#39;re getting it.</p>

<p>Cream Corn: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Athena, Athens.</p>

<p>Saheed: Which is the capital of Greece.</p>

<p>Black Dynamite: And as we all know, zodialogical astronomy was created by the Greeks in...</p>

<p>Cream Corn , Saheed , Militant 2 , Militant #3: 785 B.C.</p>

<p>Militant 2: And 785 is the area code to Topeka. Oh, my God. 785 is the area code to Topeka, Kansas!</p>

<p>Bullhorn , Cream Corn , Saheed , Militant 2 , Militant #3: Code Kansas!</p>

<p>Black Dynamite: Now take that, spell it backwards and drop the S.</p>

<p>Militant #3: Snake doc. Snake doctor, yeah!</p>

<p>Black Dynamite: Yes. And brothers, who is the Greek Demigod of Medicine who believed that snakes&#39; tongues had mystical healing powers?</p>

<p>Cream Corn: Aesculapius, of course. He had a staff with snakes intertwining all around that bitch. They called it Aesculapius&#39; staff. It&#39;s a symbol the medical field uses to this day.</p>

<p>Black Dynamite: Now, what legend involving snakes is in both Greek and Roman mythology? Now, come on. It involves Aesculapius&#39; own father.</p>

<p>Woman at table: Apollo.</p>

<p>Black Dynamite: Yeah. Thanks, lady.</p>

<p>This thread makes me go Wooooooo!</p>

A lot of Australians use reddit and follow the this subbreddit if you cannot tell by reading a lot of the comments. Reddit  is not just Americans as much as you seem to believe. This thread opened my eyes to what I believe maybe a real conspiracy and its not that this place is front for pedofilia. I may make a post about it because it has been playing on my mind since this post came up but I know I will be called a shill and downvoted to oblivion if I do, it also takes less mental gymnastics to believe than the OP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>I&#39;ll try to be brief, here are some things from my research!</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jihad.halabi.12">Jihad Halabi</a> opened <a href="https://abr.business.gov.au/SearchByAbn.aspx?SearchText=38818493753">Billys Pizza and Pasta in 2009</a>.
 Before this it was <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/encore-pizza-abbotsford-2">Encore Pizza</a></p>

<p>Regarding the logo, there is a resemblance between the boy and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208985910706299&amp;amp;set=ecnf.1272634103&amp;amp;type=3&amp;amp;theater">Jihads Son</a>. notice the outward ears. However in light of Pizza gate and the relation to children and pizza, one may consider it odd. (Or he innocently made the logo in the image of his son) </p>

<p>Yes, Jihad is a family man. Moving on.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jihad.halabi.12">Jihads Facebook Wall</a>, you&#39;ll will find a few interesting links.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jihad.halabi.12/posts/10214196461366809?pnref=story">Here he signed a petition relating to child abuse</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jihad.halabi.12/posts/10212786090748425">Here he shared a link about a child going missing</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/familyresearchcouncil/videos/10155073832627442/?hc_ref=ARQHf_D0Gp5VXsoTzDOM7P-z1V6iiazs7-h6Se_Pl8UTHLmFC4MoSHPQA2z35r0n9u8">He also shared a video about human trafficking</a> where he says: &#39;Unbelievable - that this goes on.&#39;</p>

<p>Incriminating? No. However, it seems to add to a list of already strange coincidences. 
 The guy who seems to be running a kind of &#39;pizza-gate&#39; operation, is actively posting about child abuse, missing children and human trafficking? But, is that incriminating? Of cause not, however its interesting. Moving on!</p>

<p>Guess what, Jihad has a (im assuming) brother. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wahid.halabi?fref=pb&amp;amp;hc_location=profile_browser">Wahlid Halabi</a>
 Why does this matter? Well, have a look at these odd reviews he left:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g3331148-d8527452-r299011550-Encore_Pizzeria-Abbotsford_Yarra_Greater_Melbourne_Victoria.html#REVIEWS">His review here is a little odd considering what we have covered thus far</a></p>

<p>Notice how says &#39;Well looked after Pizzas?&#39;, followed by &#39;Gave attention to Children too?&#39; Odd. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/SavedPhotos-g8527452-i146351657-Abbotsford_Yarra_Greater_Melbourne_Victoria.html">Here</a> He  has a photo captioned &#39;Different&#39;. Well, looks like normal Pizza to me.</p>

<p>But, is any of this incriminating? No. But hell, there sure is a lot of weirdness surrounding this place. </p>

<p>Another thing. <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/uv?hl=en&amp;amp;pb=!1s0x6ad642e2ec87295b:0x915df6050c0f0443!2m22!2m2!1i80!2i80!3m1!2i20!16m16!1b1!2m2!1m1!1e1!2m2!1m1!1e3!2m2!1m1!1e5!2m2!1m1!1e4!2m2!1m1!1e6!3m1!7e115!4s/maps/place/billy%27s%2Bpizza%2Band%2Bpasta%2Bmelbourne/@-37.8051905,144.9921963,3a,75y,83.44h,90t/data%3D*213m4*211e1*213m2*211sJJN6DxIqznrn5qFMam635Q*212e0*214m2*213m1*211s0x6ad642e2ec87295b:0x915df6050c0f0443!5sbilly%27s+pizza+and+pasta+melbourne+-+Google+Search&amp;amp;imagekey=!1e2!2sJJN6DxIqznrn5qFMam635Q&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ0afstrLZAhXEbbwKHR1GCT4Qpx8IpQEwCg">Notice here</a>, how you can see a shed unit, the windows barred all the way around. However, there are no bars at all on the front side of the shop. Why? If the windows of the shed need to be barred, why not the other, larger windows too? What is inside? If you look around on google maps, you&#39;ll see there is quite a bit of space also. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a good write up but I think this will ultimately do more harm than good to getting pgate out there. It relies on too many giant leaps to be taken seriously. All you’ve really shown is a shitty pizza place with terrible eye for aesthetics (that logo really is fucking awful looking).  People in the comments have already brought up the names of the menu items. Being beside a Masonic lodge doesn’t really prove anything either. I don’t mean to sound nasty, but this is the kind of stuff that makes people laugh and dismiss pgate entirely. </p>

<p>Unless evidence pops up that is too strong to ignore, stick to the Ben Swann stuff. It’s clear, concise and he doesn’t make any giant leaps. I’ve shown multiple people the Ben Swann Reality Check video, some of them who called pgate a completely ‘debunked’ insane conspiracy, and while they all still don’t believe there’s a child sex ring, they all at the very least believe there is something weird going on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to live only a few streets away from this place in Collingwood, Melbourne (Australia), I used to go to this pizza place all the damn time, it actually made great pizzas and the people who worked there were really nice. Not old, creepy white dudes who I’d suspect of pedophilia. Hard working, asians and Italian or Greeks. The creepy thing about this that I only just realised after seeing this post, was that sometimes on my way home after jumping off of the train at Collingwood station at night, I’d walk past this Masonic lodge, and there’d be a bunch of guys dressed in leather (looked like gay guys) outside the front door. I didn’t think much of it at the time as I would normally be exhausted from work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not sure if you replied to the right thing but if a professor claimed that human DNA would get incorporated into fat cells if eaten by a pig then he was also wrong lol never mind the digestive enzymes specifically in place to break down nucleic acids in the stomach, just the hydrochloric acid alone would cause the chains to break down to the point that you would not be able to identify any piece of it that made it out of the digestive tract into the pig&#39;s own cells as having come from a human. as it turns out having foreign DNA drifting around in your system is a very bad thing</p>
