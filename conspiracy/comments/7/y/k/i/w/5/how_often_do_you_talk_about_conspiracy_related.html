        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Personally I try my best to hang out with as many people as I can when I can. I always go out of my way to get in touch with old friends, classmates I have throughout the semester, or family members. To discuss the many findings and information related to conspiracies I find on this sub or my own diggings. I&#39;ve found that most seem to agree that we are being fed lies and corruption on a daily basis. </p>

<p>However most of the people I talk to work jobs, have kids, never travel, nor seem to have the time to become involved. </p>

<p>So in my life, most agree that something can be done. I have expressed to them, I have a strong urge to run myself and become involved in city politics. I have lots of encouragement from old teachers, family, friends, and parters abroad. </p>

<p>I hope many of you can find the passion and motivation to want to create change. Starting at your city levels. It would be a glorious day to see young people take the initiative to become involved. I hope to see a world where young people can stop caring about the Kims, Sports, Cars, drugs, and sex. And start caring more about their community and its people. </p>

<p>Just wanted to share with you all this cycle of thoughts currently in my head. </p>

<p>STAY MOTIVATED! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems it is you following me around.</p>

<p>But I&#39;ll answer your gatekeeping question:</p>

<p>1 Lost civilizations and ancient tech. I believe ancient structures had a lot to do with extraterrestrial influence.</p>

<p>2 The black markets specifically the drug/sex trade and how &quot;black ops&quot; are actually in control of them and manipulate the market to fund their ever raging wars.</p>

<p>3 The manipulation and control of the populace through controlled social institutions especially religion and politics</p>

<p>4 How all governents have made the majority of their constituents dependent on them and not the other way around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if I hopped to number 4?  The government is supposed to be the people. They are supposed to look out for us. Because they are us. We should have healthcare, we shouldn&#39;t be worried about dying because we don&#39;t have money. Because you know we have a government of the people for the people. Also those unalienable rights &quot;life&quot; &quot;liberty&quot; &quot;pursuit of happiness&quot;. </p>

<p>So if an unalienable right is life. Why is healthcare not free for everyone?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely understand that. I also don&#39;t think we can take the Bill of Rights to the Supreme Court. I&#39;m just confused how this sub turned into loving government(besides the FBI) that&#39;s completely against the common man. I&#39;m not saying Democrats are great. I&#39;m saying Republicans only give a shit about corporations. I&#39;m saying Democrats at least try to push Union shit for workers. Meanwhile you got Republicans pushing right to work bullshit. So kind to allow us to work in your state. It just seems like we&#39;re going backwards (to me) and a lot of people are cheerleading it on. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to start a new party. One with new ideas and I honestly think it&#39;s possible right now. The Republican party is shattered. The Democrats are always shattered. It wouldn&#39;t be easy and just like the other two you have to send a clear message. But I think it&#39;s finally time where the opportunity has risen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honest to god, if you strip party politics away from conversations people are willing to work and compromise with one another. That&#39;s the way to get a third party up and running, using compromise and centrism to push the agenda of the people forward.</p>

<p>I am of the mindset that our government should push legislation to help the middle poor classes and not mega corporations and the ultra rich.</p>

<p>Identity biases and cognitive dissonance are a powerful thing indeed.</p>

<p>If one’s ideas are tied to one’s identity, by questioning the ideas, you’d be questioning one’s identity. Reforming one’s self-image is one of the most difficult things to do, and it gets increasingly difficult with age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was the weirdest phenomenon. We were working on our 2020 plan and had serious infrastructure problems- dealing with growth but also decades of benzene that had leaked into the ground water.</p>

<p>I had a pretty comprehensive plan for a 10% growth rate, working on loosening regs for small agriculture, plans for a few small private colleges to help with our lack of labor force, funding to turn some contaminated spaces into public parks. This guy rolls in with a 0% growth target and literally no plan. Nothing. And won resoundingly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Often and yes. I have learned in the workplace that you can only make real change if you make the decisions. I have a dream/partial delusion that enough people would agree with my idea to cut the pay of congress to less than 100k a year, it should be an honor to serve your people,since it is them who got you there. Also to end the lifetime severance package after being voted out. In my personal opinion we need a complete overhaul of government. Not 1 person currently there should be there next year. We need a people willing to fight for us..an not take bribes for at least 5 years.but seriously it has been Crips vs bloods for to long time for a real change that unites the people let&#39;s end the 2 party system, accept the fact that people are different therefore have different opinions on things, an get a better representation of that in our government. I have rambled enough. Im going to bed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually just explained to my grandfather a few months ago the crip and bloods analogy. He is in his 60&#39;s now and told him something such as &quot;Dems and Reps are just like the crips and the bloods. America says blacks fight each other. Thats exactly what they do in congress. Dems are blue Reps are red&quot; I always thought it was weird that Fox News is blue while CNN is red. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a great analogy an I think it can make someone take an step back an look at the bigger picture.

    <div class="md"><p>fwiw i&#39;m in the petition phase to try to get on the nov ballot as an NPA candidate for my state house district in florida. i need 1200 signatures, so i bought the list of NPAs in my precinct (there are almost 400 of us, we&#39;re second behind dems) and in my three neighbooring precincts closer to the beach (2000 of us, second again, but this time to repubs).</p>

<p>anywho, my hope is that my fellow NPAs will have my back and help me get on the ballot, we&#39;re as big as an actual party, we deserve to be on the ballot. winning the district is prob not going to happen, realistically. there are 120,000 voters in florida district 93.  just to reach all of the 39,000 NPAs just once would cost almost $20,000. sigh. to reach all 120,000 would be about $60,000.</p>

<p>sucks too, because the top two dems are carpet baggers who announced they were running last june before they had even moved to the district (and main one seems to have moved to FL at about the time she organized the women&#39;s march here, which would mean she would be almost exactly at the 2 year minimum residency requirement, seems a little convenient...). and then there is chip lamarca, the repub. he&#39;s been our county commissioner for awhile and has done absolutely nothing, didn&#39;t even help us clear the streets of the debris from irma. three months our streets were covered with debris. it was very disheartening. we were rescued by the boat show (can&#39;t look shabby for the billionaires!).</p>

<p>my district is pretty unique demographically, 86% of us have no kids, 65% are single and live alone, 45% are Xers (35-55), over 50% have at least a bachelors, and most of us rent, in the most rent stressed area in the country (miami/ft lauderdale/palm beach). but of course the &quot;platforms&quot; of the three front runners are schools, families, and small businesses. not even a peep about hurricanes. seems like low hanging fruit to me, but these three are as astute as rocks.</p>

<p>if i was somehow financially able, i&#39;d focus my resources on reaching the NPAs and all of my fellow Xers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your comment was a much needed direction I can learn from. This is big money we are talking about when it comes to reaching larger demographics. I live in California so I can&#39;t imagine what things would be like here. </p>

<p>I never thought about focussing on the NPA&#39;s. That is a great idea and I hope one day you make it towards your goals! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if I hopped to number 4?  The government is supposed to be the people. They are supposed to look out for us. Because they are us. We should have healthcare, we shouldn&#39;t be worried about dying because we don&#39;t have money. Because you know we have a government of the people for the people. Also those unalienable rights &quot;life&quot; &quot;liberty&quot; &quot;pursuit of happiness&quot;. </p>

<p>So if an unalienable right is life. Why is healthcare not free for everyone?</p>
