<p>Bernie was a member of a group. He signed up for their rules - they could do whatever they wanted because he was part of their club. He could have ran as an independent candidate and he wouldn&#39;t have had to comply with DNC rules. He ran as a democrat, and they bent and broke their <em>internal</em> bylaws to make sure he wouldn&#39;t have a chance at their nomination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then maybe the DNC &amp; Clinton should hire the Russians to do their social media next time because from what I&#39;ve seen as the &quot;evidence&quot; of the Russian social media content, they spent very little money in comparison to the billions spent by the Clinton campaign. </p>

<p>Anyone familiar with social media analytics could look at the &quot;evidence&quot; and see how dumb this who Russia influenced the elections argument really is. The content was not exactly &quot;influential&quot; or &quot;viral&quot;. America&#39;s problems didn&#39;t come from some tweets and FB ads (that didn&#39;t even reach that many people and its laughable that they&#39;re considered any type of success, for example these are the &quot;rallies&quot; the Russians! sponsored: <a href="https://twitter.com/axre91a/status/964993064191315968">https://twitter.com/axre91a/status/964993064191315968</a> ).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It used to be run very well by some organization prior to modern day insanity.  There used to be many more debates also.  The DNC is entirely corrupt, and they can&#39;t continue to hide it, especially with a slimeball like Perez.  The CEO just mysteriously stepped down, amid a very busy news day recently also, when not long ago, the entire head staff CEO, CFO COO had to step down due to plotting against Bernie in those wikipedia leaks.  Fuck the DNC.  Leave the party, it&#39;s easy to register as independent. </p>

<p>the Joint Fund-Raising Agreement between the DNC, the Hillary Victory Fund, and Hillary for America.</p>

<p>The agreement—signed by Amy Dacey, the former CEO of the DNC, and Robby Mook with a copy to Marc Elias—specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings.</p>

<p>That may be true — but two Democratic officials tell NPR that Brazile and Perez are referring to two different things. In addition to that joint fundraising agreement the DNC reached with both campaigns, the party and the Clinton campaign struck that separate memorandum of understanding giving the campaign staffing and policy oversight.</p>

<p>That document was signed on Aug. 26, 2015 — before, among other things, Vice President Joe Biden ruled out a run for president.</p>

<p>The DNC has not denied this characterization or timeline</p>

<p>A Democratic official who has reviewed the document pointed out that in addition to the Clinton signoffs Brazile characterized, it included language stating that &quot;nothing in this agreement shall be construed to violate the DNC&#39;s obligation of impartiality and neutrality through the Nominating process&quot; and that &quot;all activities performed under this agreement will be focused exclusively on preparations for the General Election and not the Democratic Primary.&quot;</p>

<p>The agreement also noted that the DNC &quot;may enter into similar agreements with other candidates.&quot; (Read the full memo below.)</p>

<p>Read the full memo, obtained by NPR from a Democratic source:</p>

<p>&quot;This Memorandum is intended to memorialize our agreement regarding the creation and operation of Hillary Victory Fund (Victory Fund), a joint fundraising committee of Hillary for America (HFA) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC).</p>

<p>&quot;HFA is prepared to raise and invest funds into the DNC via the Victory. In return for this financial support, HFA requires the appropriate influence over the financial, strategic, and operational use of these JFA-raised funds.</p>

<p>&quot;Commencing on September 1, 2015 HFA agrees to raise funds for the Victory Fund sufficient to fund the DNC&#39;s data, technology, analytics, research, and communications operations. Specifically, HFA will agree to raise and to instruct the Victory Fund Treasurer, Beth Jones (who is employed by HFA) to transfer from the Victory Fund a minimum of one million and two hundred thousand dollars ($1,200,000.00) to the DNC from its share of the net proceeds under the allocation formula on the first day of every month (beginning October 1, 2015) for these activities (the &quot;Base Amount&quot;). In the event that the Victory Fund is not in possession of adequate net proceeds allocable to the DNC on the first of the month to make such transfer, it shall make the required transfer as soon as adequate funds are available.</p>

<p>&quot;HFA&#39;s obligations under this agreement, and the release of the Base Amounts each month are conditioned on the following:</p>

<p>With respect to the hiring of a DNC Communications Director, the DNC agrees that no later than September 11, 2015 it will hire one of two candidates previously identified as acceptable to HFA.</p>

<p>With respect to the hiring of future DNC senior staff in the communications, technology, and research departments, in the case of vacancy, the DNC will maintain the authority to make the final decision as between candidates acceptable to HFA.</p>

<p>Agreement by the DNC that HFA personnel will be consulted and have joint authority over strategic decisions over the staffing, budget, expenditures, and general election related communications, data, technology, analytics, and research. The DNC will provide HFA advance opportunity to review on-line or mass email, communications that features a particular Democratic primary candidate. This does not include any communications related to primary debates – which will be exclusively controlled by the DNC. The DNC will alert HFA in advance of mailing any direct mail communications that features a particular Democratic primary candidate or his or her signature.</p>

<p>If asked by a State Party, the DNC will encourage the State Party to become a participant in the Victory Fund.</p>

<p>&quot;Once HFA has raised the first $1,200,000 and it has been distributed to the DNC, HFA will be granted complete and seamless access to all research work product and tools (not including any research or tracking the DNC may engage in relating to other Democratic candidates).</p>

<p>&quot;The parties also agree that they will enter into an agreed upon voter file licensing agreement. As consideration for that agreement, HFA will raise an additional $250,000 into the Victory Fund that will be distributed to the DNC no later than March 31, 2016.</p>

<p>&quot;In addition, HFA will also raise funds for the Victory Fund that will distributed to the DNC in excess of the $1,200,000 monthly base amount (Excess Amount). The Excess Amount raised by HFA that is distributed to the DNC will be spent on the DNC&#39;s data, technology, analytics, research, and communications operations as directed by HFA (Special Projects). Although the DNC will remain responsible for the day to day execution of those Special Projects, HFA will determine (in consultation with the DNC) the Special Project&#39;s scope, strategy, staffing, budget, and manner of execution.</p>

<p>&quot;Finally, HFA agrees that on a monthly basis the Victory Fund will provide the DNC a list of receipts and disbursements from the Victory Fund. The DNC agrees to provide monthly financial reports to HFA as it relates to the use of the funds distributed by the Victory Fund to the DNC.</p>

<p>&quot;In the event that there is a disagreement in the operation of this agreement or the use of the Base Amount, the DNC department head and their HFA counterpart will meet and confer to resolve the matter. If that fails to resolve the disagreement, then you and I will resolve it. If there is still no resolution the DNC Chair and the HFA Chair will resolve.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to violate the DNC&#39;s obligation of impartiality and neutrality through the Nominating process. All activities performed under this agreement will be focused exclusively on preparations for the General Election and not the Democratic Primary. Further we understand you may enter into similar agreements with other candidates.</p>

<p>&quot;The attached Joint Fundraising Agreement will be entered into by HFA and the DNC (as well as by State Parties).</p>

<p>&quot;This agreement will be reviewed on March 31, 2016 and either party may terminate any prospective obligation at that time.</p>

<p>&quot;If this memorandum correctly summarizes our agreement, please reply by email with the text – &#39;Agreed by DNC&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p>There was programmed vote weighting in most of the districts that had hackable voting machines. What that means as there is almost a perfect mirror image linear regression graph of Clinton vs Sanders.</p>

<p>Votes were programmatically taken away from Sanders &amp; assigned to Clinton in a very inorganic fashion. Mirror image linear regressions of two opponents DOESN&#39;T HAPPEN over &amp; over in multiple districts across widely disparate populations.</p>

<p>That shit was planned &amp; carried out.</p>

<p>There is evidence of massive tampering/purging of voter registrations in multiple areas of the country.</p>

<p>After tons of people registered as Democrats &amp; then disappeared from the voter registration rolls at the last minute preventing them from voting in the primaries?</p>

<p>Not only is voter roll purging done in every election cycle to clear off people who died or moved away, but why would they purge 126k legitimate voters from Brooklyn, a place where Clinton was polling over Bernie by double digits? NYC was decisively for Clinton in both the polls and votes, so it&#39;s always hilarious to me that people could try and bring up voter purging in Brooklyn like it would have helped Bernie rather than just increasing Clinton&#39;s lead. </p>

<p>Media favoritism + Wikileaks showing overt collusion with journalists who didn&#39;t disclose these contacts and conflicts of interest + both Hillary <strong><em>and</em></strong> Trump pussying out of a final pre-Cali primary debate. Like none of it had any impact on how people voted (but don&#39;t worry, all these Russian retweets totes did!).</p>

<p>I love how the best narrative Hill-drones could come up with (at the time, at least) was &quot;she&#39;s winning, why does she need to debate?&quot; like it didn&#39;t matter that she&#39;d explicitly agreed to do the debate and then reneged when it no longer suited her.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that&#39;s why the DNC openly backed the life-long democrat over the independent guy who ran as a Democrat just to use their name and resources</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love how you admit, too, that they openly backed him, without any sense of appreciation for the implications of that statement. In fact, you&#39;re even defending it, because party loyalty is <em>apparently</em> more important than anything else, even though party selection of candidates has <em>major</em> implications for the integrity of our democracy. </p>

<p>I wonder if liberals like yourself will ever realize what a perverse reflection of the Republicans you&#39;ve become. They dig their heads into the sand over their bullshit, and you do the same for &quot;your&quot; team.</p>

<p>P.s.</p>

<p>Newsflash, they&#39;re not &quot;your&quot; team just because you feel they represent you better than the &quot;other team,&quot; they&#39;re playing for their donors just the same as the Republicans. Here&#39;s Albert Einstein on why party organization within capitalist society inevitably results in oligarchic dominion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. <strong>The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population.</strong> Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I can already tell from your post that you&#39;re going to dig in deeper and keep defending this horseshit, probably with some tired talking point like &quot;muh 3 million votes,&quot; again ignoring all the factors which culminated in that outcome</p>

It&#39;s like it forces a portion of your brain to turn off completely, the part which would otherwise realize &quot;You know what? If our choices in the <em>primary</em> are already made for us- or at the very least <em>heavily</em> influenced- then the election itself is consequently not a true choice or in any way democratic.&quot;</p>

<p>I do not disagree. Hillary inarguably offered the American working class a better deal than any person in the Republican Party, let alone Trump, could ever offer. But is it a <em>good</em> deal? No, it&#39;s not, because she and the rest of her neoliberal ilk are as beholden to their donors&#39; interests as the Republicans are to theirs. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Globalism is not restricted to Republicans. It&#39;s also not the source of the multitudinous problems facing us all. The issue with globalism is how it is constructed and who it ultimately serves. Neoliberal/conservative globalization serves the oligarchy. This is why there are alternative movements i.e. the alter-globalization advocated by the Zapatistas of Chiapas.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really hard not to answer this with indignant anger, but you know nothing about me or my political views. If you&#39;re saying this because of my usage of &quot;liberals&quot; above, make no mistake- I am no Republican. I am a socialist. In particular I have been advocating for libertarian socialism for quite some time. If you don&#39;t believe me, look at my post history, it is absolutely full of it. </p>

<p>The only similarity whatsoever that my views have with those of the Republicans are in that our interests are tangentially aligned against the Democratic establishment. </p>

<p>P.s. I voted for Stein in order to attempt to help the Greens in getting funding for the next election cycle. I felt free to do so because my state is solidly red and was going to go Trump either way. </p>

<p>P.p.s. I would argue that the truest cowards are those who vote for a shitty candidate out of fear that the alternative is worse. Again, this is not to say that Trump is not significantly shittier than Hillary.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How do you square libertarianism with socialism?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m so very glad you asked, as this is my favorite topic of discussion. I always love to spread awareness on this matter.</p>

<p>You see, &quot;socialism&quot; refers to a wide <em>range</em> of economic and political ideologies, with quite a bit of variance on the issue of liberty versus authoritarianism. Many people (particularly in heavily right-wing skewed subs such as this one) believe that &quot;socialism&quot; refers to a system where the means of production are collectivized and administered under a central state government. It is true that that is a form of socialism, but State Socialism (or state capitalism, however you wish to refer to it- the capital is held by the state) is far from the <em>only</em> form of socialism.</p>

<p>One example I like to point to in order to illustrate this variance in ideology is a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism">libertarian socialism</a> known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a>. This is, essentially, the <em>direct</em> ownership and administration of the means of production by the workers themselves (or their trade unions), with organization of economic and political activity decided upon democratically by those workers.</p>

<p>It is with the anarcho-syndicalists of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Catalonia">Revolutionary Catalonia</a> that George Orwell fought against Franco&#39;s Fascist forces. It was here that he developed lifelong support for democratic socialism, as well as an extreme abhorrence of <em>Marxist-Leninist derived State Socialism</em>. </p>

<p>A lot of people believe that <em>1984</em> was an indictment of socialism, but it was not. It was an indictment of Stalinism in particular, and authoritarianism in general. A lot of people refuse to believe me on this, but here&#39;s a quote from the man himself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it.”</p>

<p>George Orwell, “Why I write” p. 394</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Democratic Socialism, by the way, is kinda closer to libertarian socialism, but not really. The means of production under Democratic Socialism are still organized under the state, but it is still more anti-authoritarian in its aims than a Marxist-Leninist system would be (i.e. the USSR, China, etc) because it explicitly requires this system to be democratically managed rather than administered by an unaccountable party bureaucracy. </p>

<p>To add further clarification, this is distinct from &quot;Social Democracy&quot; which isn&#39;t really socialism at all but rather an ideology in support of reformation within the capitalist system. Most socialists (self included) oppose Social Democratic reform under the belief that it will merely perpetuate the capitalist system, and therefore the problems and contradictions capitalism propagates. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How can you call call Hillary a neoliberal and support the party of Regan?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t. I haven&#39;t said a single thing indicating support for Republicans, only that I am in opposition to neoliberal (and, honestly, liberal) Democrats. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neoliberalism is by definition, a Libertarian and Globalist ideology. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t. Neoliberalism is a corporatist perversion of prior held liberal values. It essentially throws away all pretense of working class advocacy (beyond paying lip service, when convenient for votes), and exists to further the political and economic power of the donor base which advocates for it. This is why we see things like Bill Clinton, a Democrat, signing the 1996 Telecommunications Act, allowing an immense consolidation of news media into the hands of ever fewer capitalists&#39; hands. </p>

<p>Also, like I said, &quot;Globalism&quot; isn&#39;t the problem. It&#39;s how our globalized economy is structured, and since the framework for this globalization is being laid by neoliberal/conservative politicians, think tanks, and other organizations... it serves their purposes. Hence why we have things like Nicaragua (after decades of civil war as we propped up anti-socialist contras) electing neoliberal leadership working hand in hand with international organizations like the IMF... and now they make our shirts and shit while neoliberals cheer about how we&#39;ve &quot;given them jobs.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The goal of Socialism is to limit the harm of neoliberal economies through government imposed laws and regulations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just want to clarify again that no, it isn&#39;t. You&#39;re thinking of Social Democracy, i.e. what we see in Sweden/Denmark etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Democrats are the only party that is capable of passing regulatory reform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup, I agree that the Republicans are a lost cause and would be infinitely harder for leftists to subvert from within. However, without dragging the DNC to the left, any such reform passed will merely benefit their donor base rather than the Republican&#39;s. It is not substantially different.</p>

<p>To quote former Louisiana Governor Huey Long, the only difference between the two parties on this front is whether they&#39;re skinning us from the bottom up or from the top down. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There will never be a viable 3rd party in the US, because the US is NOT a Parliamentary system of government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s actually because of First-Past-The-Post electoral policy, but I didn&#39;t vote for Stein because I thought she could win. I specifically voted for Stein because she matched my ideological views most closely, and because <em>if</em> the Greens can get above a rather small percentage of the vote (I might be wrong, but I think the threshold is 5%) then they receive federal election funding for the next cycle of elections.</p>

<p>This still wouldn&#39;t allow a Green Party presidency, but it would facilitate Green Party victories in local and state elections. I think, especially after what I witnessed in the 2016 primary, that this is a much more viable option for reform than continuing to struggle in vain against the neoliberal DNC leadership. </p>

<p>(I&#39;d like to point out here that this is far from the first election in which we&#39;ve seen establishment figures do everything in their power to prevent a more progressive candidate from receiving the nomination. Henry Wallace in particular comes to mind, although that was before primary elections were even a thing, the same economic and political forces which led to opposition against him are still around today. The DNC&#39;s donor base DO NOT WANT A PROGRESSIVE, and they never will.) </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a winner-take-all elections and governments, like the US, all candidates will naturally reduce to two parties. That is a basic fact of political science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m aware, but I still maintain that it is cowardice to vote for the lesser of two evils when there remains the choice to vote for no evil at all, simply because of the perception that the greater evil will in this case win. I only really said it because I do not appreciate being called a coward simply for having nuanced political views that led me to vote in a way you do not agree with. </p>

<p>P.s. Going back to libertarian socialism, I&#39;d also like to point out that in addition to the already incredibly diverse range of ideologies our predecessors have left us, there are more modern inventions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_politics">Participatory Politics</a> (advocated by Reddit&#39;s own Aaron Swartz in <a href="https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/aaron-schwartz-on-the-parpolity-system/2013/01/14">the following essay</a> before his death) and its sister system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_economics">Participatory Economics</a>.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990117030925/http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker2.html">here&#39;s an essay from 1886</a> delineating the differences between State Socialism and the then-nascent individualist anarchist socialism. Please note that he is not very accurate in describing Marxism/State Socialism (he&#39;s very alarmist, and a lot of what he says reads like anti-socialist screeds I&#39;ve seen posted here), but I found great value in what he said of the views of anarchists such as Proudhon and Warren. I see a lot of parallels between their concerns and issues facing us today, and to me it seems that modern American libertarianism has become a pro-oligarch perversion of their original ideology. I say this because... they&#39;re very, very similar ideologies, only modern libertarianism supports unlimited property rights and the original form did not (for very good and very specific reasons he talks about in the essay). </p>

<p>Anyway, sorry this got so long, but like I said, &quot;socialism&quot; describes an incredibly wide range of ideologies and it takes quite a bit of discussion to accurately describe these ideas.</p>

<p>If you have any further questions about socialism, please feel free to PM me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the thoughtful response. And apologies for calling you a coward, and Republican, I mistook you for one of the many Trump shills that have overtaken this sub. Getting that out if the way, I used to think (and vote) like you until I was burned by Ralph Nader in 2000. That election mirrored 2016 in many ways (a Clinton holdover vs a GOP zealot). Many of us thought Nader would reach that proverbial 5%, but I am now convinced that it will never happen. And even if it did, the Progressive President will never have the voting coalition to get anything through Congress. The US system is designed to reward Moderates and requires compromise. That is why Obama, and even the Clinton&#39;s, pulled Right once they got into office.  I recognize that Clinton was a deeply flawed candidate and far less Progressive (or uncompromising) than I would like, however, I personally believe that she would have better advanced your and my policy goals than electing Trump. As it stands now, there is little chance of a Progressive SCOTUS for the next two decades, which is how major structural reforms will be made into law, and made to last. I think the voters who either voted third party or stayed home rather than vote for a less-than-perfect candidate made the difference in the last election. I&#39;m not blaming you, the Democratic party and Clinton campaign deserves that blame. But there is some measure of blame that falls on the Russian ad campaign that drove people away from voting by changing the anti-Hillary messaging from the typical Democratic &quot;tax and spend&quot; to the vitriolic and absurd, like supposed Clinton murders and pizzagate. We will never know how much of an effect that had. But it clearly had some. The Reddit subs are a perfect example of how the narrative manipulation. That manipulation also hurt the Green party by turning people off voting altogether, or driving those potential swing voters to Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, there&#39;s this game, see? And part of the rules of the game is all the players get to to just about anything (lie, cheat, steal) to win. Collectively in 2016 they gathered around $1.5B dollars to fund their influence programs and efforts - that buys a lot of nefarious stuff.</p>

<p>But one of the rules of the game is people who aren&#39;t playing don&#39;t get to cheat to help the players of their choice win. Now you catch a few non-players who did, spending something like $12 to $24M dollars to cheat and influence, and got caught. Everybody is very angry, because of how badly the game rule was broken and how it&#39;s obvious that spending a few tens of millions to affect a game already spending $1.5 billion or more could so stunningly change the games outcome. </p>

<p>In addition to breaking a big rule of the game (only players get to cheat) the fact this happened is now being use by all the players to help cheat and win in the next game cycle. This makes addressing the rules violation very hard, because the referees are also players in the game and cannot seperation their job as referee from their role as a player. Or, perhaps they are doing that, but all the other players are working to win and so are using their influence and money to convince everybody the referees are cheating and playing like everyone else is. </p>
