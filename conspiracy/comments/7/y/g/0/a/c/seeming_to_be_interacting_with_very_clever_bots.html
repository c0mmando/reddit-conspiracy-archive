<p>What are the best countermeasures? </p>

<p>Should we ignore it?</p>

<p>Is it something like the Interstellar movie where our survivors channel back in time to this forum trying to warn us that the whole sub gets electronically nailed and arrested and thrown into WalMart centers? /s </p>

<p>Think about it: why would a user, with no interest in conspiracy at all, come to this subreddit and make it their mission to debunk conspiracy stuff - from flat earth to 9/11? Like, how many subs do you go to because you hate what they stand for???</p>

<p>My first attempt at profiling:</p>

<p>The overall effect seems to be that you are chatting with someone over multiple comments, but that other user just doesn&#39;t display all the clues that you would expect from a normal person. Like they always go back to a certain theme, without really telegraphing that they know that you know that we already talked about that theme - let&#39;s move on.</p>

<p>Ultimately: We could play a game of double reverse botsmanship by trying to determine which posts attract the most bots. Then publish that information, as a sort of indirect measure of Mainstream interest and interference. </p>

<p>Every show has a tell. It&#39;s not like the MSM turned into what it is without plenty of people saying &quot;wait, where&#39;s my normal news?&quot; I can remember when the news-crafters introduced the concept of &quot;sound bite&quot; to describe - and warn - about complex news being miniaturized to a phrase - that was in the 1990&#39;s as I recall.</p>

<p>Anyway, just saying we should be able t track with this trend and come up with counter strategies - like this - a messy mulridirectional - shared meaning level human interaction.</p>

<p>If indeed it IS that. </p>

<p>I’ve seen this popping up a lot lately. They can be easily spotted because as soon as you answer their “questions” they reply countering your answer. These are not real “questions” they’re looking for a soapbox without being called out on their beliefs, and providing that false “I’m not one of them” premise, they think more people will come in and participate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you following me because you&#39;re in love with me?  I&#39;m flattered, but already taken.</p>

<p>As for your accusation, I&#39;m hoping you realize this is a public forum.  I&#39;m going to paste my response to the reply you deleted in another thread just a very short time ago.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not following or downvoting you, except during our conversations and only on the posts where you throw your tantrums and refuse to elucidate anything.  You&#39;re on a public forum posting quite a bit, so it shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise if I end up reading a thread containing your posts.  I would&#39;ve called them arguments or discussions, but that&#39;s a huge stretch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;m done explaining that you, feel free to post your reply.  I&#39;m dying to read your next work of art, but I&#39;m also ending this conversation here.  You can carry on tilting at windmills.</p>

<p>I deleted my post because you were wierding me out. I got this Tony Podesta man fan following me with a username  called &quot;Kind_Of_A_Dick&quot;. </p>

<p>I say above that podesta might be a keyword because it was mentioned before and here you come? It could be a coincidence and you&#39;re one of those guys that has nothing better to do or.......</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Half kidding, half truth. That was just idea i came up with.
Practice with real people, see how they react, so you can distinguish who as behind that text/post. Also plenty of stupid/mentally disturbed people that can&#39;t have coherent dialogue too. Both ends of the same stick I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, i&#39;ve heard it from mouth to mouth, more like a rumor. But, honestly, i swear sometimes alot like im alone, or like those words are parasitic, is i even dont notice, and make my coworkers or other people uncomfortable. But thats just might be some bullshit spreading around like virus. (there probably is some difference, but it is probably linked to other personality traits, like low inhibition maybe). Anyway, the fact that i fluently speak three languages, as in change pattern of thought (speak two almost perfectly, with accent on both) could have more impact on my personality (or their switch, more than my style of speech or expression, which just could show my potential spectrum or some shit, lol)</p>

<p>Just today wondered how Indians have this fucking annoying english accent, yet, if he would grow up since infancy in america or somewhere, like Pajeet Pai, he would have no accent at all. Languages influences our thoughts and emotions and etc. Its more like parameters, configuration for specific culture, thought processes and emotions, to the specific group language comes from. Hence some language is mind control or some shit conspiracies, which sound beyond lcd trip or some hippie shit crazy, but would actually make sense. Because assuming people nowadays think in text,voice languages in their head, rather using another ability to process information. As in, when you think of a problem, you think it as of a text problem, and understand it as string of words, just like pc, but not a string of emotions, shapes, colors, smells and etc but i digressed so badly theres no way back lool.)  Anyway, knowing specific language or culture, influences more than the use of said language.</p>
