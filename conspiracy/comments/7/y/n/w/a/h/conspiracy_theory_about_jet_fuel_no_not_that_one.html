        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello folks. Heard an interesting sounding theory the other day but am having a hard time finding any kind of research or detail about it anywhere. Was wondering if you had ever heard of it and what you thought about it. </p>

<p>The theory goes as follows:</p>

<p>Jets cannot actually carry the purported weight of the jet fuel we are told they use for flight. The weight would amount to a huge strain on the wings, where we are told the fuel is stored, and the varying weight as the mass of fuel is consumed would further complicate takeoff vs. landing. </p>

<p>The implications of this are that there is a cleaner, cheaper way to power jets and planes that is being kept secret so airline companies can gouge their airfare and, of course, so we can be kept dependent on so-called &quot;fossil fuels.&quot;</p>

<p>What say you?</p>

<p>Everything we are told is lies so it wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all if this theory ended up having some validity.  People who are aware of the outer space hoax and the spinning wet ball lie know that gravity is just another elaborate hoax as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched some of that first video and all it really highlights is the general ignorance of whoever made it. </p>

<p>Take the Airbus 380 they use as an example - it&#39;s wings are huge, and at their deepest, where the wing joins the fuselage, you can quite easily stand up inside them. It can carry 320,000 litres, or 85,000 US gallons, and has a maximum take-off weight of 575 tons.</p>

<p>They also quite obviously don&#39;t understand how jet aircraft work - you can&#39;t run a jet engine on compressed air.</p>

<p>The entire point is considering that all of our &quot;understanding&quot; is based on lies.  If someone has expert knowledge of something that is base on lies it&#39;s useless.  They effectively become pawns of the system without even knowing it.  A perfect example of this phenomenon is with those who support the Moon landing hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aircraft are designed to be able to take the fuel necessary for the trip, especially airliners as they don&#39;t have the ability to refuel in-flight like military aircraft. The wings are the strongest part of the aircraft, to withstand the forces exerted on them while taking off, flying and landing, and also because it&#39;s the most convenient place to mount the fuel tanks.</p>

<p>The larger airliners also have tanks in the tail so that balance can be maintained by pumping fuel back and forth, in much the same a submarine uses trim and balance tanks. </p>

<p>I can also confirm from personal experience that aviation fuel smells just like paraffin when it burns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, the lack of understanding of basic chemistry.</p>

<p>We are going to talk about a basic rocket fuel reaction here:</p>

<p>Hydrazine (N2H2)+ dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) = 2 N2H2 + N2O4 = 4H2O + 3N</p>

<p>There are a few things to take into consideration here before we start, at all.</p>

<p>Nitrogen. Nitrogen is explosive because it wants to become diatomic nitrogen, whatever compound it is in, it is LESS stable than if its diatomic (N2) nitrogen, especially when the compound has a direct oxygen + nitrogen connection. There is also a great amount of energy released when nitrogen breaks off of things, think of TNT, the three nitric oxides want to rip off, and then on top of that, the nitrogen wants to split from that oxygen and meet another nitrogen. </p>

<p>Secondly, this is a liquid reaction, these are liquid injected into each other and create a great amount of gas and energy, think of boiling water, you can stick a finger in that shit, but when there is really hot steam, that shit will fuck you up, it has much more energy. </p>

<p>This is cute. </p>
