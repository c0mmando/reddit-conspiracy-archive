       Does anyone else find it really odd that people would rather blame our country's gun control laws rather than focusing on the more prevalent issue? It seems like people don't believe mental illness to be a factor in mass shootings, but rather it's the gun doing all the work. I just can't wrap my head around the idea that the person in control of the gun was not at fault.

       I agree to an extent. I do believe there should be some reform, but that reform should revolve around screening for mental illness. It should be a legal requirement when purchasing firearms of higher caliber, such as rifles and shotguns, to screen for mental illnesses. I do not believe that all citizens have their permits/guns revoked, but apparently some people do.

       I also believe it should be the other way around too. If you have guns prior to being diagnosed with a mental illness those gun should be confiscated or surrendered.

       Define mental illness. It's completely unethical to disarm someone because they take an antidepressant or anxiolytic.

       Well what mental illnesses would need to be defined. No, just because someone has anxiety issues or is deprrssed doesn't mean they're going to kill someone. I used to take antidepressants and never had suicidal tendencies or a desire to give someone a one way ticket to heaven.

       I agree, and very carefully defined.
       <br/>
       I'm frustrated with how often the catch-all 'mental illness' term is thrown around, with no real attempts at definition when used in conjunction with gun control rhetoric, when there are dozens of different disorders, some that are far more at risk for violence than others.

       My only issue with “mental health screenings”, is that what’s stopping someone in power (say even 10-20 years down the line) starts adding “mental conditions” to the list of conditions that disqualify you from gun ownership? How about, say for example, being a “conspiracy theorist”, aka not falling for government propaganda?
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s truly a slippery slope.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I’m fully on board with raising the purchasing age to 21, and criminal background checks across the board.

       I agree, a lot has to do with media coverage too. When the media popularizes an idea, it becomes normal. I'm pretty sure film theory made a video about this with regards to the tide pod challenge. Definitely worth the watch.

       I find it odd that people think it's a black and white issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       This country has a significant mental health problem. It's stigmatized, and not to mention the deplorable healthcare industry making care inaccessible or far too expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also have over 300 million guns in circulation, and many venues where you need to jump through zero hoops to purchase a gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we can work on solving the mental health problem, like humans have for millenia. We can also try to get those afflicted through the proper care channels by breaking down barriers to seek care. We can also try to put laws in place to limit access to guns for those affected with mental illness.

       I used to agree with you, then I was targeted with an electromagnetic toolkit designed to mimick mental illness to an outside observer. Military and intelligence have the means to manufacture auditory illusions and cast them at anyone, which are widely seen as an instant diagnosis of schizophrenia. We're setting a very dangerous precedent by disarming anyone accused/assumed to be mentally ill, when forces at play can essentially select that detriment from their console, and have grossly unethical but instant disarmament.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd ask that every informed voter take this dark and inconvenient truth into consideration when drafting/voting for new firearm legislation, and only restrict people with a
       <em>
        history of violence
       </em>
       . I've managed my depression/anxiety well over the years (and am explaining the electromagnetic technologies right here on reddit), and don't need misguided politicians drafting laws telling me that I no longer have a right to self-defense because it makes some people
       <em>
        uncomfortable
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       We the people should be extremely suspicious of anyone peddling fear as a means to disarm the middle class. I've been extremely disappointed that AWBs are again gaining popularity, which make about as much sense as
       <em>
        banning mental illness
       </em>
       via legislation.

       That's tough to answer as many politicians don't even understand the term mental illness. My best guess would be psychiatrists who have been surrounded with patients with mental illnesses for their whole lives. They probably understand better than most others what illnesses can and cannot be dangerous to others.

       Its because we have a fundamental cultural problem that has no easy answer or solution. People are scared right now (thanks to MSM) and demand immediate action and this is why answers like gun control get so popular. The further we sink into degeneracy the more prevalent these things become. Mental health issues and guns have existed since the nation's inception, mass shootings are a new phenomena.

       It's hard...
      </p>
      <p>
       Guns can be used to kill people, but guns are our right as Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mentally ill people should not have access to guns, but mentally ill people are still Americans and have the same rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know of a solution that would limit mentally unfit people from exercising their rights to own guns that wouldn't infringe on their, or anyone else's rights.  Who would determine what is unfit?  The government?  My wife had depression as a teenager,  would that limit her access?  Mine?  Where's the line?
      </p>
      <p>
       Swap out the 2nd amendment for the 1st amendment.  Should mentally ill people lose their right to speech?  Do we limit what they can say in public because it might cause some issues and be dangerous?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its tough.  You limit one groups rights, you can cause a slippery slope issue.

       Why aren’t more school shooters shot? Everyday civilians get shot because the cop thinks they might possibly have an object that slightly resembles a gun. School shooters obviously have a gun and are a threat I just don’t see why more of them don’t end up with the death of the shooter.

       Not odd at all.  People want simple solutions to convoluted problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       People want to end school shootings.  Their solution: make it really hard to Get a Gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does not matter if their solution ignores other things Like overturning the Constitution, ignoring mental illness.  Or if it is just plain stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a simple solution. And that is what they are after.
