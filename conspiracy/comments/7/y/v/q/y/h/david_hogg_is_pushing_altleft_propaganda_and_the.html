        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Life is a journey filled with ups and downs, and peaks and valleys.</strong> Our lives are filled with tremendous love, happiness, and excitement. But life can also hand us moments of immense suffering, sadness, and pain. And last week, the students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School experienced an enormous tragedy, as 17 folks were senselessly gunned down. Experiencing the loss of a loved one is a painful process filled with heartache and grief. One would expect that the students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School are dealing with incredible suffering and pain. Surely they must be struggling though an emotional time as they attempt to come to grips with the loss of their beloved teachers and friends. However, it appears that the students at this high school have completed the grieving process in record time, as they are now exclusively focused on politicizing the tragedy, pushing alt-left talking points, and taking advantage of their fifteen minutes of fame.  </p>

<p><strong>I want to focus on one student in particular: <a href="https://kek.gg/i/6mSzg2.jpeg">David Hogg.</a></strong> Of the thousands of students at the high school, nobody has sought the spotlight as shamelessly as David. I understand the fact that David was not personal friends with any of the victims. But he could have at least <em>pretended</em> to care about the lost lives before he decided to capitalize on the tragedy to boost his profile. Before the blood had even dried, David was already whoring himself out to the media, giving interviews to every outlet in sight. Check out a partial list of his interviews:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0v7yxczipo">The Ingraham Angle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/jBlAFnN9b8U">Fox News Sunday</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/YlBUjPshzrw">Meet the Press</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/9u1x6LNo1rM">Velshi &amp; Ruhle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/beuvViuwpsE">Face the Nation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/C3grouDLNt0">CBS This Morning</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/GoM2_0qvaIU">New Day - February 15</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/Sr1oyK5lvqQ">New Day - February 19</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/5ni_srMFPMc">CBSN</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/OoHaPqOs46o">GMA</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Wow, that&#39;s a lot of airtime! It&#39;s safe to say that David has never seen a camera he doesn&#39;t like. In his interviews, David speaks with a level of poise and articulation that is unnatural for a grieving child. It is obvious that his talking points are carefully crafted and rehearsed. The globalist mainstream media loves this guy, since he masterfully delivers alt-left, pro-gun control talking points. He is shamelessly and brazenly capitalizing on an historic tragedy to boost his profile, and presumably launch a high-profile career in media. I fully expect to see him behind a CNN anchor desk sometime within the next thirty years. Book it!  </p>

<p><strong>With all of that said, I wonder what David&#39;s classmates think of him.</strong> I can&#39;t imagine that he has many friends left over there! The shooting took place only six days ago, so the Parkland community is still mourning the loss of their fallen family and friends. But not David! David is too busy with his self-aggrandizing media tour, looking pretty for the cameras and basking in the limelight. Instead of using his airtime to pay respects for his deceased classmates, David is politicizing the tragedy, and selfishly leveraging his airtime to launch a media career -- victims be damned!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you explain who exactly the “alt-left” is and how they differ from the left? From what I have heard from this kid, his position isn’t any different than what most on left believe, so I don’t see why the “alt” label. </p>

<p>I’ve obviously heard of “alt-right”, because there are people that self identify with that philosophy. However, unlike the “alt-right”, I never hear any identify themselves as “alt-left”.   </p>

<p>Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging at</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was the part that got me. in order to be near the rally, you had to remove masks, weapons were confiscated, no shields, just the clothes you&#39;re wearing and if permitted, a possibly mace.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the alt-right collectively had over 200 guns(Which there is video evidence of them shooting, despite not being used in self-defense), multiple wooden shields, and actual spears, while the police were standing right next to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He’s a deep state plant. He’s not even a kid, he’s like 20 years old. He’s a media whore. His retired FBI dad made him do it. His lines are too perfect, nobody is that media savvy. Ooh look he fucked up his lines. He was on CBS once before the shooting. He’s a crisis actor. </p>

<p>Did I miss anything? </p>

<p>I’d get it if there was one thread to discuss this theory, but conspiracy currently has 4 threads talking about this right now on the front page. At this point I’m wondering about the growing conspiracy to vilify and silence this kid much more than I am a wanna be teen journalist with an opinion on guns (cemented by the shooting) using his new found platform to espouse a pretty moderate left viewpoint. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They released the video of him rehearsing his lines and trying to seem more sad, like the Gene Rosen vid from years ago. 
They&#39;re just ensuring that anyone smart enough to figure out what&#39;s going on either joins the team or becomes a social pariah by attacking the vicsims. 
The mockery is omnipresent as usual, along with the display of power, control and planning ability of course. 
It&#39;s not worth discussing, let&#39;s just accept that we&#39;re all slaves to the system and do our best not to feed it further, do you really want to spend your life arguing with shills and brain-dead statist apologists? 
I gotta get my broke ass arable land with a large fence and a lot of guns, everyone conscious should flee the cities imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not been my experience. I&#39;m just curious what OP means by alt-left. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard Bernie or Busters referred to as the alt-left, even though just because they didn&#39;t vote for Bernie, doesn&#39;t mean they voted for Trump. I&#39;ve heard the &quot;far left&quot; both Jill Stein and even Bernie supporters, referred to as the alt-left. Imo, the alt-left would be the &lt;10% of Bernie supporters who voted for Trump. </p>

<p>Otherwise, I find sjw&#39;s as annoying as the alt-right and antifa as extreme/dangerous as alt-right white supremacists. Die hard Hillary supporters are like the alt-right in that they&#39;re cultish.</p>
