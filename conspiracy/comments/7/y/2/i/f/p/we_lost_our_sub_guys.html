       The sky isn't falling. It never will. That's part of the fear campaign. We lost our sub to a lot of BS and many old users see and feel it. I finally realized it had come to a new low with that godforsaken Fox News article about those 13 indictments. Which btw. Fucking 13. How non occult like at all. Oh my lord. They know they got you if they still have you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is quite literally our AntiChrist. Not that I'm religious. Just my wording. But he's definitely representing something nefarious. The final installment of the NWO. While the sub deteriorates to partisan politics and intense senseless arguments.

       I don't think they're really clever at all. With enough resources you employ a few people with tons of sockpuppets and votebots. It really isn't that difficult to pull off.

       I've caught vote rings on my subs.  Maybe 4-7 people with an alt each could game most new queues.  Voting and flooding and shitting in the comments is quite effective unless you have a good mod team not afraid to tighten the clamps.

       Im taking a hiatus for a few months. I wish there was somewhere to go, but they will follow. If I don't like something I avoid it. If they don't like something they call all of their friends and attack it. Kinda the new mentality of the upcomming generations. They're all trying to change stuff they don't like instead of just avoiding it. Sometimes that's good, other times it's boarderline harrasment, but I won't stoop to their level.

        11Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies. 12And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.

       Thank you. I'm very interested in the Old Testament. I'm starting to think we had a very advanced civilization before the massive flood 14,000 years ago or w/e.

       I grew up in catholic school which pushed me far from organized religion, but the more I learn about pre-history as well as the Roman Empire, the more I want to learn the truths in the Bible. I forget who posted it, but it was a random comment in this sub talking about the Roman Empire never fell. Started taking me down a hell of a rabbit hole.

       I dunno about everyone else, but I'm here to stay and I would miss the genuine users here immensely. So many great discussions and ideas were shared on this sub. Its a shame that powerful people decided that we shouldn't be allowed to discuss certain ideas (I think Pizzagate and Seth Rich primarily triggered this), and so they decided to unleash a shill infestation on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't want those groups to win, so I will always come back here. We have no idea if/when their funding will run out, but you never know, it could happen somewhat soon. I'll be watching.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for other forums, none are exactly the same as this one but there are some decent alternatives. I can PM you if you'd like but I'll bet you know of them.

Prepare yourself. I'm not much of a doomer, but I will tell you the market is about to turn any month now and when it does things will get really heated. Just look out for yourself and the people you love. This mentality of groupthink and mass-attacks on "justice" are going to make the bad worse. It's unavoidable at this point.

       Thanks man, I truly appreciate hearing such things. I'll be here fighting until I no longer can be (I have scars to show this as well) :).

       I'd like to get u/Ambiguously_Ironic 's (or any mod for that matter) thoughts on these shills and their votes scripts?

      <p>
       Hey u/Ambiguously_Ironic, you got a handful of longtime users in this sub and they are pretty upset that the mods are failing to do anything about these shills and their vote scripts. Please do join the conversation and communicate with the actual members of this sub.

       They’ve literally managed to co-opt the entire sub.

       I knew when they made it a ban-able offense to call out shills that it would not end well.

       They banned the site and the affiliated, paid accounts.

      <p>
       Do you think the people that were manning those accounts went to the unemployment line?

       Reddit didn't ban them, only r/politics. Reddit welcomes paid shills with open arms. The "ban" was akin to an olive branch laced with anthrax.

       So those same affiliated accounts should be easy to spot here then, right? I mean just look for people that posted Shareblue and related content in politics and stopped right when that ban happened?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, seeing as they can't actually ban someone, those shills just keep posting and commenting. Only difference is they can't link to Shareblue.

       I'm trying to find info connecting Soros to CD but I am having trouble, can you help me with the connection?
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't appear they were given a grant from this organization of his (link at bottom), and Googling things like "soros common dream" just brings me to articles on common dreams with soros in the title somewhere.

       That's the biggest thing I've noticed. I don't think they actually subscribe to any of the conspiracy theories that we consider a given..

      <p>
       9/11, mkultra, rouge agencies (drug, weapon, human trafficking), MSM propaganda, federal reserve etc..

       again it's like a vegan hanging out in a butcher shop. Like ok, we get it - you don't subscribe to these concepts, fine. Leave. There are plenty of whole foods and farmers markets that sell organic blades of grass.

       Sandy hook and pizzagate were never started by trump or fox. Pizzagate was started from podesta's emails released by WikiLeaks, and sandy hook was started after researchers exposed anomalies with the shooting in 2012. while seth rich got started after Assange did that interview where he hinted that seth rich was his leaker. I don't see how a theory can be cuckoo if it was basically started by hints from Wikileaks (an agency that has exposed so much corruption)

       WikiLeaks proved itself to be a corrupt partisan org only concerned with making Hillary look bad. They lost a ton of credibility with that and then kept it going with those aforementioned insane theories. That's what started this divide. This sub and this way of thinking is supposed to be the opposite of trusting one sole person/organization, but unfortunately a lot of people fell into automatically trusting Assange/wikileaks' word (and for many trumps word). That's the antithesis of this whole thing. He sucked you in and then once he had a specific personal agenda, you were willing to believe it as truth automatically. Bad critical thinker.

       Antarctica is super interesting to me. It ties back to the pre-flood stuff. I'm starting to rabbit hole down.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me it seems possible advanced ancient civilizations (14,000+ years ago) lived in Antarctica because it was highly habitable. Then the ice age hit, caused the flood and whipped out nearly every civilization on earth at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that would happen today, the only signs that humans existed 10,000+ years from now would be the great pyramids and mt Rushmore. Everything else would be gone. Who's to say that hasn't happened once or twice before? Who's to say we're the most advanced humans to walk on this earth?

       And you somehow manage to believe that the "left wing" doesn't do the same or much worse?  After all the reading and writing you've done?  I've never seen an email from a "right-winger" that said they needed to make a "penance" to a Rothchild, if you speak of global banking.

       I am a liberal ( not an American liberal) I am anti-corp, anti-pharma, anti-MSM. In what world does being those things make you a right-wing extremist? The same way as when you lot seem some dumb idiot on "liberals triggered" crying because they are offended by some trivial thing. That isn't  a liberal it's just a cunt. As soon as you guys understand that thing might get easier.

       Im 48.  After years of following conspiracy theories, you find about 5% ever pan out and then you watch younger people come along and pick those same theories up and you just can't do it again.  And especially when you watch them weaponize those conspiracies and smear the opposite side.

       You seem a bit naive for someone your age. How exactly do you think we're going to get proof, when those who tasked with investigating this sort of thing are bought and paid for?

       What’s more nuts than this sub is conservatives thinking the fbi is out to get them. They are just doing their jobs. Like any American should. At this point you can’t deny Russian collusion and shouldn’t be bitching about this when the conspiracy theory is starting to come true.

       How does one operate with this mindset? If proof is not a requirement for a belief, what is? Reason is rendered completely useless with such a weak standard of proof. You might as well unironically believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

       I don't "believe" them necessarily, I think of them in likelihood or probability. And there is enough circumstantial evidence to think that there is a pretty high probability that there is something to those conspiracy theories.

       Belief doesn't do it justice, is faith a better term for your proof less views? How does it feel to let your political views be founded on hunches or "likelihood and probability" that anyone literate with half a brain has been laughing at since the 15th century? You know that there are countless conspiracy theories that do have proof? There are so many good reasons to hate Hillary, believing something like pizzagate or one of many documented Russian troll accounts just makes you arrive at an otherwise justifiable conclusion via getting cucked by soviet propaganda techniques we, once again, have proof of and have known about for years. I legitimately pity you. What will your cucked ass get tricked into next? Let me know because I'd love to laugh in your face. I know the world to be much much worse than news that requires proof  let's on, but I also accept that if a conspiracy theory exists that lacks proof or reason that it is not only useless, but politically disempowering to subscribe to. There are countless effective ways to change the world, most of them require a shitton of money, but literally making up theories about a child sexual abuse ring is one that in the end, gets you extremely cucked.

       You should really read that, I know I'm being arrogant but god damn is it sad you walk through life thinking like this. You can keep the same basic conclusions, you should just go about it in a way that somewhat respects you as a rational being. You need to accept the fact that you got cucked.

       You straight up admit to abandoning the need for evidence. How is anyone supposed to believe you went to law school? That is pretty funny my dude.  I'll let up now but may I try one last time to appeal to reason...
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know what empiricism means? Why have you abandoned it in your politics? Without reason, without proof, how does one know anything at all? Why do you put your faith in such an absurdly uneducated shill like trump? That asshole says that his favorite book is the Bible and then pronounces Second Corinthians "two corinthians." He does not read. Instead he unironically watches hours of CABLE FUCKING NEWS as he sips on one of his many diet cokes for the day.  You two are perfect for each other! But it's never to late to apply those Ivy League critical thinking skill and start requiring more proof than absurd interpretations of Clinton emails that truly rival mystical numerology in outrageousness.

       That makes sense.   Do you believe any of the dossier is real?  I think for a smear to be effective there has to be some truth.

      <p>
       Do you believe any part of the Russia scandal (like the indictments today) is real?

       Yes I believe that foreign governments were meddling in our election.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see that they supported Trump when they and everyone else thought he was a joke, I can also see that llike everyone else once Trump started winning they started attacking him.

       It's disturbing that a foreign government would use online trolls to twist information and ferment confusion, thank god that there aren't Americans doing that same thing to fellow Americans or we might have to correct the record.

       I disagree here. The boomers see what this country has been through and they see the lies. They are much more aware than many believe. I know on social media, it tends to look opposite, but IRL they are very in tune to the fuckery.

       Conservatives take over r/conspiracy to prove Hillary committed crimes. Do so under the guise of supporting law and order and proving that they know right from wrong better than others do.
      </p>
      <p>
       When presented with a conspiracy that goes against what they fought for the past 2 years, they fight back to preserve the status quo of attacking Hillary and protecting Trump.

       This sub was ruined the moment r/the_donald flooded over here. It'll never be the same because those people took over and refuse to acknowledge anything that goes against their narrative.

       Bullshit. What happened is that r/politics was co-opted and you couldn't have a reasonable discussion there. Folks found their way here because they could speak freely.

       Then, r/politics wasn't happy with just dominating that sub, they had to make certain that

       Russia is a conspiracy with no evidence at all and the 17 indictments are jokes.

       However, Seth Rich was murdered by Hillary Clinton personally with a knife to his heart while she sucked out his soul. I know this because Sean Hannity has promised me evidence of it.  Ignore that it was never released and his own investigator says Fox lied.  Also, I know this is true because Julian Assange has implied it is true. Surely Wikileaks, which we all know has denied involvement with Trump is credible and unbiased. Please ignore them asking for political favors from the Trumps and apparently being in common communication secretly with Sean Hannity.
      </p>
      <p>
       These shootings are fake as fuck false flags by the way. I know because Alex Jones, the man who called his show an act under oath, tells me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, and I want to be very clear about this. HRC is the queen pizza pedo. This is a matter very near and dear to my heart sir. Please do not mention that the prosecutor who game Jeffrey Epstein the plea deal that this sub thinks is dirty, is Trump's buddy. (this guy,

       ).  I'm only here to examine people I don't like good sir.

      <p>
       Podesta is evil by the way I feel it in my bones and he worked with Hilary as a campaign manager! Who could let this go? What, Paul Manafort has been a criminal conspirator working with Russia to influence foreign elections and commit crimes in countries like Ukraine and we have proof of the secret payments? And he offered a Russian Oligarch private briefings on the Trump campaign? Nothingburger you fools.

       Lets talk instead about the biased Mueller investigation that hates conservatives. Started by life long Republican Comey, replace and now run by Republic Wray, with their toadie liberal bosses in the DOJ Jeff Sessions and Rosentstein also republicans, who had the gaul to hire Mueller that other republican schill! BIASED I TELL YOU! How can we trust these hit jobbers?

       A wonderful defense of the above. An article from 1991 making an unrelated allegation about Mueller that never generated additional evidence as far as I can tell. You know what though, it seems unlikely but maybe something shady did go on in that situation I wouldn't know.  I can admit to a lack of certainty.  What's your point?

       Not sure when that was. My perspective is what we've seen is the Ellen Pao monetization plan. Too many changes in terms of censorship hit all at once during the political season. I suspect special VIP tools or consulting sessions were provided to political campaigns and key reputation management firms leading into 2016, and the full scope of what she did became realized after Pao's outing and Spez stepped back in (co-opting her platform but maybe not being quite so aggressive about expansion).

       I mean, I will never stop fighting in my lifetime, but some days you wonder if the things that happen were supposed to, considering no one stopped them. But then you wonder if apathy prevents people from change as well, so you're sort of stuck in this closed thought experiment if that makes sense.

       Grip is firm. I never said anything about the situation being hopeless, I just said we lost what it once was. Once relatively arcane groups, knowledge or practices become mainstream they become diluted. Just how things go.   We can still communicate and the earnest ones will recognize each other despite interruption from interlocutors. Or we can start another Reddit,  I guess.

       Precisely why I bounce around to the extent I do. Gotta keep the discussion open and the info flowing free. I may disagree with someone, but as long as their opinion is based in reality, and overall genuine in nature, I'll hear them out. I've been wrong plenty of times before, it'll likely happen again.

       Nice attitude! Although after reading through some of today's threads, I'm gonna take the night off from trying to "correct the record". This thread was a nice reminder that there are still people here who get what's really going on. They've got a good strategy for folks not aware of the propaganda war, but those of us who are aware see right through it.

       Nah, not really. A brigaded thread now and then does not a lost sub make. That the brigade has to exist to begin with, and is so obvious, sort of goes to show that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if/when they do crack it, if the admins intervene or axo finally just gives up, it's only a sub. There will be another sub, or another site, conversations will continue. Costs nothing, just a hassle, it's happened to anyone who remembers the internet before reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is not to hold on at all cost, it's to give nothing away for free. The more effort they have to put into it, the more people see it and take exception to it, and become immune to it.

       Everyone who is interested in conspiracies should not look to a "we" or an "our" in the first place. Think for yourself.

       And try to have some fun. If you really think you can accomplish anything by posting comments on a website you are completely delusional.

       Yeah, maybe not deliberately.. One of them links a thread or quotes user they don't like, then they get their panties in a twist.  Next thing you know they forget their golden rule and go batshit with the blue arrow.  Their only weapon. It's funny, I got an angry PM from one of their more prominent mods about this last comment.

      <p>
       Following your own logic you should be concerned about being manipulated by the Russians, No?

       What’s more nuts than this sub is conservatives thinking the fbi is out to get them. They are just doing their jobs. Like any American should. At this point you can’t deny Russian collusion and shouldn’t be bitching about this when the conspiracy theory is starting to come true.

       How does one operate with this mindset? If proof is not a requirement for a belief, what is? Reason is rendered completely useless with such a weak standard of proof. You might as well unironically believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
