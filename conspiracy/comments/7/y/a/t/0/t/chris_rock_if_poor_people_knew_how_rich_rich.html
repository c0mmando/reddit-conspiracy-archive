    <div class="md"><p>How much wealth someone has is also a better measure of their quality of life and opportunities. It determines the ability to invest in education, financial assets and the comfort and security of one’s retirement. Wealth also mitigates worries about paycheck variability or unexpected expenses. If you have wealth, the sudden cost of replacing a broken water heater or paying a medical bill doesn’t cause nearly as much stress as if you’re poor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that there are varying levels of wealth, but what do you think the maximum amount of money, assets, and wisdom you could have before you couldn&#39;t get any more benefit out of it?</p>

<p>There are rich dudes who don&#39;t even give a fuck <em>about their water heater</em>, let alone how to pay for it if it malfunctions.  Their butler will notify the maintenance guy when the hot water goes out.  The owner won&#39;t even realize he had a water heater problem.</p>

<p>I really feel like I could do whatever I needed to do <em>for myself</em> on a couple mil.  How these people need hundreds of millions is beyond me.  Are they addicted to money and status?  The next dopamine hit from having their name on a building?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not wrong. The system was taken advantage and a handful of people ended up with enough money to drive them insane. The debate comes in how to unfuck it. </p>

<p>Most of us aren&#39;t thieves and respect someone&#39;s right to have what they earned. Where we are likely falling short is the people that were responsible for blowing the whistle when the system was being raped were paid off and tucked away. </p>

<p>The reclamation of funds must come via legal means after we have put the .01% on trial and showed the world how they duped their fellow humans. Then it can be removed. The problem is there isn&#39;t a force strong enough to make that trial happen so far...and thus was wait and hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the thought, i really do, but dont you think that puts people who are completely out of touch with the real world into influential positions? The main issue with the wealth disparity right now is inheritance and the fact that you can make a billion dollars, die and leave it all to your kids who in turn just keep making money on the interest if nothing else, and then they end up with kids even more out of touch and have no empathy for the lower class and less fortunate.  That&#39;s how you get the Clinton and bush regimes or the koch brothers or even the rothschilds.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He has to pay taxes out of that money. He probably has an office that he runs the business out of and maybe a truck he lets you guys use to drive to the job. If so, there&#39;s gas and insurance he has to pay.</p>

<p>If he has so many employees he has to pay health insurance. He has to pay for the tools you use and replace any that get broken.</p>

<p>He has to pay for the supplies that each job needs like sheetrock, screws, plywood. </p>

<p>He has to pay advertising and for a website. He has to pay general liability insurance if something goes wrong and workman&#39;s comp if you get hurt. He has to pay someone to go out and do estimates on the job before the customer agrees to the price.</p>

<p>There&#39;s lots of expenses that he has to take out before he sees any of the money. I&#39;m not saying he pays you enough, I have no clue about that, but sometimes people don&#39;t realize the costs involved in owning a business.</p>

<p>Plus, he wants to profit a little so he can provide his family with nice things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I built an elaborate spreadsheet a few years ago when the Powerball lottery hit $400 million to see how opulently I could live.  I created investment and spending categories and reinvestment mechanisms to see how long the money would last. </p>

<p>Based on my spreadsheet, $10 million was about the amount where I could live like a rich man without running out of money before I hit 80.  Amounts beyond $50 million were very difficult to drain away before I died without really exorbitant spending, like owning multiple multimillion dollar homes or private jets. </p>

<p>Amounts over $100 million were extremely self perpetuating.   I didn’t build it into my spreadsheet but I think I worked it out on the side that you could wind up supporting several generations before draining your capital.  In my lifetime even with heavy spending I would up with a capital base larger than my starting point. </p>

<p>One weird takeaway was that owning large estates was a money loser.  Living every night in a $2000 night rental is only about $750k per year, so it made more sense to just own one elite home and rent wherever you were traveling.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>$10 million invested in tax-free municipal bonds doesn&#39;t get you extreme hookers and blow money, it only runs around $2-300,000 in tax free interest income per year.  But once you add a zero to your capital base you start benefiting from the relentless mathematics.  It&#39;s not easy to actually use $3 million a year in spending, you have to <em>try</em> to either waste it or get really extravagant, like I need a fleet of &lt;1 year old luxury cars at each place I live for 3 months a year.</p>

<p>And those numbers are built around the idea of not spending your capital base.  If you&#39;re not trying to build a perpetual dynasty and include some drawdown of the principal, the spendable income goes up.  You have to really <em>try</em> to spend it all.</p>

<p>With a $100 million principal where you blew 10% up front, made 2-3% return and spent 3% of your principal annually you have a monthly income of over $200,000.  On an annual basis after extremely generous housing, transport, food, and &quot;other&quot; expenses you still have about a $1 million in cash left over every year.   If you don&#39;t reinvest it, your principal only falls to $33 million in 25 years.  If you reinvest your leftover cash, your principal falls by only $2-3 million over 25 years.</p>

<p>You just can&#39;t get rid of it fast enough without literally blowing it on either ridiculous big ticket items or stuff you get little out of (mansions you only live in 1 month per year).  Maybe owning a continent-crossing private jet or a 100 meter yacht would do it, but even at $100 million principal, 100 hours per year in a Gulfstream G650 (ocean-crossing range private jet) barely puts a dent in your capital.  That&#39;s like ten 10 hour flights per year.</p>

<p>Unless you&#39;re just burning money for the sake of burning it, it&#39;s difficult to actually use that kind of money and get something out of it.  Implicit in all this is my own bias of spending money on things and activities I actually participate in.  Like, if I buy the $4 million dollar yacht, I&#39;m gonna actually spend several months a year for several years exploring the oceans, not buy the thing, spend a week on it and then pay someone to maintain it for me.  So maybe I&#39;m missing out on some weird rich guy habits like hiring a couple of people to manage an ever-expanding collection of expensive things I&#39;m seldom involved in.</p>

<p>If you look at the rest of nature and add us into it, it actually makes sense because the strongest and fittest are given all the resources to ensure they not only pass on their seed, but that seed is able to also pass their seed on. The weak or unlucky die. </p>

<p>in 2017 reported that the wealthiest 5 percent of American households held 62.5 percent of all assets in the US in 2013, up from 54.1 percent 30 years earlier.</p>

<p>How is this possible <strong><em>if</em></strong> we just had 8 years of change from Obama, not much change from George Bush, and 8 years of Bill Clinton feeling our pain. It&#39;s almost as if all those who keep falling on their swords for Clinton and Obama have been played like a piano.</p>

<p>As bad as Bush voters are, they won&#39;t fall on their swords for him nearly as much, and it took the 9/11 false flag to play them instead of just a few sound bites and media hype.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one is stopping you from creating something of value be it a product or service and selling it for financial gain. There are endless stories of rags to riches entrepreneurship in the west. Look at the guy who invented tetris in the communist workers paradise of russia, he died in squalor and destitution while the state absorbed 100% of tetris profits. If you live in western society you have the opportunity to become truly fucking awesome, successful, etc, but thats on you and only you and the harsh reality is its much easier to blame others for your circumstances then doing what needs to be done aka looking in the mirror and accepting responsibility.  Everyone is exactly where they deserve to be in western society, you put the work in, more work than others are willing to do equals more success than others have. You want to be negative thats fine too thats how most people think but realize your negative attitude and deficit work ethic is directly reflected in your negative bank account. Work 80 hours a week 7 days a week dont take breaks dont let up dont believe youre entitled to fucking dick and realize the world is completely unfair so either go out and get your unfair share by doing what others arent willing to do or shut the fuck up and move to your socialists paradise already. Theres plenty of communist options available, go there now, or get to work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You revolution against the crown was about rich people not wanting to let poor people take their toys. It was not about breaking free from hierarchy or dominance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes of people, the property of landed proprietors would be insecure. An agrarian law would soon take place. If these observations be just, our government ought to secure the permanent interests of the country against innovation. Landholders ought to have a share in the government, to support these invaluable interests, and to balance and check the other. They ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority. The senate, therefore, ought to be this body; and to answer these purposes, they ought to have permanency and stability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- James Madison, as quoted by Robert Yates</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We felt the same. I loved his old stuff. 
But he made the comment right before or right after trump got elected saying basically give him a chance. He got raked over the coals for it. 
So almost his entire bit was sjw, trump smashing crap. 
So many comedians have turned to that. 
And it’s sad. I love political humor. But that’s all they do. And they hammer the same point over and over again. It’s annoying.
Patton Oswald’s new stand up is the same. And I loved him. I can’t watch more than 20 min of him now</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>It has come about, however, in the course of the ages traversed by the human race, that all that enables man to produce, and to increase his power of production, has been seized by the few. Sometime, perhaps, we will relate how this came to pass. For the present let it suffice to state the fact and analyse its consequences.</p>

<p>To-day the soil, which actually owes its value to the needs of an ever-increasing population, belongs to a minority who prevent the people from cultivating it — or do not allow them to cultivate it according to modern methods.</p>

<p>The mines, though they represent the labour of several generations, and derive their sole value from the requirements of the industry of a nation and the clensity of the population — the mines also belong to the few; and these few restrict the output of coal, or prevent it entirely, if they find more profitable investments for their capital. Machinery, too, has become the exclusive property of the few, and even when a machine incontestably represents the improvements added to the original rough invention by three or four generations of workers, it none the less belongs to a few owners. And if the descendants of the very inventor who constructed the first machine for lace-making, a century ago, were to present themselves to-day in a lace factory at Bâle or Nottingham, and demand their rights, they would be told: “Hands off! this machine is not yours,” and they would be shot down if they attempted to take possession of it.</p>

<p>The railways, which would be useless as so much old iron without the teeming population of Europe, its industry, its commerce, and its marts, belong to a few shareholders, ignorant perhaps of the whereabouts of the lines of rails which yield them revenues greater than those of medieval kings. And if the children of those who perished by thousands while excavating the railway cuttings and tunnels were to assemble one day, crowding in their rags and hunger, to demand bread from the shareholders, they would be met with bayonets and grape-shot, to disperse them and safeguard “vested interests.”</p>

<p>In virtue of this monstrous system, the son of the worker, on entering life, finds no field which he may till, no machine which he may tend, no mine in which he may dig, without accepting to leave a great part of what he will produce to a master. He must sell his labour for a scant and uncertain wage. His father and his grandfather have toiled to drain this field, to build this mill, to perfect this machine. They gave to the work the full measure of their strength, and what more could they give? But their heir comes into the world poorer than the lowest savage. If he obtains leave to till the fields, it is on condition of surrendering a quarter of the produce to his master, and another quarter to the government and the middlemen. And this tax, levied upon him by the State, the capitalist, the lord of the manor, and the middleman, is always increasing; it rarely leaves him the power to improve his system of culture. If he turns to industry, he is allowed to work — though not always even that — only on condition that he yield a half or two-thirds of the product to him whom the land recognizes as the owner of the machine.</p>

<p>We cry shame on the feudal baron who forbade the peasant to turn a clod of earth unless he surrendered to his lord a fourth of his crop. We call those the barbarous times. But if the forms have changed, the relations have remained the same, and the worker is forced, under the name of free contract, to accept feudal obligations. For, turn where he will, he can find no better conditions. Everything has become private property, and he must accept, or die of hunger.</p>

<p>The result of this state of things is that all our production tends in a wrong direction. Enterprise takes no thought for the needs of the community. Its only aim is to increase the gains of the speculator. Hence the constant fluctuations of trade, the periodical industrial crises, each of which throws scores of thousands of workers on the streets.</p>

<p>The working people cannot purchase with their wages the wealth which they have produced, and industry seeks foreign markets among the monied classes of other nations. In the East, in Africa, everywhere, in Egypt, Tonkin or the Congo, the European is thus bound to promote the growth of serfdom. And so he does. But soon he finds everywhere similar competitors. All the nations evolve on the same lines, and wars, perpetual wars, break out for the right of precedence in the market. Wars for the possession of the East, wars for the empire of the sea, wars to impose duties on imports and to dictate conditions to neighbouring states; wars against those “blacks” who revolt! The roar of the cannon never ceases in the world, whole races are massacred, the states of Europe spend a third of their budgets in armaments; and we know how heavily these taxes fall on the workers.</p>

<p>Education still remains the privilege of a small minority, for it is idle to talk of education when the workman’s child is forced, at the age of thirteen, to go down into the mine or to help his father on the farm. It is idle to talk of studies to the worker, who comes home in the evening crushed by excessive toil with its brutalizing atmosphere. Society is thus bound to remain divided into two hostile camps, and in such conditions freedom is a vain word. The Radical begins by demanding a greater extension of political rights, but he soon sees that the breath of liberty leads to the uplifting of the proletariat, and then he turns round, changes his opinions, and reverts to repressive legislation and government by the sword.</p>

<p>A vast array of courts, judges, executioners, policemen, and gaolers is needed to uphold these privileges; and this array gives rise in its turn to a whole system of espionage, of false witness, of spies, of threats and corruption.</p>

<p>The system under which we live checks in its turn the growth of the social sentiment. We all know that without uprightness, without self-respect, without sympathy and mutual aid, human kind must perish, as perish the few races of animals living by rapine, or the slave-keeping ants. But such ideas are not to the taste of the ruling classes, and they have elaborated a whole system of pseudo-science to teach the contrary.</p>

<p>Fine sermons have been preached on the text that those who have should share with those who have not, but he who would act out this principle is speedily informed that these beautiful sentiments are all very well in poetry, but not in practice. “To lie is to degrade and besmirch oneself,” we say, and yet all civilized life becomes one huge lie. We accustom ourselves and our children to hypocrisy, to the practice of a double-faced morality. And since the brain is ill at ease among lies, we cheat ourselves with sophistry. Hypocrisy and sophistry become the second nature of the civilized man.</p>

<p>But a society cannot live thus; it must return to truth or cease to exist.</p>

<p>Thus the consequences which spring from the original act of monopoly spread through the whole of social life. Under pain of death, human societies are forced to return to first principles: the means of production being the collective work of humanity, the product should be the collective property of the race. Individual appropriation is neither just nor serviceable. All belongs to all. All things are for all men, since all men have need of them, since all men have worked in the measure of their strength to produce them, and since it is not possible to evaluate every one’s part in the production of the world’s wealth.</p>

<p>All things are for all. Here is an immense stock of tools and implements; here are all those iron slaves which we call machines, which saw and plane, spin and weave for us, unmaking and remaking, working up raw matter to produce the marvels of our time. But nobody has the right to seize a single one of these machines and say, “This is mine; if you want to use it you must pay me a tax on each of your products,” any more than the feudal lord of medieval times had the right to say to the peasant, “This hill, this meadow belong to me, and you must pay me a tax on every sheaf of corn you reap, on every rick you build.”</p>

<p>All is for all! If the man and the woman bear their fair share of work, they have a right to their fair share of all that is produced by all, and that share is enough to secure them well-being. No more of such vague formulas as “The Right to work,” or “To each the whole result of his labour.” What we proclaim is THE RIGHT TO WELL-BEING: WELL-BEING FOR ALL!</p>

<p>if he knew...even most of us here may not comprehend the extent of the wealth of the wealthy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dumb comment. Everyone knows that rich people are rich, and most people in Western Civilization are aware of how things work. No one is rioting. Some people are just better at making money than others. Some people are better looking than other people.</p>

<p>&quot;If ugly guys knew how many hot chicks good-looking guys were getting, there would be riots in the streets.&quot; </p>

<p>Chris Rock (along with most poor people) doesn&#39;t seem to understand that &quot;wealth&quot; is not finite; it&#39;s not a limited supply of gold coins that a few Mr Burns type people horde. What a foolish, childish way of thinking &amp; talking about wealth. Wealth can be created infinitely. No one is keeping anyone from becoming the richest person in history. You can invent a new computer operating system and dethrone Microsoft and Apple. You could develop an app that lots of people need. You could write classic novels, you could write hit songs, you could get really good at playing basketball, and on and on and on. The only thing keeping you from being the next Bill Gates is you and your lack of earth-changing ideas . The only thing keeping poor people from being rich is poor people <em>finding a way to make themselves really valuable to other people</em>.</p>

If you disagree let me know what you think might do it. 
Americans watched TARP in 08 the largest theft and or transfer of wealth in human history from the poor to the rich where Congress was threatened by the banking masters with martial law if they did not go back in change their vote and pass the bill. 
I knew after that nothing could wake Americans. The 28 pages from the 911 report showing we were lied to about funding of 911. Barely a few articles. 
Its utterly fascinating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism, as a system, tends to concentrate wealth and that&#39;s fine. The role of government has traditionally been to redistribute at least some of that wealth back down the chain to stimulate spending and investment across all wealth categories (as well as alleviate abject poverty).</p>

<p>The US government still does do that but I guess what&#39;s weird about it is that as wealth has become increasingly concentrated, as will happen in a capitalist system, the government has been backing off its role in redistribution. This has the effect of more and more wealth accumulating at the top.</p>

<p>In the past this kind of extreme accumulation has been bad for everyone (rich and poor alike). The political system of the US used to be able to recognize this and course correct accordingly. Today we&#39;re living in a political system that appears to have lost any connection to policy and real-world consequences. They&#39;re beholden to an odd set of ideologies, allegiances and special interests. The congress has lost the ability to make rational choices based on facts. And even though it will sound partisan this burden of irrationality falls mainly on the congresspeople identifying as republican.</p>

<p>Want to know how rich that is? Let me put it to you this way: You know how everyone talks about the 1%? The 1% are the big bad evil people right? According to <a href="https://dqydj.com/who-are-the-one-percent-united-states/">this article</a> to be in the 1% you must have a net worth of $10,374,030.10. To be in the 0.10% you must have a net worth of $43,090,281.00. I&#39;m not going to do the math anymore for you guys. But that should tell you all you need to know, he&#39;s full of shit.</p>

<p>Chris Rock isn&#39;t modestly rich, he&#39;s the kind makes him one of the richest people in human history. Know that the people Chris Rock is talking about are people that actually work 60+ hours a week. They actually produce products for our country. Chris Rock has an easy job where he probably works 60 hours in a year. I really don&#39;t like that the people who are lecturing real working people aren&#39;t working people and they are a whole lot wealthier than the people they claim are so evil.</p>
