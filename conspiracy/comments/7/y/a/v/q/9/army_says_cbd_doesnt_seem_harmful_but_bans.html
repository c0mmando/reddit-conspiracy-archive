He walked home with 90 Percocet and a refill.</p>

<p>To balance that out though,
I broke my hand and was not given anything, and told to buy ibuprofen over the counter.</p>

<p>Sometimes the military is dumb. 
But they do seem to go crazy with the pills!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>damn wtf, 90 + a refill? I got each of my wisdom teeth removed individually, and got one 15pill bottle with no refills of 7.5&#39;s. Why is there not more standardization around prescription amounts that doctors give out?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea it was pretty wild. 
I actually think that’s what led to him getting out, Short Story I could tell ya.</p>

<p>I agree, I think it’s crazy that there’s not, or at least doesn’t seem to be, some standard (problem)=(specified treatment)</p>

<p>Especially with that amount, I know doctors kind of work off their own thoughts but still.
Nobody needs over 200 pills, unless you’re ass is dying lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are starting to see the light.  Once you explain CBD vs THC and hemp vs canabis and get someone to try it for a couple weeks they are hooked.

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely correct. The strength of social programming effects those who don&#39;t even think it&#39;s evil and would benefit from it. My Mother is a very smart, holistic health supporter, and generally open minded person that supports my use of Cannabis/CBD. She knows it has massive benefits that would really help with health issues, but because of the social stigma/worry of drug testing (even though I show her lab results with 0% THC) she just won&#39;t try it.</p>
