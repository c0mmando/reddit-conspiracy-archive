       So i've been noticing this "NorthCrane" website that pushes bullshit, kinda like yournewswire.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked it up and found a ring of accounts all by the same person pushing it here.

       I might be tipsy right now, but tell me this isn't odd considering what's been going down recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Someone doesn't want this to be seen, at less than 70%, I guess I woke up some alts, they're downvoting all my post history. Interesting.

       I was reading the mod log and noticed another one was recently banned,

       That's called astro-turfing tho. It's not allowed on any sub, even the ones where alta are allowed.

       Go check the ban log, a high profile user was admin banned for getting caught astroturfing. Many accused of a lot of things. Funny he got hammered right before the news broke this week...

       No, I don't see anything 'shady' about a single person trying their 'best' to push a site they own for advertising money. A conspiracy is a bunch of people, not a single person. But I get where you are coming from.

       A ring of a single user, it seems. There are many legitimate actual groups or rings of people doing this kind of stuff, this one seems like a single person pushing some site he owns - it's not the same thing. You seem to think I don't feel there is a threat with groups of people getting paid to have opinions or push agendas on the internet?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do, that's not the case. I am only arguing that this is a single person trying to get hits on their website, it's not a conspiracy, it's just some fucking dude trying to make a buck - albeit in a disgusting way, still doesn't make it a conspiracy from this one person.

       I'm just trying to steer the sub in the right direction, I almost certainly will come out as a cunt to certain people. But believe me when I say I'm really just trying to get conversation in this sub on the right track, which is objective of course, but still - been here a long time - don't want to see bullshit.

       Like clockwork.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a psy-op that happens about once a month and has been going on for the past 5-6 months. Same pattern every time. Multiple accounts created. Always cross post between here and t_d. Always get "discovered". And finally, a post here that will reach the front page of this sub "proving" that "t-d bots" are invading the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would someone continue to use the same tactics that get them caught over and over again? They would have to be very, very stupid, or they want to get caught. Reddit is a pseudo-anonymous forum, so it is very hard to actually prove that an account is run by a bot, unless the accounts behave exactly like the accounts in question, in which case it is simply a matter of pointing it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we've either got a very stupid, very persistent person invading this sub once a month with a sqaud of bots, or we are being false flagged by someone who wants it to look that way. My money is on the latter.

       I love the mental gymnastics at work here. It really illustrates how confirmation bias pervades political discussion. Dirty liberals are always cheating, but not our team! Must be a false flag. Of course the liberals would massively spam the oppositions talking points and spin.

       I've posted the exact same comment on threads like this for 3 months straight.  The only mental gymnastics at work here are from the people that have seen this happening month after month and refuse to acknowledge that they are being played.

       Reddit is a pseudo-anonymous forum so there are not many ways for users, or mods, to actually tell if someone is using bots or sockpuppets.  I guess it's lucky for us that whoever is doing this always leaves breadcrumbs so the accounts can be linked, like using different variants of the same username.  It would be easy to not do that, so why don't they?  Because they want to get caught.

       Why would he care if he gets caught? No matter how many times he gets caught, he just starts new accounts and links to his page again, generating more revenue. As long as he keeps generating revenue from site visits because people here and on the TD click on his links, he has no reason to change strategy.

       Boom! Good work! I was wondering why this site was being so frequently pushed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has anyone else noticed in the last month the lack of posts? Yes, I'm aware the 2 month account rule went into effect, but this sub is getting less and less content posted. I surf new and it's taking less time to catch up in the feed, on a daily basis. Both fewer posts and more repeative, like if one more person posts about Google conspiracy reddit, I'mma shit myself.

       I've seen a lot of people here are just tired of all of the political posts, so maybe they don't come around as often or left altogether. But the biggest conspiracy theory at the moment involves politics, so it's no surprise it's talked about a lot.

       If you don’t think that there are also sock puppets working on Trump’s behalf just like CTR works against him, you are fooling yourself.

       TBH, it is why I find myself spending less and less time on T_D anymore, it is so full of pro-Trump bots and shills that most of the actual discussion is gone.  And I mostly support Trump (not without anger at certain actions I disapprove of).

       Why is American politics such a "huge" topic in the conspiracy world since trump has been elected? It it because people genuinly think he's not a "puppet" and will break corruption and TPTB?

       They've been having to use every trick in their book to scare Drumpf into doing what they want. He fears impeachment and being seen as a coward and they've been exploiting those two fears from the moment he was declared winner.

       Drumpf is a worthless POS but he isn't one of their puppets. Killary was supposed to win via election fraud. Drumpf was never meant to have any chance of winning. They only allowed him to be there because they needed someone who could be painted as being even worse than Killary, with the ultimate goal of creating an illusion of widespread support for Killary (to prevent a situation in which the majority of the country screams
       <em>
        election fraud
       </em>
       ).
       <br/>
       The only reason we have Drumpf in the White House right now is that the altered voting machine software didn't properly factor in the electoral college. The software gave Killary the majority of the votes like it was supposed to (while properly giving the appearance of a close race) but it failed on the electoral college part.
       <br/>
       That's why CIA &amp; friends freaked out so hard &amp; sloppy after the election. They had no contingency plan for Drumpf because they thought it wasn't possible for him to win.

       What a terrible use of election fraud, if they didn't know how the election works. Especially when the electoral college won an election over the popular vote in 2000. I'd have to wonder how anyone so incompetent would have the ability to complete any kind of election fraud.

       I pretty much agree with exactly everything you've put forth except the last sentiment. In the grand scheme I preferred Hillary take the loss but I certainly had no good wishes to see Trump as President, and whatever "extension" we have on this game is barely bought time. Just call me pessimistic, we're gonna get what's coming to us, but for now I'll keeping on fighting.

       a recent deadman drop revealed there's millions of AI on the internet, debating each other...  They avoid detection by only responding/debating with other bots.  The rest of us get sucked into their debates but we're basically just cheerleaders.

       You just found someone with multiple accounts who is bad at astroturfing. Also the first post 'Jew' in the_donald will get your account banned from the sub. Many active people have multiple accounts.

       Wow this is unfuckingbelievable. This fucking narcissist is at the head of the most powerful country in the world? It really explains a lot of the shilling and propaganda that is ubiquitous in subs like these. This guy is a propaganda expert and if people don't think there is a vast internet propaganda campaign to make him look better they are mistaken.

       Goes both ways though, doesn't it? So long as you're pretending the ruskies and the trumpers are the only ones shilling, you're setting a pretty strict limit on the number of people who can take you seriously.

       I pretty much agree with exactly everything you've put forth except the last sentiment. In the grand scheme I preferred Hillary take the loss but I certainly had no good wishes to see Trump as President, and whatever "extension" we have on this game is barely bought time. Just call me pessimistic, we're gonna get what's coming to us, but for now I'll keeping on fighting.

       I've posted the exact same comment on threads like this for 3 months straight.  The only mental gymnastics at work here are from the people that have seen this happening month after month and refuse to acknowledge that they are being played.

       Reddit is a pseudo-anonymous forum so there are not many ways for users, or mods, to actually tell if someone is using bots or sockpuppets.  I guess it's lucky for us that whoever is doing this always leaves breadcrumbs so the accounts can be linked, like using different variants of the same username.  It would be easy to not do that, so why don't they?  Because they want to get caught.
