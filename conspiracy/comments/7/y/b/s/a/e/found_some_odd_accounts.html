<p>I looked it up and found a ring of accounts all by the same person pushing it here.</p>

<p>*<a href="/u/jdmiller6">/u/jdmiller6</a> posted once on TD with the &quot;Jew&quot; angle NorthCrane uses</p>

<p><a href="/u/JDMiller8">/u/JDMiller8</a></p>

<p>*<a href="/u/jdmiller9">/u/jdmiller9</a></p>

<p><a href="/u/jdmiller10">/u/jdmiller10</a></p>

<p><a href="/u/JDMILLER11">/u/JDMILLER11</a></p>

<p><a href="/u/jdmiller12">/u/jdmiller12</a></p>

<p><a href="/u/JohnDonMiller">/u/JohnDonMiller</a></p>

<p>I might be tipsy right now, but tell me this isn&#39;t odd considering what&#39;s been going down recently.</p>

<p>Edit: Someone doesn&#39;t want this to be seen, at less than 70%, I guess I woke up some alts, they&#39;re downvoting all my post history. Interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A ring of a single user, it seems. There are many legitimate actual groups or rings of people doing this kind of stuff, this one seems like a single person pushing some site he owns - it&#39;s not the same thing. You seem to think I don&#39;t feel there is a threat with groups of people getting paid to have opinions or push agendas on the internet?</p>

<p>If you do, that&#39;s not the case. I am only arguing that this is a single person trying to get hits on their website, it&#39;s not a conspiracy, it&#39;s just some fucking dude trying to make a buck - albeit in a disgusting way, still doesn&#39;t make it a conspiracy from this one person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like clockwork.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a psy-op that happens about once a month and has been going on for the past 5-6 months. Same pattern every time. Multiple accounts created. Always cross post between here and t_d. Always get &quot;discovered&quot;. And finally, a post here that will reach the front page of this sub &quot;proving&quot; that &quot;t-d bots&quot; are invading the sub.</p>

<p>Why would someone continue to use the same tactics that get them caught over and over again? They would have to be very, very stupid, or they want to get caught. Reddit is a pseudo-anonymous forum, so it is very hard to actually prove that an account is run by a bot, unless the accounts behave exactly like the accounts in question, in which case it is simply a matter of pointing it out.</p>

<p>So we&#39;ve either got a very stupid, very persistent person invading this sub once a month with a sqaud of bots, or we are being false flagged by someone who wants it to look that way. My money is on the latter.</p>

<p>Reddit is a pseudo-anonymous forum so there are not many ways for users, or mods, to actually tell if someone is using bots or sockpuppets.  I guess it&#39;s lucky for us that whoever is doing this always leaves breadcrumbs so the accounts can be linked, like using different variants of the same username.  It would be easy to not do that, so why don&#39;t they?  Because they want to get caught.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Drumpf is a worthless POS but he isn&#39;t one of their puppets. Killary was supposed to win via election fraud. Drumpf was never meant to have any chance of winning. They only allowed him to be there because they needed someone who could be painted as being even worse than Killary, with the ultimate goal of creating an illusion of widespread support for Killary (to prevent a situation in which the majority of the country screams <em>election fraud</em>).<br/>
The only reason we have Drumpf in the White House right now is that the altered voting machine software didn&#39;t properly factor in the electoral college. The software gave Killary the majority of the votes like it was supposed to (while properly giving the appearance of a close race) but it failed on the electoral college part.<br/>
That&#39;s why CIA &amp; friends freaked out so hard &amp; sloppy after the election. They had no contingency plan for Drumpf because they thought it wasn&#39;t possible for him to win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow this is unfuckingbelievable. This fucking narcissist is at the head of the most powerful country in the world? It really explains a lot of the shilling and propaganda that is ubiquitous in subs like these.

    <div class="md"><p>I pretty much agree with exactly everything you&#39;ve put forth except the last sentiment. In the grand scheme I preferred Hillary take the loss but I certainly had no good wishes to see Trump as President, and whatever &quot;extension&quot; we have on this game is barely bought time. Just call me pessimistic, we&#39;re gonna get what&#39;s coming to us, but for now I&#39;ll keeping on fighting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve posted the exact same comment on threads like this for 3 months straight.  The only mental gymnastics at work here are from the people that have seen this happening month after month and refuse to acknowledge that they are being played.</p>

<p>Reddit is a pseudo-anonymous forum so there are not many ways for users, or mods, to actually tell if someone is using bots or sockpuppets.  I guess it&#39;s lucky for us that whoever is doing this always leaves breadcrumbs so the accounts can be linked, like using different variants of the same username.  It would be easy to not do that, so why don&#39;t they?  Because they want to get caught.</p>
