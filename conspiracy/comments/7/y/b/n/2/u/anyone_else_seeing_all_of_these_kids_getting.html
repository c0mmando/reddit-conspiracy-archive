       This doesn’t make any sense. All of a sudden this tragic episode happens and now all these kids parents and other family members are turning in their kids because they’re also plotting. Something about all of this just seems very odd. Why all of a sudden, why are these stories coming out now. I seen a kid that was arrested in my neighboring town even. What’s the end game here?

       Which part of it?  I am not a mind reader, so I don't actually know what is motivating people to turn their children in.  However, in the Sandy Hook and Florida massacres, the shooter killed their parents first.

       No, but their parents had to pay millions of dollars to the victim's families.  Perhaps another reason to turn the kids in?

       Wow no kidding. That’s really crazy. Those poor people. That’s pretty unjust. I don’t know much about all these shootings but I’m sure they felt just as bad if not worse as the rest of the world when they heard about the incident. Then to learn it was your kid?! I really think at that time I might seriously consider hanging myself. I would be to weak to deal with the thought of that.

       Yes, and I posted one here where some kids got arrested the weekend before almost scoping out the school. There was another one where a grandma stopped her kin, I'm sure there are a lot more.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's scary how kids are being pushed to do this stuff. Between online propaganda of turning the "others" into non-human demons, psycho-pharmaceuticals, and more bullshit it's getting scary out here.

       Good points for discussion.  You might keep updating the main post with links to various people who have turned family members in.  It does seem like there is something more to it, but whether it is driven by a "conspiracy" or just common actions is the big question.

       I’m not sure how to link to pages sadly but I seen at least 3 in the last 2 days. One from a town 10 minutes away even. Everyone is so caught up in the gun discussion but not talking about these kids getting arrested and for all we know it could be he said she said and a bunch of finger pointing.

       This is what’s scary though because if we start stereotyping this is only going to get worse. The weirdo is usually the really nice and normal kids. A lot of people just don’t take time to get to know them. I’m glad that when I was in school I treated everyone the same. There was no weirdo in my eyes, unless you were a serious reject. Like throwing chlorine in the air vents or something.

       I feel like all of it is fake. They’re just trying to say. Look we found this person who said something that we deemed dangerous, randomly arrested them, and isn’t it so great that we prevented another awful tragedy!!!!? I don’t like the idea of giving the FBI more power to arrest people and it may be a complete violation of privacy

       Fuck man this world pisses me off so much. I hate how brainwashed people are and it’s like mandatory that we have to feel sad for victims of mass shootings. How many people die a year from mass shootings? Probably less than 200. Now let’s compare that to the 90,000 alcohol related deaths per year. Big difference right, but people get so emotional over these mass shootings, many of them have a lot of fishy things going on in the official narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is I can live with a few mass shootings each year, because it’s better than giving up our freedom only so we can given even more power to US government funded institutions like the FBI. You know the same US government that has reportedly and ruthlessly killed about 20 million people since World War 2 ended.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope im not Alone in this but it kinda feels like very few people are as logical as I am when it comes to this whole mass shooting discussion

       I wouldn’t care if I lost a family member to a mass shooting. It’s an almost unavoidable event if it happens. Just like if I lost a family member in a car accident, what exactly would I try and do about it?? Advocate for banning roads?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is so rare and you are playing the if this happens game or the if that happens I bet you would feel a lot different. It hasn’t happened yet and it doesn’t happen. Do you know anyone who has lost a family member or has died in a mass shooting? No, you don’t because it rarely happens, and sometimes when it does happen it is a complete hoax, like we saw with Sandy Hook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just don’t rely on institutions like the FBI to save you from a possible suspect online who’s posting disturbing things. Like wtf. You have to rely on yourself to be prepared, don’t beg for government to save u

       WTF, you have no idea what you’re talking about at all. You care more about the families of the 17 kids than you do about the millions of people suffering in unbearable and chaotic conditions in Venezuela. You care more about the families of these kids than you do about the massive civil war in Syria that wipes out hundreds or thousands of innocent people each day. But you have the nerve to claim that I don’t care about anyone other than myself? No, you have it all wrong. I’m just saying we need to get our proportions right here. We solve the biggest problems first, and then we work on solving very minor issues like mass shootings. Is that too hard for your nut sized brain to understand?

       You do realize it’s possible to care about more than one thing at once right? I care about the plight of those outside our country and inside as well. However, the problems we face inside our country should probably get priority before we turn outwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I wouldn’t exactly call mass shootings a minor issue. It’s a massive point of shame for our country. The mass deaths of innocent people is not a minor issue.

       Even if you were to only focus on issues within the country, this is a very minor ordeal. There are 44 homicide deaths, 90 car accident deaths, and 1,645 cancer deaths on average each day in the USA. Yet everyone is zoned in on this singular tragic event. It’s artificially hyped up by the media, and you know it. You’re brainwashed, just admit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if you were worried about this country you would be more concerned about stopping the lunatics at the top, not the lunatics at the bottom of the pyramid. The lunatics like the people who run the federal reserve, and the few hundred giant capitalists that own all the factories, all the shares, and all the newspapers. These scumbags also drive America into extremely costly wars and they finance both sides on many occasions. These are also the very same scumbags that own the media that hypes up this most recent mass shooting. I hope you get red pilled just a little by this but you are very brainwashed and it will take a lot to change your world view into something that isn’t divorced from reality

       What do you mean we’re doing nothing about it? We’re talking about this stuff every day. There’s proposals being made every day. Do we need metal detectors in schools? Do we need to give the FBI the power to arrest anyone who makes a threatening post on social media? Do we need to make even more gun laws and restrictions on people who can get a gun? I tend to think that all of this is a violation of privacy and it completely puts safety over liberty, and that is something I’m not a fan of. I can live with a few mass shootings a year because whether you like it or not it’s just not that big of a problem. You hate when I say it but it’s true. Mass shootings are not a big problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course you lean left. Leftists tend to lack critical thinking skills as they favor putting their emotions before logic and they fear offending any group of people that they deem a “persecuted minority”.

       Yeah, we’re really not doing a thing to prevent them. I think the gun ownership should be a privilege, not a right, but any instance of someone putting forth meaningful legislation to work towards that is either laughed down or just shut out. The healthcare system in this country, as it currently is, will never allow people, especially the disadvantaged, to use it easily and readily to treat mental illness. Nothing is being done to alleviate that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I don’t really know how else to tell you but you REALLY should care more about your fellow countrymen. The statistical likelihood of their possible death doesn’t matter. All innocent deaths have equal weight and should have equal measures to prevent them from happening again. It’s really not cool or edgy or “logical” to not care about people; it just makes you look like a lonely asshole.

       Less is more less is more less is more. I bet you agree with President Trumps proposal to lower the cost of prescription drugs. I don’t. Many of these drugs likely lead to even more mental illness and more crazy behavior and more overdoses and more death and more despair. The quality of health care does not determine the health of a nation ok. We spend way too much on health care already. The government spends probably a trillion dollars a year on health, but it isn’t helping because it seems like Americans are getting more and more obese each year and the average lifespan of Americans is actually going down, that is a recent trend. More money into healthcare does not mean it’s better necessarily. It’s probably time for people to get off the pills and the drugs and the anti depressants if anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do we fix health? We improve the quality of food. I also think part of the mental health problem has to do with just people having less money and income inequality. The percentage of disposable income for people in the bottom 90% of America continues to go down each year. Wouldn’t you think it’s just a natural trend that we see more extremists as America devolves into something other than a 1st world country?
      </p>
      <p>
       Still as of now mass shootings are not a big problem in America they probably measure at around a .5 on the Richter scale of America’s problems. The biggest problem being central bank collusion with S&amp;P 500 corporations along with massive military spending to fight wars that benefit us in no way. And one of the smallest problems being mass shootings

       I’d agree that the quality of healthcare doesn’t determine the health of a nation. Despite us spending a metric fuckton on it, the average lifespan of an American is decreasing because of lack of coverage. The best healthcare in the world won’t save someone who can’t access it. Our private insurance, which is outrageously expensive and covers jack shit, is breaking the health of this nation. And it of course disproportionately affects the poor. Under a single-payer system, all could be covered and pursue the means to treat their physical and mental health.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’d also agree on getting people off of a lot of pills as well. More specifically, opioids. Anti-depressants did wonders for me though. The problem is the over prescription of highly addictive drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’d also agree that income inequality negatively affects someone’s mental health. Add in a lack of affordable education, housing, and childcare and we’d agree even more. Nothing wrecks someone’s mental health in the long term like poverty does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apart from all of that though. I saw one of your previous posts about your self harm. Reach out to me man. Self harm gripped me for three years and I wouldn’t wish that shit on anyone. I know it’s hard to talk about but seriously, reach out man.

       Oh, please. Your comment immediately before that was "Oh please. U grow up it’s not that big a deal." Is that the sort of alternative you're putting forth as "critical thinking skills?" I hope not, because to me it just sounds like what you're doing is the same old lazy-ass partisan dehumanization of the enemy that drives me crazy when my fellow leftists do it. Not a good way to impress your superior right-wing intellect on us.

       Okay, then I will proceed to not take anything else you say seriously in the slightest. That was the point you intended, right?

       It's not what you were saying, it's the way you seem to only use these 
accusations about "emotion" and such to get what you want, moment by moment. There's no discernible principle behind any of it. That feels like something worth calling out in our current political moment, especially since you

       It’s an observation I have made. Liberals tend to operate on emotion and feelings rather than facts and logic. It’s why they vehemently defend Transgenders and discrimination against Transgenders despite the fact that they have a 44% attempted suicide rate and in all likelihood have a mental illness that needs to be addressed with something other than a surgical gender changing procedure. This is just one example, I can explain many more examples of this that I find

       I understand where you’re coming from and you’re right in the sense that booze kills a lot of people and we can put cigarettes in this topic too of course. At the end of the day though a life is a life and nobody wants to see a shooting of any kind especially when you’re involving children. That’s heart breaking. Things need to change because this world is sick. I don’t know how we all agree to live under a government that is willing to feed its population a stick of tobacco that is filled with nothing but deadly chemicals and poisons. Willingly and knowingly that this will cause sickness and death in a mass scale and turn around and charge us for treatment. This is one small example of course but, where did we go wrong. At what point in time did we start caring about a government that could care less about us. You can explode your brain the further down the rabbit hole you go thinking about stuff like this. It will drive you crazy.

       I would care more about the victims of these shootings if everyone else didn’t do it for me. I think there’s enough people worrying about this. Why is this a more major world story than the crisis in Venezuela? There’s another where did we go wrong kind of moments.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I truly don’t care about the families of these victims, I just don’t. Do they care that I’m depressed and I hate my life and I cut myself to feel better? No, they don’t at all. I guess I care about anyone who suffers unjustly and I feel for people who do, but there’s a lot more places I could put my care than in a mass shooting that killed just 17 people. I wonder how many innocent people died in Syria today. Right. Nobody cares about that shit though

       so you're depressed, a self-harmer. And you're worried about your freedoms to carry a firearm? IMO you shouldn't have a gun if you're fucked up enough where you cut for release.

       priorities man. people get really upset because it's like a life that has so much potential is quickly snuffed out, where as most people who have heart attacks or are alcoholics are 35+ years old or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       i feel you though. in this day &amp; age, people
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be more upset that Big Pharma is purposefully avoiding a cure for cancer or heart disease, but they aren't. because that's a more complicated issue that feels more passive (&amp; not really a newsworthy "event") or is more easily ignored until it's too late, it doesn't strike a chord with people like a great tragedy such as a school shooting, so MSM doesn't blast Big Pharma/Healthcare Conspiracies in the populations faces like it does with other events.

       Not sure if anyone in the mainland heard about this one, but this past week a middle school here on Oahu had terroristic threatening case from social media. School had a cops monitoring the campus all morning.

       They're still on the search for the person who posted it. These fuckin kids nowadays have no empathy to their own actions.

       Anyone sick of seeing the school shooting crap being pushed by shills?

       Not saying you are one, but you are still succumbing to the discussion agenda they are pushing.

       Not saying that these events didn't happen but I do believe the narrative on all these events lately has been gun control and now its pushing for better profiling of people to stop the "maniac" before he acts. Its just a constant barrage of increasingly more fucked up events to wear down the psyche until everyone mentally is tired of fighting for freedom and ready to give up their rights for any false sense of security TPTB can offer them.

       I think it could largely be explained by three factors: the copy-cat effect, law enforcement not wanting to guess wrong on the real thing, and national media paying more attention because of the recency of the Florida shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       For at least some portion of these school shooters (or at least what we're led to believe), at least part of the motivation is fame of some sort. These are boys and young men with troubled lives and little prospects, and seeing the attention, even and maybe especially the revulsion these shooters get can seem a good alternative to their lives of quiet desperation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, local police and the FBI have been heavily criticized over their lack of response to reports and warning signs. Events like this will always lead to increased and even excessive vigilance. That's just human nature and not wanting to get caught with their pants down, especially when the whole country is watching. The same probably goes for parents or relatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my local news market of maybe a couple million people, it seems at least a few times a year there's a story about a kid getting arrested for a bomb threat or school shooting plot. None of these make national news. Extrapolate that out to the whole country, and you probably have an arrest like this a few times a week, maybe even daily. Normally, none of these reaches national news, but in the aftermath of an actual shooting, they get picked up because the newspeople find it relevant to the current "outrage of the week." People will view and click on these stories this week, while two weeks ago they would have gotten a tenth of the attention, even if the stories were promoted the same.

       Is nobody here familiar with the fact that America created terrorism? Every kind of terrorism, from 9/11 to school shootings.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll find that MSM's (distorted) portrayal of events leads everyone into thinking terrorism happens due to existing gun laws and protection force failure. So they shovel more money into funding the military force, push for weapon ban, and suddenly your entire life is in the state's hands.

       They say it's about "gun control" no they won't be able to take em all away, they can make more laws and what not but the end game is purely to drive fear into the people. We can't even blame Isis for an attack anymore because people finally got the idea that they are u.s. created and financed. So we're going back to school shootings. Soon it'll be the Mexicans and drug dealing African American communities again... and you rinse and repeat. Just to drive fear to keep police in work and eventually militrize them.

       what is strange? i believe that this happens after 9/11 with muslims too. i believe that this is a common pattern of suspicion that arise with the fear of the population towards those groups.
