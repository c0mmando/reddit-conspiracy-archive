        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, fuck it, I know UFO and alien stuff was being pushed hard here until they started pushing the school shooting, but it is fun to think about and I thought I would post this thought.</p>

<p>Also, if you have seen my comments in other UFO threads, I personally believe that UFOs are not ships that are piloted by organisms (those are just secret earth tech) but probes which use some form of energy beam to collect data.  Similar to a laser beam being used on a window to hear conversations but way more advanced.  A photon beam based probe is the most likely solution to crossing distances or space or even time and dimensions.  “Aliens” are probably humans from another time and or dimension.</p>

<p>So, very often the argument for intelligent life in the universe is presented as a statistical certainty.  The argument does that since the universe is functionally infinite, now matter how tiny the probability is of intelligent life, there are enough planets to make it a near certainty.  What is generally debated is whether, due to the nearly infinite distances, there is any chance at all two intelligent civilizations could <em>ever</em> actually notice or contact one another.</p>

<p>Well, I just want to throw out this argument for the possibility that we are the only life in the universe, it is not my “belief” in the sense that I don’t commit to an opinion on whether there is or isn’t other life, both possibilities are interesting.  I do believe that there has been no evidence that extraterrestrial life is required to explain, that is simply the easy go-to explanation for things that could be much weirder in a space-time physics context (and inter dimensional human contact isn’t any less incredible really).</p>

<p>So, the basis of the argument for other life is essentially that there exists some probability <em>p</em>&gt;0 for there to be a planet with all the requirements for intelligent life to develop.  The argument continues that the number of planets, <em>n</em> in the universe basically approaches infinity, and can be treated as infinity.  Therefore, no matter how few of those planets meet the criteria of <em>p</em>, the result in simple terms is:</p>

<p><em>n</em>&gt;1/<em>p</em> and <em>n</em>/(1/<em>p</em>)&gt;1
 and Lim<em>n</em>x<em>p</em>-&gt;infinity</p>

<p>Meaning no matter how few planets meet the criteria <em>p</em> there are so many planets that there must be a nearly infinite amount that do meet <em>p</em>, thus extraterrestrial intelligent life is certain.</p>

<p>But, while the statistics make intuitive sense, this seems to not take any account into some factor that must ask how many other universal objects are required to produce <em>p</em>!?</p>

<p>In other words, rather than consider our solar system a discreet system in the universe, we know that it is a infinitesimally small part of the Milky Way galaxy, which is an even smaller part of the universe.  And we theorize many different possible ways that not only our planet, but also our sun, and at large our galaxy formed (not going to bother with how it <em>all</em> formed).</p>

<p>Most theories propose interactions of gravity and cosmic dust and radiation and such.  Meaning that to just form the <em>sun</em> took an interaction of mind-boggling complexity of <em>who knows</em> how many objects in the universe!  And that isn’t even getting into the formation of planets!</p>

<p>So, now, for there to be a <em>p</em>&gt;0, there is also and <strong>N</strong> that is the number of celestial objects and interactions required to produce <em>p</em>.  (There is obviously also a <strong>P</strong> which is the probability of the number <strong>N</strong> of those objects interacting in the correct way to produce <em>p</em> but I want to avoid recursiveness)</p>

<p>Now at length, and when taking into account my note about <strong>P</strong> and recursiveness, one may say that the relation of <strong>N</strong> and <strong>P</strong> can simply be “rolled in” to the relation of <em>n</em> and <em>p</em>, but that is the assumption I wish to address.  We are dealing with things that may tend to infinity, but are to the best of our knowledge not actually infinite.</p>

<p>Just how large is <strong>N</strong>!?  The real question could be whether it tends to infinity or is <em>significantly less</em> than infinity as a discrete value.  We don’t know, so this argument says that it <em>does</em> tend to infinity.  So now you have:</p>

<p>Lim(<em>n</em>x<em>p</em>)/<strong>N</strong> = 1 (earth)</p>

<p>Or infinity divided by infinity equals one.</p>

<p>We could be alone merely because it requires the <em>entire universe</em> just to produce enough planets for a single one meeting the conditions for life to develop.  The idea is that it isn’t just a probability based on the simple number of planets, but of how many objects are required to produce each one.  This severely limits the effect of near infinity upon the base probability of life.</p>

<p>I thought this up while considering what a vegetarian friend told me their own reason for being a vegetarian was that it takes (quantities estimated) 500lbs of grain to produce 1lb of beef.  I thought that was a rather good reason.  Then I thought about the fact that it doesn’t just take that 500lb of grain, it takes all the people who grow and transport the grain, and all of the people who make everything required to transport or produce the water fertilizer and so on that the person used to grow the grain and on and on... in other words, it wasn’t just that 500lbs of grain for one pound of beef, there was a massive number of interactions just to produce the grain.</p>

<p>I thought about this in regard to the question “why would the universe be so large if there is nothing else out there?” And it made me wonder that if it takes a system of such exponentially large number of actions just to produce something as mundane as a pound of beef, imagine how fucking massive the system of interactions would need to be to produce the earth.  The result is this post.</p>

<p>I welcome any comments or thoughts, and again reiterate that I am only trying to illustrate an argument for this, not convince anyone it is fact.</p>

<p>Edit:  Just a note about the possibility of non-carbon based life:  I noted that, and another person also pointed that possibility out.  I didn’t really deal with that because it is simply a huge unknown.  Could it exist?  Probably.  Could it be intelligent?  Hell, even experts who try to study carbon based intelligence and consciousness don’t really understand it now, so that is impossible to answer.  Further, if non-carbon based life exists and developed conscious intelligence, would it even be perceptible to us?  Again, no way to know.  That is mostly why i left that out, there isn’t really any logic to apply.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I don’t.  And I did mention that in the post, that it is theorized to be finite.  You couldn’t have an expanding universe if it were infinite for there would be nothing for it to expand into.  And my whole argument was operating on that assumption.  I mean, really when we are talking about the universe, pretty much everything is going to be in the realm of assumptions and theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good quote.  That is what makes the whole damned thing so difficult to even conceive to be honest.  You can try to read current theories about this, but it is hard to make any sense of even with a mathematics background.  And it very well could be a lot of bullshit that is so complex most people just assume it is true. That is why I was trying to explain in such simplified and broad terms, anyone should be able to follow the logic of that argument even if they think I am wrong.  Hell, I am not even saying it is right, just presenting a logical argument for how it may be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I will start with the last one because you simply misunderstood that...  meat did exist before humans, I am talking only about every action involve in a specific price of meat which is the one you would find in a supermarket, not any meat anywhere.</p>

<p>All the rest are just wrong, at least as understood or theorized by current science.  Universal expansion means that at some point (the Big Bang generally) Everything was a singularity.  Therefore everything in the entire universe has something to do with every other thing.  There exists not one single speck of matter that did not at some point in the existence of its atoms interact with every other bit of matter that exists.  </p>

<p>Obviously, if our theories are completely wrong, this along with everything else goes completely out the window.</p>

<p>The natural process of creating meat is also complex when you look at each step - Doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s unlikely to occur, which is the mistake you&#39;re making. </p>

<p>Considering the theory is that the “big bag of marbles” was at one point a single particle, yes, that is exactly true.</p>

<p>Again, this is operating in the terms of this theory which is well known.  If you disagree with the Big Bang entirely, that is your prerogative.  I am not advocating it, just using its framework for this conjecture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are no &quot;aliens&quot; from another planet. Flying disc have been around from the begining of time because ancient culture had knowledge past down from &quot;winged beings&quot; , fallen angels.

<p>Right now on Netflix conspiracies series they have one of the episodes goes into a baker who was thrown in prison for hacking (successfully) into a goverment computer (back in the 90s?)... anyways he got into a file pointing to the fact the crafts weren&#39;t from outer space, they were ours and some other free energy type stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True.  That is what I think is interesting to think about with these things; take aliens off the table completely.  Just saying aliens is like a magic wand that can cover anything because we can just assign to them “advanced technology” and make anything possible.

    <div class="md"><p>The probability is such, however, that anyone concluding that there is &quot;therefore no life in the universe&quot; is going directly against logic in a very direct way.</p>

<p>Additionally, these are just abstractions that are being postulated by the video and by your OP.  The actual fact of the matter is that there have been SOOOOO many cases of anomalous and ET-based occurrences in history that no real intelligent human can logically conclude that there is no ET life in the universe - as well as on and about this very planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it would be pretty arrogant for us to assume we&#39;re the only beings in the universe. If the criteria for life is correct (being within a certain distance of a sun) then there are literally millions of suns out there, perhaps more, each potentially supporting life on orbiting planets. It&#39;s statistically impossible that we&#39;re the only ones. Even Mars falls under that criteria (although my personal belief is that Mars did once support life but is now a dead planet) </p>

<p>That said, the thought that we have been or still are being visited by other beings from other planets is another matter entirely. I&#39;m not so sure they would want to have any involvement with us. It&#39;s far more likely IMO that the &quot;beings&quot; visiting us for nefarious reasons, such as abductions or experimentation purposes are visiting us from other dimensions, or they&#39;re already inhabiting our planet. </p>
