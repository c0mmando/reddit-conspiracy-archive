However, not in the literal form, but, in a philosophical/symbolic form (ie. you either ascend with the change in vibration/enlightment, or descend and remain in somewhat ignorant stasis - to go mad or be lead to the slaughter).

<p>Strong AI is a ways off. I know there are a few people who are sticking around just to play stump the AI.  </p>

<p>Automation... its greatest devastation will be in automating business systems.  smart contract technology leading to autonomous organizations. Real Estate in the future will be an entirely automated process.  </p>

<p>lots of jobs will just not exist anymore.  thats a hurdle we have yet to cross.  i am not confident in how thats going to play out at the moment.  </p>

<p>the third density experiment in many-ness is drawing to a close  this earth logos and its subsequent dimensional experessions will move into the full 4th density. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok.  so if all thats true... then what? whats the soloution, whats the next move.  if its all just half disinformation half truth as per the operating model. ok.  then what... </p>

<p>i will agree.   Read the entire Law of One if you are able. The core knowledge is contained in its pages.  as with all things, you will need to have some sharp contextualization skills and the more you know before your journey, the better the outcome.  Ra is just another entity/smc making their way. another self from another time.  </p>

<p>hidden hand now i remember.  wasnt that all sorcha faal secureteam10 and that other weird dude.  not cory or dave but the really  weird one.  no not that guy from ancient aliens... </p>

<p>those are the one who tell you victory is just around the corner and or the end of the world or ww3-10 are underway.  </p>

<p>just serve the creator.   itll all work out.  </p>

basically in the fallout of the &quot;age of destruction&quot; there&#39;s not much else one can succeed in besides improving the ways they fail. there&#39;s no escape for anyone from the spiral of transmogrification... surely the collapse will be an integral part of the present-future, a routine our successors will be forced to deal with daily, yet I fear we are facing imminent catastrophes (global, financial, social, whathaveyou) - the likes of which the quote-on-quote <em>modern</em> world hasn&#39;t seen for millennia - and yet there may actually be quite little chance of survival for the majority of our species

    <div class="md"><p>There is no conclusive proof that we are in the actual zodiacal Age of Aquarius right now. We may be in the beginning or middle of the zodiacal transitioning from Pisces to Aquarius, hence all of the chaos and uncertainty. We still have the Abrahamic religions in place. The Age of Aquarius may not begin until the 22nd century or beyond. Our entire lives may be spent in a transition. </p>

<p>In my studies, the opposite sign on the zodiac wheel plays a part in the religious for the age (opposite Pisces was Virgo - Jesus the Fisher of men, birthed by Mary the Virgin). Aquarius, the water-bearer, has it&#39;s opposite sign on the zodiac wheel being that of Leo, the lion. In terms of planets, Leo is represented by the sun. </p>

<p>I&#39;d remain watchful in the coming years of signs of a new religious movement starting, perhaps by way of &quot;natural disasters.&quot; Or a continuation of the &quot;New Age&quot;. I can&#39;t tell at this point yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The age only refers to the stars and our universal alignment. Like a universal clock. Nothing more. Boring, right? That&#39;s why Chinese have a cyclical calendar with repeating &quot;animals&quot;. Just another second in a minute in an hour in a day in a week in a month in a year. All the shit you can&#39;t see is just spinning around and around and looping. Shit goes way further back than is recorded, like 12 21 12. Mayans and shit. Same type of and just as smart of people 10, 20, 30k years ago passing on knowledge of the skies. Pretty easy to figure out if you have 10k years to work with. Native Americans have 10k year old stories and bloodlines, why wouldn&#39;t the Mayans, who were a mere couple three thousand miles away. &quot;Age&quot; is just a diferent hour on a universal clock.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;Whereupon one of the priests, a prodigiously old man, said, &quot;O Solon, Solon, you Greeks are but children: there is not such a thing as an old Greek.....You are young in soul, every one of you. For there in you possess not a single belief that is ancient and derived from old tradition, nor yet one science that is hoary with age.&quot; - Plato</p>

<p>Millennials, Gen z, whoever, will be the &quot;son[s] of man&quot; to return the way of life that harmonizes with the Earth and all other life. Only you can choose how to prepare, love or fear</p>
