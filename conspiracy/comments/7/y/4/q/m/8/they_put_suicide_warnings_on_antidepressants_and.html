        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Its common knowledge that SSRIs SNRIs and other psychiatric mind bending drugs are potentially dangerous. Not only are they only marginally more effective than placebo in many cases, but the side effects of actually making people suicidal or violent are quite common.</p>

<p>Since these drugs are handed out to kids who literally arent old enough to wipe their own asses yet(as young as 2!), whose brains and neurotransmitter systems are still delicately forming, and since they allow direct to &quot;consumer&quot; advertising on US TV, maybe they need to include a violent behavior warning too?</p>

<p>What do you guys think? Ive personally watched these drugs warp the minds of kids and adults who were otherwise healthy normal people and turned them into lobotomized zombies.</p>

<p>I have personal experience as well. About 25 years ago they doped me up on ADD drugs and switched me to antidepressants and it was a six year long rollercoaster of living in a nightmarish Hell on Earth. </p>

<p>For those too young to remember, it was the fad back in the 90s to drug kids with Ritalin(basically speed) if they talked too much or, in my case, thought the busy work in school was BS and couldn&#39;t be bothered to do it. </p>

<p>Fortunately i got myself off all that shit and havent touched it since the late 90s. Having the experience i did, as well as watching other people in similar situations, some of them never breaking free of their zombification, has given me insight as to just how corrupt the drug companies and the doctors who push them are.</p>

<p>As an anecdote, i knew a doctor who said he wouldnt push a specific drug unless the drug company also paid for his wife to go on the lavish all expenses paid kickback vacations they used to hand out to doctors.</p>

<p>As far as i can tell, things have gotten worse since the 90s, with the use of psych meds of all types skyrocketing. I never heard of 6 year olds on them back then, much less 2 year olds, which is apparently a thing nowadays.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that i couldnt live in Hell any longer. It was chemical torture. It was like being out of control of my own mind, and my mind is my most precious asset.</p>

<p>My body and mind rejected it as the blunting, warping poison that it was. I was traumatized as fuck by the time i got away from the quack doctors. Severe anxiety was the end result from all the shit i went through.</p>

<p>The result of getting off the drugs and the bullshit psychobable was being able to take the entrance exams to college at age 16 and getting in, losing almost 100lbs and i was able to think again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And thus raises the ugly head of the insane notion that disarming law abiding, mentally stable people, who dont go off and kill people to accomplish what exactly? </p>

<p>Like Hitler&#39;s Germany, it will create a population where the only people who have guns are criminals who use them maliciously: criminals who work for an oppressive government or just regular criminals who rob and murder.</p>

<p>Those assholes dont bother with background checks and legal purchases. They go buy a gun smuggled in by the truckload from Mexico.</p>

<p>You compare the USA to places with strict gun laws, but its a fallacious comparison. The USA is not Japan. They have a culture where many things work that would never happen in the USA. No looting takes place in disasters. People band together and help each other.</p>

<p>But Australia! Yes they have strict gun laws and they also have a hugely unpopulated island landmass, so its not exactly easy or cheap to sneak truckloads of guns in.</p>

<p>Ideally we would live in a world where no one had guns, or militaries, no war, no criminals.</p>

<p>We dont live in that world. We live in a world where being able to defend yourself from a robber, murderer or a tyrannical government is necessary.</p>

<p>Deluding yourself into thinking that banning guns in the USA is going to make a shitload of illegal guns disappear is insanity.</p>

<p>Oh and FYI, the people who commit mass murder use bombs and trucks in countries where guns arent easily accesible.</p>

<p>Your country has plenty of anti-white racism because its ultra leftist leadership is insane.</p>

<p>You also dont share a border with Mexico where drugs, criminal illegal aliens and guns flow freely.</p>

<p>And just in case you were wondering, we do have healthcare in the US as well. Thanks to Obamabullshitcare which tried to emulate the socialist welfare state model, my health care costs have more than doubled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t think the only thing keeping the US government &quot;taking over the populace&quot; is that they have guns. Because either A) the rest of the world would go &quot;Stop that now&quot; if the US suddenly decided to go NK or B) as most in this subreddit believe, they&#39;re already controlling you anyways, while you still have your guns.</p>

<p>Also, RE Mexico, it&#39;s actually a lot harder to legally get guns there than it is in America, which actually causes most of their illegal weapons to come from the USA, not the other way round. </p>

<p>And how often are the mass shootings stopped because someone else also had a gun?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to make illegal guns go away, no. But it&#39;s certainly going to make a lot of guns go away in general. And I also know that one single solution (remove guns, remove anti depressants, etc) isnt the fix for the problem; it&#39;s a complex problem that will need a complex solution, something I&#39;m not going to pretend I have or know enough about.</p>

<p>FYI, they do yes, but even those happen less. And we also call them what they are; terrorists.</p>

<p>Ps: because it&#39;s sadly a rare occurrence on the net these days, and looking at your other comments, I just want to say thank you for replying in a polite and debating way, instead of it just breaking down into who can come up with the stupidest insults ;) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes they work, but there are usually better options, but those better options cant be patented like drugs.</p>

<p>Some of those better options are naturally derived, dietary, biological agents like microbiome regulating bacteria. Safranal derived from saffron and curcuminoids derived from <em>curcuma longa</em> have both been trialed and demonstrated to be as effective or better than Prozac but without all the horrible side effects. I was personally on Prozac and Luvox for a while, and i know meth users who were more with it and sane than i was when i was on those. </p>

<p>Insurance doesnt cover any of the better safer alternatives because they are not patentable. Saffron costs more by weight than gold, but i buy it. Not everyone has that ability. And because people are gullible and buy garbage, they make it harder for everyone to eat a diet that helps prevent depression.</p>

<p>Just imagine if insurance covered stuff that works better than SSRI and SNRI drugs but had no side effects. I lost almost 100lbs when i quit SSRIs for starters. And i could actually think again. </p>

Companies should not be able to target ads to individuals with stupid happy commercials that pretend to make everything better. For fucks sake I don&#39;t have erectile dysfunction but if I think cialis can make my life look like their commercials I&#39;m going to my doctor and demanding those pills! Same thing goes for depression meds. &quot;Oh shit I&#39;ve had a rough week and been feeling like there&#39;s a black cloud over my head like in that drug commercial and they just take a pill and it&#39;s all better? In going to get some of that&quot;.

<p>Guess you didnt read the link? All the studies are there, sam-e has 40 studies alone
The article you posted did mention 40 studies but nowhere made any attempt to describe that even one of those was a strong study. First article on SAM-e is again just a blog post with no links to studies and no mention of strong studies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second SAM-e article has 2 references for SAM-e being used for depression. 
1) <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12418499">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12418499</a> does not appear to have been double blind 
2) The second article they list (Morelli V, Zoorob RJ. Alternative therapies: Part 1. Depression, diabetes, obesity. Am Fam Phys. 2000;62(5):1051-60) says this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a double-blind trial conducted that same year,15 26 patients received SAMe or desipramine for four weeks. At the end of the study period, 62 percent of the patients taking SAMe had significant improvement in symptoms, while only 50 percent of the patients taking desipramine had significant improvement. <strong>The study did not extend beyond this short observational period, leaving unanswered questions about the long-term side effects of SAMe and whether the antidepressant effects of SAMe persist beyond four weeks. The study did not take into account the usual four- to eight-week time period needed for TCAs to become maximally effective</strong>. So they are saying it is more effective despite not designing there study to allow accurate comparisons...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On to tryptophan. Your first article seems really quite reliable so ya I could be convinced maybe tryptophan would work for those who are only mildly depressed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>positive results have involved individuals with baseline depression scores at the upper end of normal, while negative results have generally been found in those with lower baseline scores</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting to me that you say these compounds haven&#39;t been picked up because they can&#39;t be patented yet in your first article it is a patented blend.</p>

<p>That is interesting about saffron I must admit and I will be looking into it in more depth in the coming days but it contradicts your ncbi article. Saffron, according to the research you sent me, works by balancing hormones in your brain but your third article says thats a total fallacy. </p>

<p>The reason that some depression meds work by increasing serotonin and others work through other mechanisms is because depression is not caused by a single defect but instead hundreds. Serotonin alone has at least 5 different receptor types and subtypes within those. Each doing different things. A single drug (whether natural or synthetic) is unlikely to ever be able to help all depressed individuals. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I ever said overprescribing wasn&#39;t a thing or that it wasn&#39;t an issue (on mobile and already typed out this much so don&#39;t want to back out to check). It&#39;s very much an issue but I think the problem arises from the ability of the US to target adds to the general populace</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats not entirely true from my understanding at least. I come from the veterinary world where albeit things are slightly different (we probably have a little easier of a time &quot;prescribing&quot; unproven but seemingly helpful blends of natural products because if something does go wrong its not a human life and instead animals are still legally considered property, but I did some research on the human side and things seem pretty similar). The risk when prescribing these natural blends (which I&#39;m going to call nutraceuticals from here on as its more accurate and less confusing) is that there is very little regulation. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act states that it is up to the manufacturer to ensure the product is safe, contains the ingredients listed in the amount listed, and that the product is truthful and not misleading. Further, these nutraceuticals are not required to be approved by the FDA at all. That means that so long as the manufacture doesn&#39;t make any outlandish claims theres nothing that can be done really unless its harming people. And instead they could hire a doctor to make an outlandish claim for them and then sponsor that doctor on their website (this happens all the time with veterinary nutraceuticals targeted to horses). </p>

This is an article about how much glucosamine they found in various nutraceuticals compared to their label claim. They had products containing 0% all the way up to 115%. </p>

<p>The problem lies in over prescribing. Just like the opioid issue, psych drugs are given out way too liberally. I&#39;d definitely opine that they&#39;re prescribed way more freely than pain medication, because they&#39;re in a control group (in the US) that&#39;s much less regulated than opioids. </p>

<p>The lack of understanding of how these drugs work, and what side effects they cause is an alarming reality to face. Every day you are likely to interact with somebody using these drugs.</p>

<p>I stated the fact that chemicals which cant be patented aren&#39;t used, specifically <em>because</em> they cant be patented and sold under exclusive licenses bu drug companies. Its a perverse incentive structure, not dismissable pseudoscience.</p>

<p>You will find that chemicals like safranal, curcumin, and the other constituent chemicals of various plants are just complex in nature and action as synthetic drugs.</p>

<p>The downstream effects of dietary and microbiota changes are similarly profound. Just because its not a synthetic chemical doesnt mean it cant be a powerful drug. Look at cocaine, weed and opioids. They are derived from plants and yet are powerful drugs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After my mom died I slowly broke down and was put on antidepressants anxiety meds and sleep meds. Its a guessing game of what will work. I was put on different meds every 3 months when I saw my psychiatrist (couldnt get an appointment sooner if I wanted to) for 2 years. I became quickly addicted to anxiety meds. I remember my doctor told me &quot;if you need the anxiety medicine to work quicker you can put it under your tongue&quot;. Well whats quicker than that in a pinch? Snorting it. The antidepressents made me feel literally nothing. Not even numb but <em>nothing</em>. Ive been told I have severe depression but therapy and talking arent what fixed things. My family coming back tofether, me taking better care of myself, eating a proper diet did much more than meds ever did. So did marijuana. I smoke often but less problems putting it away for periods at a time when work demands it. Its helped my anxiety ten-fold. I truly dont believe much in medicine and doctors after this and other health issues ive had to deal with (in short, stomach issues which marijuana fixed). I understand some people have a chemical imbalance and medicine intervenes to help but i dont think that&#39;s the case with most patients. Talking to someone can be helpful to some but i dont like it myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im truly sorry for your troubles. You are lucky. I had a traumatic near death experience(as in i was nearly killed by someone else) while smoking pot. Ever since then i cant smoke it without a massive panic attack. I would caution anyone to make sure its not skunk(high THC low CBD) pot, as that will make depression worse and pure THC in large doses induces dysphoria and can lead to a psychotic break.</p>

<p>Definitely agree with you about SSRI/SNRI drugs working occasionally if people actually have a rare neurotranamitter imbalance. They are wildly overprescribed though.</p>

<p>If the poster would <em>normally</em> have the urge to stab someone with a pen, then its obviously not the drugs.</p>

<p>Most sane people dont walk around with the urge to stab others. If they suddenly begin to have said urges right after they get on some mind bending drug, it probably is the drug.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you here.  I’m not saying that psychotropic medication is bad.  There’s a lot of people that take it because it works for them.  What I am saying is that we do not understand in entirety the changes in brain chemistry during its formation.  There’s no way to monitor the constant changes happening within the brain ever, but we can’t even speculate from day to day during puberty.  </p>

<p>I don’t believe that it’s a coincidence that the first school shooting occurred when it did.  That was the first generation of kids who were given adhd medication readily.  The late 80’s also saw a shift in treating depression in adolescents with antidepressants.  Essentially, we started to mess with the brain chemistry of children and now, 25 years later, we are learning the consequences of that.  </p>

<p>I don’t just think, I know that psychotic medication is playing a large role in the problems we are seeing in children within our society.  The studies are coming in and there’s huge correlations between taking psychotropic medication while the brain is forming and a disproportionate level of adult psychosis.  I’m screaming this to anyone who will listen.  I beg parents to try coaching and therapy instead of medication for adhd.  I have a masters degree in nursing education and I believe in vaccines.  I’m not a crazy person, rather an educated one trying to get people to understand that there’s something going on here.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The medications don’t give people suicidal thoughts - the increased risk of suicide is because the effects of the medication can take several weeks to fully come into effect, and sometimes the person taking them experiences increased energy and motivation before the improvement in mood, so whilst before they were suicidal and lethargic/unmotivated, now they are suicidal but with the energy to actually carry out the act. The effect is temporary and goes away when the medication takes full effect - that’s why patients taking them for the first time are heavily monitored and have weekly or more frequent appointments with their doctor or therapist for the first few weeks of them taking the medication and are informed about the warning signs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good for you. I have been mentally ill for most of my life - around 19 years now, give or take. I’ve been in psychiatric care for some of that. Before they found a cocktail of meds that worked for me, my life became dramatically better - before, I was suicidal, had severe paranoid delusions, was very depressed and could not function as a person at all. Now I’m fairly stable, albeit with a limited emotional range - I don’t have strong feelings now in either direction, but it is vastly, vastly better than it was before. </p>

<p>In respect to how patients are monitored, I was speaking from my experience in the UK, which even with spending cuts is still fairly decent when it comes to mental health - I assumed that the US would be similar. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not in the US.  I&#39;m in Finland, which apparently has considerably less concern for the welfare of its population&#39;s mental health.   The doctor just threw pills at me and left me to get on with it.  All I could think about was how badly I wanted to plant myself in front of an oncoming metro.  My children begged me daily to stay with them and not give in to those demons.  They were teenagers then.  It was beyond horrific.  </p>

<p>The doctor didn&#39;t understand why all the pills weren&#39;t working.  When I ran out of money to pay him (€200/hr) he lost interest.  I lost my job as well.</p>

<p>I stopped the pills cold and worked myself back up to mental health over the course of the next few years.  I got no help from anyone here, only the loving concern of my children.  That had to be enough.  I made it enough.  But dammit it was the hardest thing imaginable.  I&#39;m now longterm unemployed and not going to be able to get back into anything at this age anymore.

    <div class="md"><p>I dislike how much antidepressant hate is on reddit. Zoloft (sertraline) is awesome if you&#39;re really emotional and over reactive / cry a lot, makes emotions easier to handle. (I will admit it can make you very cold and unfeeling so stick to lower doses). and Wellbutrin (bupropion) is awesome if you don&#39;t have the energy to go to the gym or socialize, as doing those will improve your depression symptoms as well. it also helps you lose weight which is great for self esteem. I&#39;ve tried a bunch of meds and I think these 2 are great. </p>

<p>i recommend everyone stay away from most antipsychotics like seroquel/abilify (unless you&#39;re schizo, bipolar, have a personality disorder, etc), effexor/pristiq (brutally addictive, painful withdrawal. seems to cause anger issues.), lexapro and prozac. </p>

<p>citalopram and lithium are okay. </p>

<p>absolutely do not take benzodiazepines unless you suffer from severe panic attacks. they&#39;re super addictive, make you have worse anxiety over time, and destroy your memory. </p>

<p>research shit doctors are prescribing you before taking it!</p>

<p>tbh I&#39;m not convinced that medications contribute to shootings. it seems to me that doctors noticed future shooters seemed mentally disturbed/antisocial and tried to medicate them to keep them and others safe. if anyone has anything disproving this I&#39;d be happy to read it tho. (unless it&#39;s kelly brogan who I think is a quack.) </p>

<p>SSRIs are prescribed in many countries but it&#39;s only ever americans that are prescribed them who go on murder sprees. American society is fundamentally fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could easily be a confusion of causation and correlation though - just because most of these school shooters have taken antidepressant drugs doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that the drugs are the cause. Could simply reflect the fact that those who are prone to homicidal behaviour are likely to have underlying psychological issues that result in antidepressant drug prescription.</p>

<p>Shrooms, acid, and weed are the way forward with mental health care.  They need to be the starting place.  Big Pharma is just killing all of us and that needs to be acknowledged sooner rather than later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People don&#39;t want to wait 6 months or more (my first one was 9 months out) to see a psychiatrist so they get their family doctor to prescribe it to them who may have not read anything about them since medical school. There&#39;s a million ways the body goes sideways and it&#39;s impossible to keep up on everything, especially when you&#39;re already working 70 hours a week. Our medical system is fucking dumb. </p>
