    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why sanction just russia? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not for Trump to decide? A bill was passed to sanction and Trump has refused carrying it out. The separation of powers has to exist and the executive branch shouldn&#39;t be able to simply abandon it&#39;s duties at whim. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If trolling on twitter is a crime</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You do know that it was not just trolling, right? People have been indicted for accepting money from a foreign government to influence elections. An american even accepted money from Russians to build a cage for a parade to give an example of how many different levels of engagement the Russians have had. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/11/us/politics/cia-judgment-intelligence-russia-hacking-evidence.html">This in addition to hacking the DNC and giving information over to Wikileaks. Hacking the RNC (though not leaking the hacked information).</a> </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s foreign policy advisor Papadopoulos has already pleaded guilty for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia regarding the above hacked information and is cooperating with Mueller as part of his plea deal. </p>

<p>Trumps campaign manager Manafort is currently being charged with conspiracy against the United States. </p>

<p>This is not normal and interference in such scale by a foreign government United States simply shouldn&#39;t accept. The response was sanctions, passed in Senate 98-2. It passed the House on Tuesday 419-3. Trump simply has no right to not implement the sanctions. </p>

<p>If you believe otherwise, it&#39;s kinda hard to believe that you&#39;re a patriot or that you are on the American side at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s medium to allow corporations more control over their existence all while the average citizen becomes more subordinate. They want loyal citizens who won&#39;t cause a stir. That&#39;s why there was such a campaign to stomp out communism and anything counter-capitalism. And what better way to strengthen that idea than leave a busted island (Cuba) for the world to see, and a country (North Korea) who we beat into a tiny corner of existence. Leave these two countries to fend for themselves and say,&quot;Communism and socialism won&#39;t work, they&#39;ve failed.&quot; Reverse the role and make Britain the only capitalist country, and it would fail also.</p>

<p>Now, don&#39;t misunderstand me. I&#39;m not advocating for any form of government. I think they are only as useful as the people who are active in them. Communism, capitalism, socialism, they all have flaws. They all have their flaws. I think it&#39;s best to push towards a form of government that the people of the country desire and will work in instead of one based on protecting a few where the average citizen has little to no interest, what ever form that may take. </p>

<p>I do think the populace is growing tired of the antics and I do hope there is a change of ideologies and practices in the next few years. </p>

<p>Thank you for your response.</p>

<p>Go easy friend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference between the two is one makes more of a &quot;good faith&quot; effort to look after the needs of the population as whole while the other does not. The GOP has drunk the kool-aid of &quot;supply side&quot; economics without any understanding of the underlying economic theory. There&#39;s no Grover Norquist on the Democrat side (do people not realize he was involved with Ollie North and the contra  scandal?), You&#39;re enforcing a false equivalency. There&#39;s a lot more diversity of viewpoint within the Democratic party compared to the republican party (arguably one of their disadvantages) many of which <em>do</em> represent the best interests of the majority of the American public. Which isn&#39;t to say that there&#39;s no corporate shilling and sketchy lobbying within the Democratic party... But it has a much more muted effect on the policies passed. Remember that Bill Clinton raised taxes on the wealthy during the 90&#39;s which boosted government spending and helped drive aggregate demand even further (thus raising GDP) while simultaneously creating a budget surplus. That&#39;s policy that makes sense and encourages organic growth whereas the current economic policy of the GOP represents the exact opposite mentality and disproportionately benefits the rich by front-loading growth, guaranteeing a retraction (aka recession) in the near future while exploding the deficit, driving inflation beyond expectation and forcing the fed to raise interest rates at a rate faster than most people expected. </p>

<p>But people who post in a conspiracy sub about “Russia isn’t the reason for all of our problems” on THE SAME DAY that 13 Russians are indicted for crimes during the election is fucking BLATANT PROPOGANDA. </p>

<p>Nobody blames the Russians for the wealth disparity in the US. Nobody blames Russians for our healthcare system. Nobody. </p>

<p>This is a pathetic attempt at changing the narrative and honestly if people can’t see that then I have truly lost all hope. I don’t care if you’re pro Trump, even this should be embarrassing. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t view it that way, although I&#39;m not saying it isn&#39;t a rational viewpoint for you to hold. I am posting in support of OP because, honestly, the average Reddit liberal is reacting in such a way that it&#39;s like they believe even the slightest negative whisper regarding Hillary or the DNC is simply the result of Russia&#39;s efforts.</p>

<p>It&#39;s annoying and incredibly frustrating because this viewpoint delegitimizes and dismisses actual, valid criticisms people have for the Democratic establishment, and it is absolutely <em>vital</em> that we criticize and reform the Democrats in order to have a party <em>worth</em> supporting. </p>

<p>I understand that things will be significantly better for the working class under even the most hawkish neoliberal than under someone like Trump, but &quot;better&quot; still isn&#39;t &quot;good,&quot; and the deal Hillary could offer us fell far short of the vision for America we deserve. And it&#39;s just insulting and infuriating to have my views and opinions- to which I&#39;ve arrived after <em>long</em> thought, deliberation, reading, and discussion with leftists IRL- dismissed as being the result of Russian propaganda.</p>

<p>Also, and this is a bit of an aside, but it&#39;s also frustrating that the same people who are taking twitter puppets and botnets to be this horrible influence on our election- and I&#39;m not saying it <em>wasn&#39;t</em>- tend to also be the same people who dismissed similar corruption revealed by Wikileaks, i.e. the Podesta email where literally dozens of reporters (who, coincidentally, often posted pro-Hillary/pro DNC articles...) were attending off-the-records dinner at the Podesta&#39;s. If Russia pushing various narratives on Twitter &quot;hacked the election,&quot; then what of these reporters and their undisclosed contacts with the Hillary campaign? It doesn&#39;t seem to matter to most, but it matters a great deal to me. </p>

<p>Anyway, sorry for the rant. I wouldn&#39;t even be posting but I&#39;ve seen a good few comments shitting on Jill Stein and it&#39;s anger&#39;d up mah blood. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for that thoughtful response. I could not agree more. IMO the dems lost this election more then Trump won. I’ve been screamed at for saying “I’m not the biggest Hillary fan” - even tho I voted for her - by what you call liberals. I used to consider myself a liberal. But I hated the way Hillary ran her campaign, taking tons of super pac cash and funding the dnc, who in turn fucked Bernie over and anyone who didn’t like Hillary became sexist or a socialist. Anyways I can’t finish this thought but as I said I think we agree more than we thought initially. Guess that’s an example of the bias I have when I hear “dem fucking reddit liberals!!”, I did what I absolutely hate and assumed more about your political beliefs than was fair. It’s gotten so polarized and I hate that I just played into that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve tried discussing left-libertarianism with you numerous times, so I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve reached the point where I believe civil discussion will be unfruitful, but if you never ended up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990117030925/http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker2.html">reading this essay</a> I recommend you do so. I&#39;m certain that you will at the very least find yourself in agreement with some of the things he has to say regarding the views of individualist anarchists such as Proudhon and Warren. In my opinion, drawing conclusions from what he says of their views, it seems the modern &quot;free market! Woo! Libertarianism is anarcho-capitalism!&quot; view is a watered down version, bastardized to support corporations and the primacy of individual oligarchs. </p>

<p>Other than modern American libertarianism supporting unrestricted rights to own capital regardless of use, residency, etc., it is otherwise <em>remarkably</em> similar to much of the rhetoric modern libertarians espouse. This difference is crucial and holds staggering implications to how the rest of our society organizes and functions.</p>

<p>In particular, I hope you will read what he says of the &quot;money monopoly&quot; and think of it in context of modern &quot;End the Fed!&quot; sentiment. Then remember this essay predates the establishment of the Fed by a good few decades.  </p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for the amicable comment, and take care. If you respond and I don&#39;t get back to you, it&#39;s because I post a lot and disable inbox replies to avoid inundation with responses. </p>

As an example, Russian tweets supported Jill Stein, so now to a solid portion of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> supporters anyone who ever supported her is now the woeful victim of Russian propaganda. God forbid anybody felt their views aligned more closely with hers than with those of an imperialist arch-neoliberal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So remind me... Who gave massive tax cuts to corporations and the wealthiest Americans? And everyone else gets a measily extra $2K deduction? Does OP really think the GOP is the party trying to tackle the massive inequity in this country? That requires wealth redistribution, either through incentives for employers to pay employees more (tax deductions could be tied to wage distribution) or through higher taxation and government entitlements and block grants.</p>

<p>The GOP decided to pass deficit funded tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans in a fully employed economy. They&#39;re driving inflation up which brings <em>your</em> purchasing power down. Great for exports, terrible for the average person. It&#39;s almost assured a recession in 2020.</p>

<p><em>And you want to blame liberals???</em></p>

<p>OP, I understand that you&#39;re frustrated about being poor and most certainly undereducated (obviously you didn&#39;t pay attention in macroeconomics class) but maybe if you stopped blaming others for your own deficencies and actually spent some time educating and bettering yourself, you might not be so suceptible to the blatant manipulation of the right-wing Ailes/Koch media machine. Stop looking for a scapegoat-- you voted for this.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the real conspiracy. You get rolled over and over and still don&#39;t realize who the puppet masters are. </p>

<p>No. He cut taxes. Again, I lived through this. The economy was rocking. You&#39;re talking about &quot;redistributing wealth&quot; and have the nerve to say my economic literacy is zero? How do you propose this &quot;redistribution of wealth?&quot; Are you just going to round up all the rich people and shoot them? Or do you think they will just willingly &quot;give it back&quot; to everyone else? If you jack up their income tax to 95%, they&#39;ll just hire accountants to find loopholes or move their businesses to other countries (like they do now) with lower taxes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you apparently have no understanding of economic theory. I also lived through the 80s but the difference between us is that I recognize the difference between monetary policy and fiscal policy. Reagan&#39;s supply side economics (trickle down theory) he caused more harm to the American economy than any other economic theory. Familiarize yourself with the Laffer curve before spouting off annecdotal nonsense and pretending like you understand economics. The growth in the 90s far outpaced that of the 80s, why do you think that was?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably because it&#39;s in the best interests of the corporations and oligarchs who finance our politicians&#39; campaigns? Higher wages means less desperation and more bargaining power for the working class, and what is good for us is inversely bad for them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. <strong>The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population.</strong> Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.</p>

<p>This is why liberals are the enemy as well as the GOP, even though they offer the working class a &quot;better deal.&quot; Here&#39;s Oscar Wilde on that matter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just as the worst slave-owners were those who were kind to their slaves, and so prevented the horror of the system being realised by those who suffered from it, and understood by those who contemplated it, so, in the present state of things in England, the people who do most harm are the people who try to do most good;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think financial education is lacking in this country. For instance the credit game. Common sense would tell you to just pay everything off. Not to use credit cards, etc. But in order to have a good credit score you have to use those things in order to establish credit history. I didn&#39;t know this until I&#39;d royally fucked up my credit and was researching how to repair it. I think things like this, how much to save, how to invest in retirement, and the absolute importance of these things, should be mandatory education in public schools. I doubt my parents have an emergency fund to this day. How could they properly teach me how to responsibly use money if they didn&#39;t and still don&#39;t know themselves? That&#39;s why I think the bulk of cats in this country live paycheck to paycheck. They grew up living that way and cycles like these are difficult to break. Just my 2 cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The starry87916578 guy who responded gives a good point, but also:</p>

<p>1) <em>Most Americans DON&#39;T make that much money</em>. I know I wouldn&#39;t struggle with 40k. I wouldn&#39;t even struggle with 30k/yr. However, I also live in a very low cost of living area, and unfortunately rents vary wildly. Even though median incomes are around 50k/yr (depending on demographics), if your rent is still half of that... And no, you can&#39;t just pick up and move, because the jobs don&#39;t move with you. </p>

<p>2) Our economy is still fucked and retailers have been heavily pushing store credit cards (incentivized with sales you can&#39;t otherwise get) in order to support flagging consumption. This is IMO pretty much the only reason this is been &quot;a recession&quot; rather than a &quot;long depression&quot; (even though I still see it being referred to as the latter). Without these credit cards, consumer spending would plummet and there would be a true economic crisis. The cost, however, is all the debt piling up, which is compounded with what that other guy said on financial education lacking in America. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with what you’re saying. I’m quite left and yet apparently I’ve drifted more and more central because of the extreme “liberals” who skew the scale - not that my views have changed. I fucking voted for Hillary and been called alt-right by liberal “friends” of mine who can’t hear anything they disagree with. I get it. </p>

<p>But people who post in a conspiracy sub about “Russia isn’t the reason for all of our problems” on THE SAME DAY that 13 Russians are indicted for crimes during the election is fucking BLATANT PROPOGANDA. </p>

<p>Nobody blames the Russians for the wealth disparity in the US. Nobody blames Russians for our healthcare system. Nobody. </p>

<p>This is a pathetic attempt at changing the narrative and honestly if people can’t see that then I have truly lost all hope. I don’t care if you’re pro Trump, even this should be embarrassing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem is inflation.
I was looking on how much it would cost to rent a studio apartment or even a damn room for around 600$ and that&#39;s just for a room not including water power internet .  Now a apartment is around a $1000.  All of this without a phone bill car insurance maintence or payment food to eat three or even two times a day.  With what minimum wage is I&#39;m surprised how people make it without going postal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>America is doomed. The propaganda machine has done a perfect job separating the people into extreme left or right, then convincing them that the other side is the biggest danger to the country. Now people don&#39;t even want to talk anymore, you&#39;re either with them or against them.</p>

<p>The true sad thing is that most Americans don&#39;t subscribe to either party. They have beliefs that are in the middle but are forced through fear mongering to adopt a side of the extremes, because the propaganda machine tells them that if they don&#39;t, the other side will win.</p>

No liberal cares about policy? Nice. Do you have any other wisdom to share? Liberals aren&#39;t your enemy. They&#39;re of a different political belief and most of them want the country to do well, just like I assume you do. We&#39;re all Americans. </p>

<p>People like you, who use the term &#39;liberal&#39; like a weapon, need to grow the fuck up. Same to the people who use similar right-wing terms in the same fashion. YOU are the type of person that has made politics as volatile and divided as it is. For being a conspiracy forum, there sure are plenty of people buying into the media&#39;s party-baiting. Every other thread is the same bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m so confused how you can link Liberals and the wealth gap? Genuinely confused.</p>

<p>This is the greatest trick all politicians have pulled since WW2 - NEOLIBERALISM.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not a political term, it&#39;s an economic term. This sub, and well most of the US don&#39;t understand it or seem to want to understand it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s why the wealth gap grows at the fastest rate it has ever grown at.</p>

<p>Government regulation does help and is 100% needed, because the free market leads to corporations who are only after profit.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not communism or socialism, that&#39;s the truth. It bewilders me how people have seen companies destroy our environment, pick up and move whole industries out of areas, wreaking havoc on our economy, and people still think corporations and the free market would be a better alternative.</p>

<p>Nobody wants socialism, but there needs to be regulations in what corporations can do, to help the public. There needs to be spending in public services.</p>

<p>We the PEOPLE are the nation, not corporations.</p>

<p>TLDR: Neoliberalism has gone too far, we have trades kings for CEOs. They get rich of our natural resources. A third way is right. </p>
