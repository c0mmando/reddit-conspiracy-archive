       But no... never had thoughts or desires to hurt anyone for real. I don't even kill flies. I trap them and bring them outside.

       Haha. Same sentiments here. Daydreams about going on some counter-elitist, world ass kicking tour, but with some Neo, Matrix-like electro magnetic powers attainted through constant meditation. I picture teeth and and hairpieces flying all over the place, but then I have to remind myself to calm it down, at least a bit.

       Not everyones neurochemistry and neurophysiology is the same. A lot of people do become violent or suicidal on SSRI and SNRI drugs.

       Some people can smoke weed and it relaxes them, but due to a severly traumatic experience, even a contact high is enough to give me a massive panic attack and make my heart race.

       I like your logic, subjective feeling I have, apply to entire US population. Get the fuck out. It took me five years to get myself off of those pills, there was one that I had to stop taking, about two weeks in I started daydreaming about running a guy over with a forklift, I literally couldn't escape the thought, I had nothing against the guy. I spent another week fighting off the thoughts before I told my doctor. He changed my script and it all went away.

       So youve been on the drugs for 25 years but you say youre majorly depressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the drugs arent anti depressing enough. Have you tried diet, exercise, saffron, curcumin and lactobacillus rhamnosus? I wrote a pretty extensive thread about my experience with these drugs.

       +1 for Curcumin. A hot Tumeric drink with a some black pepper to prevent your liver from processing the Turmeric too quickly always puts me in a great mood.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also like to add black tea. The Theanine reduces Cortisol(stress) by a lot.

       The piperine in black pepper is the specific chemical that aids in the absorption of the curcumin. It can be dangerous to have too much piperine with some specific heart meds if i remember correctly.

      <p>
       I actually sometimes grate up fresh turmeric root and put it in rice or a salad. Its quite tasty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive heard about theanine but i buy Japanese green teas because i want the extra caffiene and idk of any black tea from Japan. I pretty much only trust camelia sinensis tea grown in Japan because of their quality controls.

       One probiotic strain out of tens of thousands + of friendly bacteria that thrive in our guts is basically a useless placebo. Ive researched this topic VIGEROUSLY. First off.. probiotics you can buy or eat (supplements or fermeneted food) arent bacteria strains evolved/from the human gut - they are strains in labs and strains taken from other animals like cows (many many mainstream strains), strains from fermeneted food, etc. Not from a humans gut. These probiotics still are shown to sometimes help certain people (everyone is different). Only if you take a high dose and take it daily if not with each meal. Studies show these non human gut derived bacteria from other sources DO NOT take up residence in our guts. They pass right through because they are from other animals/fermented food. Human derived gut bacteria is shown to actually LIVE on the gut.. attached to the inside.. it is a resident.. evolved to basically be symbiotic with us. So recap : probiotics we can buy or make (supplements/fermented food) may be helpful with anxiety/depression/etc if you find a reliable source of high quality high potency probiotics. It will only work if you keep taking it daily.. they do not colonise the gut. Studies do show that people who moved from different parts of the world and changed their diet around completely had also very different gut bacteria after they lived there a bit, so you can change your micro biome through what you consume. Also avoid getting sick because taking antibiotics kills off many of your gut bacteria, as people age studies show that the diversity of their gut bacteria lessens tremendously - you can only damage or misstreat yourself (and your gut bacteria) so long. And life slowly sucks that from you anyway. Eat healthy! Live long and prosper!

       Lactobacillus rhamnosus and many other probiotic bacteria are HUMAN STRAINS. The original cultures came from humans, and they just keep growing them and putting them in pills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Youre thinking of SBO probiotics that have to be taken constantly and can actually be dangerous. SBOs are not equal to human strains.

       Some may be human strains but you really gotta do your research on the company etc. that specific lacto rhamn may be one of like 10 lacro rhamn (theres usually a number after the english name). All types of lacto rhamn would be different and have different effects. Also you gotta remember that theres thousands and thousands of types of bacreria and this would be only one of thousands. Its so complex humans dont really have it all mapped/understood yet.. taking one is somewhat like supllementing vitamin d everyday but not supplementing all the other vitamins/minerals. It may not be bad but is it really helping? Theres so many factors. Anyway.. ive tried probiotics. Maybe helped gas and digestion a bit but let me tell you.. i stopped eating wheats/grains processed food and sugars and let me tell ya.. after a month of that ive lost my daily chest pains and have never felt better in my life. I still suffer from my anxiett n depression but not as bad.

       Babies dont have a fully developted gut microbiome. They get it from their mothers vagina as they are birthed, then from breast milk feeding from their mother and then from environment. Probably by 5 or some time like that they would have a better microbiome..  could be wrong tho.. maybe the guts not developted fully until later. For sure i read we get lots from breast feeding though :).

       I think something that never gets talked about is depression as a normal response to certain things such as a lack of friends or emotional connections. We are human and deep sadness is part of being human. When a loved one dies we grow very sad. This is normal, Also bear in mind that to many of us our society is broken. There is so much wrong and most of us who cannot or will not adjust to it then experience deep sadness. Is it normal to be be happy when you know your food, water, air, economy, government, media has been controlled by ruthless and evil people who are poisoning us? Or is sadness and anger a normal response? 
I have come to believe that a lot of our culture is a facade, it’s a smoke and mirrors. People pretending to be happy while the whole ship is sinking. The SSRI’s don’t solve the problem for most because the problem lies in the lack of human / emotional connections or trauma. The only solution is to heal the trauma or create emotional connections, and that is not easy in a broken society.

       Not always. Parasites and protozoa can change your emotional state. These drugs help some people normalize.

       That’s different then deep sadness triggered by a sad event. Or being depressed because you are lonely. The solution is not only pills but there might need to be other therapies as well. Of course there are biological causes too. However society has lost human interactions because of technology it stands to reason that there is going to be an emotional response to that. I am not referring to biology.

       +1 for Curcumin. A hot Tumeric drink with a some black pepper to prevent your liver from processing the Turmeric too quickly always puts me in a great mood.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also like to add black tea. The Theanine reduces Cortisol(stress) by a lot.

       I will admit I have joked about going postal at work though. I'm actually surprised that work places don't get shot up more than schools. The level of shit and mediocrity that happens in corporate America now is astounding.

       One probiotic strain out of tens of thousands + of friendly bacteria that thrive in our guts is basically a useless placebo. Ive researched this topic VIGEROUSLY. First off.. probiotics you can buy or eat (supplements or fermeneted food) arent bacteria strains evolved/from the human gut - they are strains in labs and strains taken from other animals like cows (many many mainstream strains), strains from fermeneted food, etc. Not from a humans gut. These probiotics still are shown to sometimes help certain people (everyone is different). Only if you take a high dose and take it daily if not with each meal. Studies show these non human gut derived bacteria from other sources DO NOT take up residence in our guts. They pass right through because they are from other animals/fermented food. Human derived gut bacteria is shown to actually LIVE on the gut.. attached to the inside.. it is a resident.. evolved to basically be symbiotic with us. So recap : probiotics we can buy or make (supplements/fermented food) may be helpful with anxiety/depression/etc if you find a reliable source of high quality high potency probiotics. It will only work if you keep taking it daily.. they do not colonise the gut. Studies do show that people who moved from different parts of the world and changed their diet around completely had also very different gut bacteria after they lived there a bit, so you can change your micro biome through what you consume. Also avoid getting sick because taking antibiotics kills off many of your gut bacteria, as people age studies show that the diversity of their gut bacteria lessens tremendously - you can only damage or misstreat yourself (and your gut bacteria) so long. And life slowly sucks that from you anyway. Eat healthy! Live long and prosper!

       Lactobacillus rhamnosus and many other probiotic bacteria are HUMAN STRAINS. The original cultures came from humans, and they just keep growing them and putting them in pills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Youre thinking of SBO probiotics that have to be taken constantly and can actually be dangerous. SBOs are not equal to human strains.
