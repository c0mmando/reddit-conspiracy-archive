       We know that Facebook and Twitter are barraged by fake ads, news, users, etc. and Reddit is no different. This shows that users in
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald

       are either wittingly or unwittingly complicit in spreading Russian propaganda.

       Wow is that thread cancerous. Users calling for more action against "Russian shills" while completely ignoring all of the propaganda that has been been pushed on them by their own government and the Democratic corporate complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone propagandizes and trolls, but we only care when it's the other guy. I'm willing to bet the U.S. propaganda and troll apparatus is far more insidious and pervasive than they could ever hope to be.

       This always perplexed me. Eisenhower warned of a MIC. The CIA worked with corporations to overthrow democratically elected governments and install right-wing dictators and death squads all over central and south america.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would any objective observer think these corporations working with right-wing organizations to install right-wing dictators for the benefit of MICs and military contractors would be more Democrat than Republican??

       Holy fuck! 241 posts to a Russian operated Twitter account.
      </p>

       This is Earth shattering!  I doubt a single operative could manage so many posts over a 2 year period.  That would be like making 1 post every 3 days.

       Yea all those Russians that filled stadiums during his rallies were all duped by Twitter.. Didn't hear anything Trump said.

      <p>
       Meanwhile the MSM used tricks during Hillary rallies to make it look like more showed up.

       You conveniently leave out the part where Russian ops are also pushing anti-trump content.  So we both got duped then right?

       That influx from TD and r/politics was organic. TD came here because they witnessed dozens of conspiracies come true during the campaign, and r/politics because of the share blue takeover brigade basically follows and argues with TD folks where ever they go.

       I saw the whole thing happen. I was daily in all 3 subs, stil unsure what to make of everything, and watched weekly more conspiracies come true in 4chan/TD, and so on, and people in TD referencing that r/conspiracy has been talking about "said topic" for years or months. This started the influx.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/politics never took r/conspiracy serious. We were always seen as tinfoil nutters and laughed at. Whenever I got into any debates there, they would look at my history with r/conspiracy being my main sub I post to/hang out, at that time, and make a tinfoil remark, they would laugh, and then would just shrug and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The influx of people from r/politics into r/conspiracy has been a recent event, just the last 4-6 months.

       That's fine. He has a right to do that. He chose that side of the spectrum, and felt strong enough about to do that. As long as r/conspiracy stays, to the best of its ability, open and inclusive, there is nothing wrong with that. I am also an ex-democrat who started to lean right, a combo of some aspects of conservatism (spirituality, morals, values, financially) with libertarian views, ultimately an independent centrist, and I have various subs/interests outside of this sub, as is my right

       r/politics looked like it got taken over, there was a mod purge, all new mods took over, and all of a sudden everything on the right was banned/downvoted, and everything on the left was blown up. It looked like an actual takeover, and there are people/whistleblowers supposedly claiming it got taken over for $, by shareblue. I was there and the sub certainly looked like it did go through that. In terms of $, that would require some sort of federal investigation to see if its 100% legit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps a takeover was happening here too. However, when Flytape was here, before the TD influx, he was a good, but human, mod

       I can't really disagree with anything you said up until that last paragraph. You make some good points, especially about some of the users in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . But as far as I'm aware, the only "evidence" of the moderators there being bought out was from a single anonymous 4chan post that didn't actually provide any sources. I could claim the same thing about the mods here and it would be just as believable. I used to comment in politics pretty often myself because there were occasionally some interesting debates and other times where I just couldn't keep my opinions to myself. And while the users there could be pretty awful, the moderators always seemed decent to me. I never had a single comment of mine removed, even though I went against the grain quite often. And the one time I got death threats (for saying I voted third party of all things) they were quick to ban the offending users and remove their comments.

      <p>
       I've only been in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       for about 2-3 years, so I can't speak for what things were like before then. But the whole mess with DronePuppet using numerous alt accounts to undermine this subreddit and ban left-leaning users, Flytape sticking up for him (and maybe helping him), and then the two of them running off together and starting a new right-wing only conspiracy subreddit makes me question any of their actions before that. They didn't just suddenly decide to become super biased one day.

       Yes that's the one. Like I said, we don't have a smoking gun for it unless there was a federal investigation. However, here at r/conspiracy, we usually consider these things as a possibility, and more often then not, they end up being true later on

       I mean it make sense. The best thing to do is Mod fairly there, while making sure the headlines leaning left are plastered on r/all front page and that the main headlines/sources are controlled to create that narrative. Once you do that, then policing individual comments in a massive seas of thousands of comments, can be given to those on the lower end of the totem

       I mean flytape, if he didn't know what was up, and was sticking up for him, makes sense if he never did anything before then that was wrong. But if he knew and was helping or not, that's still to be seen. Perhaps at that time, there was a left brigading squad coming in and trying to take over the comments after they saw TD folks starting to come here, and it was a fight behind the scenes, or however it went down, like I said, if flytape did something wrong and there's legit proof then I'm good with it. I just remember him being a good mod, very hands off, during a time when the sub was really wide open and free

What was the sub's reaction when they found out ten_gop was mentioned in the indictment? I know what the reaction is. I just want a t_d user to confirm it

       It's definitely a big deal. They wouldn't be shilling if it had no effect on us, so we should all try to be aware of the shilling. However, it's misleading to imply that Russia is only pretending to be Trump supporters. It seems a lot of users on Reddit have the false belief that they aren't being influenced because they are on the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is more focus and discussions online about "Russian-linked" conservatives, but there are "Russian-linked" accounts on both sides. The theory is that Russia is trying to divide the country by pretending to be both sides. You have to be careful because Russia might be able to manipulate you by pretending to be a person who appears to have similar political beliefs to your own. Make sure you are the one who drew your conclusions. Don't let others online push you into an extreme position. You could be doing their work for them.

        Sixteen thousand Facebook users said that they planned to attend a Trump protest on Nov. 12, 2016, organized by the Facebook page for BlackMattersUS, a Russian-linked group that sought to capitalize on racial tensions between black and white Americans. The event was shared with 61,000 users.

       “In effect, the effort aims to spend a large sum of money to increase the amount of trolling that already exists online.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plan comes as Clinton operatives grapple with the reality that her supporters just aren’t as engaged and aggressive online as are her detractors inside and outside the Democratic Party.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lack of engagement is one of Clinton’s bigger tactical vulnerabilities, particularly when compared with rivals like Donald Trump, whose viral social media attacks are legion, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is backed by a passionate army of media-savvy millennials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some experts on digital campaigns think the idea of launching a paid army of “former reporters, bloggers, public affairs specialists, designers” and others to produce online counterattacks is unlikely to prove successful. Others, however, say Clinton has little choice but to try, given the ubiquity of online assaults and the difficulty of squelching even provably untrue narratives once they have taken hold.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, however, using a super PAC to create a counterweight to movements that have sprung up organically is another reflection of the campaign’s awkwardness with engaging online, digital pros said.
      </p>
      <p>
       “It is meant to appear to be coming organically from people and their social media networks in a groundswell of activism, when in fact it is highly paid and highly tactical,” said Brian Donahue, chief executive of the consulting firm Craft Media/Digital.
      </p>
      <p>
       “That is what the Clinton campaign has always been about," he said. "It runs the risk of being exactly what their opponents accuse them of being: a campaign that appears to be populist but is a smokescreen that is paid and brought to you by lifetime political operatives and high-level consultants.”

That's literally the exact opposite of what their purpose was, as stated in their press release, and by the company spokespeople on multiple occasions. This all came from that daily beast writer that didn't understand the press release.

       Ok, Matilda. You're absolutely correct. CTR paid people to go online and engage in purely organic conversations with Hillary's detractors, but that's not shilling by the modern neo-liberal definition. I get it now. Thanks so much for the clarification.

       I'm willing to have an honest discussion about some Russian interference on social media, really, I can admit that this is a very plausible thing for private or public Russian interests to try to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       You however, don't appear to me to be interested in an honest discussion. Articles. Give me a fucking break. I am not misunderstanding that CTR press release. David Brock and Hilary Clinton literally admitted (excitedly) to the whole plan in their cryptographically verified leaked e-mails. What Media Matters has been doing goes way beyond spreading links and amounts to psychological warfare. You must think we're really stupid and we're just going to ignore what we watched happen in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       after the DNCC and in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       after the inauguration. You really think I'm going to forget how
       <strong>
        hundreds
       </strong>
       of ridiculously bland anti-Trump subreddits came up over night pumping out the same bland anti-Trump content all day every day where all the comments sound like they were written by the same team of grandmas all trying desperately to sound like the "young people" without breaking character?
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are going to open this door, then we are going to investigate
       <strong>
        ALL
       </strong>
       information warfare operations which occurred on the internet during the 2016 election and since. David Brock and his teams of shills should not be immune from this. These Russians were charged with things like fraud, by the way, not spreading misinformation. So either the fact that they were spreading misinformation is irrelevant or it's the whole point of the prosecution. If that's the point of the indictment, then David Brock and
       <em>
        every last one
       </em>
       of his paid shills should be investigated just as thoroughly and indicted if they are found to have committed any crimes, procedural or otherwise.

       Or, you saw the most historically unpopular president cause a bunch of resistance subs to pop up on a website used by the demographic that voted overwhelmingly against him. That, or "psychological warfare". Which seems more likely?

       Are you saying that the people who go to T_D would have voted for Hillary if not for this twitter account?

       Or places like TD became a launching pad for literal fake news and propaganda, which all those bootlickers shared millions of times across all their social media, leading undecided Aunt Betty-Sue to see a meme with a fake quote from Clinton supporting Sharia Law, in turn leading her to hold her nose and vote for Trump because "I can't vote for someone who supports Sharia Law".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now multiply that by tens of millions of real Trump supporters and Russian bots, and all of a sudden every type of social media is flooded with tons upon tons of fake news, each subtley influencing voters who didn't know who they were going to vote for.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Grab em by the pussy" (actually happened), doesn't sound so bad next to "Let's allow 5 million Muslim refugees and allow them to practice Sharia Law in America" (even though that was completely made up).

       There is fake news everywhere. There is fake news on /politics/ and T_D and there is fake news here. Remember the fake news about the Florida school shooter being part of a white supremacist group? That was retweeted 35,000 times on one tweet alone. The AP, ABC, ADL, all ran with it. I'm sure you have unwittingly retweeted or shared fake news as well... are you a "bootlicker" now too?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's not pretend that fake news had a net benefit for Trump. He has been on the receiving end of most of it, and the mainstream media with their undeserved reputation for honesty are taken much more seriously than a twitter account.
      </p>
      <p>
       I shouldn't even need to remind you of all of this. You know the MSM has been caught hundreds of times spreading anti-Trump bullshit. You dismiss that part, maybe because you enjoy it until it's retracted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The indictment didn't say any of this had any effect on the election. You should be happy that people were able to resist this propaganda and vote for who they truly wanted.

       But that's not what happened. This propaganda was introduced to millions of Americans and was specifically targeted to swing states. There are still people out there that believe this stuff.

       That wasn't trolling, that was an example showing why the logic was faulty. It was trolling just because I mentioned KFC?

       Unfortunately for you, my assessment of trolling outranks yours.

       I suggest you move on to another argument or angle, as this is as productive as it is going to get.

       Wow, in 7 years of Reddit I've never read a mod comment and cringed until this. On a sub of literally hundreds of personal attacks and baseless bickering, you delete a post for mentioning KFC when making an off-hand remark?
      </p>
      <p>
       And don't worry, I'm not trying to convince you otherwise or prove that I can mod better. But as I clicked in at -8 for your comments I figured I may as well provide context for why you have an extraordinarily cringy thread of comments that reflects very poorly on this sub.

       I think you are misrepresenting what was said. If you are having trouble comprehending here's quote from the article that you linked "American intelligence officials have said they have no way of calculating the effect of the Russian influence." Nobody said it did not affect elections but that they can't calculate how much it affected. We clear now?

       I don't use incognito mode. Like I said before... apologies in advance if I was wrong, and it turns out I was wrong. The NYT did add that paragraph you quoted, about 20 hours after the initial publication, and I see it now. You were right, and I was wrong. :-)

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        American intelligence officials have said they have no way of calculating the effect of the Russian influence.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's very vague though... I'm just being honest. It seems to be referring to past statements by unknown officials at unknown agencies. I mean, did the NYT reporters just ask these officials after the indictments were announced? Or is this just what has been said in the past?
      </p>
      <p>
       And if all of these intelligence officials can't be sure one way or another... that doesn't say a lot either.

       Ctrl + F only searches the page you're looking at. When I was looking at the most current archived copy of that article, that entire paragraph was missing. NYT added it later.

       I did give some examples of it. I'm tired of giving examples of it every time. If you don't see it by now, seeing more examples of me won't sway your opinion, because your opinion isn't based on facts.

       Here are a couple of examples from the usual suspects that I put together for someone the other day:

       Whether or not the russians changed the outcome is irrelevant.
 What is relevant is that they broke several  US laws and they have been indicted for doing so.

       lol this is like reading the first half of Macbeth and throwing it in the trash and going “see I knew everything would turn out fine for god-emporer Macbeth.” Hahaha the story ain’t done, son. Have you asked yourself, in all seriousness, if what you wrote is true, then why the hell is the investigation STILL ONGOING? Whars left to investigate? I mean, there was no collusion sooo that should be it right? What the fuck do you think Flynn, pop, and now Gates are “cooperating” about? Their testimony didn’t have anything to do with these indictments so what are they in reference to? I’m sure Steve bannon spent 20 hours this week with Mueller just volunteering to help the team clean up the office, right? Ya know since there’s nothing left to investigate.

       Politico didn't report that. They're reporting on the others who spread it. It's fake news because they rushed the story to publication before it could be verified. They rushed it because they loved it, and knew they would get mega clicks. 35,000 retweets on one tweet alone.

       It's not Mueller's job to determine if it has any effect on the election. That would be up to Congress. Even if Mueller personally believed it affected the election it would not be included in an indictment.

       And just as Mueller didn't say he thought anyone was guilty until he had cases put together, no clever politician would say "This affected the outcome of the election" unless he already had a real solid case proving it.

       I don't watch the reg TV news too often but caught a little snippet yesterday. And the reporter made a point of saying--look this investigation is really still in it's embryonic stages and there's a lot more coming. Kinda got my attention.

       People don't like to hear about it. They're just so desperate to "take down Trump" and deep down they know that's not going to happen now. This has been a rough couple of days for them, so they're lashing out.

       This is the larger problem. The American education system is a failure at teaching people to use or practise common sense. To be honest, it's not just the American system, I'm sure that Russian propaganda could influence other elections when they try and they do seem to have some links to Brexit but as a whole, it's more focused in America, especially in those poorer Republican states.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russian propaganda was able to influence this election because the amount of dolts like Aunt Betty-Sue are everywhere. Or you see it on this sub with the types that think they're smart because they can counter every point with some tangential point about other so-called 'fake news' not benefiting Trump because they can't seem to make logical connections. I think that whole curriculum needs some sort of review, get those kids to read more and take some sort of class that teaches basic logic or common sense or judgement.

       Gotta becareful saying "Russian Propaganda" as I believe this is playing into a new narrative that Russia is out to get the USA. "Follow the money" my thoughts are this will be an organised effort, not by governments, but for a person or group of people to make money off the back of disruption (Just like the reason Brexit is dragging on).

       Memes are just propaganda, full stop.  Sometimes they're political, sometimes they're just humorous, but when weaponized the way they were, they exist to force an idea into people's heads through the use of repetitive imagery.

       Facebooks ads are very specifically targeted.  There may be 2 billion users, but it's very easy to target English speaking users, in specific states with specific hobbies and tastes.  They can reach the exact audience they want to.  Still can btw.

       Link gets into feeds, maybe people look at it.  Probably they don't.  Some people look.  Maybe it influences them, probably it doesn't.  The net effect is basically insignificant.

       I hope to be clear on the general subject: whether it's CTR, Cambridge Analytica, Russian trollbots inc., these operations are a giant waste of money.  People think they have effects they simply do not have.

       My uncle voted for Trump. He didn't like Trump but he thought Hillary was "evil"  He 100% voted for Trump because he believed all the bullshit memes about Hillary going around.

      <p>
       So yes I don't think Russians on line convinced people to vote for Trump but they definitely helped convince people the alternative was voting for a globalist Satan worshiper that wanted to abort babies to harvest their stem cells.

       Im sorry but all those "whataboutisms" pale in comparison to anything Trump is associated with.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to answer your question none of those things swayed his vote more than the fake stories.  He didn't care about the DNC stuff because he knew Hillary was always going to be the candidate. What he went off on over and over was the "Hillary is going to take all your guns and make abortion mandatory" type bullshit facebook shares.

       You seem pretty confident in what you believe is fact. I'd be curious to see how you came to be so confident, but I imagine I wouldn't particularly trust your sources. All the research i've done really only lead to more questions. Honestly, i'm a bit envious.  It's been a long time since I was 100% sure of anything, and I bet it's evolved into a kind of pareidolia, cause it seems like there are seriously few things without
       <em>
        some

       level of fuckery afoot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do want to point out to you just for the sake of irony, and maybe a little introspection, this
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        How does it feel to be a pawn in a conspiracy?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       is a bit at odds with this
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You realize half those things were played up by or set up by Russia.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why you ask? because save of few instances of incontrovertibly, everything you've claimed is just a counter-conspiracy. how about the the official narrative of 9/11 be a conspiracy theory? Absolutely it is, a government sponsored conspiracy. what about the Russian Collusion plot? Well, it does say it in the name, only nicer and less loaded with flat-earthers.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        noun: collusion
       </p>
       <p>
        secret or illegal cooperation or conspiracy, especially in order to cheat or deceive others.
       </p>
       <p>
        synonyms:
        <em>
         conspiracy
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, does the fact I believe the Russialago "collusion" narrative make me its pawn? Or is it only if you're pushing for it? either way, you would definitely meet your own definition of pawn i'm afraid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Man, you nailed your last sentence though. That one is essentially true.

       Russian agents infiltrated forums like this and pushed specific agendas. It was very noticeable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bad or embarrassing trump news? Front page slammed with pizza gate, seth rich, uranium one or begahzi. Like clockwork. And people here would get all riled up.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I ask you, if you are getting riled up at the behest of a government intelligence agency, particularly an autocratic one like Russia run by kgb coloniel and with no respect for truth irvfree speach, should you not reflect on what you have done or been involved in?
      </p>
      <p>
       All that hand wringing about CTR and derision about Russian trolls and penetration of this sub and yet it turns out the reverse is true, CTR played a minor role if any (I don’t know if incompetence or it was actually doing something else) and meanwhile Russia was spamming sites like redditvand creating fake narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       People should ask what we’re the motives, what was the truth and what was propaganda. Instead people are defensive and dropping whataboutisns and claiming fake news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus sub really needs to rediscover critical thinking and self awareness.

       People are asking those questions, many not coming to your neat and tidy conclusion.  Russian trolls/ bots has been a meme since before trump was elected, this isn't new. social media is infested, not just from russia. if you weren't a slave to ideology it was fucking obvious.

       Well, I remember early reports of them 5 or so years back. They were less clandestine then. Actually was a good well sourced article in atlantic several years back where they interview some of the people that were involved. Then as evidence petered in before it got big it was apparent that something was going on. Then during the election reporters went to places like macedonia that were actively generating many of the articles. Some where just doing it entrepreneurially to get add revenue on social media platform but it seems like some were getting paid money from Russia. They had tried left wing fake news but didn't get as much traction but also definitely there was a move to push the Trump narrative because it was more divisive and more in Russia's interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is separate from all the shady money dealings the people around Trump had with Russian oligarch money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump was clearly bailed out from insolvency with deutche bank funneling Russia money. Don Jr admit they do a lot of business with Russian entities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kushner/ Flynn meanwhile was advocating the Russia-Saudi nuclear deal that required US lifting Russia sanctions. His 666 property is underwater and I wonder if he was promised a cut of the deal if the sanctions were lifted. I think that is why he wanted a private channel to Russia that kislyak nixed. Its why Flynn was talking to the Russians about sanctions the day obama kicked out the diplomats. It also probably why erik prince (betsty davos brother and blackwater founder) met the russians in the seychelles to set up a back door.  Him, flynn and oliver north were at the time trying to pitch a mercenary blackwater type security force.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kushner later met the VEB bank head, a state owned back run by a kgb trained economist that is thought to funnel putin money and was caught running russian spies in the US. Kushner said it was state business, VEB said it was personal... except they are under sanctions, Kushner can't do business with them. VEB's head  speaks arabic and has heavily invested in the gulf since the sanctions... I think this was about the nuclear deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manafort meanwhile was clearly operating under the oligarchs control, offering private briefings, changing the republican convention platform to exclude ukraine, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flynn was trying to make money at every turn too, from dealings with Erdawan about kidnapping gullen to the nuclear deal to oliver north/ erik prince mercenary army (oliver north of iran contra fame).
      </p>
      <p>
       Gates was working with manafort. Papadopolous was a moron who got over his head and got honeypotted. Don Jr and Erik Trump are morons who were trying to win at an cost, but also along with kushner take a lot of sketchy money from Chinese, Russian, Turkish investors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cambridge analytica, wittingly or unwittingly maye have sold targetting data to Russian trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think the Trump campaign is a Russian cell, Trump is scared of Russia dumping his sketchy transactions and money operations into the public space so avoids confronting Putin. Putin sees Trump as divisive domestically and incompetent in foreign policy and friendly to  Russia so his trolls backed up Trump. Then they used the levers of greed and ambition to compromise  individuals in the trump campaign... easy to do because legitimate political operatives want nothing to do with the Trump campaign or administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, Russia played the game like a master... I think people should pause and think about how they were duped and what role they played. I don't know that this is exactly what happened but evidence suggests something like this went down.

       This term is being used constantly by people who want to shut down criticism of Hillary and the DNC. Asking about Hillary's blatant corruption isn't 'whataboutism', you douche, it's a relevant question. People don't think Hillary is Evil because of Russian bots. They think she's evil because she absolutely is.

        Asking about Hillary's blatant corruption isn't 'whataboutism', you douche, it's a relevant question.

       Well, her email servers don't suggest "blatant corruption," at absolute worst, they suggest "gross negligence." But even that is such a ridiculous stretch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing that came out of the DNC emails implicates Clinton at all. The worst thing that came out of it is that it appears the the DNC really wanted Clinton to win, and were biased against Sanders. This is absolutely wrong, and Brazille deserved to be fired, but there is nothing in it that links Clinton to any of it.

       I don't know if it is bots that convinced people of this, but you are certainly a victim of a misinformation campaign and you are far from alone if you believe the her email servers and the DNC email leaks even
       <em>
        suggest
       </em>
       corruption by Clinton, let alone even remotely prove it. I don't like Clinton, as i think she would have just been "more of the same" neo-liberalism, war-hawking that we have seen over the past 30 years, I would have much preferred Sanders. But, dear god, to buy into that BS just shows how effective disinformation campaigns can be. Whether it was Russians, bots or just other people who were able to fool you like this, that doesn't change the fact that you are among those who have been fooled.

       My low opinion of HRC goes back many years, way before 2014 when this Russia interference stuff allegedly began. I look at her and see evil in her eyes. She looks like a demon in human form, I don't know how you can't see it. You seem to think everyone is so gullible that they are easily swayed by memes on facebook or Twitter. For one thing, I don't even use facebook so how would I be swayed by a facebook ad campaign? I have a Twitter account I barely ever use. You don't know anything about me and you're making dumb assumptions because that fits with your narrative about what you think happened with the '16 election. What happened is a terrible, corrupt, incompetent candidate was beaten by someone better, end of.

       Your argument to this point has been "I don't like the way she looks." This doesn't prove she is a bad person, only that you would vote based on looks.

       Except you don't make this case at all. All you did was trot out (or really, defend) the same old tired and ridiculous "what about her emails and the DNC leaked emails?" Oh yeah, and "I don't like the way she looks." Great rational argument there. None of this shows anything about her being "corrupt" or "terrible." Maybe incompetent, that is a more reasonable conclusion. But, holy hell, Trump proved himself 10x less competent than she throughout the election, so that would be a pretty bad reason to vote for Trump instead.

       Well, you jumped into a discussion to defend another poster who attacked her emails and the DNC leaked emails. So considering your post was devoid of any actual substance, it is hard to blame me for assuming you agreed with the poster.
      </p>
      <p>
       But other than the fact that you don't like the way she looks, what evidence do you have that she is "blatantly corrupt?"

       Nah, he isn't passing the Russian Sanction bill, why not?

       Seems he has nothing bad to say about Russia at all.
Look at China selling NK oil and shit, and calls them out on it. But when it comes to Russia doing it he says nothing.

       Putin said they didn't rig our election, must be true according to Donnie, but wait.. Russians just got indicted and few Americans.

       Maybe he's not increasing the punishments on Russia because he knows things you don't, like this is all bullshit and they're a scapegoat for Hillary and the DNC's incompetence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being indicted doesn't mean anyone is guilty. An accusation is not proof of guilt. There's an old saying that 'you can indict a ham sandwich'. Being indicted doesn't mean the person did anything wrong. Or is 'innocent until proven guilty' not a thing anymore?

       She was a secretary of state, senator, presidential candidate, first lady, murderer of Seth Rich, and involved in organ harvesting in Haiti among other pure evil things.  So hopefully that answers your question as to why we care about her even though she "isn't even in politics anymore."  Its about justice

       Sure - I see your point but whataboutism kills any conversation or debate. One person brings up a point for debate and those willing should argue for or against that point. Just bringing up Hillary is basically like saying “I know you are, but what am I” it’s very childish

       He has a valid point. This whole Russia nonsense is laughable. So information on Facebook, a social media site, was used to sway peoples opinion. That is the exact purpose of that medium, to convey information. Instead of taking this issue the direction it needs to go, which is by acknowledging that social media is something that you should not take seriously or spend much time on, let alone use to form a political opinion, it is going in a direction of censorship and control of the information and narrative, which is never good.

       If you really believe 13 Russians or even 30,000 Russians using the internet influenced the election, you are living in la la land. The DNC didnt influence the election? Her emails didnt? Those are facts and facts that speak a much larger and more dangerous truth about our country instead of an obvious trivial one about foreign intelligence.

       Sorry man. I'm with ya. I don't know how people can't see that. You bring up a "hey, this candidate has proof of a pay to play system right here in these emails." Point to someone who talking about trump/Russia collusion you get hit with "whataboutism" like that word takes away from the validity of what was said. Both candidates can be evil pieces of shit.

       You are confused. The intent of throwing out the "whataboutism" is to distract from the matter at hand. It is literally trying to take away from the validity of what is being discussed by pointing to something else.

       I’ll answer, the extensive NPR investigation into the email scandal . You should go listen to it.  Their conclusion was gross negligence but nothing sinister. When you look at he facts Clinton and her team were idiots when it came to tech and got sloppy.  Also she was investigated by the opposition and cleared.

       Is the FISA warrenty drama that is happening now valid? If so, that removes  my opinion of the FBI being unbiased.

       If the FISA warrant drama is fake news, then Clinton being cleared was probably the right call.

       I would be happy to, but I can't discredit something that you haven't (or, really, can't) actually provided. You've made the claim that you read something with your own eyes that proves her blatant corruption. You've made an assertion, it is time for you to support your case. Asking me to disprove the case you haven't even made yet is nonsense. Almost as dumb as pointing to number of upvotes and downvotes as if it proves who is right and who is wrong.

       I actually hate the Clintons but think Trump is worse. This is what I don’t understand about Trump supporters who blindly defend him no mater what. I won’t blindly defended any politician.

       Let's be honest they were not pushed as hard as Killery/ Clinton is a rapist/ pizzagate or uranium one. Since most mass media atleast is fact based with spin. Hannity, info wars and TD are happy to run away from facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other point is most of the people who didn't vote for trump would of not voted for him regardless, because he is uncouth, a blowhard and doesn't come across as very intelligent or experienced.

       The amount of people who see mass media compared to those who see Infowars, there's a massive difference. Your average joe public is also far more likely to trust the word of CNN over a random site called infowars too.

       Yes, one of the places pushing bill Clinton is a rapist, Killery, pizza gate and Uranium 1. Also pushed by Russian bots and also a favourite of the The -D

      <p>
       If i went to the_D right now I would see "bill Clinton is a rapist " and claims of Lock her up.

       Trump isn't just normal old stupid. Trump is uncommonly stupid. Trump gets daily briefings in single page bullet point form. Trump doesn't know what a "clean bill" is. Trump is the only republican official that doesn't believe he's obstructing justice, because he doesn't know what that is. He's

       And what policy of Trumps do you think caused this? Because it's pretty common sense that it takes quite some time for the benefits (or lack thereof) of the previous administration to wear off, and trump hasn't actually been able to do much. Obama did some great things with the economy, I'll agree with you there.

       Ah yes, Obamas run off. Awfully convenient we had to wait 8 years and a bit for the results to start appearing. Like every new market and economy all time high was apparently nothing to do with Trump and just Obamas run off. Then a week or two ago when the DOW dropped rapidly for a correction suddenly we were into Trumps time.

       Everything spiked on election day mate, it's clearly down to Trump becoming president.

       Not at all, the results have been appearing for years. What is very interesting is when out of nowhere in the space of about a week republicans went from "The economy is awful" to "the economy is great" despite the economy not actually changing in that week. Trump hasn't been able to make significant policy (up until the tax reform) and so the economy has continued to grow then same as it was during the second of of obama's presidency.

       I can say that personally, I went through something similar. It's not an outlier it's something I have heard more and more. I followed the election more than I've followed any previous election this being the 3rd time I could vote. I was personally hoping for Sanders v Trump simply because I hated the idea of Clinton v Bush. After the primaries, I was disappointed Clinton won and had quickly lost any sort of faith in Trump based on his demeanor and actions. Over time though I grew to hate Clinton more and more and eventually looked more and more at Gary Johnson. While I knew he wouldn't win and I knew a lot of his ideas did not fit my own I appreciated someone who genuinely gave a shit about the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still remember the days and weeks of T_D on the front page bashing Clinton and I would be lying to myself if it did not have an effect on me. Sure SanderforPres was on the front page a lot during the primaries but that quickly died down and T_D was absurdly more viral on Reddit. For a time the top 30 posts on
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       were from T_D typically all bashing Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       It didn't happen overnight but given my feelings on Clinton were already lukewarm it certainly had a factor in swaying my vote without a doubt.

       So, you already disliked Clinton during the primaries, and you grew to dislike her more over the course of the election. You didn't want a continuation of the Bush / Clinton dynasties, and a lot of people felt the same way. It was a kind of "hope and change" moment... right? Just like how Obama won. You didn't want the same old shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of that seems natural to me. It doesn't sound like your feelings about Clinton were as lukewarm as you say though. Just a few sentences earlier you said you hated the idea of Clinton vs Bush.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then when it came down to it, you didn't want either Clinton or Trump. But those were the only two realistic choices you were given - anything else was a throwaway vote. That's not your problem... that's just how it turned out this time around. It happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where did the Russian interference really come in to play for you? If anything, seeing posts from T_D seems to have reinforced your existing beliefs and opinions. Preaching to the choir, as the saying goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I think a lot of people are sort of pretending that Reddit is more influential than it really is. I'd love to see some polls or surveys from Trump supporters in "battleground states" to see how many of them have even heard of Reddit, let alone heard of T_D sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never visited that sub during the election, and only checked it out once very briefly after the election when there was a crosspost from here in conspiracy. The rules they had (or maybe still have) about not criticizing Trump just seemed odd to me. At least they're being up front about it I guess. Not like /politics/ where the unwritten rule is that you can't say anything nice about Trump at all. I see both /politics/ and T_D as two sides of the same coin.

       I think you completely forget that the T_D sub upvoted to the front page literal Russian propaganda. The fact that actual propaganda made it to the front page and perhaps made an effect not only on me but on thousands if not hundreds of thousands of others is terrifying.

       5 posts linking to that Twitter account made it to the front page of T_D before the election. That's not even the front page of /all/ but they may have made it that far as well. Even so, that's 5 posts. Five.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then... you have to take in to account that most of it was real. That twitter account is deleted now, but they were posting mostly clips of debates, real news that was favorable to Trump, and things like that. I'm sure they posted some bullshit too. But come on... let's be realistic here. 5 posts. Now

       And people "worldwide" cannot vote in US elections.

       I guess you're never going to forgive yourself. You can't even process this information you're seeing. Most of what was posted, even from that twitter account, was real. Video clips and whatnot. And again... there were
       <strong>
        only 5 posts
       </strong>
       that made it to the front page of T_D before the election. 5 posts is enough to basically give you a mental breakdown with this guilt you've put on yourself. Seriously... get over it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm stunned that you can't see how ineffective it really was. Instead you go on and on about how many people visit Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many millions read and trust all of the fake news they see on TV and read from "trusted" newspapers online? A whole lot more than those who read an obscure, untrusted, unverified twitter account. That's for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just the other day we saw a bunch of respected news outlets get
       <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/florida-shooting-white-nationalists-415672">
        fooled by 4chan in to publishing fake news
       </a>
       . One tweet of that fake news alone was retweeted 35,000 times. The correction was retweeted under 500 times. The power of propaganda is real, but you're looking in the wrong place if you think this "TEN_GOP" was effective at it.

       How do you figure 2.5 posts a day?
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly how do you figure that this account we’re talking about is a top 10 user on t_d?

      <p>
       Again, on night like email leaks, scandals, big news the rest of Reddit are censoring etc I’ll post a lot, mostly as questions.  I’ve probably posted 20 times this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have something like 300 posts here, and well over a 100 in places like no stupid questions, tech support and some fan subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       The place has nearing 600 thousand subscribers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have we clocked how many times crt, shareblue it accounts like this have posted to sandersforpresident, politic, conspiracy and the many other places they tried and (as proven) failed to affect the election result?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we take into consideration Obama going on French television supporting Macron during the election, or him telling brits that if they vote for brexit they will ‘go to the back of the line’ on trade?

      <p>
       Is this really what ‘collusion’ is boiling down to?

       It's definitely a big deal. They wouldn't be shilling if it had no effect on us, so we should all try to be aware of the shilling. However, it's misleading to imply that Russia is only pretending to be Trump supporters. It seems a lot of users on Reddit have the false belief that they aren't being influenced because they are on the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is more focus and discussions online about "Russian-linked" conservatives, but there are "Russian-linked" accounts on both sides. The theory is that Russia is trying to divide the country by pretending to be both sides. You have to be careful because Russia might be able to manipulate you by pretending to be a person who appears to have similar political beliefs to your own. Make sure you are the one who drew your conclusions. Don't let others online push you into an extreme position. You could be doing their work for them.

        There is more focus and discussions online about "Russian-linked" conservatives, but there are "Russian-linked" accounts on both sides. The theory is that Russia is trying to divide the country by pretending to be both sides.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The critical point you elide is that the infiltration of both sides was done for the purpose of helping Republicans, and Trump especially. They sought to attack and destroy Trump's opponents. One way to achieve that was with tens of thousands of pro-Trump trolls. Another way to achieve it was by splitting the Democrats: fake Muslim groups that attack Hillary; fake black groups that attack Hillary; fake Bernie groups that attack Hillary. The point was to fracture the Democratic Party?
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember how they leaked the very first batch of DNC emails on the eve of the Democratic National Convention? Russian trolls then spread the word among Bernie supporters that the emails were proof of DNC corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       And do you remember what happened next? The Bernie faction at the convention went ballistic and disrupted the entire first night of speeches. News coverage was dominated by "the latest revelations about the DNC." Shows like The Young Turks talked about nothing else for days on end -- throughout the entire convention. Many individuals, in those days after the first leaks, vowed permanent opposition to the Democratic Party. They created a rift on the left that exists to this day -- and which shows no sign of healing.

       I thought Twitter was just all fake followers.
      </p>
      <p>
       One second it's, "Trump has literally tens of millions of fake followers"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it's, "they have tens of thousands of bots on Facebook and Twitter"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it's, "they have thousands of fake accounts"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it's, "look at all these followers they are influencing!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it's, "the Donald is 90% fake Reddit accounts and bots"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it's, "241 times this account was on the donald"
      </p>
      <p>
       So, fake accounts with fake followers posting fake news on fake subs with fake userbases and get fake upvotes from bots?

       Why is the "fake followers" concept is being applied selectively, here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just dispense with the coyness, please. How can it be an issue that a Twitter bot got posted to a subreddit, if the subreddit is fake. Why does exposure matter when ots being exposed to a bunch of bots, by bots?

       Then you know that not only is it beyond easy to make bot nets, you can write simple scripts which will automate your entire process. It is insanely easy to generate fake follower networks. If there are thousands of bots with thousands of followers, why would I not assume they are all in an automated follow-back network?

       So you have a bunch of devout Trump followers who already support him, and the Russians forced them to vote for him? They convinced them to vote for the candidate they already supported. You do realize this is what you're essentially saying right? I'm guessing you also realize how ridiculous it sounds right?

       Look at what they did. Ten_GOP stuff was posted there. They injected bullshit right into the base that would then amplify it to all their contacts, relatives, fb friends. T_D useful idiots didn't know that the story they were retweeting about Hillary wanting to implement Sharia Law was literally written by Kremlin employees, but if you wanted to spread that message around- might you go to a place where people are spreading pro-Trump info? Maybe they'll pick up the ball and run with it?

       They inject a bullshit story about Hillary wanting to continue Obama's muslim mission into a sub that they 1. Know will buy it wholeheartedly and not fact check it and 2. Will retweet, spread it on facebook, talk about it amongst themselves, and talk about it with their friends (some of whom are undoubtedly undecided voters).

       Russians spent at least 80 years studying psych warfare. They didn't do this because it doesn't make sense. I don't know how I can help you see how simplistic and failproof their implementaiton was.

       I don't know what you mean about fake votes, but pretty sure the goal of the Russians was to have substantially more votes go to Trump thus ensuring his presidency. I'm not a scholar of the electoral college but a couple times, this past case being one of them, in the past 20 years or so, candidates have won the popular vote and not the presidency.

       What a farce!
      </p>
      <p>
       Very early on, probably around October 2015, I followed @TEN_GOP on Twitter.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter if they were a Russian sock puppet. TEN_GOP daily posted
insightful commentary and links to news articles that the FAKE NEWS were
completely ignoring because that news went against the Official Narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wouldn't matter to me if TEN_GOP was a grey space alien tweeting from a
cloaked Archillean battlecruiser in low orbit 100 miles above the Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the fuck when does it matter who is speaking The Truth, when The Truth
can stand on its own feet? And since the fuck when do millions of people ignore
legitimate, verified information depending on who the source is? And why the
fuck do millions of supposedly educated people willfully barricade themselves
like Bubble Boy inside an Infowar Iron Lung to filter out any news about that
they happen to disagree with?  Every day the FAKE NEWS bombards us with shitty,
thinly sourced stories based entirely upon "some people say" and "Anonymous
sources confirm", and "unnamed Intelligence officials with knowledge of the
matter", and on and on, and nobody bats an eye.  There is a brain cancer that
has gripped the American public, who now think they can just close their eyes,
click their heels, and wish away any harsh reality they dislike.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is there a federal arrest warrant out for some anonymous rando tweeter, but
not the 25 high profile journalists who attended a fancy risotto with "walnut
sauce" private dinner at Podesta's McMansion, which we only know thanks to
Guccifer and Wikileaks?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/11409">
        https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/11409
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter who hacked Hillary and Podesta and it doesn't matter that we
only learned about Crooked Hillary's astonishing scale of profound corruption
spanning decades from Wikileaks and Guccifer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like the old saying goes, "the Fool looks at the finger that it pointing at the
moon."
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aren't Maggie "Tee it up" Habberman, and John "with me it'll be the story
she wants" Harwood currently fugitives on the lam and dodging US Marshalls who
are hunting them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is nobody talking about the disgusting media corruption like Team Killary's
secret roster of dozens of "Surrogates"--high profile journalist fluffers who
the Clinton Foundation launded payola to in exchange for them going on FAKE
NEWS shows to parrot talking points given to them straight from Jennifer
Palmieri, the campaign communications director of Clinton's campaign?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/10/09/exclusive-new-email-leak-reveals-clinton-campaigns-cozy-press-relationship/">
        https://theintercept.com/2016/10/09/exclusive-new-email-leak-reveals-clinton-campaigns-cozy-press-relationship/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       All of those "Surrogates" deserve to be in the same cell block as Crooked Hillary.
For fucks sake, even Wolf fucking Blitzer is a sychophant who trades away his integrity
for envelopes of cash and por favor from Clinton Foundation donors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is Dirty Cop Mueller burning tens of millions of dollars to censor a dozen
motivated Russian shit poasters, and setting a dangerous legal precedent to
criminalize certain Free Speech, but doing diddly squat to slap Crooked
Hillary's bribery and "Pay4Play"? Hillary's hijacking of the 4th Estate has
inflicted orders of magnitude of damage upon America by eroding our trust in
all news, and incapacitating our entire Civic Society from being informed about
important national events, so that we can vote for the best leaders and decide
upon the most sound policies.

       I have never been as lied to as I have by my own fellow citizens. If that means I have to put my faith in the basic decency of Russians to assist us to save whatever shred of goodness remains of the American Spirit, then fine, so be it.

       There's no shame in saying, "I've been conned and will be more careful."
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Truth" you loved so much that Ten_GOP spouted? Couple examples. Google them also to see how much this bullshit spread:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I’ve seen a check that has Nancy Pelosi’s signature because she authorized a payout for sexual abuse of a minor. The victim’s family has told me they’ve received threats when trying to take to MSM about the payout.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before the election, @TEN_GOP tweeted a series of misinformation, according to the New York Times, such as ''Obama wants our children to be converted to Islam! Hillary will continue his mission.''
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Washington Post reported that the list of prominent people who tweeted out links from the account included political figures such as Michael Flynn and Roger Stone, celebrities such as Nicki Minaj and James Woods, and media personalities such as Ann Coulter and Chris Hayes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Twitter has said it had discovered that 2,752 accounts controlled by Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there was a group cry post in T_D when Ten_GOP got taken down by Twitter.

       No, I don't think that's it. I think it's more the fact that most people know by now the 'Russia thing' isn't some made up left-wing hoax, and that Russia is still pushing disinformation which loyal Trump supporters are happy to spread for them.

       Nah, only took about 10 seconds to look up, too. They had a 40 million dollar budget to fight Trump. Russians operated, what, a couple years at 1.25 x 12 = 15....let's say they had 30 million in 2 years.

Life is too short to bicker over stupid politics, we all depend on each other whether we like it or not, or whether we understand it or not.

       Good question.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Before the election, @TEN_GOP tweeted a series of misinformation, according to the New York Times, such as ''Obama wants our children to be converted to Islam! Hillary will continue his mission.''
       </p>
       <p>
        The Washington Post reported that the list of prominent people who tweeted out links from the account included political figures such as Michael Flynn and Roger Stone, celebrities such as Nicki Minaj and James Woods, and media personalities such as Ann Coulter and Chris Hayes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Twitter has said it had discovered that 2,752 accounts controlled by Russians.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And this gem:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I’ve seen a check that has Nancy Pelosi’s signature because she authorized a payout for sexual abuse of a minor. The victim’s family has told me they’ve received threats when trying to take to MSM about the payout. #draintheswamp #Shushfund."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Really interesting to google the quotes and see how many Trumpers shared this valuable information from the Soviets. They were never big on factchecking so shit like this just got gobbled up.

       And maybe Pelosi did authorize a payout for sexual abuse of a minor. I mean we can't prove she didn't, right? Let's take this Russian psy-op warrior's word for it.

       As someone who's been calling Russia-Trump collusion bullshit for over a year this doesn't story doesn't affect my viewpoint. I would assume that most world powers are propagandizing twitter and other social media outlets in order to gain favor economically. I assume that various corporations and oligarchs within Russia had favor as to whom they wanted elected as well. None of this relates to the pissgate dossier, Christopher Steele, the DNC email hacks/leaks, and the other more controversial material.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we spent the same amount of time looking into propaganda by China and various other world economic powers you'd find the same result.

       Those same "IRA" bot accounts helped Jill Stein and Bernie Sanders as well. Let's not also forget that Russian operatives pushed BLM and militant Feminism as well. Those would definitely be at odds with Trump's message wouldn't you say?

       Can you find me any racist posts on the front page of that sub right now? If it's really the majority it should be easy. Maybe Im blind but I'm seeing a post about a black lesbian being warmly welcomed after being downvoted into oblivion for having a differing opinion in other subs.

       I'll offer you the same task of trying to find something racist. I'm not sure why you think you've made an argument. Having people from all races and cultures posting in a sub, and all of them being warmly welcomed, is probably the best evidence for the users not being racist.

       If some of the commenters in this thread are representative of the T_D base, they just don't care. People in that sub have a minute by minute relationship with news and information. If they can get a "win" over some liberal or Never Trumper in the media, they'll pump out a bunch of shit and make a lot of noise about it. It doesn't matter where their information comes from, if it's accurate, or if it even makes sense, because the content there is largely disposable and created to address whatever is right in front of their faces at the moment. It's about pure volume of content and quality doesn't matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a cumulative effect to this sort of info consumption and creation in that it turns the users into fact-immune morons who seem programmed to view every element of a story in a vacuum. You saw on this sub how many users leapt on the word "unwitting" after the 13 indictments came out, conveniently ignoring the broader context. It's easy to "beat" something or someone when you ignore context, pump out a couple shitty memes, declare victory, then move on to the next thing.

       which is a horrifying account of how the post-Soviet Russian state media works under Putin. Or read
       <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/putin-russia-tv-113960">

       The tl;dr of both sources is that
       <strong>
        modern propaganda works by getting you to believe
       </strong>
       <strong>
        <em>
         nothing.
        </em>
       </strong>
       It's like lowering the defenses of your immune system. If they can get you to believe that all the news is propaganda, then all of a sudden propaganda from foreign-controlled state media or sourceless loony toon rants from domestic kooks, are all on an equal playing field with real investigative journalism. If
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       is fake, your news consumption is just a dietary choice. And it's different messages for different audiences - carefully tailored. To one audience they say all news is fake, to those who are on their way to conversion they say "Trust only
       <em>
        these
       </em>
       sources." To those who might be open to skepticism, they just say "Hey isn't it troubling that the media is a business?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Hannah Arendt, who studied all the different fascist movements (not just the Nazis) noted that:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time,
        <strong>
         believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and nothing was true.
        </strong>
        The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood,
        <strong>
         they would take refuge in cynicism
        </strong>
        ; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness.

       The philosopher Sartre said this about the futility of arguing with a certain group in his time. See if any of this sounds familiar to you
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ____ have chosen hate because hate is a faith to them; at the outset they have chosen to
        <strong>
         devaluate words and reasons.
        </strong>
        How entirely at ease they feel as a result. How futile and frivolous discussions appear to them. If out of courtesy they consent for a moment to defend their point of view, they lend themselves but do not give themselves. They try simply to project their intuitive certainty onto the plane of discourse.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Never believe that ______ are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words.
        </strong>
        The ____ have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>

        since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.
        <strong>
         If then, as we have been able to observe, the ____ is impervious to reason and to experience, it is not because his conviction is strong. Rather his conviction is strong because he has chosen first of all to be impervious.

       He was talking about arguing with anti-Semites and Vichyists in the 1940s.
      </p>
      <p>
       This style of arguing is familiar to anyone who has seen what has happened to Reddit over the past 2 years as we got

       Ever see someone post something that is quite completely false, with a second person posting a long reply with sources, only to have the original poster respond
       <strong>
        "top kek, libcuck tears"
       </strong>
       ? One side is talking about facts but the other is playing a game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at what happened to "Fake News."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a word that was born about 9 weeks ago. It lived for about 2 weeks as a genuine English word, meaning headlines fabricated to get clicks on Facebook, engineered by SEO wizards who weren't even American, just taking advantage of the election news wave:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         "You Won't Believe Obama's Plan To Declare Martial Law!"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "Hillary Has Lung, Brain, Stomach, And Ass Cancer - SIX WEEKS TO LIVE!"
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       For a while, it seemed like the real world could agree that a word existed and had meaning, that it referred to a thing.
       <strong>
        Then the word was promptly murdered.
       </strong>
       Now, as we can clearly see, anyone who disagrees with a piece of news - even if it is NEWS, not an editorial - feels free to call it "Fake News." Trump calls CNN fake news.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a two step process to this degeneration. First, one gets an audience to believe that all news is agenda-driven and editorial (this was already achieved long ago). Second, now one says that all news that is embarrassing to your side must be editorial
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       fabricated.
      </p>
      <p>
       So who is the culprit? Who murdered the definition of fake news? A group of people who don't care what words mean. The concept that some news is fake and some news is not was intolerable, as was any distinction between those who act in good faith and sometimes screw up, vs those who act in bad faith and never intended to do any good - a distinction between the traditional practice of off-the-record sourcing and the novel practice of saying every lie you can think of in the hope one sticks. The group of people I'm talking about cannot tolerate these distinctions. Their worldview is unitary. They make all words mean "bad" and they make all words mean "the enemy.". In the end they will only need one word.

       It's also deeply cynical. I came across a 4chan thread planning to disrupt the release and social response to the new Black Panther movie by pushing a petition to give a quarter of its profits to the black community, in the hope that, if it failed, SJWs would turn on Marvel for being racist and conservatives could decry the black community for relying on handouts. Even if it fails it wins, because it pushes a divisive narrative. And more basically it fulfills a deeply cynical need to troll and disrupt.

Criticism of the president and his fans (not people who only voted for him but the people who suck his balls and defend his every word and action) makes you a shill?  This sub has
       <em>

       Hopefully when they are done going after Russia (since that is the country we actually have evidence was actively interfering with this election) we can maybe go after Israel... but I'm afraid Trump would never allow that...
      </p>
      <p>
       And why are you deflecting?  We are talking about problem A and your solution is to say "yeah but what about problem B... clearly we are only looking at problem A because corporate neoliberal propaganda!"  Never mind that this investigation has already resulted in over a dozen indictments.  Maybe Russia wouldn't have been on the radar so much if Trump wasn't dumb enough to say shit like "hey Russia, if you are listening please find Hillary's 30,000 missing e-mails" and shit like that when he's on live TV with millions of people watching?

       Trump is absolutely terrible. You’re missing the point. In the past the establishment and POTUS have been one in the same. If Trump was establishment he would t be getting attacked by the establishment.

       He is not attacked by the establishment. The entirety of the Republican party seems to ignore everything he does.

       Every policy he has enacted has been to please the establishment and the rich. People got a 20 dollar tax cut, while the rich got billions. People also ignore what he took away.

       The big talking point going around right now to downplay the indictments is “if the fbi wasn’t so busy investigating Russian bots, maybe they would have found time to look into the Florida shooter”. Like the FBI moves in unison and every single agent is working on russia, so no other work gets done. I don’t even doubt that there are some folks that are so far gone that they legitimately believe that. It was a carefully constructed distraction campaign that seized on a awful evil action and pushed it forward to create anger and take advantage of raw emotion. It is an example of how normalized hyper partisan shitslinging has become, because yes, some people actually believe it, but many people pushing that know for certain that one has nothing to do with the other, and are looking at the shooting as a good “opportunity” to pile on the FBI, and run defense for thier tribe. I don’t recall this happening when the FBI was “investigating” and labeling BIE as a terrorist organizations, and the there were other mass shootings, so what changed?

       So Trump is a Russian stooge now?  I'm a Trump supporter, but if he's a stooge of any country, its Israel, which every US president seems to be a stooge of, and you can't be a stooge of both Israel and Russia.  If you want the truth about Putin, yea I'm sure he wanted either Trump or Bernie to win.  He knew Hillary/Bush/Rubio would result in escalated tensions in Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin knew that the deep state was frothing at the mouth for a full boots on the ground invasion of Syria.  Obama and the media tried it and the American people on both sides of the aisle overwhelmingly said no.  They're still at it though, and after Syria will be Iran.  Trump isn't playing the deep state's game of a proxy war with Russia for the purpose of controlling a pipeline through Syria, so therefore he's "colluding with Russia."  Read between the lines dude, its not that complicated.

       Oh boy, you haven't read the Trump/Russia connections yet? You're in for a real treat if you like money laundering connections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Iran is totally not the next realistic target after Syria. Look at the new Iranian natural gas fields. Owners of these fields have gotten a massive new cash injection from the US unfreezing their bank accounts due to the Nuclear Treaty. They've built a new massive pipeline almost straight through to Europe,
       <em>
        except for in Syria.
       </em>
       It's the only country that has held up any production on the pipeline, and it's no wonder why: this pipeline would provide major competition against Russian Natural Gas in Eastern Europe, where Russia controls 80% of the Natural Gas market, which is the foundation of the Russian economy. Oil and Gas make up 16% of Russia's GDP, 52% of Russian Government revenue, and over 70% of their exports. Now you have pro-pipeline anti-Assad rebels and the Kurds backed by US, European and Iranian forces, versus the anti-pipeline Assad regime backed by Russia. There's no way Western forces will spend this much money in Syria just to burn the whole investment by toppling Iran.

       Perhaps the FBI is purposefully "incompetent."   Just maybe NiKolas Cruz was on a secret
       <em>
        Operation Gladio-like
       </em>
       FBI untouchable list, meaning do NOT arrest or bother this guy too much because the CIA has plans for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean how can the FBI claim they couldn't track down the person who made the YouTube post that he was going to be a "
       <strong>
        <em>
         professional
        </em>
       </strong>
       school shooter," when the poster used his uncommonly spelled
       <strong>
        REAL
       </strong>
       name (with a "k"): NiKolas Cruz...
      </p>
      <p>
       So just maybe Cruz got a pass from the FBI because Deep State individuals in the FBI were instructed by Deep State individuals in the CIA to not interfere with Cruz.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cruz's evil, deplorabe shooting got the House Intelligence Committee's Devin Nunes memo out of the headlines for a few days.  This, of course, is the memo that could eventually lead to the prosecution of former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying Brennan and Comey created the Gladio-like untouchables list, but others in the Deep State may have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting how the Fort Lauderdale / Parkland, Florida shooting happened so close to Trump's Mar-a-Lago home, only 28 miles from the school.  Also only a day or so before, some evil type(s) mailed an envelope or package to Trump's son containing a white, powdery substance to invoke the fear of anthrax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recall that shortly after the 9-11 terror attack, someone mailed anthrax (or was it a fake anthrax-appearing substance?--don't recall) to Senator Leahy and a handful of other Senators/Congressmen who were initially opposed to voting for Congressional authorization for the Middle East wars that began last decade.

       What I also find unbelievable is that the Russians would spend all this effort and money to illegally control the narrative during the election and NOT try to control the vote counting. Is it reasonable to think they had some kind of moral limits that stopped them from indulging in election fraud?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In a rare but superb news story on the evening of the 1988 presidential election, Dan Rather of CBS Evening News had this exchange with computer expert Howard J. Strauss of Princeton University:
       </p>
       <p>
        Rather: Realistically, could the fix be put on a national election?
       </p>
       <p>
        Strauss: Get me a job with the company that writes the software for this program. [Strauss was referring to the most common computer program in use.] Then I’d have access to one third of the votes. Is that enough to fix a general election?
       </p>
       <p>
        In an earlier clip during this CBS interview, Strauss had dropped this bombshell: “When it comes to computerized elections, there are no safeguards. It’s not a door without locks, it’s a house without doors.”

       Exactly, this only makes sense if trump really had more corrupt dealings\blackmail\relations with Russia than Hillary did. Some take this like it's an axiom because trump is a fool but it is by no means an easy question to answer considering her uranium 1 deal and the
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5009373/FBI-surprised-Bill-Clinton-took-500-000-Russia.html">
        Kremlin bank payouts that Bill Clinton has received
       </a>
       ). Alternatively she was talking crazy with the Syrian no fly zone so if it is all true maybe Russia was trying to dodge WW3!
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin knows and has interacted with hillary, unless trump is a literal Kremlin lap dog then trump would be a horrible candidate to 'collude' with since they really would have no clue what his geopolitical moves will be.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that it seems most people think trump
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       a Kremlin lapdog in which case he's a great successor to the long line of puppets the CIA has been installing around the world for half a century, it doesn't feel too nice.

       I fear mostly with this demonization of Russia that people will be lulled back into thinking that America is a model democracy and never would act in an

       They never wanted Trump elected, just America divided. I doubt they wanted Hillary to lose seeing she is quite happy to give them what they want.

       They very clearly preferred DJT as the winner. All public information from the indictment and Mueller's investigation clearly states this intention. Maybe they only preferred DJT because he was Not Hillary, but that's still a preference for him.

       contrary to popular belief, controlling the vote count in this country is insanely hard to do outside of each county. vote flipping and fractional counting occur regularly, but they occur at the precinct and county levels. rigging whole states isn't even attempted. the key is to rig key counties. the key counties aren't chose by size, but by plausibility. you add votes that confirm what people expect for that county, and subtract votes that confirm what people expect for that county. people expect broward to be outrageously blue, no one notices if you add more blue to blue, likewise for the republican counties (they combine several, since they don't have one broward's size).
      </p>
      <p>
       here in florida, dems and repubs duel with rigged counties in every election cycle. you know the counties, because they are the ones that "hang," i.e. they report initially then sit on their hands until the absolute latest in order to know how many votes they need. broward always hangs, even though miami dade is bigger than we are.
      </p>
      <p>
       florida's final count in 2016 was pretty close to what it should have been. you know this because of the votes on the initiatives, which take supermajorities, and votes on downballot races: repub moriartis beat dem keechel in my state house district by just a little more than trump beat clinton state wide. the FPL trojan horse initiative to kill solar failed to pass with only 55% of the vote (repubs were more likely to vote for it). people voted party, not candidate. as per usual.
      </p>
      <p>
       dems have to have obama 2008 turnouts to win the state. that didn't happen, instead you had your regular reliable voters voting, more of whom are republican in this state.
      </p>
      <p>
       that's not russian shitposting to "influence" our elections. that's 4 decades of florida state politics.

       Mostly because they were outspent 2:1 by the Trump campaign. I never understood why no one ever mentions that all campaigns pay for an online presence, it's like they think Hillary was the only one to ever do it. Dems spent $19 million on Shareblue and shit like it, but the Trump campaign spent $37 million on the same damn thing.

       I don't think Trump spent $37 mil on the
       <em>
        same thing
       </em>
       .  Did Trump's "online presence" get blocked from the politics sub?  Crazy how shareblue is so bad they got banned from the sub tailor-made for them.

       I took a hiatus from reddit for a couple of months because I knew fake news was drowning out real critical thinking, particularly on this sub.  Now I'm back because of this story.  (The russian shills on twitter etc)  It proved me right.
      </p>
      <p>
       No way am i letting this shit go now that I know for sure I was right.

       I was "anyone but Hillary" before she or Trump even officially announced they were running.

       So were millions of others who don't blindly follow the MSM narrative.

       She is literally one of the worst candidates to ever be floated in the Presidential election, speaking as a registered Democrat.

       Ever spoken to anyone who didn't vote for Hillary because of the Podesta emails? The corruption of the Democratic party? Bernie being treated unfairly?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have, they got swayed by Russian interference, since none of those scandals would be public knowledge without their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference in the election was 80,000 votes, out of over 120,000,000 cast. If those scandals flipped or denied three quarters of one percent of the total votes from the Dems, that's a flipped election right there without ever touching a ballot box.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since this is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , there's a decent chance you think uncovering those scandals are a good thing. Still doesn't change the law, still doesn't change that we need to educate the American populace on how to fight disinformation and misinformation, still doesn't mean that the administration should be investigated for their role in the operation.

       So, I wrote a comment when that account got deleted, basically saying that some of those Tweets were badass and the person behind it should write more.
      </p>
      <p>
       While impersonation is wrong, I still stand behind my statement. Good writing is good writing, regardless of where it comes from.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't read all Tweets, but some of the ones shared were fantastic, and that's not easy to do in 140 characters. So... whatever. I love the trolls coming at me finding posts from over a half a year ago. Pathetic.

       There were days when the "politics" subs front page was filled entirely (literally entirely) with likes to Shareblue. Reddit is so full of political bots from inside, and outside the US, as well as companies advertising. Every popular sub is spammed. New game coming out? Upvote (and post) content for that game. New TV show, promote it on the television sub. Companies have entire divisions dedicated to social media and making it look like their product is being promoted organically by the community.

       "The Truth" you loved so much that Ten_GOP spouted? Couple examples. Google them also to see how much this bullshit spread:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I’ve seen a check that has Nancy Pelosi’s signature because she authorized a payout for sexual abuse of a minor. The victim’s family has told me they’ve received threats when trying to take to MSM about the payout.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before the election, @TEN_GOP tweeted a series of misinformation, according to the New York Times, such as ''Obama wants our children to be converted to Islam! Hillary will continue his mission.''
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Washington Post reported that the list of prominent people who tweeted out links from the account included political figures such as Michael Flynn and Roger Stone, celebrities such as Nicki Minaj and James Woods, and media personalities such as Ann Coulter and Chris Hayes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Twitter has said it had discovered that 2,752 accounts controlled by Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there was a group cry post in T_D when Ten_GOP got taken down by Twitter.

       The Russians have a phrase that applies here: "Useful Idiots."

       And just as Mueller didn't say he thought anyone was guilty until he had cases put together, no clever politician would say "This affected the outcome of the election" unless he already had a real solid case proving it.

       I don't know what you mean about fake votes, but pretty sure the goal of the Russians was to have substantially more votes go to Trump thus ensuring his presidency. I'm not a scholar of the electoral college but a couple times, this past case being one of them, in the past 20 years or so, candidates have won the popular vote and not the presidency.

       However, if influencing an election you would want your guy to get more votes.
