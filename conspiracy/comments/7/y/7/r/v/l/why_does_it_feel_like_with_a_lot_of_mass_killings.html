The Florida shooter had been on the fbi&#39;s radar, it still slipped through and took his actions. Iirc the Boston bomber even lived with a CIA agent. Why do they let mass murderers slip through? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. That’s my point. While we’d hope they pursue/catch every threat, to do this at 100% is an impossibility. We have no sense of all the threats that <em>have</em> been captured for scale. </p>

<p>Shit, you can&#39;t even google something without it showing up as an ad on Facebook or instagram... let alone talk about it and having ads show up on said platforms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. I don&#39;t remember chips and I was in BTC at Jackson in late 2009/early 2010. I remember having an exemption (high titers for each vaccine already/I was vaccinated during childhood) and sitting in the bleachers while the rest formed lines. I receive 1 vaccine that they told me was hep A and an up the nose spray that they said was a flu vaccine.</p>

<p>Unless we were hypnotized, which I don&#39;t remember happening, then I don&#39;t recall chips and the only large gauge needle was used for the white medication (penicillin?).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect these people are oftentimes victims of MKUltra style abuse / mind control growing up and are then lulled into certain scenarios. Notice how these killers always here voices in their head in addition to having several visits by the FBI. They use voice to skull tech to experiment on them and induce certain behaviors. Conveniently these voices might tell them to watch videos of ISIS or some bs - then when they go crazy and shoot up a school, hey look we have another incident to justify the perpetual &quot;war on terror&quot;. When we are officially in a war the federal government gets massive amounts of powers that they wouldn&#39;t normally have during peacetime, and so these incidents are mostly to fuel that war on terror propaganda. I think gun control agenda is also a possibility because the fact that there are more guns than people in the US is a huge thorn in the side of those that wish to take over and establish a one world government type scenario. </p>

Was he Brainwashed MK subject or simply a loon? are their political motivators? I would say its probable, for example Florida&#39;s current congresswoman Debbie Weisserman Shultz aka DNC former chair with a laundry list of shenanigans(Seth rich, Shawn Lucas) under her post as DNC chair is up for reelection this upcoming November midterms which btw 11 seats in the House of Representatives are up for grabs due to the Awan scandal (I&#39;m sure everyone here is familiar with.) think Gun control as huge motivators, and a digression from the upcoming trial of involved DWS and Saudi/pak spy Awan.</p>
