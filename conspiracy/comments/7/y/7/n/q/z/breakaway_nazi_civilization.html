        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think it’s possible that WWII was for a completely different reason than we’ve been told. Imagine 1930’s Germany, and a German physicist makes an incredible discovery and the Nazis now know how to control gravity (or something similar). They determine that the implications of this would end the human race because we are not yet advanced enough for this technology, which probably has some type of doomsday scenario if used incorrectly. So, they take a bunch of people who have been determined to be intelligent enough, and sent them in a ship to be a breakaway civilization, maybe to even be what we consider TPTB. But they needed to have an excuse for all these missing people without alerting the rest of the world to what they were up to, so they got together with the leaders of the world and decided to fake WWII as a cover for this. </p>

<p>Obviously it is SUPER out there, and has many plot holes. But I think that some type of variation of this theory is certainly possible and could explain virtually every conspiracy theory out there rn. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watching it rn. It’s a cool concept, I just wish they had the Nazi civilization actually advance technologically, even beyond that of the Earth people. Instead they have them basically stuck in 1945 which seems sort of silly to my. Otherwise it is a pretty cool movie though</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you say &quot;faked&quot; ww2, you surely don&#39;t mean that it was a hoax?  Because there are millions of vets the world over who would beg to differ.</p>

<p>Unless you mean that it was a set up, and that the leaders of each respective country agreed to go along with a huge world war for the greater good. Or that those countries all learned of Germany&#39;s ground breaking secret and started a massive war to stop them from starting a break away civilization. Or do you mean that the holocaust was a hoax and all the missing Jews were the world&#39;s first astronauts. Or do you mean that the Nazi&#39;s broke away and the war was  retaliation and race to steal the new tech from whomever was left behind?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In order for any theory of a recent breakaway civilization to be true, you pretty much have to assume that they have (from day one) gone around the world building pyramids and writing manuscripts (including religious texts) and constructing fake archaeological sites in order to distort history and misdirect investigators towards a <em>more ancient</em> breakaway civilization.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not saying that isn&#39;t possible.  But we are told that Rommel never made it to Cairo.  And Nazis probably didn&#39;t write the bible or alter the Dead Sea scrolls or construct Machu Picchu or Gobekli Tepe or Angkor Wat.  So if there is a breakaway civilization, it&#39;s more likely to be whoever was connected to all of <em>that</em>.</p>
