       ... That people can be awful, awful humans.  And they just might kill 17 people with no real reason, other than they feel like it. I know it's not something your brain wants to accept, coz it's not nice knowing that someone can have that sort of tendency, but NOT EVERYTHING IS A FALSE FLAG.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why can't you accept one person might just wanna kill some people with no agenda, but can accept that a group of people in the goverment/CIA/FBI/whoever will happily kill a bunch of people for some "hidden agenda"?

       Edit: If you post about "them pushing gun control", can you please explain who "they" are. Because currently you sound like a spam bot yourself, just pushing for pro gun control.

       Who are you ranting to?  People are free not to believe official narratives presented to them and for good reason.

      <p>
       It is explicitly legal for the US to propagandize their own citizens with fake news.   We've seen it again and again, so it's only natural that the default is not to buy in to extraordinary and sensational claims based only on faith in authority.

       Honestly, just to myself, like a madman on a street corner haha.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that, but they're also basing their lack of trust only on a faith that
       <strong>
        everything
       </strong>
       isn't as it seems, whether that's the case or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       And i can understand why it might be easier to accept "the authority is lying to you" than "a human is capable of random slaughter", but sometimes it is just that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I just feel sorry for any family or loved one of those who were killed; it can't be fun for them to be told their child, sibling, whatever, didn't really die, or they got killed to push the gun agenda, etc.

       Because I can look up the names of the 17 people who died, and I'm sure I could find them on social media sites, or (if I wanted to be really insensitive) ask their friends about them, what happened, how they died. 
Why do you believe they didn't? (I'm not asking this as an arsey comment back at you, I'm genuinely interested)
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't speaking in a direct term, I'm not saying people are going up to them and telling them so, but clearly it's not hard to find people on the internet who believe that to be the case. 
"How dare you insinuate it?" 
What, it's offensive to say I feel bad that people's friends and loved ones could have died?

       That's fair, and it's fine to maybe go "Is [incident] what we believe?", but like you say; sometimes you just have to accept it at face value, even if it's not a nice thing to have to accept.

       There is a difference between a hoax and a false flag.

       They are really pushing the gun control narrative with this one.

       I was talking about false flags, not hoaxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       "They" (MSM I assume you mean?) would, I'm sure, push for water-guns-filled-with-acid control control if he'd squirted them all in the face with acid. I think it only feels that way, however, because they're just trying to stop this from happening again, and most people don't want a full on gun ban, just tighter restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       A van or truck runs people in a pedestrian area; you don't call for the removal of vans, but you put up concrete barriers or ways to stop it from happening again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, would you rather "they" just say "oh well, shit happens" and not try change anything, so that the next time it happens they can be blamed for not doing anything to prevent it?

       Actually they are pushing for self-driving cars too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not all these incidents are false flags...I am not even really concerned about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes I believe the Florida shooting happened. I do not have enough evidencd at this point to determine if it was a false flag, but even if it was not:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) We now live in a society where these shootings are happening consistently. There is something really wrong, and we need to look at why our society is so sick. I might write a post on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) They are pushing certain agendas and narratives. If you can, look at the top of
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       right now. They are definitely pushing the anti gun narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) To me, it is not about guns. It is a sick society - yeah, but we do not hear about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) I am 90 percent convinced we will be living in NWO prison cities where we cannot even drive our own cars. (Those who survive at least).

       True. But I think if our society is sick this is going to continue to happen. Just think when they made abortions illegal, women still found a way to get them...and more dangerously.

       I agree.  People didn't shoot up schools back in my grandparents' generation like they do now.  I think it is better to resolve the root of the problem.  For one, I think it takes care of the bigger problem.  Secondly, it takes care of more problems.  Guns are a tool.

       I think some form of gun control is okay. Do not think we need to full out ban guns, and it is a slippery slope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus this ignores the issues of families. If these aren't false flags, who is allowing these guns to be so accessible to teens and children?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a deeper-rooted issue here and I call it lack of proper parenting.

       There was a gun in my house growing up. My parents did not take the proper precautions with it, and I do not know why?

       To be honest I have been thinking about smoking lately.

       Why the push towards no smoking but not no drinking? I think drinking is way more harmful.

       Smoking can be done in moderation like drinking can.

       I would say intentions mean a lot when it's the difference between wanting to disarm the public before the nwo rolls out and wanting to prevent mass murder.

       Seriously, though, this is the place to give alternative takes on events. It can be frustrating when a conspiracy you don't buy into is plastered all over the place but remember that you believe stuff that other people consider to be bullshit, too.

       This is how I often look at it. Am I a flat earther? No. Do I think flat earth theories are silly? Yes. Do I bother reading them? No, because it's not a conspiracy that I'm interested in. But I fully support their ability to post their theories here, I just scroll past them.

       Your whole logic is backwards. As almost every terror event, false or not, is organised by some state actors it's prudent to always assume you deal with state terror until proven otherwise.

       I said that almost every of these events is run by state operators of some kind assuming the opposite as default is stupid because that's just following their goals. The less people believe to be real from the start the less effective they become and the sooner they stop this BS or get more radical. In the later case the faster the population will rise and give these state terroists what they so richly deserve.

       Right but I think the point is there is a huge uptick. We have had guns forever, we have not had school shootings forever.

       So when you seeing an increasing string of these, with simular signs (depressed kid, Feds warned, on meds, threats before with no action)...it is good to look into it.
