    <div class="md"><p>This is a great idea. If you could take insurance out of healthcare and start a program like this, people would flourish. Healthcare has become such a big business, with protocols set in stone. Not always the fault of the physician, their hands are tied in gordian knots at times. It needs to be patient centered, and it is not. Big healthcare has seemingly ignored that your response to this diet and medication will  not be the same response I may have, one size does not fit all.

    <div class="md"><p>just wanted to chime in here, because I had a terrible accident at work a few years ago where I died, had an NDE, was CPR&#39;ed back to life, and spent the next 2 months in the hospital, and 4 months after that seeing various specialists.</p>

<p>There are a TON of shitty Doctor&#39;s, and I mean incredibly incompetent to such a degree, that I refused to see any specialist that was a woman (besides my primary care, who is awesome). Many of them hardly even speak proper English and you can&#39;t understand shit they say. It&#39;s just ridiculous. I started questioning what these schools are doing when I had gone through so many dumb AF doctors, some Rx&#39;ed me wrong medications, others were clueless, and every single time, I was the one who offered the best options for myself because I was informed.</p>

<p>While I think a loving Apple Store experience of health would be great, there&#39;s just a massive influx of really shitty Doctor&#39;s out there, and they deal with such a high volume of people, you are lucky to get more than 3-5 minutes with these folks</p>

<p>Yeah its horrible. Many of these Doctors are entirely incompetent. I would literally use medical terms and procedures/options/meds that they had zero clue about and would ask my for the literature I had on hand. I learned really quickly how to filter out the incompetent ones, but still its so sad, because most people come in with Authority Bias and they think because the person has a lab coat on and a Phd, that they should be trusted and are competent, when its completely the opposite</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some bad docs out there. It used to be that only the smartest went to med school, not so now. Universities make more money when more people attend, and the brightest students seem to go into engineering and tech careers. Physicians are so specialized now, and with a cover your ass mentality, they simply refer a patient to other more specialized specialists than treating them, leaving the patient with too many people trying to dictate care. And insurance companies control your treatment plan. If a physician orders a test before checking off the boxes dictated by insurance, the doc won&#39;t be reimbursed and the patient will pay out of pocket. It&#39;s a frustrating field to be in. </p>

<p>You were very wise to inform yourself. I think people who suddenly have to deal with health issues expect that their doc will know what to do, and while some physicians are great many are now just a cog in the big healthcare machine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also think about the raw resources it must require in purchasing medicines. Let&#39;s dry them up. Let&#39;s make it impossible for them to spend money in outlets where they are no longer wanted. Let&#39;s show the world the truth of what they do and how irrelevant they are. Then show them towns destroyed by opiates, and corrupt doctors pushing meds on people. Let&#39;s get involved in court cases and make them wish they had different names. Let&#39;s show their peers, churches, and sports teams for who they are. Let&#39;s examine anyone currently receiving money from pharmaceuticals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Renegotiate terms with big pharma by coalescing around socialized healthcare. A national health service would cut costs and improve access of service to citizens.<br/>
Of course, in order to do that you would need a representative government of the people. Therefore, the primary issue may be regulating money out of politics. Publicly funded campaigns, limits on private / corporate funding, broadcast by a publicly funded medium. Otherwise, big pharma will always out spend the American public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m big pharma. 5 year old Billy comes to me with cancer that I can easily cure (she just needs to smoke some dank crystal weed). </p>

<p>Obviously this is unacceptable because I want to make as much money as possible. So I sell Billy a $300,000 cancer &quot;treatment&quot; that may relieve some symptoms temporarily, but ultimately can&#39;t cure the cancer. Thus, Billy dies a year later.</p>

<p>But wait! Let&#39;s consider an alternate reality:</p>

<p>I admit that crystal fucking weed actually can cure cancer. Billy is cured! Now, instead of dying at 6 years old, Billy will live to the ripe old age of 90. During his long life, Billy will need medical services numerous times. He&#39;ll break a few bones, go to his annual checkups, and need prescriptions for various illnesses. By the time Billy hits 65, he has a couple of (actually) incurable conditions that require prescriptions and medical services to hold at bay. It&#39;s easy to see that in this timeline that fits so many people today, big pharma actually makes much, much more money than they ever did by charging Billy for a fake cancer treatment and letting him die.</p>

<p>Unless you truly believe that there is one big &quot;cure&quot; out there for everything that big pharma is holding back, you can&#39;t reconcile this timeline with your assertion that big pharma holds back treatments that will not be profitable to them in the short term.</p>
