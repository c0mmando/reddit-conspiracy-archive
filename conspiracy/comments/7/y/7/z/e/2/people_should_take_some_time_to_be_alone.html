        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think for people to develop some healthy and strong personalities, they should reflect about life and about what really matters. Even before I became associated with the term conspiracy theorist, I didn&#39;t like the idea of being hyper connected to people through different media like facebook and such, so while I did use such methods of communication I always kept a healthy distance from them, always focusing on my own goals. Now, identity politics has invaded nearly every aspect of people&#39;s lives and even the internet. People work so much and are constantly under the threat of being judged by society that they don&#39;t have time to reflect about their own identity and have to follow the values of society just to survive.</p>

<p>Reflection is very important to becoming more whole. Take some time alone to think for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Divide and conquer.</p>

<p>If anything people need to have more of a sense of community and a willingness to see each other as we actually are.</p>

<p>Perspective not filtered through corporate technology. </p>

<p>Mindfulness and self reflection are essential but clear communication and defined roles in family and community lead to purpose and self-respect.</p>

<p>Society is not just reacting to corporate media and marketing.</p>

<p>If you do not represent don&#39;t expect somebody else to represent you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree. I see friends bounce from one relationship to another to another and they never actually figure out themselves. They are constantly being influenced and trying to fit in and they aren&#39;t authentic with themselves. </p>

<p>Take a few months off, contemplate exactly what you are. Deeply look within and meditate on your findings. Being alone is amazing and empowering. Once you truly understand your natural, a humble self confidence radiates from you. </p>

<p>At this point you can really contribute to a relationship because you only expect your partner to be themselves. It&#39;s wonderful. I highly recommend talking time and practicing self reflection. It can only enhance your quality of life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can’t say I agree with your reasoning but there is benefit to distancing ourselves from the trenches to get a better perspective and take in comforting details of our world, even in this muck,that are overlooked.  It can be demoralizing to see destructive forces tear apart our stability and prosperity.  It helps to remember what good still surrounds us, to be thankful for our basic needs being met and for the loved ones in our lives; to remember God has plans to bring this demonic war to an end that will turn everything back into  a new good and a restored peace. All this is temporary. </p>

<p>As far as keeping distance from others that share your insights, it seems you view this part of your life as a shameful secret that you compartmentalize.  It’s good to disclose with discretion bec many make outlandish assumptions about ppl who have allowed themselves to see evidence of what is openly being done by world class liars.  It’s a psyop intended to make ppl from associating or accepting what will bring them ridicule and loss of social standing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ye. One thing that overload of info/news/internet/TV/conspiracy theories do is making people think they constantly need to be up to date with current events and things slow down and get so much more calm when you just sit and like read a book. When you spend some time alone your mind gets so much more clearer about life, your values and you realize how different the real world is than the projections on screens. </p>

<p>Before I was targeted really badly I spent a while mostly alone or with my best friend, doing hobbies I loved and meditating, I had such a bright outlook on the world and didn&#39;t know anything about targeting or how bad/deep conspiracies go. I had profound spiritual experiences that helped me be a better person, most importantly I learned life is like a dream and it can be controlled by our minds. I&#39;m tortured whenever I meditate now cuz it helps with connect with something greater. </p>

<p>So when we engage in controlled activities that are provided for us and we don&#39;t enjoy them like most schools or jobs people lose touch with themselves, their true values and become like a zombie that doesn&#39;t have any higher dreams or needs to be more than what we are and they just live on auto pilot cuz that&#39;s the only way the system allows us to live in a sedated state with an illusion of happiness by the entertainment they provide. They TRY to make life hell for those who become masters of their own life.  </p>
