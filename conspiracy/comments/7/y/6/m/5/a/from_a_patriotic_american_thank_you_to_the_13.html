I&#39;m not going to tell you that now, because I don&#39;t believe it. Im not usually a petty man, but what I AM here to do is gloat over the fact that people have been straight faced swearing up and down that there was no Russian interference. Now, indictments have been made proving otherwise. The fact that we&#39;re now even debating over just how big the impact was proves my point, which is simply that it happened. That&#39;s all. And I would like to further point out how <em>immensely</em> and <em>deeply</em> satisfying it is to me to see people scrambling to turn the narrative to &quot;well was it even that big of a deal?&quot; Because you miss the point completely, which is simply that it happened.</p>

<p>Yep.</p>

<p>The fake news Russian <em>interference</em> has shifted from unsubstantiated claims of Russian hacking, to unsubstantiated claims of Russian collusion, and finally to unsubstantiated  claims of Russian social media trolling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An indictment isn&#39;t proof of guilt though. Otherwise why would we have trials? And furthermore I think it&#39;s highly unlikely we will see a trial because I think it&#39;s also highly unlikely that Russia is going to extradite. What I do find interesting is why are we not going after other organizations using bots to push propaganda on social media? How do you feel about those organizations spreading propaganda? Should we also investigate them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely we should investigate anyone found spreading disinformation propaganda, especially knowingly.

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t know if they are because the only thing being discussed is the Russians. I watched the congressional hearing the other day with members of the IC. The thing I found most interesting was how China has been influencing colleges here in the states. Were you aware of that? Maybe you were, but I wasn&#39;t. In my opinion, China is a much scarier nation than Russia is today. Maybe 40 years ago the opposite was true, but not now. So why aren&#39;t we focusing on a real threat like that rather than a bot army? Bots are everywhere. Everyone uses them. I&#39;m sure many folks were unaware of that, but I truly believe that this narrative is being used to discredit certain viewpoints as invalid and to promote censorship. Fear is absolutely a tool used. It appears to me that this is nothing more than a red scare tactic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an interesting perspective. I&#39;ll bite, and I don&#39;t mean this in a divisive way, but to what end do you believe this red scare 2.0 so called, has to do in terms of censorship?

    <div class="md"><p>The recent censorship on Twitter, Facebook, and demonetization of videos on Youtube. That kind of stuff. I really do believe that this is being used as justification for censoring conservative viewpoints. It might surprise you to know that I used to consider myself somewhat liberal. I don&#39;t really fall into any camp though. Probably more libertarian than anything. But I don&#39;t believe censorship of any kind is good. And I do believe that that&#39;s what&#39;s happening. I much like you don&#39;t want another country spreading disinfo here. I&#39;m just highly suspect of the Russian angle that&#39;s been shoved down our throats for the past year and a half. If Russia&#39;s doing it other countries are. Us too. I&#39;ve seen perfectly reasonable comments that weren&#39;t inaccurate in any way being down voted to oblivion on this very site. That seems pretty evident of bots and I just don&#39;t believe that they are all of Russian origin. During the election when I&#39;d google Trump the results were very negative. When I&#39;d google Clinton it was all good shit. I truly believe that social media, whose companies are admittedly left leaning, do things to hide things and persuade folks to their line of thought. I do believe as a private company they have that right, I just think it&#39;s a really sneaky tactic that a lot of folks are unaware of. And the modern day McCarthyism going on is a tactic being used to shut down different takes. I&#39;ve seen it plenty here. Someone states a conservative viewpoint and rather than argue or provide contradictory evidence cats will call them Ivan or a Russian shill. Like the new take on Assange. Because he aired Clinton&#39;s dirty laundry now it&#39;s claimed he&#39;s in bed with Russia. They don&#39;t want to talk about the fact that everything he&#39;s ever posted has been 100% true. No, rather they refuse to even listen to anything he says because he&#39;s &quot;partisan&quot;. It&#39;s a tactic being used to shut down a conversation. It&#39;s one of many. The entire racist/bigot, Islamaphobe, sexist name calling is another. I just think this is a new form of it. Do you get where I&#39;m coming from?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I actually agree step for step here. I&#39;m a liberal myself but I&#39;m actually working on research for an article on the &#39;authoritarianism&#39; of the left, moreso nowadays then ever. I can totally see where you&#39;re coming from, how easily Russia can be used as a label to dismiss certain points of view. And it&#39;s a tricky line to toe because I personally believe that in this case there&#39;s no smoke without fire, but we have to be realistic about also silencing dissenting opinions while considering that there may yet be grains of truth in these, for lack of a better term, narratives. You have to be wary of what each side is trying to spoon feed you, I feel like the truth usually lies somewhere in the middle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t doubt for a minute that Russia tried to influence our elections. Again I&#39;m just highly suspect regarding just how much this story has been pushed. I posted a video the other day that I saw. It&#39;s a TEDx talk about propaganda. I&#39;ll leave you a link. I found it interesting anyways. Don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever heard of Jordan Peterson, but he has some good shit about the authoritarianism of the left. I think there are quite a few folks who consider themselves liberal but recognize that the party is somewhat being high jacked. I gotta tell you it was nice to talk to someone not so dug into their worldview to have a legit conversation. You&#39;ve helped a bit to restore my faith in folks, thanks for that! Good luck with your paper!</p>

<p>No more than any other argument can be used to the same effect. Like when there&#39;s a school shooting and someone says &quot;let&#39;s not politicize on a tragedy&quot; is also a way to shut down conversation.</p>

<p>I agree that a lot of folks are dug in on their world view and may not be looking for a counter to their argument. But there are people who will hear about something and want to look into it. Astroturfing, down vote brigades, etc are a way of suppressing arguments and facts on sites like these where people are sharing ideas and beliefs. I&#39;ve seen many, many folks in this sub spreading disinfo. Whether they&#39;re coming from a place of ignorance or are intentionally trying to muddy the water isn&#39;t for me to do decide. I try to give proper links to cite my conclusions, but often it doesn&#39;t matter. And for those people who are looking for the truth, it&#39;s beyond difficult these days to discern what it actually is thanks to strategies such as these.</p>

<p>I pretty much agree people are dug in. I am however an optimist and do believe that people are capable of rising above tribal instincts.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve got a hell of a point there. The only thing I will say though, is that saying I don&#39;t want to talk politics right now is far, far different than calling people horrible and evil because of their political beliefs. Again I lean pretty left on a lot of things. I did not vote for Trump. But I had many friends and family who did and aren&#39;t anything like the ignorant, racist/bigots that they&#39;ve been depicted as. The media has been shaming folks with a conservative viewpoint for many, many years and in the past year and a half they doubled the fuck down on it. Republicans care about folks just as much as liberals do. They just see policy differently. It&#39;s a fallacy to believe one side has better morals than the other. Don&#39;t know if I made sense here, but hope you got my general gist.</p>

<p>Anyways, Nice to see someone actually discussing things. Good day my friend.</p>

<p>Again I agree. It was nice talking to you too. I appreciate your points and agree with you quite a bit. Enjoy your weekend!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is like a batter arguing they feel better that they hit in to a double play instead of striking out. I dont think  that anyone&#39;s ever denied that Russians use bots to try to influence opinion, most governments probably do.</p>

<p>The goal was two things: Trump was a &quot;Russian Puppet&quot; and they &quot;hacked thr election&quot;,  and <em>we will not let you forget it</em>:</p>

<p>Of course, im being facetious. But you dont want to go down the road of speaking realistically about this. Because then you might discover that &quot;collusion&quot; was never actually a crime. You might discover that violating 4th amendments for political purporses is.  You might discover the ultimate irony that Russian intelligence sources fed disinfo to a certain former MI5 who now runs smear campaigns for state enemies (thor haaverston). If you read his recent testimony over in the UK you might realize why he has refused to testify in front of the precious SC. There&#39;s no stopping this now.</p>

Hell, I agree that it didn&#39;t even really matter that much and as a matter of fact I&#39;ve said from the beginning that if Russia had launched these social media scheme&#39;s I seriously doubt the efficacy of such efforts. But that&#39;s not my point at all. I&#39;m just being self indulgent here for a moment, reveling in the fact that people have been insisting that it didn&#39;t happen, period. And now we know it happened, the narrative shifted so incredibly quickly to &quot;well it&#39;s not like it mattered anyway&quot; that it nearly gave me whiplash. Thats all my point is, that these crybaby trumpists have no credibility because they literally stand for nothing.

    <div class="md"><p>So, one look at my name will tell you what industry I work in. Ive seen things done by companies that are very similar to what these 13 individuals do. These online behavior is a set of common tactics developed in the marketing world, imagine that. </p>

<p>Now, our government has been hacking away at other governments for a while now. Somebody hacks somebody and we do it back and forth all the time. Typical spy shit in the 21st century, dating back to the 90&#39;s.</p>

<p>In 2016 when Clinton&#39;s email server was &#39;hacked&#39; I knew that blaming it on the Russians was a bullshit lie, because the numbers that would need run to zero in on a private server (nobody in govt should be allowed to have these period, but I&#39;m not here to talk about infosec), were astronomical. It was <em>much</em> liklier that the data breech happened from the inside, if not intentionally then definitely because she was using a small, unknown MSP that didn&#39;t have the knowledge to properly secure the system. I e. More likely Hills hired inept idiots. But, the HRC PR machine screamed Russia all day. </p>

<p>Flash forward to the Primaries. From the perspective of a moderate who didn&#39;t like any of the candidates, Sanders was my best choice.  Now, I know the Clinton machine, I&#39;ve spent the better part of 30 years observing these people and their tactics. They were stacking the votes for Clinton, but when voter fraud was brought up the Clinton machine once again screamed Russian interference. No prppf, just ranting and insistence until the story died. </p>

<p>I legitimately thought Clinton had it in the bag. She is so corrupt there isn&#39;t a politician or celebrity that isn&#39;t in her pocket. Ever notice that? Funny. I was 100% convinced Clinton would win (a thought that made me sick) because I couldn&#39;t fathom anyone voting for Donald Trump out of sheer principle alone. Holy shit was I wrong. </p>

<p>Turns out, there&#39;s some pretty dedicated people on the other side of that political table from me, and they were willing to mobilize and do the unthinkable in order to save this country from Hillary Clinton, and for that I applaud the MAGAs. </p>

<p>So when they say that it doesn&#39;t matter, I hate to give it to them but they&#39;re right, even if annoyingly conveniently so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so there was this thing called 9/11, which was kind of a collaboration between the USDS, Israel, and Saudi Arabia.  They did this huge false flag where they demoed three skyscapers in downtown NYC, but made it look like a terrorist attack.  They then used this as an excuse to go spend a few trillion in the middle east bombing brown people.  Anyways, needless to say this is all pretty illegal, so they had to cover it all up.</p>

<p>Robert Mueller was head of the FBI at the time.  The FBI is a Federal Bureau charged with Investigating crimes.  Unfortunately, under Robert Mueller there wasn&#39;t much investigation of the largest &quot;terrorist&quot; attack in American history.  </p>

<p>Oh, so what you are saying is that you didn&#39;t read the indictment and therefore have no real idea what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t 13 random Russian internet warriors. The operation described in the indictment had hundreds of employees and a monthly budget of $1.25 million. And each of those hundreds of employees was using software that allowed him to manage hundreds of different fake social media accounts. They basically were operating a small army of trolls with hundreds of live human beings operating tens of thousands of accounts -- all day, every day.</p>
