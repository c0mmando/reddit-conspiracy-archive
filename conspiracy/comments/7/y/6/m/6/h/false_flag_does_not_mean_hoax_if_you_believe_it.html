       Quoting your link:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The contemporary term false flag describes covert operations that are designed to deceive in such a way that activities appear as though they are being carried out by individual entities, groups, or nations other than those who actually planned and executed them.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And quoting this link for "hoax" (
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoax">
        https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoax
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A hoax is a falsehood deliberately fabricated to masquerade as the truth.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, all false flags are a type of hoax.  There are hoaxes that are not false flags, but all false flags consist of a deliberately fabricated falsehood that masquarades as the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       From that the OP's statement is either incorrect or stating a platitude that two different phrases don't have the exact same meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       The correct statement would be:
A false flag is a type of hoax.

       I think the fact that news organizations have faked footage in the past - ahem, CNN - has led to a deserved skepticism from those who know. I don't know how many or if events have been faked, but I sure as hell believe I've seen faked "footage" of these mass casualty events.

       I don't disagree with you. I was just pointing out that people will automatically dismiss your ideas because you bring up CNN (or MSM for that matter).

       its alright.  everything is a false flag op on here.  everything. every bullet fired according to some twit is a false flag. do you realize how absolutely stupid that looks. every day.  then people go on and on and on about the same false flag trope.
      </p>
      <p>
       dont worry false flag has lost any meaning or relevance by everything turning into one.

       It could be an effort to make conspiracy researchers appear disreputable, same as flat earther posts. As there are enough idiots in the world to provide this content all that needs to be done is have a bit upvote the shit out of their hogwash. It makes the community as a whole look stupid and it's very easy to do. And if this community looks stupid then people won't listen to them if they do stumble upon something questionable.

       cant it be a bit of both.  vegas is a bit weird ill give you that.  sometimes people kill other people.  the media loves to feed on it and then spew it back.  i stopped watching american news media a while back.  its tiring that "every shooting is a false flag" statement.

       Right, and there are people who take stuff too far and make all the skeptics look stupid. The media and Obama went after AR-15s afterwards even though the only weapons found were 3 pistols and a pump action shotgun. Then there was that guy in the camo pants who they chased through the woods. There's alot of shit about the official narrative that didn't add up, same goes for Vegas, as for Florida it's too soon to tell, but it looks like a legit crazy person and the FBI shit the bed as usual

       I used to share the same opinion. You can probably find a post of mine in this subreddit saying something like "If the US Government wanted to pull off something like this, then they'd just send a special forces guy in and kill a bunch of kids. It's cheaper and more effective, with less chance of getting caught."
      </p>
      <p>
       The more I researched it though, the more obvious the hoax becomes. You have:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Smiling dad
       </li>
       <li>
        "Everyone must check in"
       </li>
       <li>
        Ambulances and police from outside the town being turned away
       </li>
       <li>
        A bus driver who saves a load of kids dropping them off on some weirdo's lawn, not taking them to the police or the hospital
       </li>
       <li>
        A coroner hoping that it doesn't come down on the heads of the people of Newtown
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       etc, etc, etc.

       What is everyone must check in? Not sure the bus driver thing means a lot to me.

       I just don’t see how you can look at those few pieces of “evidence” and say “that’s obviously a hoax.” It’s questionable AT BEST.

       No, it's quite the opposite for many. People see inconsistencies with what they've been presented, so they dig deeper and find things that challenge their bias.

       Conspiracies are real and this sub is important. I, too, believe Sandy Hook happened. If I had such utter disdain for the fellow members of this community, however, I'd likely keep it to myself.

       Because it’s not believable and it is completely erroneous to say that you knew someone (you don’t). You can’t prove it so it adds nothing of value. It’s the lowest possible fruit on the vine, emotional appeal.

       If you don’t think that the genuine usership here is well past that, I suggest you do your homework and consult your handbook, soldier.

       So when you can’t prove your ridiculous claims it’s a conspiracy but when someone claims something that refutes you they are automatically a liar? You people are something else live in your own little world.

       Here's the thing though:  In no other school shooting have the parents rallied so hard for crowdfunding support, nor have they gone so hard after people you are dubbing crazies for questioning the narrative.  The parents of Sandy Hook have freely taken millions of dollars from the government, from people like you and me, and even Boeing when they donated to them, while simultaneously chasing more after the 'crazies' than anyone ever.  If these people are crazy and not speaking something that's the truth, why not just ignore them?

       He's not talking about Sandy Hook. He literally said Florida. He's talking about the recent events.

       I don’t believe than any of the shooting or terror attacks were a hoax or fake.  I know they happened, i know people died.  Now what i question is the intent.  Most of them probably are 100% real and are what they say, but I believe some of them were performed by groups with a motive...

       Yeah I know they happened, are you questioning wether sandy hook and las vegas and other atrocities even happened? All I’m saying is that I don’t think all of them were just some lunatic acting on his own crazy behalf, I think its a strong possibility that some of these were planned/organized/aided by corporations/governments/other private interest groups, for the specific goal of turning half of America against its own second amendment and eventually the removal of it or legislation around it.

       You claim knowledge,not guesses. So if you can't share the reason you claim it's fact we have nothing more than an internet comment.

       I have not seen any evidence of a death at Sandy Hook. So I neither believe nor disbelieve. I find the claim of deaths unlikely.

       Me saying I know that they actually happened is me trying not to offend the family of someone who was involved.  We ask for evidence if the claim is that widely accepted events DID NOT happen, not vice versa.  I’m sure you’re just trolling or whatever, but either way, your input is not useful.

       Do you actually think we believe that John Q Public who “knows someone” who died this week, is just, to use your words, “sleuthing” around on a conspiracy forum on Saturday morning?

       Let's assume you're really someone lurking this board for information and go from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not here for an argument, you hold your own opinions.  Just providing insight.
      </p>
      <p>
       People don't agree with the official narratives that are put through the media.  This used to be one of the only boards on reddit that you could discuss it on without the constant insults.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I would say in the months leading up to the 2016 election, it has become quite obvious this place has been infiltrated too.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, personally, I search for objective information to come to my conclusions.  Cases like Sandy Hook(amongst all the mainstream shootings) have a lot of inconsistencies that people want to discuss because they can't get their heads around it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could very well be that they can't publish the information that some people seek.  But it seems to happen every time there is one of these "shootings", there's a lot of things that don't add up.  So people want to discuss them.  They may be wrong, but by hopefully by discussing them, the questions can be cleared.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't agree with the insults on either side, nothing can be gained from bringing others down.
Have a good day and I hope this provided some insight!

       Great comment. Thanks for your opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am all for discussion and differences of opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I’m not for is elementary thinking and school yard name calling that insists there is literally nothing to discuss here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can’t stand the denial of the truth so I often react in a visceral tone when I should keep my cool and realize that this is just another part of the program.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it’s true they can hoax these events, then it certainly stands to reason they can enforce the narrative where it is most likely to be questioned.

       Why? All you have if you haven't dug deeper is what you've been presented. It's not a hard concept. Do some research, keep an open mind so as to not automatically reject new information, then form your own opinion.

       See, this is annoying. I have spent the hours in watching "We Need to Talk About Sandy Hook" and "Dear Wolfgang," and I've read all of the links people post when others ask for info proving it was a hoax, and none of it has in any way convinced me that it was a hoax. And instead of recognizing that people can come to different conclusions, the default response to people making statements like mine here is to insinuate that they are shills or not posting in good faith.

       Just some friendly advice.  You are not going to convince anyone to change their mind by saying,  "Watch this 1 hours video."
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you get people to start watching the video, there needs to be some point made quickly.  The dude is talking about how he was a law enforcement officer and weighted 80 lbs less.  He goes on to talk about how cops eat doughnut.  What a f-ing waste of time.  The funny thing is, the very first thing he says on the video is "I cannot afford to waste your time."  He then proceeds to do nothing but waste time with worthless stupid music and his stories about eating doughnuts.
      </p>

       With that guy advocating your theory, no one is going to listen.

       Thanks for the advice. I'm not concerned with anyone changing their mind. And it isn't my theory, it's his theory and when he gets to the meat of it I think he asks very compelling questions. In a topic where people are discussing sandy hook, it isn't
       <em>
        unhelpful
       </em>
       to link a documentary that dives into this. Maybe you won't find it helpful, and maybe the guy who asked for info wont, and maybe even most people won't! But comments like mine are how I came to learn about a lot of different topics. So yes, it is helpful for the people who do want to take the time. Is it a perfect documentary and is Wolfgang Halbig the perfect public speaker? No. But does it present compelling evidence and ask compelling questions
       <em>
        in a way that is better than I could do?
       </em>
       Yes! I'm not a great writer so I prefer to let others do the talking.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone finds the documentary annoying or difficult to watch, Wolfgang Halbig did
       <a href="https://www.thehighersidechats.com/wolfgang-halbig-sandy-hook-lawsuit/">
        this interview
       </a>
       on The Higherside Chats where they cover much of the same material as the documentary I linked before. It is still just over an hour long though, so sorry I can't do anything to make this information bite sized and easily digstible for a modern world that demands our "infotainment" be short and sweet.

       So the FBI and the local police departments are all liars and fabricated an entire mass murder and Wolfgang Halbig is the one honest person in the whole world?
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with that message is that it detracts from the real problems. The FBI and local police do manufacture evidence.  But when you spread bullshit like this, it makes it harder for people to believe the legitimate cases.  There are plenty of cases of police manufacturing evidence.  Seven officers in Baltimore just got convicted and the trial showed exactly how they manufactured evidence.  Its not a conspiracy theory when the people are convicted of conspiracy -- then it is a fact.   Plenty of legitimate police conspiracies out there.  No need to spread bullshit ones.

       No, you’re putting words in my mouth drawing conclusions about my viewpoint. I never said Wolfgang Halvig is the only honest person in the whole world. Why would you even say that? I said he presents compelling evidence and asks compelling questions. I never even said I believe everything he says. Stop twisting my words.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to be perfectly clear, I think everyone should look at all the available information and draw their own conclusions. You’re being disingenuous with your “friendly advice.” You’re just using tactics to slide the conversation to support your preferred narrative. I see no reason to do to continue this conversation, as it is obviously not happening in good faith.

       He doesn't present any evidence at all.   He jumps to conclusions based on a lack of evidence.  It would be like you coming up to a man and saying "Show me your penis." When they say "No," you conclude he doesn't have a penis.  You go on down the street and ask other men the same thing.  They all say "No."  You then conclude there is a massive conspiracy because the men in this town don't have penises and are all trying to cover it up.  Very compelling evidence.  Very compelling questions.

       Look up the helicopter footage of the people walking in circle at the fire station. Watch "we need to talk about sandy hook". Re-watch Robbie Parker, the mortician guy, and the neighbor guy (gene something I think?). Enjoy losing the rest of your day and your perception of reality.

       and then say it was all just "clinging to tenuous bullshit".  It makes you lose all credibility and is the definition of cognitive dissonance.  If you believe the Sandy Hook official story I couldn't imagine what conspiracies you actually think are real.

       For many of the ideas discussed here there won't be a source, you need to look at what information is available and draw your own logical conclusions.

       I did like your original comment, so not sure why all the down votes.  But "real dialogue" does not consist of saying "If you researched it, you would see it my way."
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, perhaps you can share the original research that you performed.  I am not talking about internet links or watching a video.  Obvivously, you can't trust anything in a youtube video nor online.  If TPBP can fake a school shooting, then they can fake a youtube video and fake a performance at the Super Bowl.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what original research did you perform that helped you come to your conclusion?  Did you go to the city and personally interview anyone?  Did you take any pictures of the scene yourself?  Did you do anything that involved leaving your computer?

       I'm pretty sure I was referring to my original comment.  The OP said "nobody here thinks it was a hoax" and implied it was likely a false flag but could not have been a hoax.  I admitted that I hadn't thoroughly researched this even yet so I wanted to know what evidence he was relying on to make that comment.  That was the "real dialogue" I was referring to.

       Do you not realize how close minded that is?  I mean someone can read a book out loud and upload it to youtube.  Since it is on youtube does that now mean the book can no longer be trusted?  You can even follow along with your own book to confirm if you wanted to.  "Internet links and videos" are just a means of communicating information.

      <p>
       Again "youtube video nor online" is completely vague and nobody said you should automatically trust anything and everything.  So you trust Fox News, CNN, MSNBC to tell you the truth about the official story?

      <p>
       I would say the Super Bowl performance was not even part of the main evidence against the offical story.  Watching interviews with all of the people involved (like the coroner for one example out of many) shows you the official story makes no sense at all.

       I could ask you the same question on any event that ever happens.  Since no video or anything online can be trusted do you just not hold an opinion?  Do you just trust what the mainstream media tells you since you apparently are starting with the viewpoint that the event did in fact happen?

       You didn't watch any interviews of the people.  You didn't watch a single one.  What you watched were edited versions of much larger interviews.
      </p>
      <p>
       You didn't watch the press conference.  You watched an edited version.  You didn't see the persons demeanor 10 minutes before.  You didn't see the person's demeanor 10 minutes after.  You watched someone else's edit of what they want you to see.

       Yes, I visted the world trade centers prior to 9/11 and entered a large sky scrapper building that was very tall.  In 2002, I visted the same location and the sky scrappers were not there.  There was a pile of rubble where they used to be.  I concluded that the towers had been destroyed because of my own personal observations before and after 9/11.  Given the times I visited the location,  the time frame had to occur during 2001, and the site was consistent with the towers being destroyed on September 11.   There are numerous other examples I could site, but if you don't have any such personal stories yourself, I would suggest that you explore the world more.

       Congratulations, that was one event that happened almost 17 years ago.  Is that the only event that you hold an opinion on?  Do you believe the official 9/11 story about HOW the towers came down?  Since I've never even heard the argument that 9/11 was a hoax that didn't really happen, just confirming the towers came down doesn't do much as far as "researching" the entire event.

       I checked your IP address, accessed your devices and network traffic and see that you never downloaded any of the videos.  It is possible that you accessed them at a public library but I am pulling up the video feeds now, and.... no, no facial recognition of you using the public libraries to access the data.  But damn, someone watches a whole bunch of Pretty Little Liars....

       Lol..  I completely owned you on your retarded logic and that is the best response you can come up with?  One of the funnier ways I've ever seen anyone back peddle out of a conversation and doge simple questions once they realized how stupid their own logic was.  "checked my IP and accessed my devices"  Lol, sure you did.  Which edited press conferences and interviews did I watch then?  What vital information was edited out from the full version that you have yet to link to?

       It was. And one thing I've noticed is that now it is so obvious that Sandy Hook is bullshit, so many people have researched it, it's such a lost cause, that shills are now allowed to use a line like "I think Sandy Hook was probably fake but this one is real for sure, I know someone who got shot."

       After seeing the complete footage of the Pulse Nightclub shooting, I have a hard time believing it really happened.  I had assumed the "false flag" aspect in regards to the Pulse shooting was referring to staging a shooting to terrify the American people into surrendering their right to keep and bear arms.

       I entertained that thought, but after hearing people speak about how, when they tried to get out, something or someone was holding the doors on a side entry closed, idk.  That's an odd thing to say if you're a crisis actor for an event with a lone wolf shooter.

       People say false flag because it's one of their allowable talking points as shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though every high-profile shooting and terror attack in America since Aurora has been a complete hoax, with no deaths or gunshots, the precious meme that must be upheld at all costs is that people are actually dying at these events.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is only this way that the agenda of spreading fear will be accomplished. We are "allowed" to question the mainstream media's claims that a lone crazed gunman or ISIS member is carrying out these things, but we are not "allowed" to question the original claims themselves -- i.e., the claims that people were shot, killed, blown up, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, OP, I clearly understand the difference between a false flag and a hoax. Show me any reason to believe that any people have died at Sandy Hook, Boston Bombing, San Bernardino, Pulse, Charleston, Las Vegas, or Parkland.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until then I can be more specific than false flag and accurately label them
       <strong>
        hoaxes
       </strong>
       and will continue to proudly use this word in the face of shills sent here to obfuscate and assert speculative nonsense about multiple shooters etc. -- all in an effort to get people to accept the idea that there was at least one real shooter, without questioning this claim.

       When an event is being used as a bludgeon in an effort to destroy constitutionally protected liberties, no line of questioning can be deemed out of line or inappropriate and any effort to do so is anti-American.

       If even one shooting is ever fake, all the others must be questioned down to their foundational claims and real deaths must not be accepted until extraordinary and internally consistent evidence is proffered, especially if the new announced shootings are being shown among charts and graphs commemorating past events we know to be staged.

       Since I was not at any of them, I cannot give evidence of bodies at all. I don't believe anyone was killed at SH, Pulse, or SB; there's enough evidence for that. But it is important to use definitive language...

       You would think that if the deadliest mass shooting in the country happened in front of thousands of witnesses with recording devices I wouldn't keep seeing the same three or four indiscernible and inconclusive photos.

       Fair enough, but those pictures added on to the literal thousands of eyewitness accounts, the 500 that were wounded, the families of the 58 that were killed and the first responders.

       That's what it

       mean. What it means in this sub is "we can't blame this on foreigners of any kind so it must be a conspiracy." That's why things "didn't add up" about the Vegas shooting only after you learned he was a white guy. I know nobody wants to admit it, but it's as plain as the nose on your face.

       It’s basically what says it is...  it’s like if a country puts up the wrong flag on a ship and does an attack so it’s blamed on the wrong country.  Only it doesn’t have to be countries it’s the general phenomenon.  The offender does hope to use the false flag to push a narrative and that narrative could be considered a hoax.  Not the same thing as the event being a hoax though.

       Great comment. Thanks for your opinion.
      </p>

       I am all for discussion and differences of opinion.

      <p>
       What I’m not for is elementary thinking and school yard name calling that insists there is literally nothing to discuss here.

       I can’t stand the denial of the truth so I often react in a visceral tone when I should keep my cool and realize that this is just another part of the program.

       If it’s true they can hoax these events, then it certainly stands to reason they can enforce the narrative where it is most likely to be questioned.

       I’ve read the rules and am an active participant of this sub. I’ve apologized for dipshit comments I made made earlier today. This particular subject affects me. Don’t censor earnest sentiments.
