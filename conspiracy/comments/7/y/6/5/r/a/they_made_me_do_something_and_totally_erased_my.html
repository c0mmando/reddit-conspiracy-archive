        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Am a sane targeted individual. I did something they didn&#39;t like and one night in my home I took little cough syrup and xanax with dissociative and memory impairment SIDE EFFECTS, blacked out, they made me do something and I found out the next day from seeing evidence I left. Never had DID or lost time experience before or since but been harassed a lot by organized/covert crime since childhood. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like they need certain parts of the brain to light up so their tech can lock onto it and increase the effect. One time they induced an alien communication from smoking weed lol I swear I&#39;m not making this up and it could sound crazy without enough awareness about the issue but I don&#39;t care I know what I experienced. </p>

<p>edit: they want you to think mass shooters do it cuz they&#39;re crazy and hide the advanced mind control technology aspect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;no criminal was ever mentally ill cuz they use tech in some cases&#39; lol fuck off, it&#39;s obviously to control news cycles and keep people in fear. Before electricity was a thing people were manipulated by other things to act out violently, now that people are becoming more aware they need better and better ways to control us. </p>

<p>Have you even met a mentally ill person? Most mentally ill people don&#39;t go around shooting people and the ones that are really far gone are kept away from society. IF they manage to stay hidden it&#39;s fucking fishy, with all the surveillance tech they have now they can find anyone, they&#39;d still been manipulated by SOMETHING to act out so violently and I blame it on how the greedy assholes control our world or advanced mind control technology.</p>

<p>I believe suffering is a manifestation of mental illness in society, their technology/organized harassment can create mental illness. The mentally ill group of assholes that act like they control things want everyone to be like them and for everyone to think everyone else is crazy, to create an illusion of division between us. Every man is born good, we&#39;re just manipulated to think differently about ourselves, each other and the world around us by intentional limitations they create.</p>

They can&#39;t act without your consent, and taking drugs is a form of consent as you&#39;re giving up a little control of your consciousness. Just some food for thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read what you had to say, I still believe my initial theory and I wanna add how infections, bacteria, fungi and viruses are weaponized and used in targeting technology: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5iZFHcRK68">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5iZFHcRK68</a>   </p>

<p>When I just found out I&#39;ve been targeted since childhood they induced a possession experience, v2k like crazy for a week, control of my heart rate for 2 days. The same night they possessed me and controlled my heart rate they showed me a virtual reality dream of being murdered then tortured me a lot for 4 months by inducing lot of pain all over my body and they stopped when I typed in google one night I won&#39;t go crazy. Then they bought in a UFO outside my house as a last effort to push me into new age crap again. </p>

<p>They did this right after I did something they don&#39;t like as their way of &#39;punishment&#39; or conditioning to try and stop me from doing things they don&#39;t like, they made me lose consciousness from 1 milligram of xanax which has never happened to me after any amount of drug, I&#39;ve actually never lost consciousness in my life ever not even when a rock tore half my face off as a child, maybe when I&#39;ve drunk too much I wanted to sleep really bad but nothing like this.</p>

<p>Then they made me do something that was related to something they made me say when they induced the possession experience and then completely erased my memory of doing it. I&#39;ve never experienced lost time or dissociative symptoms in my life, I always remove clothes and crap from my bed before I sleep and when I woke I only remembered not going to sleep in my bed and NOT wanting to sleep, I found what they made me do from evidence they made me leave intentionally and my clothes were still on the bed I ALWAYS move them.    </p>

<p>When I&#39;ve taken xanax whenever, I forget little details of like a story someone&#39;s explaining to me while the xanax is still really high in effect, I&#39;ve never completely forgotten everything that happened, let alone it was just 1 milligram (I think the smallest dose is 0.5, believe me 1mg xanax is not supposed to do this to someone oh yeah with some cough syrup, still not supposed to happen.) </p>

<p>BTW xanax has memory impairment side effects and DXM has dissociative side effects that they increased to max and nothing nearly like this happened to me ever from trying a higher dose of those drugs. I don&#39;t get stupid high anymore and plan on enjoying better drugs that I won&#39;t name with great friends in their correct time and setting. (A perpetrator/handler I&#39;ve already removed from my life introduced me to xanax.) </p>

<p>I&#39;d already increased DMT in my body from meditating a lot, was on like a constant trip naturally and healing people around me, my life was awesome and can&#39;t have that now can we. I&#39;m tortured badly whenever I meditate. But I&#39;m still using everything they&#39;ve done to me to become a stronger and more cautious individual that&#39;s really prepared to live in a technologically advanced world without authority. In the world we live in today and the being I&#39;ve decided to become long time ago, just forgot, I&#39;m able to discern if one&#39;s authority over me is to be trusted and beneficial towards me and if I should use what they&#39;re offering. </p>

<p>In other words, by me knowing my self best, and how there&#39;s one voice I should trust about things in my own life that&#39;s my own voice and not different projections of whoever&#39;s out there like random reddit users and thanks to growing up with an awesome family in an era with information being passed so quickly on the internet, I can pretty much tell when someone&#39;s talking out of their ass, when to shut up and let others talk, not shy to fight for my rights and able to discern general bullshit better in my life and just turn the other way when I need to. I guess in this case I thought it necessary to say something <em>again</em> against the constant bot attacks about me taking 1mg xanax and some cough syrup, as if it has some leverage to deny all my other experiences or things I had to say about targeted individuals. No, this is just another T.I experience adding on all the others and you can&#39;t make it seem otherwise with all your stupid attacks. You kinda make yourself look dumber every time this happens. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t sit and mope or give any thought about my past experiences and this is like something for me to log them, rant sometimes and make more people aware about advanced tech at the same time.               </p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if you believe me I&#39;m responding cuz I don&#39;t want rest of people out there getting wrong info about targeted individuals. I&#39;m cutting back on my redditting too and caring more about my body/mind/soul/environment in general cuz they want people wasting time debating online like when atheists started to get the idea that with all their efforts to educate religious people online they just kept coming as if the image they&#39;re trying to project that rational, caring, wise, free thinkers are in the minority is an illusion. </p>

<p>I stood with a sign in freaking Tehran about targeted individuals and spoke to lot of real people about crazy advanced technology governments use to oppress us, how they use remote influencing technologies and normal people as their patsies to create organized harassment in certain people&#39;s lives and how every government and every level of society is infiltrated by &#39;them&#39;, in other words I spoke to lot of people outside the conspiracy circle about really weird stuff. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not afraid to say from my experience that most of us understand global oppression as it&#39;s been happening to our ancestors before us for MANY generations and the internet/news/TV is making this clearer everyday. People just need to discern between illusions better and what they <em>really</em> need in their life, understand a healthy individual reflects a healthy collective. </p>

<p>I like to get drunk with friends sometimes, I think that&#39;s worse than the very little &#39;substances&#39; I use and seen way more people start fights when they&#39;re drunk than on weed/benzos, I wonder why they don&#39;t make it harder for people to obtain alcohol in US and weed is illegal, hmm</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made the drug post cuz mind controlled shooters using drugs was relevant that day. I never abuse drugs, they made me black out, controlled to do something and wake up not remembering any of it. </p>

<p>I NEVER abuse drugs, I&#39;ve NEVER had a lost time episode from taking 1mg xanax. It was after I&#39;d done something they didn&#39;t like and the thing they made me do was related to my personal &#39;mind control programming&#39;, they&#39;ve hinted in advance about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>never mind the many other times I tried drugs and they never do anything when they&#39;re not pissed at me, there&#39;s an obvious pattern or manipulation that isn&#39;t related to the drugs or my will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not paranoid, I meet with awesome friends everyday, have an awesome boyfriend/family and really enjoy my life. I&#39;m grateful my mental health is lot better than most people, just informing people of things they can do with technology, it&#39;s been a hell of a wild ride and I don&#39;t regret any experience I&#39;ve gained in life, I always try to see the full part of the glass in any situation and I&#39;m not asking for anyone&#39;s help or talking because I&#39;m paranoid ;)</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite funny being called paranoid realizing the lengths they go to to keep tabs on everything with all their surveillance and whatnot lmao they call me the paranoid one </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was pointing out how ridiculous it is being called paranoid when PTB need all this surveillance crap, I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re trying to say but ok, you call you paranoid buddy.</p>

<p>Oh and, just to say I really understand what you&#39;re talking about and I just don&#39;t give a fuck that shills gonna call me crazy about this but they actually induced the feeling of paranoia in me technologically for a very short time (right before they did lot of other technological crap to &#39;traumatize me&#39;) and uh well, no...I&#39;m not in that state all the time, like if someone posts a pic of a cute animal do you keep talking about how crazy they are about animals or w/e lol, I&#39;m a pretty cool person if you got to know me, I enjoy my life a lot and paranoia is just..not even close to what I&#39;m about. I don&#39;t give a damn about the targeting cuz I just perceive my reality differently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read what you had to say, I still believe my initial theory and I wanna add how infections, bacteria, fungi and viruses are weaponized and used in targeting technology: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5iZFHcRK68">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5iZFHcRK68</a>   </p>

<p>When I just found out I&#39;ve been targeted since childhood they induced a possession experience, v2k like crazy for a week, control of my heart rate for 2 days. The same night they possessed me and controlled my heart rate they showed me a virtual reality dream of being murdered then tortured me a lot for 4 months by inducing lot of pain all over my body and they stopped when I typed in google one night I won&#39;t go crazy. Then they bought in a UFO outside my house as a last effort to push me into new age crap again. </p>

<p>They did this right after I did something they don&#39;t like as their way of &#39;punishment&#39; or conditioning to try and stop me from doing things they don&#39;t like, they made me lose consciousness from 1 milligram of xanax which has never happened to me after any amount of drug, I&#39;ve actually never lost consciousness in my life ever not even when a rock tore half my face off as a child, maybe when I&#39;ve drunk too much I wanted to sleep really bad but nothing like this.</p>

<p>Then they made me do something that was related to something they made me say when they induced the possession experience and then completely erased my memory of doing it. I&#39;ve never experienced lost time or dissociative symptoms in my life, I always remove clothes and crap from my bed before I sleep and when I woke I only remembered not going to sleep in my bed and NOT wanting to sleep, I found what they made me do from evidence they made me leave intentionally and my clothes were still on the bed I ALWAYS move them.    </p>

<p>When I&#39;ve taken xanax whenever, I forget little details of like a story someone&#39;s explaining to me while the xanax is still really high in effect, I&#39;ve never completely forgotten everything that happened, let alone it was just 1 milligram (I think the smallest dose is 0.5, believe me 1mg xanax is not supposed to do this to someone oh yeah with some cough syrup, still not supposed to happen.) </p>

<p>BTW xanax has memory impairment side effects and DXM has dissociative side effects that they increased to max and nothing nearly like this happened to me ever from trying a higher dose of those drugs. I don&#39;t get stupid high anymore and plan on enjoying better drugs that I won&#39;t name with great friends in their correct time and setting. (A perpetrator/handler I&#39;ve already removed from my life introduced me to xanax.) </p>

<p>I&#39;d already increased DMT in my body from meditating a lot, was on like a constant trip naturally and healing people around me, my life was awesome and can&#39;t have that now can we. I&#39;m tortured badly whenever I meditate. But I&#39;m still using everything they&#39;ve done to me to become a stronger and more cautious individual that&#39;s really prepared to live in a technologically advanced world without authority. In the world we live in today and the being I&#39;ve decided to become long time ago, just forgot, I&#39;m able to discern if one&#39;s authority over me is to be trusted and beneficial towards me and if I should use what they&#39;re offering. </p>

<p>In other words, by me knowing my self best, and how there&#39;s one voice I should trust about things in my own life that&#39;s my own voice and not different projections of whoever&#39;s out there like random reddit users and thanks to growing up with an awesome family in an era with information being passed so quickly on the internet, I can pretty much tell when someone&#39;s talking out of their ass, when to shut up and let others talk, not shy to fight for my rights and able to discern general bullshit better in my life and just turn the other way when I need to. I guess in this case I thought it necessary to say something <em>again</em> against the constant bot attacks about me taking 1mg xanax and some cough syrup, as if it has some leverage to deny all my other experiences or things I had to say about targeted individuals. No, this is just another T.I experience adding on all the others and you can&#39;t make it seem otherwise with all your stupid attacks. You kinda make yourself look dumber every time this happens. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t sit and mope or give any thought about my past experiences and this is like something for me to log them, rant sometimes and make more people aware about advanced tech at the same time.               </p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if you believe me I&#39;m responding cuz I don&#39;t want rest of people out there getting wrong info about targeted individuals. I&#39;m cutting back on my redditting too and caring more about my body/mind/soul/environment in general cuz they want people wasting time debating online like when atheists started to get the idea that with all their efforts to educate religious people online they just kept coming as if the image they&#39;re trying to project that rational, caring, wise, free thinkers are in the minority is an illusion. </p>

<p>I stood with a sign in freaking Tehran about targeted individuals and spoke to lot of real people about crazy advanced technology governments use to oppress us, how they use remote influencing technologies and normal people as their patsies to create organized harassment in certain people&#39;s lives and how every government and every level of society is infiltrated by &#39;them&#39;, in other words I spoke to lot of people outside the conspiracy circle about really weird stuff. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not afraid to say from my experience that most of us understand global oppression as it&#39;s been happening to our ancestors before us for MANY generations and the internet/news/TV is making this clearer everyday. People just need to discern between illusions better and what they <em>really</em> need in their life, understand a healthy individual reflects a healthy collective. </p>
