        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Today I dropped my little brother off at his high school to play in band for his high school basketball team. Before he got out I hugged, kissed, and honestly shed a couple tears. He’s scared too, so he didn’t tell me to stop, he just hugged me a little tighter and didn’t say a word. Dropping him off at school shouldn’t feel like I’m dropping him off at war. I’m 23 years old. I remember what it was like growing up. I was bullied, a lot, but thank God we didn’t have social media and smart phones back then the way we do now. At least when I left school I was safe from them. I didn’t have the perfect home but I had one. Through college I took a lot of psych classes and was astounded as to how many “emotional issues” I had that were so blatantly tied to traumas I experienced as a child. I was text book “sorority girl with daddy issues”. But my traumas led me to seek the love of guys who used me, not kill 17 people in a mass shooting at a high school. </p>

<p>What I’m getting at is this. People keep asking why is this a thing now? Back in my day these things didn’t happen? Okay well then let us look at what has changed. Gun rights/policies have not changed drastically in the last 50 years. But what has? </p>

<p>Households now almost always require both parents to work. This leads more children to be put in day cares, children who come home to grumpy and tired and stressed out parents from their long work day. Less meals at the table and more from the drive thru. You get where I’m going. </p>

<p>Social media. It’s poisoning. Children, far too young, have access to more information then they could ever need. Bullies can reach you at all hours of the day. Our children are now more self centered, vain, &amp; full of propaganda when they should be playing outside and watching spongebob. </p>

<p>Video games. A very unpopular opinion. But exposing children to gun violence and desensitizing them is bad for development. On what planet would any human being think it would be ok for a kid to play a game that’s main objective is to literally kill your opponent? Don’t tell me they are for 16+ tell me how many middle schoolers or even younger you know playing COD? This is another tool by tired working parents to keep children out of their face and busy. Leading to an array of issues. I’m not saying war games cause mass shootings. But they don’t help with the fascination of guns and violence. Same with movies. </p>

<p>Obesity. It is scientifically proven gut health is directly correlated to mental health. &amp; America isn’t know for their salads. </p>

<p>Broken homes. Marriage, monogomy, all of that seems (not mainstream).  Back in the day you were frowned up for having an affair or a baby out of wed lock or multiple baby daddies, etc. now it seems like the “stepford” families are few and far between. Children are meant to have 2 parents for a reason. </p>

<p>The drug epidemic. Leading to abuse, Socio economic problems, broken homes, drug addicted babies (who have high risk of developing defiant disorder/learning disabilities). When you come home and your mom is shooting heroin and you go to bed hungry, think how that is affecting your child?</p>

<p>Big pharma. We are shoving anti depressants, address, ritalin down kids throats when they don’t conform to our norm. It has to stop. </p>

<p>Idk if any of this would qualify as a conspiracy theory, but sometimes I think our government is executing an MK ultra experiment but like on a whole generation. Let’s get them fat, addicted to drugs, subliminal message them with high violence video games, tv shows, and movies. Shove propaganda down their throats via social media. I’m not here to defend guns or gun laws idgaf about that. What kind of society are we raising? Or are we becoming? What are they making us? We’ve let the media, the school system, the dr’s hi jack are children. The only people failing them is us. </p>

<p>1And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. 2And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 17 and can provide insight. Firstly, I deleted all social media and focused instead on education and spirituality and have not felt better in my short life so far. My generation is the most mentally disturbed generation of kids so far. Last week, I was on a school camp in which it was focused on personal and spiritual issues and the such. From that camp I learnt that 90% of my year level has/had anxiety/depression issues. The camp really blew my mind as all my peers opened up about themselves in a way I had never heard before. I felt like an outsider by being confident and in a way, carefree, about my life. I made the connection that social media, broken homes, lack of spirituality and on top of all that the stresses of education were the key reasons for the troubles kids my age suffer. </p>

<p>Note, that I am in Australia, where gun violence is obviously something that occurs only rarely and in gang violence mostly but the only thing I don&#39;t agree with your posts is the video games part. When we kids play video games we are focused either on advancing in the games or having fun with friends.</p>

<p>Social media is the biggest evil and biggest harm to kids my age though. I am so happy I got rid of all of it as I too suffered anxiety when I had it but in the 12 months I haven&#39;t I have never felt better. Social media creates false standards for people and I believe it&#39;s a way to control people my age. By feeding us so much information at the same time we become trapped in an endless trance of scrolling through the social media pages and eventually either wasting precious time or becoming depressed and suffering psychological issues. Then there is the issue of popularity which, prior to social media, was only ever based on who were the &quot;cool kids&quot; in the school grounds but with social media kids today use the number of likes and followers/friends as a measure of popularity and acceptance. All kids today just wanna fit in and be accepted and it has gotten bad enough that some kids will cry or be saddened if they do not get enough likes on a photo for example. When kids suffer anxiety, depression, etc. they are forced to take hundreds of drugs that will supposedly &quot;make them better&quot; but in fact it is worsening the mental state of kids worldwide and I know from personal experience that kids as young as 14 are stockpiled on antidepressants and similar drugs.</p>

<p>Your part about the government performing one massive &quot;MK Ultra experiment&quot; is something I completely agree with and I am terrified about the results of this experiment and how kids my age will deal with the struggles of life that come with older age.</p>

<p>I am usually an optimist, but as long as social media and most of everything else you mentioned is around, it is only going to get worse as kids today are simply drug-filled zombies sheepishly walking along without realising what is occuring around them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to hug you through the phone! I’m so sorry society has created sucH a world for you and your peers that your are dealing with these issues at such a young age! Th stress of paying your mortgage, feeding your family, paying your car payment as you get older is already so tough. At least I have my younger years to reflect on when I was more carefree. If younger generation are depressed and anxiety filled just as you said, no wonder they are snapping. You poor souls. We truly have failed you all. My brother is 15 and I try to remind him all the time the. Importance of education. I hope he makes it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea see 90% of kids your age are depressed. Its not cuz you all are fucked up from the gitgo. Its cuz society had failed them and they think there is no future, (maybe cuz its a fact). Its a combo of the social engineering and you feel bad when you aren&#39;t living up to societal milestones like virginity, girlfriend, etc. what have you. This coupled with the fact that you are the generation of lobster introduced to the hot water. Not sure if your familiar with the analogy but the reason we can discern such more bullshit is because those older than us have been slowly acclimated for quite some time. You and I as younger people are like &quot;WTF this water is so hot, isn&#39;t this water hot mom and dad and grandma?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Junior the water is fine, its always been like this&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wholeheartedly agree that we live in an extremely stressful era which is corrosive to the human psyche.</p>

<p>I would add in an extremely competitive economic system to your list.  Kids these days start out needing to get into advanced classes in junior high, which they must get good grades in to gain access to AP classes in high school.  Again they need good grades in high school and a whole panoply of structured extracurricular activities to get into a good college program.  Of course this college program will cost them $50-100k and <em>also</em> require extremely good grades to get into a graduate program so that they can hope to get a job that pays well enough pay off that college debt.</p>

<p>This entire time they are facing relentless pressure that if they screw up anywhere along this path they will wind up with a second rate future -- no AP classes, no good college program, worthless degree with still-crippling debt and a lower-wage job that leaves them paying off college loans into their 40s.</p>

<p>And none of this says anything about the nature of the institutions they&#39;re in -- run by bullying bureaucrats enforcing arbitrary rules and running kangaroo courts used to enforce various social agendas.  Which doesn&#39;t scratch the surface of peer life in these institutions, which is its own &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; kind of environment rife with bullying, class and status based discrimination and so on.</p>

<p>Even without the rest of your list, the modern education system is a zero-sum gauntlet of long-term failure opportunities.  It seems totally unsurprising that the &quot;rejects&quot; it spits out are at the point where anxiety, frustration, hostility, despondency and hopelessness end up intersecting.  And lets not forget we deal with this by using the police and criminal justice system because we don&#39;t have the money or resources to deal with this kind of psychological wreckage as a society.  Those the cops don&#39;t shoot or jail wind up ticking time bombs waiting to explode at whatever symbol of their lives seems appropriate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are given the proper guidance. Most kids (Aka me) don’t realize the consequences of taking out mass student loans.  You are 17/18 fresh out of high school, no parents, no care, full time job. Classes, dorm, books, food to pay for. All while still wanting to keep up with the “college crowd” and able to go out to eat, drink, wear nice clothes. Then you take out max student loans not even comprehending was debt really is. Then in 4 years you graduated with 50K in debt and can’t even find a job that makes 50k a year because you didn’t go to professional school. I can name 12 people right now that are living that same truth. Hell I even know dr’s and pharmacists who are struggling to pay their 200k student loans with their 120k jobs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;m going to pull the generation card. It gives me hope that someone from Gen Z gets it.</p>

<p>Great post! But here are a couple of more factors to consider: promiscuity and homosexuality.</p>

<p>The social acceptance of teen sex (especially now for females to be active compared to the associated stigma in decades past) and the shoving of the agenda in public schools through sex ed classes has turned schools into orgies. What&#39;s the problem? In such a scenario, the alpha males have multiple partners and the beta males have none. It&#39;s only socially-enforced monogamy that prevents beta males from becoming lonely and getting angry. Here is an article that explains it. Even though it&#39;s from a faith-based publication, this particular article takes an anthropological approach. <a href="https://www.crisismagazine.com/2018/judaisms-sexual-revolution-judaism-christianity-rejected-homosexuality">https://www.crisismagazine.com/2018/judaisms-sexual-revolution-judaism-christianity-rejected-homosexuality</a></p>

<p>The pushing of the gay agenda in schools is an extension of that. Evidence that there is propaganda is that polls show people think 25% are gay when the real numbers are more like 2%. Teens are confused enough without those confusing messages being pushed. This results in more bullying, anger, etc. At least two high-profile mass shootings are related to homosexuality: Columbia and Orlando.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in my 30s and have a 4 year old boy, sometimes I lay down at night and question if I&#39;m doing everything right for him, well... most nights I&#39;d say. I work 70 hours per week right now, 6 days a week and I&#39;m not with his mother so we split time down the middle. I&#39;m doing my best to teach him about being a good person, and trying to make sure I lead him down the right path but lack of time is a huge factor and it&#39;s not even really I choice at this point, it&#39;s either find a new job that&#39;s not going to pay as much so I will struggle to provide and will probably drive myself to insanity or continue working as much as I do to provide and drive myself to insanity. Both choices seem to lead to the same outcome and yet I try to hold my shit together and be a good example, it&#39;s not as big of a problem now as I&#39;m sure it will be in the future once he&#39;s able to fully understand that I&#39;m spending a majority of my waking hours working and unable to spend as much time with him as I truly want to. Not even sure where I&#39;m going with this honestly, the world just feels so fucked right now and I don&#39;t want my son to have to go through the same things that I am now, ugh sorry for the rant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An interesting read for sure, I consider myself more of an authoritative parent, same as my father. My Mother was more permissive and also tried going the route of being more of a friend than a parent most times, since my Father was constantly working out of town I spent most of my time doing whatever I wanted and was usually grounded for it when he was home, which wasn&#39;t often. I try to hit a middle ground with my son, I want him to be able to confide in me when he&#39;s got things on his mind but also teach him as best I can about how things work in the world, I think I&#39;m doing an okay job so far because my kid is well behaved most times especially for a 4 year old, at least in comparison to a lot of other children his age that I&#39;ve seen. One thing my parents did right when it came to school was talking to the teachers, if my grades were lacking or I had complaints about a particular class my parents would meet up with the teacher and discuss the situation. My dad has a very logic based mind so he was pretty good about knowing when a teacher was trying to help and if I was being a little turd, I turned out okay as an adult but it took a lot of speedbumps to get here and I&#39;d like to avoid having to see my son go through the same things growing up. Thanks for the post, much appreciated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting topic as I was just thinking about this the other day.</p>

<p>Does our society create mass shootings? No, not 100% at least, now to my explanation. </p>

<p>If someone wants to go to do a mass shooting they&#39;re gonna do it, it&#39;s going to happen. From bombings to running people over with cars, tragic events as such simply can&#39;t be stopped and there&#39;s nothing much we can do. These things are at any given moment and rather the person is under the influence, has mental issues, or is out for some type of &quot;cause&quot;, I don&#39;t believe there is no way to get it 100% under control.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never believed video games and other entertainment is the direct or only motive. Which is now leading me up to my main point...</p>

<p>The Media does play a HUGE part in these events, every time it happens it&#39;s plastered all over the media for a few weeks until it dies down. The media just gasses these events all the time and gives a the offender&#39;s name actual fame. They are giving these people who are already prone to doing such actions even more fuel every time this happens.</p>

<p>And since this is Conspiracy let me dip a but further into my thoughts in which I think we can most agree upon. </p>

<p>There is so much more shit going on in the world and right here in the U.S. that is not covered at all on the media, but, lets have a natural disaster or a tragic one and there is some type of bill being passed on the low.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh it&#39;s definitely a &#39;conspiracy&#39;, entities in position of influence and control are fully aware of the situation and making money hand over fist from the dissolution.  It is undeniably a declaration of war upon the sovereignty of the human spirit.  The response isn&#39;t one of violence or aggression but of opting out and informing oneself while acquiring health through discipline.  Excellent write-up, heartbreaking, stay frosty.</p>

<p>Pick any bad thing that sometimes happens and ask if we&#39;re failing somebody, somewhere, because we haven&#39;t fixed it yet.  Woe is me!  The sky is falling!!</p>

<p>Good things and bad things happen all the time.  It looks like that will continue.  If you focus on the bad things most of the time, then it&#39;s going to look like the end is near.  Instead, maybe, focus on the MILLIONS of school children who are doing OK, as opposed to the few who aren&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think such a statement of the problem has little chance of leading to a solution, given that people have been making the same observation for a very long time, with little to no change as the result.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a gun owner, and I don&#39;t much give a crap about my right to own a gun.  But, your observation isn&#39;t going to cause the MILLIONS of people in our country who do own guns and care a great deal about their right to continue to do so to change their minds.  If we&#39;re failing our children, then we&#39;ve been doing so for a very long time, and about quite a number of issues.  </p>

<p>So, to answer your question, yes.  Now what?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree! I truly believe we are being distracted by a lot of other lesser known evils. I read a conspiracy on here one time that has really stuck with me. A user was talking about how Hollywood directors and actors bragged about how they would make movies and shows about things that were really going on in our government/world that way we were exposed to it and if we ever heard of it happening in our government we would correlate it with “fiction”. They also talked about how it was a way to rub our noses in it, literally telling us what was going on and watching us do nothing about it. They said t way more eloquently but you get the gist lol </p>

<p>How can we help parents be better parents when they are indifferent to their children to begin with?</p>

<p>My father-in-law was born into a very wealthy family. He had any material possession he wanted. His parents were always working or at parties. No love. Just things.</p>

<p>This sort of neglect and emotional abuse inhibits the development of a normal human; it creates a human who cannot attach or bond to others. Disassociation. Detachment. So destructive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk how to say what I want to say without sounding like an awful human being. But I’ve always said being a parent should be a “privilege” not a right. Everyone is having children they either can’t afford or don’t care about and it is creating un loved and un nurtured citizens. I think more focus should be made on what it means to truly be a parent and how starting a family is a blessing not a right. Too many people are just sleeping around and getting knocked up leaving it to the system or grandparents to raise their children. We have given too many safety nets for accidental pregnancies, if we made starting a family harder (ex. Not giving out government assistance or tax credits) then the wrong people wouldn’t be breeding like wildfire. </p>

<p>** I’m going to stress I hope no one takes this the wrong way. I’m from a very rural town and know of families who literally have children to increase the money they get off the government. They sell their food stamps for drugs and their children grow up to be trouble makers and stealers just like their parents. Who then in turn have several children of their own. It is this awful cycle I have seen unfold in my hometown my whole life and I’m sure happens other places as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly, you’re right about the breakdown of families and the resulting children being a burden on society. However, strangely it’s a relief to know that someone else is seeing what is happening and knowing that it’s wrong. I’m planning on being a husband and father sometime in the future and seeing what I’m up against has lit a fire under me to really look into how and why the institution of family is completely under attack. I don’t want to clog up this thread with all of my findings and thoughts on it but pm me if you want some great reads and videos I’ve found (also my unsolicited thoughts on this as I’m deeply passionate and invested in making sure my family will be unbreakable) </p>

<p>As a very basic explanation, the traditional family is not good for an expanding government. Having a strong, providing father and loving, protecting mother; it’s hard for the government to justify stepping in and demanding more taxes under the guise of filling in the parental role. That’s why they told women to abandon marriage in the 60s and go pursue careers so now they have two incomes they can tax. They’ve also incentivized  single motherhood with food stamps and subsidized housing, letting the government step in as the provider and removing any consequences of having children out of wedlock. While she’s at work, she’ll send the children she can’t pay for or manage without a committed husband to state-run daycares (schools) to be indoctrinated with perpetuating this cycle. Governments win when families are fragmented. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I should’ve elaborated on the video games more. I’ve watched children who literally get off the school bus and go straight to their room and play video games. All evening no helping with chores or doing homework or socializing with family just video games. Mindlessly eating junk food playing video games. Not doing homework, playing video games. Staying up late, going to school without proper sleep because of video games. All weekend? Video games. When the parents try to interfere a full blown melt down usually follows suit then the parent gives up. Granted this is usually video games with violence but not always. And kids are on there arguing and screaming with dudes all over the world. I’ve witnessed this all first hand and nothing about that is healthy. It doesn’t even end in childhood, it follows you guys through puberty and adult hood. I know some very successful people who turn into mindless raging idiots when playing a good game of COD with their buddies. Just kind of don’t understand the culture behind them and can promise you my children won’t have them. </p>

All through high school, he was buried under a headset from the time he got home until 2 am. Yelled at my mom when she made him unplug for meals. Complained that he was tired and couldn&#39;t pay attention at school. Said he needed ADD drugs and that&#39;s why he couldn&#39;t pay attention. Had no aspirations to go to a four year college. He turns 24 this month, has made excuses for why he can&#39;t finish the last 12 credit hours of his associates degree at community college, lives with my parents, drinks eight cans of monster energy a day and still plays games until 2 o clock in the morning.

<p>Social media, social media.  Its quite a buzzword to use in order to get parents onboard on whatever thing you talk about. Social media has kept us closer than we ever been. People meet new people all around the globe, parents keep talking to their kids who are far away. While it can be used wrongly it doesn&#39;t mean its poison because some used it horribly</p>

<p>Also, really? Video games? Thats low. There something called esrp, its the parents fault for not reading the very easy to read mature label on it.</p>
