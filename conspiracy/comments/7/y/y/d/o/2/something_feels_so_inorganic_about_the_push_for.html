        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Gun reform has been politicized.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not trying to tackle the actual root causes of WHY people want to shoot places up (i.e terrorism) such as social isolation, stigmas such against mental health treatment than are you really solving anything? Mass shootings may be being caused by people with rifles but how is this going to curb overall gun violence? For example the city of Chicago doesn&#39;t even sell guns but somehow people are running round there with literal military grade weapons. </p>

<p>Are most gun deaths the result of mass shootings or is this simply hysteria? Do we need gun reform or actual healthcare reform? Should teachers be trained and should school administrators be taught with how to spot and deal with those who feel outcasted? Political Science tells us that terrorism is the after effect of social outcasting. An example? look at Europe: The Paris shooters and the Belgian shooters were second and third generation immigrants. Regardless of gun laws, people will get guns. You can&#39;t stop them. But what gun control IS enabling is the inability for individuals or the proletariat as a whole to commit an armed uprising. With the rising cost of living, the stagnating wages, the fact that most Americans can&#39;t even handle a $1000 dollar emergency is the best option to turn this whole boat around to lose the one symbolic way that regimes throughout history have been changed ? </p>

<p>I would argue that this whole push to take away guns as a wholesale thing is simply an extension of the encroachment of the security state on the rights of Americans and the amplification of the &#39;war on terror&#39;. The NSA has been spying on us and still does (it didn&#39;t go anywhere), the CIA has been proven to at the very least spy on the very regulators in congress who are to watch over it (we know from the very little released about MKULTRA and Mockingbird that the possibility is control) You just witnessed the literal rigging of an primary against the most popular candidate in decades, propaganda has been legalized to share use domestically, FISA has been shown to be extremely flawed. The FBI regularly entraps individuals in plots knowing full well they are sensitive. I think it&#39;s a matter of security and the only people that a full gun ban favors are those that benefit from the status quo (i.e. literally everybody but ordinary people). </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like kids being bullied is a new thing: what is new is &#39;mass shootings&#39; and you have to ask yourself why. I&#39;m not convinced all these are 100% organic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like to follow the money when speculating conspiracies. Who benefits from post mass shooting hysteria the most? The NRA &amp; the republican law makers in their pockets. Is it possible the real conspiracy is a republican/nra one constantly condemning democrats “trying to take yer guns” all while their constituents swarm madly to stock up. Seems to be less of a stretch to me and they are constantly projecting. Easy maths</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s the gun companies that make the cash. A one year NRA membership is $30 or something. The gun companies play both sides of the fence. The dnc takes large donations from gun mfrs. Dont you think that’s a bit odd and counter intuitive? They pay the Democrats to holler “gun control” and they pay republicans to keep the laws as is. Gun companies lose money when a republican holds the whitehouse.</p>

<p>Lets talk about how much money the pharma companies spend on lobbying vs the NRA.</p>

<p>Then let&#39;s talk about all these mass shootings, suicides and what drugs these people were prescribed.</p>

<p>Then lets look at where FOX, CNN, MSNBC etc get all their advertising money from. I bet you will find it is drug companies.</p>

<p>You will very rarely hear a news story on MSM talking bad about how someone on a drug went out and killed people, but they will attack guns all day long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not advocating any sort of gun ban? And I never have, it&#39;s a total non-starter so a waste of time to discuss it. I made a jokey comment that tbh while doesn&#39;t stand up a serious picking apart the point remains. The Republicans are also for preventing gun violence, I would hope so, at least individual members, but tell me what are they doing? All I see are press releases about prayers no solutions, no affirmations that they will stop this nothing. Nothing gets done by either side ever. Why is the CDC blocked into studying  gun deaths? why would that ever be a good thing. I don&#39;t want you guys to not be able to own guns, I don&#39;t want u guys to have rights stripped from you but all I ever see on the other side of this debate is people saying it is literally ANYTHING else. It couldn&#39;t ever possibly be anything to whatsoever with guns or gun legislation. And that is a problem. How the fuck did this lad pass a background check for that gun. He was on psych meds and had continual contact with local law enforcement almost constantly since leaving school. I really don&#39;t understand how that isn&#39;t a problem for people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad you say you don&#39;t want to take everyone&#39;s guns.  But the legislation being called for are more bans on guns.  This does infringe on the second amendment and it&#39;s original and still crucial intent.  So pretending like this isn&#39;t the agenda of many on the left isn&#39;t helpful.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes legislation is being called for it doesn&#39;t mean that is the ONLY legislation being called for. Also don&#39;t call it the left&#39;s agenda, many people just want the constant stream of corpses to STOP.  Are you so blinded by your love of firearms you can&#39;t admit something has to change? Somewhere? </p>

<p>It has got to the point where me as a non-american is agreeing with people that you should be arming and training your teachers.... Here you and many others will probably say &quot;good, you agree with a sensible solution&quot; and want to leave it at that. And that is what saddens me. You don&#39;t leave it at that, that isn&#39;t the solution. It&#39;s a stop gap to prevent children being gunned down at a place of eduction. </p>

<p>This week on this sub I have seen statements such as this:</p>

<hr/>

<p>I can live with a few school shootings as long as they don&#39;t take away my right.</p>

<p>Having depression and being a self-harmer shouldn&#39;t stop me from owning a firearm.</p>

<p>as you said you&#39;re not even American so you don&#39;t even have the right to talk to us about it.</p>

<hr/>

<p>No one gives a shit about the kids that were just killed and when the kids themselves start to say stuff they are smeared relentlessly and with what I can only describe as complete enthusiasm. </p>

<p>There has to be some sort of compromise from your side. Yes, mental well-being needs to be seriously addressed, the law enforcement role at &quot;Missing&quot; this guy NEEDS to be addressed. You know what else needs to be addressed? that this lad legally bought that firearm while on several medications for mental health and having almost continual contact with law enforcement since leaving school. </p>

<p>No, notice how I mentioned the constitution.  I do see the necessity for the right to bear arms, and at the very least good rifles.  If you only knew you would understand.</p>

<p>Huh, a second ago you were excusing action based in fear. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say wanting to take action to prevent future occurrences of a type of tragedy that happens only with such frequency in the U.S. to be pretty logical. It would be illogical to think doing nothing and failing to address the issue would result in anything other than continuance of current trends. But, that would likely result in a pretty big loss of revenue for a highly profitable industry, so I see why they would be so anxious to quash any dissenting views. </p>

<p>So if we remove the second amendment you lose that “basic human right” don’t you? Not so basic at that point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice edit.</p>

<p>There are different types of rights. I have repeatedly clarified this but you seem unable to grasp basic linguistics. A constitutional right is a right. It is different from a basic human right. Also, you should really look up appeal to authority. If your principles were worth a damn you should be able to defend them without repeatedly pointing to someone or something else and claiming your beliefs are true because they/it said so. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Uh, what? Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution...came after the Constitution? The Constitution came after...itself?</p>

<p>Alright, here&#39;s a history lesson folks.</p>

<p>One of the reasons the Articles of the Confederation were discarded was because the Federal Government had no capacity to exert force, specifically to defend itself against aggressors both foreign and domestic. </p>

<p>The framers didn&#39;t want to have a standing army, for fear that it&#39;d be tyrannical, so they came up with the militia system. Under this system, militias were administrated, trained, and awarded ranks by their respective States. The Federal government could summon the militia and command them to crush insurrections. At first, the summoning was performed through an act of Congress, but this proved cumbersome, slow, and unreliable.</p>

<p>Several events, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Clair%27s_Defeat">St. Clair&#39;s defeat</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shays%27_Rebellion">the humiliating saga of Shay&#39;s Rebellion</a> prompted Congress to explicitly give the President unilateral authority to summon and command the militia, codified in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia_Acts_of_1792">The Militia Acts of 1792</a>.</p>

<p>George Washington himself used this new authority to summon and command the militia to crush <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion">the Whiskey Rebellion.</a></p>

<p>Later, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurrection_Act">Insurrection Act</a> would implicitly re-affirm Presidential authority to summon and command the militia  by specifying its exact requirements (namely, posse comitas).</p>

<p>The militia is commanded <em>by</em> the government, so no. </p>

<p>Learn a bit about Deism, which was treated as heresy at best and atheism at worst during the time, and was believed in by many of the founding fathers. This idea that they&#39;d want to protect Deism, which in its radical forms basically posited that God did nothing except set the universe in motion as a first cause, but not atheism, is just dumb.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But you clearly admit to the militia being the citizenry. End point, the citizenry shall not be disarmed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The militia being the citizenry doesn&#39;t do anything to refute my point. All it proves is that the Founding Fathers felt that protecting the federal government from insurrection was important enough to institute a universal draft.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They will eat away at it.  <em>Infringing</em> first upon who qualifies to buy a gun, and also what constitutes a &quot;legal&quot; gun for citizens to own.  Just watch.  It may take 20 years or even 50 years, but they will eat away at the Second Amendment because it is a threat to control of the population by a select few.  Who is this group that is seeking to control, and to remove possible future threats?  --who is seeking to remove guns from US citizens <em>now</em>?</p>

<p>You have guns to protect the state - &quot;Security of a free state&quot;.  It says nothing anywhere about protecting individuals against the state...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ideas are solid.  Technology has changed but people haven&#39;t and they are just as sneaky and dangerous as they were 200 years ago.  We need a piece of paper with rules the government can&#39;t easily stomp out.  Without it we would most likely have very few of these freedoms/rights left.  Constitutions are very important and to compensate for the times they can be ratified.  However it is very dangerous to just assume it to be old and outdated.  The government already finds loopholes around it the way it is.  Like by creating secret courts that issue warrants with little to stand on circumventing due process of law.  Or you have no reasonable expectation of privacy in public and therefor if you leave your house they say it is legal to search your or your car.  Or we aren&#39;t spying on Americans, just accidentally because they are within 6 degrees of separation from a terrorist.  Or the fact that they couldn&#39;t make marijuana illegal so they made it illegal to posses without a tax stamp that they don&#39;t issue.  The list goes on an on.  It&#39;s ignored and worked around already and we are too comfortable to do anything about it.</p>

Those 10 people write rules about the kinds of rights people should have and then for 200 years their descendants bicker about what the document meant.

Then there is no need to write a document and argue about how to interpret it. We would all know within ourselves what rights we are born with.

<p>That&#39;s the essence of anarchism but if you label it anarchism, suddenly it&#39;s a notion most people want to dismiss. I understand that we can&#39;t do it with the people we have now, but why can&#39;t it be taught over a few generations? TPTB are manipulating the behavior of our offspring to their own benefit.

Anarchism would work if it didn&#39;t always lead to rule by the powerful which then it isn&#39;t anarchism anymore.  There has to be a neutral entity to enforce laws that protect people from harm and bring justice for those that do.  People just can&#39;t be trusted to self regulate even though the same greed that would fuck us over in that situation is what also fucks us over in the current situation.

<p>That&#39;s just what I have observed especially if you have something to offer they will take advantage of you.  That is why I choose to live out in the sticks.  Seems the more people you cram into a small space the more selfish they get.  It&#39;s possible that it could be learned and taught but the current society in America, being a good person is not how you get ahead unfortunately.  The selfish thieves are typically rewarded for their behavior.  </p>

Their superiors tell them so and they respond in kind. So yeah I agree that regular soldiers, just like cops, are regular people who believe in rights. But when you get them into uniform, they no longer are able to judge for themselves and they simply follow orders to arrest or detain. If you understand psychology, you would understand that to make the soldier overcome their human instinct to protect their fellow citizen, you have to brainwash them into believing their usage of force is justified and necessary. You brainwash the soldiers by telling them lies about their target population so the soldier is more likely to use force on someone he believes is an enemy of the state.</p>

I made a jokey comment that tbh while doesn&#39;t stand up a serious picking apart the point remains. The Republicans are also for preventing gun violence, I would hope so, at least individual members, but tell me what are they doing? All I see are press releases about prayers no solutions, no affirmations that they will stop this nothing. Nothing gets done by either side ever. Why is the CDC blocked into studying  gun deaths? why would that ever be a good thing. I don&#39;t want you guys to not be able to own guns, I don&#39;t want u guys to have rights stripped from you but all I ever see on the other side of this debate is people saying it is literally ANYTHING else. It couldn&#39;t ever possibly be anything to whatsoever with guns or gun legislation. And that is a problem. How the fuck did this lad pass a background check for that gun. He was on psych meds and had continual contact with local law enforcement almost constantly since leaving school. I really don&#39;t understand how that isn&#39;t a problem for people.</p>
