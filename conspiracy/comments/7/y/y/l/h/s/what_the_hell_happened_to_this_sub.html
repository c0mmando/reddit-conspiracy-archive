       It's full of complete close minded fools as of late. Nothing is discussed openly and any one with the opinion even close to supporting a conspiracy theory (aka anti msm opinions) are down voted and have accounts take a diarrhea dump of their thoughts, suggestions, and opinions. What happened to friendly open discussion and debate? It's just a bunch of douchebags talking down to you and being over all passive aggressive assholes now. This is the conspiracy sub, why the fuck are we all arguing over who did what left said this right said that, Russia this, trump that  Hillary this, Bill that... Fucking give your head a shake people. This is a sub that should reject all politicians. The game is rigged, there is no white horse leader for America...current or in the future.. ..its over. The game is rigged and has been. I've been going to this sub for years. If you have too, then you see what I'm talking about. This sub really started to nose dive around the DNC leaks, Seth Rich, and most importantly.... The podesta emails in regards to 'pizzagate'  it saddens me as a critical thinker that this sub is at its lowest point in its history.  Just rantin'  feel free to down vote to oblivion or discuss using our brains.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit1*  just to note. I'm writing this edit after only 30 seconds of it being live. In that time, someone down voted this post and we all know damn well they didn't read this in that time. Now THERE'S a conspiracy :p
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit2** well this took off didn't it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit3***  I'll add that I'm sure we all know of politicians that want to serve us well and have our best interest in mind. But and I will add -  in my opinion -  the system itself is a failure. So no matter who runs, it won't matter. The game is rigged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit4**** last one for tonight as I'm south for vacation and I wrote this at the pool killing time waiting for drinks. The wife hates when I get on here rambling. Maybe she's actually Russian.
Thanks for the gold too. And apologies if this same topic is beat to death here every week. I'll apologize again since I'm Canadian. Night all!

       I really tried my best to clean it up a couple of years ago. The other mods decided I had gone rogue, and I resigned shortly afterwards. To be quite honest I barely ever come here anymore. The quality of this sub has fallen dramatically in the last couple of years and it's only getting worse.

       What happened is that a lot of people want this to be an echo chamber for their half assed "investigations" or "discussions" which usually just twine-balls of incorrect facts, hearsay, interpretation, etc - they want a place they can engage in fantasy play about their pet theories with people who aren't going to challenge them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Often times the rest of reddit/the net will ignore these little spaces but sometimes we notice noxious smells or fumes coming from them and we have to come in and see what's going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember when that guy went into a pizza place with a gun because he spent too much time reading BS on the internet? Yea, that's what got the sub shut down...it was turning into this insane schizo witch hunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course pedophiles exist, of course they talk to and help eachother, and of course some of them have power. The "pizzagate" thing overall though is just a bunch of misinterpretation, cherry picking, and seeing jesus's face in toast.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people come in and ask questions and press for evidence and point out that there are more possible explanations than the ones being put forward -better ones - then a lot of people complain and start throwing "shill" around.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is supposed to be an open discussion and debate you should be open to hearing alternate opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Case in point - Seth Rich. It's a fact that random murders/botched robberies happen. We also don't know all the details of what happened. There's no reason Seth Rich couldn't be a perfectly mundane murder, the fact that so many people act as if it HAS to be something sinister demonstrates that they aren't working based on evidence &amp; rationality but are engaging in motivated reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also the fact that Seth Rich couldn't have been the only leaker...and there's a ton of evidence that the DNC was hacked by hackers of russian origin or alignment. Pretty much everyone, including the russians when they're being honest, agrees that they engage in these sorts of campaigns.
      </p>
      <p>
       The seth rich leaking thing doesn't make sense, and if we're gonna go down that road you also have to take time to consider the possibility that seth rich's murder was part of a russian plot to cover their tracks - to create a fall guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's never made sense to think he was the leaker, the main evidence is julian assange sort of implying it (though not even that really, just letting people believe it) and it's been proven again and again that he has no problem lying or implying things are true if it suits him.

       I'll touch base on the pizzagate stuff - Wasn't the pizzagate sub shut down well before that story of the dude with a dun at a comet ping pong? There was overwhelming cirmustantial evidence to support pizzagate. Not that there were kids in the basement of the joint, but it seemed to scratch the surface of something that appeared to be much much bigger. Cirmustantial evidence is not hard 100% proof, no, but you have enough of it, it should Atleast warrent questioning and investigating, not immediately thrown to the curb as nonsense. Don't you think?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the Seth Rich stuff, you are not wrong. Assange implying or we taking facial movements as fact is not right. Also, it being a conspiracy sub, you're right, the idea of Russia involvement with SR opposed to the DNC shouldn't be thrown to the side either. No one really knows what happened to SR. But the timing of his murder and the leaks are odd. People also think that ol' trump started the Fake news push when it was actually the msm literally exactly after that weekend of the DNC Leaks and the Podesta emails. Trump calling cnn fake news during that conference started pushing 'fake news' talk everywhere. Timing is always important to note.  Does it make it fact? No. But does raise the question 'why then?'

       You're right that circumstantial evidence can warrant further investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it really "overwhelming circumstantial evidence" though?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just about the type and amount, it's about HOW it was collected. Circumstantial evidence has to be analyzed in a context of what we can and do know in order to be meaningful.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's important to conduct investigations in a certain way. You start by establishing certain facts, then you follow threads, develop ideas, test them, keep collecting info...etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       What a lot of pizzagaters do though is they just anomaly hunt. They just dig through a pile of info of dubious quality and collect everything they think is "weird". They usually don't bother seriously trying other theories besides the pet one they have. They also discard anything that doesn't fit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what you end up with at the end is a big dump of "evidence" pasted together in MS paint where it's dubious as to whether it's even true and there's no actual analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the "evidence" I've seen of pizzagate is easily just lack of imagination or ignorance on the "researchers" part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stuff like "oh they called children 'entertainment' in this email NOBODY would do that, PIZZAGATE PIZZAGATE"
      </p>
      <p>
       Except I've hear adults use the type of language in the emails tons of times. Most pizzagaters are young males so I guess it's hard for them to imagine, but a lot of people genuinely like being around kids in a totally innocent way. They find them entertaining and they enjoy the idea of nurturing the next generation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate will forever be tainted by the fact that there's so many people in it that will go "I found this one strange phrase in an email and even though I didn't really try I can't think of ANY explanation except pedos therefore it's pedos"
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why it's a bit funny to hear some people complain about the "debunkers"...if you actually care about uncovering "the truth" and "beating THEM" then you'd want to eliminate the bad actors and idiots from your own team.

       This sub has always been as 'anti establishment' as it gets. People who think of themselves as such are drawn here. Trump very much
       <em>
        portrayed
       </em>
       himself as anti establishment, and his supporters believe him. So they flock here, where they feel they belong, but it shifts the political makeup of the sub, and now you have a bunch of people who think the president and his people are fighting the good fight against all those other terrible people in government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aaand obviously that also means that anyone who wants to do some astroturfing sees that this place is A) full of Trump supporters, and B) full of anti-establishment people, many of whom flocked to Trump in 2016, and so should be ripe for the picking.

       R/conspiracy seems to be very conservative. You have to sort out the deep state from the Russians and if you are political there is no objectivity. If we all could agree that either Trump is an embarrassment or that he is awesome, we'd be more stable. As it is, until we can believe our lying eyes, we're going to fight.

       This is because your fellow humans have sold out having not developed any useful real world skills so they get paid to incite, discredit and gaslight you and everyone else in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recognized this a few years ago and I no longer (besides this) comment anymore. Nobody is interested in real truth here. My suggestion would be wherever the most hate, the most ridiculed topics are those ones typically where the most truth lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat earth for example, I have measured across 46 miles of open water and about 100 miles over land and it is measurably flat and level yet it will be ridiculed and downvoted. Everything in the Bible and the book of Enoch is true. The biggest conspiracy of all is the hiding of God. The devil’s greatest trick...
      </p>
      <p>
       Pure evil exists and has generationally for thousands of years. The serpent seed has only expanded over time and has deceived everyone about almost everything.
      </p>

       I highly suggest getting your information from the Bible as it is the only truth in a world full of lies. We have been overcome with Satan and his army.

       It really started to go to shit about 5 years ago. It's basically a useless sub as there are just better places for this kind of discussion. Reddit is an echo chamber for Marxists, and then the Donald is a place for civic nationalism. If you're doing more than shit posting on reddit as a whole, you're kinda goofy.

       Every week there is a gilded meta-post about how shitty this subreddit is. There was never a time before shills, trolls, and brigades. If you want to find real content with genuine discussion, sort under New or Controversial. Ignore vote scores cause they don't matter.

       I never understood how that works. Are shill companies approaching redditors and purchasing their accounts or is someone within reddit handing over inactive accounts to shill companies? There hasn't been evidence to support either theory, and I'm sure someone would come forward at some point.
      </p>

       How strange would it be to come back to reddit after a long break to find your account has been used for shilling, right?

       Sounds like you can get an account for $2. But a high karma one might fetch $100-$200.

      <p>
       If someone offered me $100 for this account I would probably take it.

       I also saw a few sketchy looking websites in my quick google search that say they pay for accounts.

       We can discuss theroys without having full knowledge.

       Just because we don't know everything isn't a reason to not ask questions or post ideas.

       I can spur on others to present the other facts they may have. Even if I am lacking.

       Some people just want to shit on the whole thing to discredit any discussion.
      </p>

       And yes we have to check out suspicious account history.  Doesn't mean everyone is a shill, but we do know it happens all the time so that why we must look.

       Considering this sub calls anyone a 'shill' who has a realistic outlook that isn't "deep state" enough or linked to pedophilia or globalism, I don't know if I can take your comment seriously. I've been called a shill a few times just for pointing out fallacies in borderline retarded theories on here. Listen, we a love being woke and being aware of some shady shit that goes on and not being corporate consumer sheep. We like discussion, that's why we all come here right? But the moment the discussion becomes a debate and not a circle jerk this sub collapses in on itself and suddenly any opposing viewpoint is just some FBI shill.

       Question everything, have an open mind, don't believe everything you're spoonfed by mainstream media. Loom into shit. We can all agree on this stuff, but can we lose the fucking tribalistic autism and value self awareness over paranoia?

       Do you recall how r/the_donald took over r/all during the election? They took over many subs. They were all over here, r/politics, hell I even remember seeing them in r/trees.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is r/the_donald and strictly anti-Hillary people refuse to come to terms that Donald Trump is arguably worse (and let me say this since so many of you love him, he's just as equally bad--is that fair?) than Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of showing that you really care about justice and fairness, as were the claims during Hillary's Benghazi/emails, etc, those same people are refusing to acknowledge all the shit Trump is caught up in.

       It's simply, conservatives got here first. That's it.

       That's the thing, I'm a very
       <strong>
        very
       </strong>
       anti-Hillary person. I'm also a very
       <strong>
        very
       </strong>
       anti-Trump. I find myself more at odds with the Hillary supporters though because for all the talk about how bad Trump supporters are, I see an incredible number of Hillary supporters acting worse. I see them far more than I see Trump supporters. That wouldn't even be a big deal if it weren't accompanied by them talking non-stop about Trump circle jerks and how Reddit hates minorities and women. Reddit is by and large a very liberal place. As a centerist who leans slightly more left than right, it would even work for me. But the constant act as if they are under attack for seeing an opinion that differs is infuriating. Then you glance at the votes, and they are upvoted while dissenting opinions are downvoted into oblivion. There is basically a demand for confirmation bias, and an almost total lack of self awareness politically, and while neither side is immune or remotely free of it, the left here on Reddit seems to really be championing that cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hope would be that we could understand that political affiliations ultimately don't matter in a sub like this. People should understand that neither their nor the opposition's party is good or trustworthy, but instead we get a constant cycle of both attacking the other side while defending something that is ultimately indefensible. It almost seems that we are at a saturation point with partisanship.

       That could be true, but the reality is that both sides need to be called out. Both lack the self awareness to see what they are becoming and it isn't good. It's at the point of hate just for the sake of hate on both sides, but I guess I don't know how to express that in a way that people will understand.

       <em>

       good people on the other side shows just how completely mentally fucked the partisan divide is.

       So you know what sucks? Losing rights or protections under the law because the other side doesn't agree with them. But with both parties absolutely ready and willing to take away piece by piece or wholesale everything people enjoy, no party is the party of the good guys.

       To be fair it is not a made up term and is a very effective forum sliding tactic. Concern trolling is another way of undermining confidence in a topic by showing "concern" or expressing doubt in an insincere way to undermine it. When really taking the opportunity to bash te topic in a passive aggressive manner. Not saying thats whats going on here but it isn't just made up. The term has been around for yrears.

       There are a shitload of things on this sub I disagree with.  I'm not into aliens for example.  But I just don't go into those threads.  Problem solved.  Why the fuck people go into threads and comment on things they don't know about and don't care about and don't like is utterly beyond me.  That's shill behavior.  Or just stupid and inconsiderate.

       This is of course good advice, but some people have taken this to the point of "always believe the opposite of whatever the mainstream media says."  I imagine that before Trump, the people on this sub would be all over a possible conspiracy involving the president colluding with Russia.  That is A grade conspiracy fodder.  But now that such a thing is suggested by the mainstream media, the "conspiracy" thing to do in some people's minds it to deny it is even possible.  And in addition to these people you have those who have bought into the Trump personality cult for whom "truth" merely connotes "that which benefits the leader."  Both of these groups of people are not debating with an honest interest in finding truth (I use the word "truth" here to mean that which corresponds with reality).

       Yes, I've noticed this too! It is amazing that they see the world through such a "simple", black/white lens. whether they legitimately forget or are just in denial, I'm unsure but I find it fascinating that they seem completely unable to comprehend any sort of nuance or complexity to any and all situations; especially their failure to understand that TPTB "know" and use these beliefs/this behaviour to their benefit, too. propaganda is not as blatant or straight-forward as it once was anymore. ultimately, in their "efforts" to be "woke" and make sense of current events, etc. they're being manipulated just the same but goodluck trying to tell them that, lol

       I don't think many conspiracy theorists, atleast here in this thread are claiming it's not possible for any two politicians to have colluded or conspired. The impression I get and something I feel is being downplayed is that most of us know politics is a game and ultimately a public facade and drama that is ultimately irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       World leaders manufacture disputes and cooperation, it's all about instilling the idea they are important and working for us. They might aswell all be video game characters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly believe whether Trump, Hilary, Obama or Bush was president or not, we would still see the same wars, same debts and same BS. They have the same script and just swap out the characters.

       If you're proclaiming your own outlook realistic in a conspiracy sub, you have no interest in good faith discussion. Being a skeptic means being a skeptic about everything, even if it doesn't seem realistic on the surface.

       However most long time conspiracy buffs  would agree that an argument with a casual user is a waste of time. Generally speaking you have to develop a historical perspective to grasp the grand architecture of conspiracy beliefs. If you’re not willing to at least consider that possibility, then it’s a waste of time to debate the minutia that isn’t likely to impact your worldview.

       I think we lost some unspoken rules. I'm in a similar position to the commenter your replying to; not a regular but sometimes it's the only place discussing an article. And it's funny to watch people spin. BUT I've been around long enough to know what /all does to a smaller sub. I don't vote because it's not my sub to decide what gets discussed, and I'll refrain from commenting unless I think I've got something to add, I try not to argue.

       Right it's beyond just civility though. Small subs just can't take a lot of outside influence, intentional or otherwise, without losing their character. Presumably if you come here, it's for the subs content. If you actively vote/submit then you're not getting this subs content you're just looking in the mirror. I suspect most people didn't come here for the content they came to argue so here we are

       We should start looking into ways to prevent this sub from going off track too often. Shills not only try to reinforce mainstream narratives, they probably also post dumb theories to get us distracted and going down the wrong path. The more bullshit they post, the more dilute the sub becomes and the more difficult it is to obtain useful information.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there should be a periodic reminder that
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/70qvx7/updated_list_of_proven_conspiracies_and_hidden/">
        there have been a great deal of proven conspiracies
       </a>
       , some of them being international in scope, and involving large groups of people who got away with it for many years. This completely wipes out several of their main narratives, including the claim that the government must be too incompetent to pull off large conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Periodically focusing on conspiracy facts, rather than theories, especially when many of the proven ones are very similar to current unproven theories, would do a lot of good here.

       Conspiracies have been made mainstream in the last 6-8 years. I remember watching Zeitgeist back in 2007 and thinking “wow, this is nuts”. No one (to my knowledge) before that connected world banks and religion to a mass conspiracy to rule over the masses. This has been made mainstream for a lot of reasons. Mostly the internet and it’s free-range of information; imo

       Why do people have to fall into one of the two parties? I mean, for fuck's sake, this is a conspiracy subreddit. I kinda would rather see people not blindly follow either side on here. There are political subreddits for that. And I encourage you to visit them and compartmentalize yourself on those, if you feel so inclined. But when on a conspiracy subreddit it seems best to try to keep an open mind. If the post doesn't align with your worldview, then you just move to the next post. Ultimately upvotes and discussion should win. I kinda wish downvotes were disabled on this subreddit.

       I didn't say follow either of the two corrupted parties. But don't be under the illusion that every singe politician is a bad guy; that's ridiculous. There exists tons of nuance. They're human beings. Some of them are absolute heroes. I vote Green Party sometimes, but it's not looking good for third parties in the U.S. If we want to actually make change- for instance, I do drug legalization work- we have to deal with the political reality.

       I always expected this subreddit to not be partisan because I wouldn't expect it to
       <strong>
        blindly trust anyone!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate Trump. I don't like Hillary. I wanted Bernie. There are conspiracies around all three of them, and I want them all discussed here, because this should have been
       <strong>
        the best place
       </strong>
       to talk about it without it being a politics war. Without people telling you to "shut up, because
       <strong>
        proof
       </strong>
       " yet, here we are, "shills" no matter what we say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I interested in some conspiracies more than others because of my political biases? Yes. Absolutely. But I won't shit on other people for theirs on a conspiracy subreddit? No!
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't downvote a hillary conspiracy on here, or a Bernie one on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, if Bernie is entangled in some weird shit
       <strong>
        I would like a heads up.
       </strong>
       So please, conspire freely about any and everyone. But... we can't do that here.

       There are plenty of solutions but they mostly involve the admins enpowering the users and not the mods and not the shills.  For example, when you create a post you should be able to turn off downvotes in your thread when you start it, you should be able to have an invite only discussion, you should be able to view a users upvote and downvote totals in the sub you are in for the last 30 days.   That is just what I can up with in less than a few hours.  The admins know these solutions an more, but all changes have been pro shill changes.

       Regardless of what your personal relative favorabilities are towards either of the two, I feel pretty confident saying neither has been effectively banned from reddit. They, and every form of social media simply don't have the capacity to effectively block out any determined "troll army" with sufficient resources, as can be seen across the internet and globe.

       The front page invalidates your point immediately. Obviously only one troll army is having the door opened for them.

       I won't reject the notion of Russian trolls but it has absolutely been Hillary's camp that has been most influential on Reddit. I'll never forget the day after Sanders lost the primary the complete 180 this entire website made and never looked back. It's one big propoganda network and has been for more than a year now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The extent to which Russia has influenced Reddit's atmosphere I cannot know, and Hillary's camp's (for lack of a better identifier) motivations I can only guess at, but it seems clear to me that reddit has not offered an organic user experience on many of the controversial subs for quite a while.

       I feel the same.

      <p>
       I get a feeling of anxiety if I use Reddit too much, just due to the deluge of propaganda that floods the website. I may not click on the article, but after reading enough titles one can put together the narratives, both real and fake. IMO, Reddit is as compromised as Twitter.

       I mean....as someone who went from supporting Sanders to Clinton I can pretty easily explain it.
       <br/>
       It was Sanders v Clinton.  I purposely avoided ever talking negatively about her in case she won but others didn't--we wanted Sanders to win so talking negatively about the competition is going to happen.
       <br/>
       Then Sanders lost.  So she was the democratic nominee which made it Clinton v Trump.  Me and many others may have preferred Sanders...but we greatly preferred Clinton to Trump.  So, yeah, people changed over.  But it's not nearly as stark as you're saying.
       <br/>
       The Sanders sub was still going on even well after all hope was lost.  There were jokes around reddit about 'so you're saying there's a chance' about people still holding out hope for him to miraculously (impossibly) get the nom.
       <br/>
       And, then, some people still held on to the Clinton hate and continued--some went third party or even over to Trump.
       <br/>
       So, as someone who as pretty deep into that stuff...it wasn't as big a 180 as you make it out to be but, even the change that did happen, is completely understandable.
      </p>
      <p>
       To a lot of these people it went Sanders &gt;&gt; Clinton &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Trump
       <br/>
       So the '180' makes perfect sense.

       I'm not just talking about the shift from Sanders support to Clinton support. The day after the primaries ended this entire website was one big newstation for Clinton 2016 coverage. The entire front page was completely full of pro-Clinton or anti-Trump garbage every single day for the rest of the year until Nov 20. It was a complete shift for the website.

       One of the cornerstones of the conspiracy community is a lack of trust in the mainstream media. It has always been that way, decades before this election or Trump.

      <p>
       So I would ask you to answer your own question. Since it is blatantly obvious how "The Russians" mainstream media "conspiracy" has been swallowed wholesale by everyone with the political leaning to allow it.

       If he wasn't one before he is one now. I'm not pro or anti Trump. The reason is because the politicians are just there to give you an illusion of choice. I truly feel voting is just to make us feel like we have a say. This is my opinion though.

       You think the people who truly run the world would allow someone outside of their control to be the president of the most powerful country on the planet? That’s a laugh. Trump is in the position he is in because he is working with them. Why do you think he’s so pro-Israel? Open your mind.

       When this sub first started a "shill" was anyone pushing against a conspiracy being discussed. They usually had relatively new accounts, or older accounts with no history of participating on r/conspiracy. These older accounts were most likely purchased so as to give the appearance of legitimacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Post-election, a "shill" is anyone that disagrees with a perceived political opinion expressed by the OP.

       There's no determination. It's an absurd logical fallacy people use when they're too lazy to actually come up with evidence or arguments to refute another person's point.

       Just judging by the content of their post? You cannot. Full stop. In this sub, it's mostly a stupid epithet that gets thrown around when people get angry at opposing opinions.

      <p>
       There are almost certainly
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       shills here; probably ones on both sides of the political spectrum, and possibly even ones designed to look stupid and discredit conspiracy theorists altogether. But if you could identify them individually, it would mean they weren't doing their job right.

       Well I thought that was a pretty obvious joke, or maybe it was obvious, and it was just a bad joke .... All I mean was that sometimes it feels like you have "both sides" accusing each other of being shills more as an insult to their motivations more than a genuine accusation.

       Shill is just a way for people to disregard and smeer someone's opinion that they don't like. I would bet that the vast majority of people who call people shill or imply that they're shills don't
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       believe that they people they're talking to are getting paid by David Brock or whoever. Similar to when I was in middle school and people called those they didn't like "fags." But almost none of those people thought that they people they were insulting were gay, they just knew it was a way to shut the other person down.

       I recommend reading the paper by Cass R Sunstein (friend and adviser to Obama) and Adrian Vermeule  "Conspiracy Theories",  to see some of the tactics that appear to be used by potential shills on conspiracy "social networks", and the reasons why they think they're effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can download the full paper here:

       "Abstract
Many millions of people hold conspiracy theories; they believe that powerful people have worked together in order to withhold the truth about some important practice or some terrible event. A recent example is the belief, widespread in some parts of the world, that the attacks of 9/11 were carried out not by Al Qaeda, but by Israel or the United States. Those who subscribe to conspiracy theories may create serious risks, including risks of violence, and the existence of such theories raises significant challenges for policy and law. The first challenge is to understand the mechanisms by which conspiracy theories prosper; the second challenge is to understand how such theories might be undermined. Such theories typically spread as a result of identifiable cognitive blunders, operating in conjunction with informational and reputational influences. A distinctive feature of conspiracy theories is their self-sealing quality. Conspiracy theorists are not likely to be persuaded by an attempt to dispel their theories; they may even characterize that very attempt as further proof of the conspiracy. Because those who hold conspiracy theories typically suffer from a crippled epistemology, in accordance with which it is rational to hold such theories, the best response consists in cognitive infiltration of extremist groups. Various policy dilemmas, such as the question whether it is better for government to rebut conspiracy theories or to ignore them, are explored in this light."
      </p>
      <p>
       Excerpts of note:
"...the best response consists in cognitive infiltration... ", "Keywords: conspiracy theories, social networks, informational cascades, group polarization" "We have suggested, however, that government can minimize this effect by rebutting more
rather than fewer theories, by enlisting independent groups to supply rebuttals, and by cognitive infiltration designed to break up the crippled epistemology of conspiracy minded groups and informationally isolated social networks".

       I have been called a shill because I was interested in the russian conspiracy and tried interacting with some of the trump cult people with it. It has definitely left me feeling I am not welcome with my opinions in this sub because there are some older users who feel threatened by new information. I have also noted some of the users who will comment on every russia post and try to derail it. This includes some of the mods of this sub.

       Of course it's possible. But it's also hard to ignore when those opinions align 100% with propaganda talking points of organisms such as ShareBlue and the like, which are known to target Reddit and Facebook.
       <br/>
       I mean, the amount of narrative control by that organism should be the number one conspiracy, because how can anyone trust any opinion aligning with those talking points, if we don't know the extent of the control they have?

       As with any conspiracy or conspiracy community, you have to dig to find real discussion. We've all sorted through a ton of shit to even consider ourselves a part of this community. I personally don't see why we shouldn't have to dig through shit for the foreseeable future. It is the name of the game.

       Look, after re-reading my reply I can see how it
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       come across as a passive-aggresive response. I hope this reply clarifies my point:
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying your submission is misplaced, because there sure is a ton of undiscussable topics for many users. I think, like you, that there are many posts or threads where honest discussion is impossible so many users don't even attempt it. I can certainly tell  when my replies are just wasted effort when engaging with some people so I won't make that reply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Common trust is what we must share in order to have good discussions, and it is missing on a grand scale here. It is not gone completely, but it is getting more difficult to find.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I do engage in discussion, or debate, I try to do it with common decency and a request for reciprocity. It's not always that way, but the best conspiracy minded discussions will follow this guideline. As always, this is just my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one wins an argument or changes another's mind with indecency, so I figure what's the point in engaging with those tactics?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seek out those that operate with an open-mind and common decency, ignore the rest when you can. This isn't a subreddit for the faint of heart or sensitive minded. There IS a lot of shit to sift, but I've always felt good when I find the hidden gems.

       I suspect it's rather more sophisticated than that.  You have a botnet that monitors /new and compares it to a list.  If it's not on the list they want today, it's automatically given a certain number of downvotes.  If it contains certain keywords, it's downvoted harder.  If it's on their list of topics they want to work on, it is upvoted and then given a bunch of comments.  The shill accounts all upvote each other.  They have a certain narrative to present.  Anything that goes against it is both manually downvoted, and presented to a botnet to mass-downvote.  A few uneducated people will write actual comments that fit with the narrative, and they are mass-upvoted, so this encourages them to do that more because of the endorphin release.  They are training people to fit the mass narrative and only comment things that the botnet wants to hear.

       It's happens in mob rule, karma-whoring, dying "social media" like reddit. Sure it's popular, but it's not "the same" -- the hive mind and it's voracious appetite for conformity stalks reddit like the men in black. Something new will rise on the blockchain. I'm not sure the current iterations of blockchain will fair, but something will stick. And reddit, facebook, twitter will all become the "AOL" of the internet.

       It happened around the time r/uncensorednews had a few xposts from here get popular over there. I suppose I can't say for certain that it was because of them, however the mentalities seemed to line up considering their history of strong antisemitism and racism.

       It's because there's an ongoing political conspiracy unfolding daily. It may seep through an entire political party, and that party is transparently deploying conspiracy theories to attempt to discredit the investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're witnessing an ongoing conspiracy. In a way, you're
       <strong>
        in
       </strong>
       the conspiracy. How people on this board aren't rock hard 24/7 over it is totally beyond me. Maybe people somehow prefer the conspiracy theories that have zero evidence to support them?

       All while actively ignoring the fact that the administration they support is currently involved in the biggest conspiracy against the United States in modern times. The fucking campaign manager has literally been indicted for conspiracy against the United States!! LOL

       Not really. Both of them are basically partisan versions of r/conspiracy right now repping their theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       The major difference is that r/politics wants to appear very intelligent, because this need to be seen as smart is a huge draw for unintelligent people.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, r/the_donald uses humor and memes to draw in people. Because t_d doesn't claim to speak for all of politics but only one side it is much more effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end J don't frequent either of them because they're both blatant propaganda, BUT only one of them is at least doing propaganda correctly in 2018 and that is the_donald because they are at least entertaining.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like seriously r/politics is still talking about Russia? Talk about cringeworthy. Even my super liberal friends don't say shit about Russia anymore.

       Lol indictments handed down. Seriously do you know what our CIA does? Have you read Chomsky? Do you even have a cursory understanding of global politics and America's role in regime change and meddling in elections.

       Russia lol'd at those indictments too.

       r/politics is suppose to be about politics in general. r/the_donald like the poster above said, is a fan page. If anything the blatant bias in r/politics is what you should be aghast about.

       I don't know. I don't know what the original idea was, but I don't think they intended for this shit to happen. I don't necessarily believe bots and shills were an actual things when Reddit was invented. Although I could be wrong about that and if I am so be it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get certain subs are nothing more than fanboy pages and I'm okay with that. I know what I'm getting when I click the sub.  I just feel like something like r/politics should be a little more balanced. I don't know how you do that. I don't think it's only shills and bots. I do think the bulk of users on Reddit in general are younger and probably lean more left. So I can wrap my head around that a little bit. I just think it's a disturbing trend where only one side's views are promoted and the other sides points are down voted and hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I'm a grown ass woman, internet points aren't something I care about, but I don't think I've ever had the guts to object to something being said over there. I believe it would be thoroughly exhausting and somewhat disheartening to have to defend my opinions like I would be forced to do if I were to comment. I'm not saying I shouldn't have to defend my stance. I think that shit is important. Just that I've seen the barrage that takes place and even in a sub like this, where most cats are fairly open minded, it's been difficult when I've said something that may trigger some with a particular leaning. I just hate it that we can't have like legit discussions about stuff these days. And again, I don't believe everyone is a shill. I think there some who are just incredibly loyal to their party. I think there are a few who are just ignorant of facts. And I believe that there are plenty who are just as aware as I am regarding a topic and we really do just come to two different takes. Those are the cats I long to talk to. Unfortunately it's becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between who is who and what their motives are. There are in fact people spreading disinfo in this very sub. Ugh. Maybe you won't get what I'm saying. If you know of a site we're legit political discussions can take place without one side railing on someone with a dissenting opinion let me know. I'd love to be able to discuss shit in a place that wasn't an echo chamber.

       I get what your saying, and agree. You'll be hard pressed to find a place online. Best bet would be to seek out discussions with individuals, not large groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is kind of depressing seeing what online discussions have devolved into, and trying to seek out what's real and what's "shill/bots" pretty much makes everyone cynical as fuck. I guess welcome to the new internet? Everything is real or everything is fake, it all just depends on what sub your on.

       I appreciate your words and I have been fortunate enough to have run into a couple of cats on here that had a different take than I and we've been able to have legit discussions. So I think your absolutely right about seeking discussions with individuals rather than the community at large. Welcome to the new internet indeed! Haha. But yeah, I guess we just gotta weed through the muck. I do wish everyone was aware of these tactics, but I am and I guess it's somewhat my responsibility to educate those around me that not everything we see on the internet is how it appears. Again, I realize not everyone is a shill or are trying to shut down conversation, your a perfect example of that. Thanks!

       As an Australian, it is hard to comprehend how a patriotic American can possibly ignore the fact that there are now indictments against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian groups - all linked to the Kremlin - for interfering in your elections.

       If we are to find this "meddling" so offensive shouldn't we at least know that that is?  So far it's been tweets, memes and ads on Facebook.  Are you telling me I should be irate about hashtags or retweets on twitter?  I personally don't see it as significant, definitely not significant for all the manufactured outrage I see every day.  There are people who do horrible horrible things regularly in the world that aren't discussed yet if I'm not calling for action against Russia for some stupid meaningless shit on social media I'm a Russian stooge.  I mean give me a break.  The US has most likely and probably still is "meddling" in your Australian elections.

       That tells more of a problem with America than anything.  If people are being persuaded by stupid shit on social media I don't really blame that on the Russians.  Also if they are that easily swayed by memes on facebook think of how easy it would be to totally manipulate someone with the 24/7 propaganda that airs on television. Hell you can even pick your flavor depending on how you want stories to be interpreted for you.

       Actually that is not a fact nor has it been quantified in any way shape or form.  That is a conclusion you arrived at, which is fine.  Just don't force your conclusions on me as if they are fact in any way because they aren't. So don't tell me what you think I should be concerned about based on "facts" that are just ideas in your head.  That would be silly of me.

       Don't apologize to me. You aren't doing anyone but yourself a disservice.  I gather information from all sources, consider the facts, and form my own conclusions so unfortunately I don't have a favorite source to share with you.  I honestly just first saw this video shortly before engaging in discussion with you and it just so happens to be a great summary of the point I was making.

       bothered? no, he's entertained! He enjoys being pandered and pampered too by foreign powers who are campaigning on sowing the seeds of kek flame wars.
      </p>

       But the only reason it's probably funny to him is because he has been targeted as a useful-trend following-social media pawn. He gets to giggle and play grab ass with his Meme team.

       He's not threatened or concerned about outside Russian influence because they are not a threat to

       "meddling" was your word. I used the word "interfering", but should have said "influencing". If you don't have a problem with Russia interfering with or influencing your elections, I suggest you re-examine your priorities, because it is the opposite of meaningless.

       Apparently they have found evidence that Russia was in the voting systems in a few states. I don't know if they manipulate the vote count at this point. Nothing like that has been suggested, but maybe they didn't need to when it came election night.

       TD fucking set off bots and has been brigading here since late 2015.  Anyone to the left of Atwater was put on bot lists and would go to -30 within ten minutes.  The would come to gish gallops and flooding by comment bots.  Then you get the nast PMs.  So finally I left.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the last few months it seems the bots got turned off in a lot places.  Especially here.

       I never really understood this argument.  It's explicitly a pro-Trump sub.  They tell you right in the rules you will be banned if you say otherwise.  I don't post there but at least they are straightforward about it.  Now
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       , which is supposed to be for relatively neutral discussion of politics in general is often compared to T_D as the polar opposite when they shouldn't even be in the same category. All that sees the light of day there is Anti-Trump pieces, many without substance.  They don't outright ban you but they have the votes so strongly manipulated you can't effectively participate if your views don't align with the prescribed narrative.  Reddit's 10 minute penalty echo chamber rule is very discouraging.

       Another thing while we're on it. Did you notice the 'fake news' narrative popped up literally that weekend after the Podesta leaks/SR death? I always thought 'fake news' was hilarious. People act like it's new but misinformation and fake news has always been around. Tabloids at the grocery check out can confirm.

       Yup! I remember seeing a google trend for the term "fake news," and it actually started right after the Podesta emails were being released, when people were talking about Spirit Cooking, and I'm not sure if we had stumbled on Pizzagate yet. Many people think Trump was the first to start using it, but he only co-opted it.

       Google started the "fake news" campaign. They funded the non-profit site First Draft that first used the term in it's modern context. Eric Schmidt was the head of Alphabet Company at the time, the parent company of Google. Schmidt devoted himself to the Clinton campaign.

       Or, you know, conspiratards shot up a pizza place and everyone else realized that their games were a real physical threat to others and important enough to address. Maybe that explains why people are bothering to engage with these conspiracy theories.

       It's true man. All the front page of this sub is anti-obama and hillary shit and anything against the GOP, Trump, russia investigation all gets downvoted. anything that goes against thier views gets downvoted. I'm not a liberal, and I stand firmly on Hillary fucken kills people, but if i say anything bad about trump, BAM downvotes. Go back to T_D if you want to be a close minded idiot.

       Hmm. I wonder how your comment and the guy above you is upvoted if this sub is "basically T_D." I see this time and again, over and over. Claims like this are immediately debunked by the number of upvotes, and the users don't seem to understand the contradiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I might be literally the only liberal in this entire sub who admits that this sub is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a Trump cirlcejerk. In most threads, the people getting upvoted in the comments are the ones speaking out against trump. The people getting upvoted are the ones saying "This sub is so controlled by Trump supporters." Then how do those comments get upvoted? They usually respond by claiming it's because the thread made it to
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , but we see anti Trump comments at the top of threads that aren't even the top post in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we can talk about anti-Trump submissions. These do really well in this sub, which I will prove below. Guess what the excuse is? people claim the submissions were upvoted so high because they were on
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       . Oh really? How did the post make it to
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       in the first place if this sub is "controlled by Trump supporters?"
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot more than this, but this is what I could dig up from a quick search. Notice you never see anyone claim "this sub is a T_D circlejerk" in any of the anti-Trump threads. They just pretend these threads don't exist and continue with the anti-
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       propaganda, which is usually heavily upvoted in here for some reason. A lot of people in here hate this sub.

       If you check the comments of supposedly "pro-Trump" posts, anti-Trump comments reign supreme. There's nothing really wrong with that, but the people claiming this sub is one giant pro-Trump conspiracy are deluding themselves. Some people try to claim all of this is explained because this or that post hit
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , but that's complete bullshit. Posts that don't hit
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       are also very anti-Trump in the comments. Anti-Trump posts also couldn't hit
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       in the first place if they weren't heavily upvoted in this sub before they reached

       , I'll show you a thread that is below a 1000 with anti-Trump comments. In fact, many of the posts above never made it to
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , but to be conservative, I'll keep the threshold under a 1000 to guarantee that

       regulars are the ones making and upvoting these comments.

       If you check the comments of supposedly "pro-Trump" posts, anti-Trump comments reign supreme. There's nothing really wrong with that, but the people claiming this sub is one giant pro-Trump conspiracy are deluding themselves. Some people try to claim all of this is explained because this or that post hit
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , but that's complete bullshit. Posts that don't hit
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       are also very anti-Trump in the comments. Anti-Trump posts also couldn't hit
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       in the first place if they weren't heavily upvoted in this sub before they reached

       To the people who claim anti-Trump comments can be explained because some threads in this sub make it to
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , I'll show you a thread that is below a 1000 with anti-Trump comments. In fact, many of the posts above never made it to
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , but to be conservative, I'll keep the threshold under a 1000 to guarantee that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       regulars are the ones making and upvoting these comments.

       I'm starting to find it obvious that the whole "calm before the storm" conspiracy theory is true. Patriots have secretly planned to avenge the murder of JFK by exposing and dismantling the cabal which ordered his assassination. This international criminal organization is the architect for what we now call the Deep State. The treasonous criminals involved know that they could legitimately face military tribunals and execution, and their propaganda efforts are becoming increasingly desperate in response.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have hundreds of people here daily talking about how Russian collusion would be the biggest conspiracy EVER, which is laughable to anyone who knows anything about the history of CIA meddling in foreign elections, and yet these people are often upvoted to the stratosphere. Meanwhile, the counter-coup conspiracy theory is downvoted to oblivion and/or laughed at even though it ties into the core conspiracy theory that has been discussed here since the subreddit began.

       It's kind of hard to "leave your politics out of it" when WikiLeaks demonstrated the Democrat Party rigged their primary process, and then the law enforcement apparatus of a Democrat president's administration was improperly used to spy on a Democrat's opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry; can't "leave my politics out of" that.

       Perhaps your ire should be directed at the ones who don't care about that rather fucking large conspiracy, or who throw up a bunch of bullshit to try to obfuscate it.

       I agree with you on this, but if I started talking shit about trump straight up taking bribe money out in the open, would you down vote me to shit because it disagrees with your interests? It's okay to point out government lies and shady shit, it's not okay to purposely talk shit to someone who disagrees with your personal shit, not here anyways IMO. If you wanna go start down vote wars, go talk shit in r/politics. Easiest place to offend a liberal haha.

       Absolutely! I'm tired of the division between people. I miss the days when we trusted no one and had our own unique ideas and beliefs.. I miss the days when we investigated topics and came to our own conclusions. Nowadays i think a lot of people are blindly following one 'side' or the other and it's terrifying.

       Since we're basically just using this post to complain, as a long time lurker of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , I'm upset that no one here sees to seriously consider Trump/Russia as a conspiracy worthy of discussion. Like, if true, this would be one of the biggest conspiracies to have ever existed! How is that not absolute conspiracy nerd cat nip for anyone else!?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll fully admit my passion for this sub ebbs and flows, I'll be active for days in a row and then completely forget it exists for months. Back when the investigation started, I popped in here hoping to see some lively discussion and back and forth and there was fucking
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       . It took me awhile before I found some specific subs for the Russia investigation, but frankly those are boring as fuck because there's very little dissent. I want to hear from both sides! Even if it makes me angry! That's why I still visit The Drudge Report almost every day, despite my own personal political affiliations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why can't we live up to what many of us claim to want; to have semi-serious discussions about popular theories? Why aren't there like, weekly mega-threads on the top pop-conspiracies of the moment, with actual moderation to keep things on topic?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have a pizzagate thread where I can read people's crazy 4chan posts and be devil's advocate of how a sentence in an email might really just be talking about getting some pizza without us calling each other shills. Have a Russiagate thread where you can point out the reasons I should be skeptical of the sourcing of a new "bombshell" report.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, we settle for bot spamming the latest left/right flame up while mods act like dicks and throw any thread that isn't going the way they want into "contest mode" to stifle discussion. I wish there was some way to do a "consitutional convention" style re-boot of a sub. This place could be so much better if we started actually enforcing expectations on each other and cut out all of the hyper-partisan shit (shit of which I am guilty of myself).

       It's almost hard to discuss because most of the major points aren't really being contended. Does anybody think Russia
       <em>
        didn't

       I mean, why wouldn't they? It's hard to believe that Russia was like, "Hmmmmm I bet we could -- for a pittance -- influence the U.S. election in favor of a candidate that promises to be friendly to Russia
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       will sow the most internal discord in the U.S.... but let's
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       do that."

       I think the MSM approach of painting everything Trump does as EXPLOSIVE BOMBSHELLS that are going to destroy him has helped create the split. It’s a boy who cried wolf kind of situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here in Australia since your goddamn elections there is at least one story a day about the latest thing trump has done - I don’t give a shit about his tweets but the media makes a huge deal out of it every time. There was a story on a news website here about the truth behind his hair that was on their front page for two fucking days, so it’s pretty easy to accept that the media is biased against him. Then when something comes out like Russian collusion, I’m automatically thinking oh another one of their stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       This also creates a kind of situation where if you push the Russian thing then you’re on the side of the MSM, but if you deny it then your a tool of the government. It’s a no win for everyone
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: what I mean about the media here is that if it’s that bad here, I can’t even imagine what it’d be like over there

       Because there is no evidence of Trump/Russia collusion and the entire theory doesn't even make sense. Meanwhile there is a ton of evidence of Hillary and DNC doing exactly what Trump is being accused of and the media ignores it. In other words the people pushing the Trump/Russia nonsense have no credibility.

       This is the kind of shit I'm talking about. You didn't make any attempt to actually discredit anything, your entire post essentially boils down to "fake news"/"but hillary"/"people are saying".
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone who has been paying rapt attention to this thing as it has played out, I disagree with your basic assertions, but we have nowhere to hash out those differences aside from illusory posts that will effectively vanish into the ether within a day. What's the point in going in to details in that kind of environment?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I asked you, I'd hope you have more information to expand on your reasons for your beliefs, as I do my own. But, neither of us is going to make the effort to do that because we're effectively starting from zero with each interaction. That's way too much effort just to have a meaningful discussion with a single person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Group those discussions up in a rolling megathread, and we at least have a chance at those discussions. You'd start to recognize other people in the thread and have a basis of understanding to interact with each other and talk to one another.

       you're responding to a guy who frequents T_D and recently made the following comment. His post history is funny, he was barely politically active until he hopped on the Trump Train. Funny that people still think there was no influence from Russia when you can literally see the moment people started getting all up in arms about it. Like really, you would have chose Donald Trump as your president? Donald Trump beat every other republican to win the primary because he's a better candidate?

        There was no safe way he could return to Russia to do the actual digging; the vengeful F.S.B. would be watching him closely. But no doubt he had a working relationship with knowledgeable contacts in London and elsewhere in the West, from angry émigrés to wheeling-and-dealing oligarchs always eager to curry favor with a man with ties to the Secret Service, to political dissidents with well-honed axes to grind. And, perhaps most promising of all, he had access to the networks of well-placed Joes—to use the jargon of his former profession—he’d directed from his desk at London Station, assets who had their eyes and ears on the ground in Russia.

       Maybe you're totally unfamiliar with who Steele is.

      <p>
       The people he knew wanted to curry favor with the West. They were dissidents, opportunists, etc.

       Trump is being accused (and I believe there's documented evidence of this) of having direct ties to businessmen and oligarchs in Putin's inner circle.

       One talked to people that wanted to dish dirt on Putin to the West, the other is suspected of being in bed with Putin.

       Well your beliefs are not based in reality. This whole Russia-Trump thing didn't come to light until after the election was over. It was dreamed up by the DNS. Muller already indited 13 Russians. I'm still waiting 1+ year now to see where this Trump-Russia link is.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what Trump-Russia link is documented? The sale of Uranium One and the speaking fees, Clinton Foundation drying up after election is over.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't trust Trump as far as I can throw him, but I don't see any real link to Russia here. I have closer links to Russia here in NJ when I hire a mover.

       We'll see, man. He now concedes that Russia meddled in the election and
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       won't enact the bipartisan sanctions against them.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Trump Jr. forwarded Kushner an email thread with the subject “Russia - Clinton - private and confidential,” and further down in the thread, publicist Rob Goldstone clearly states he is setting up this meeting as part of “part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump"

       That's from emails Trump Jr. released.

       Hmm...."the Russian government's support for Trump."

       No links though!! Look over there!

       Let's not bullshit each other. You don't have anywhere near the number of links to Russia as Trump. You could hire whoever the fuck you want and the Russian government is never going to have a plan to support you.

       Look at the shit we have been doing in the middle east over the past 25+ years. Compared to Russia we are the bad guys. I don't want to be the bad guys anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't give two shits about Putin, Trump, Hillary, Obama or any other one of these fuckers but I see no reason we need to have high tensions with Russia because as far as I can tell, the people of Russia like us, like our stuff, like our way of life and are not our enemies. When you have wars and tensions, the only people to get hurt are the innocent ones. Not the ones at the top in power.

       Devil's Advocate:

      <p>
       John ordered pizza the last time they were all at the house in question (note: realtor found...). Someone else offered to pick up the pizza, but didn't know where the pizza place was. John sketched a basic map with an end goal of "____ Pizza." Email sender (knowing that John ordered the pizza and someone else got it) speculates that perhaps John wrote the map on the handkerchief, and it might belong to John.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        alternate theory
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       John loves pizza, and has strong opinions about the best pizza places in the area. John won't shut up about a topic when you express interest and he's drunk. John also likes to draw things when he gets drunk. Email sender knows this about John, and speculates that the odd, seemingly pizza-related handkerchief/map might be John's.

       Agree on the principle of playing DA but in this case the attack could be on the DA argument itself and not the concept of playing DA.
      </p>
      <p>
       For your example, void of other context you could make other interpretations sure, but within the context of FBI recognized pedo symbols and code words going off like fresh popcorn, you do have question a benign interpretation.

       "And I thought I’d share a couple more notes: We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure."
      </p>
      <p>
       Within that framework, emails like that bend to the sinister, imo. Who the hell is "entertained" by children playing in a pool? Children playing are generally loud and obnoxious but we let them do it because it is healthy for their development, not because it's "entertaining." I have a hard time accepting the DA arguments in this case, so may that's the reason you get push back, not against the concept of making DA arguments.

       Whew. People really are missing the point here. Look, I'm not really interested in re-fighting pizzagate.

       Is sarcasm and dry humor just, not a thing among fans of pizzagate? As in, both parties know that young children are often obnoxious to have around, and are assuredly not "entertainment"... like... man, it really is kind of hard to explain sarcasm. Do you not joke around with your friends like that ever? Implying that something you both know isn't fun will actually be fun, just for the joke of it? To acknowledge without saying that it won't be fun, but it is happening?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the "FBI Recognized pedo symbols and code words," are you referring to
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/FBI-pedophile-symbols.pdf">
        this document?
       </a>
       You know what that document doesn't mention? Pizza. Anywhere on it. Best as I can tell, the only reference associating pizza w/ pedophilia (and the list of "code words" I've seen floating around re: pizzagate) is 4chan, with the evidence essentially amounting to "because I said so."
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I'm not really interested in going further with this discussion, but isn't this a great example of something that should have been a mega-thread with continuing discussions, rather than scattered across the dozens of breathless "new 4chan evidence!" threads that were popping out?

       I'm agreeing with you both on the point of the importance of making DA arguments, and on the point of not rehashing old material. My point (which perhaps I sabotaged by getting too deep into the weeds) is just that you may be misinterpreting the push back of people engaging with your arguments for the push back of people not wanting to entertain arguments.

       Sure, I can see that (and I actually made almost exactly that point to someone else here, earlier today). My bigger issue isn't related to "pushback", though, so much as... suppression?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know. I'm not in love with that word for it. I don't think there's enough of an active contingent of people literally suppressing stuff about Russiagate to completely stifle it. I've certainly seen some of the bigger "bombshells" make it to the top of this sub. However, all talk about Russiagate all but disappears once those stories are off the front page.

       You are
       <em>
        literally
       </em>
       using conspiracy theorist logic to justify a bunch of very clear evidence of fucked up shit. Is it really that hard for you to imagine extremely powerful people are using their power in inhumane ways? We're talking about society being based on competition that rewards sociopathy, but it's too difficult for you to see all these blatant puzzle pieces point in a specific direction.

       For fuck's sake, the guy has a statue of a Jeffrey Dahmer murder victim, and paintings of cannibalism. Is that fucking normal to you? Or is it all just sarcastic tongue-in-cheek edginess? That's just hilarious what you're willing to defend.

        I also want to make clear that by being dismissive of Pizzagate I'm not trying to be dismissive of the issue in general. We've had ample evidence of people in power committing sexual abuses. I just, personally, have not been convinced by any of the "evidence" re: Pizzagate (especially considering the source of the materials and their relation to Russia/Trump/Russian propaganda efforts).

       We're talking about people who will never be scrutinized by any law enforcement, and you think we should look the other way immediately when all these things point to a similar type of system as many other countries have faced over powerful people being involved with child abuse/exploitation.

       Trump is literally the establishment, and he's being used by the rest of the mainstream establishment like a whipping boy/heatsink. Rather than looking at any of the corruption that happened during the Primaries, it's
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       been thrown on Russia and they slowly let out more and more "truth" that it was coincidentally exactly what they thought, rather than being corruption from our side, which is exactly how it appeared. Amazing how well they just knew that would all work out that way, rather than the media implicating itself in clear collusion, we get to worry more about how
       <del>
        Seth Rich
       </del>
       Russia leaked all those things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Attacking Trump is
       <em>
        literally
       </em>
       pro-establishment. If you were against the establishment, you'd realize Trump is a product of the oligarchs flooding the media with hate and making him the "Republican pied piper" because they were so afraid that Hillary had nothing good to share and they couldn't possibly risk advertising for Sanders.

       Then if any of those scenarios are true, which they very well could be, why has never came out and addressed it? Not even an attempt, other than he says it was debunked, his own words not mine. Not with just this email though, he hasn't addressed any of them and the weird coded language that's used throughout.

       Well, think about it from his perspective. What's the benefit of doing what you say? Of addressing each point specifically? Would that stop the speculation? I don't think anyone can honestly claim that to be true. If you already believe that he is guilty of these things, him simply saying "that's not true, we were talking about hanging out and getting pizza" isn't going to be compelling evidence for anyone. It is hardly a unique tactic to avoid fueling controversy by not commenting on it. That's PR 101 in a lot of cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, it is entirely possible that he doesn't remember the specifics of some of emails in question. For those buying in to Pizzagate, these are important, pivotal emails. If you buy the other side that he's innocent, these emails are essentially meaningless to him. Would you remember the context of every email you've sent to a friend?

       Everything you said makes sense and I agree. But he comes out and says it was all debunked yet he can't point to where it was all debunked. Thats not him ignoring it, that's him telling us to ignore it.

       Well, sure. But does that have to come from a sinister reason? Back to being in his shoes. Presume you're completely innocent. How must it feel to be called a pedophile based on the words of some people on the internet interpreting your stolen personal emails in a (from your perspective) nonsensical way? And not just to be called it, but to know that many of those people believe it deep in their bones? Wouldn't you want to "tell people to ignore it" just a little bit?

       I would explain my side of things and show supporting evidence. After that it would be out of my hands. There'd still be people talking about it but they were going to talk regardless. At least that way my supporters would have concrete proof from me explaining my side of things.

       Really? Taking it at face value, they were looking at real estate, John left a handkerchief behind, the handkerchief had some pizza-related design on it, and the realtor found it. I mean, I'll admit that pizza designs on a handkerchief are a bit uncommon, but  to say that the only context that line makes sense in is as code for an underground child sex ring is just absurd.

       It sounds like John Podesta typically sends Herbert Sandler pasta for Christmas, and in 2015, decided to mix it up by sending an assortment of cheeses. Sandler is making light of the change from tradition, and is jokingly asking if the cheeses will help his dominoes game compared to the traditional pastas.

       So first you claim that the multiple emails of the millionaire Washington elite discussing pizza and hotdogs is totally not suspicious, but coincidentally is known darkweb code for pedophilia and child trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'm dreaming about your hotdog stand in Hawaii..." John Podesta has a hotdog stand?
      </p>
      <p>
       "The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related) "
      </p>
      <p>
       "Do you think I’ll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Would love to get a pizza for an hour? Or come over,"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Do you think I’ll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, Tony Podesta has a close personal relationship with convicted pedophile Dennis hasert.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Laura Silsby, former director of The New Life Children's Refuge, who had a relationship with HRC since 2001 is caught attempting to abduct and traffic 33 children from Haiti.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now you are claiming that the emails were completely fabricated, because of WikiLeaks apparent history of editing and omission. The only claim made of editing to the leaked emails was adding the word confidential.
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, no one credible has tried to claim that WikiLeaks has fabricated documents. Not once.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your logic and reasoning stand up to no scrutiny.

       No,  you seem to be confusing yourself because you made two different claims in this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       The claim that the emails are legit but the codewords are referring to drugs, so are 'not suspicious ' in the context of child trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other claim that you don't trust WikiLeaks so the emails were fabricated.

       My points is that those could be code words for something else. It is not definitive.

       And no, if you look at the bigger picture, the emails, the artwork and the multiple personal connections to pedophiles and child abductors....the codewords meaning drugs or something else makes no sense.

       The Trump Russia conspiracy sounds great, I just don't think we can get a good idea of what's going on. We have right wingers off handedly dismissing it, demanding evidence they would never otherwise demand on this sub acting as if there is absolutely nothing connecting it to Trump. We have left wingers who
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       that Trump is guilty when they would demand what the Trump supporters are while it's their party under the microscope denying everything just the same. It's blind partisanship where each side gives every single last benefit of the doubt, no matter how absurd to their party, and declare guilt if they but so much as dream the other side did something.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why politics is such a sham in here. People want to play debunker when it suits them, and they want to buy evidence they would otherwise dismiss when it benefits them. Basically Trump supporters and Hillary supporters ruined that topic for us.

       I didn't vote for Hillary and I think anyone who objectively reads the testimony of Juanita Broderick, and the other accusers of Bill will conclude that Bill is a rapist.

      <p>
       If there's no Trump/Russia conspiracy, can anyone explain this: Obama got wind of Russia meddling, he kicked out 35 Russian diplomats, seized two Russian compounds in America and imposed sanctions. Trump has said he "believes they (Russians) didn't interfere) and has now been forced to eat his words, conceding that they have---yet he STILL will not enact the bipartisan sanctions passed against Russia for election meddling.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the above would indicate to any objective observer that is something is rotten in Denmark.

       Which are great things to say, but are puzzling when combined with other things he's said and done. He's also said that he believes Russia didn't fuck with our elections because he asked Putin and Putin told him they didn't. Or, that he's declined to enforce new sanctions made by Congress and that he himself signed.

       “We believe it was the DNC that did the ‘hacking’ as a way to distract from the many issues facing their deeply flawed candidate and failed party leader.”
      </p>
      <p>
       July 25 — The FBI confirms it has opened an investigation into the hacking of the DNC computer network. In a tweet, Trump says: “The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In an interview that airs on RT, formerly known as Russia Today, Trump says it is “pretty unlikely” that the Russian government was behind the hacks targeting the Democratic Party. “I think maybe the Democrats are putting that out. Who knows? But I think that it’s pretty unlikely,” Trump says.
      </p>
      <p>
       “I notice any time anything wrong happens they like to say, the Russians, the Russians — she doesn’t know it’s the Russians doing the hacking, maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In an interview with Time magazine, Trump says, “
       <strong>
        I don’t believe they interfered.
       </strong>
       That became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point. Any time I do something, they say ‘oh, Russia interfered.'”
      </p>
      <p>
       It just goes on and on, like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now he wants his base to believe, "I never said Russia didn't meddle."
      </p>
      <p>
       Except he's on record saying, "I don't believe they interfered."
      </p>
      <p>
       All that's moot, however. He now is certain they interfered and still isn't doing shit about it. Why?

       So Kushner getting emails about "part of the Russian government's support for Mr. Trump," and then going to meet those Russians is the doing of an alphabet agency?

       Even if it were, the non-treasonous action on Kushner's part would be to alert the FBI- not reply "I love it!" and go to the meeting.

       Well I guess I’m a fool. Let me know when a politician stands up for and defends your rights by putting an end to the IRS and unrepresented federal tax program. That’d be a good start to a positive change in this country. Everything else is a mere smokescreen to keep you entertained. No real changes come from politics.

       Would we have these massive tax breaks for the rich under a Dem? Obama restricted the loophole that gave tax breaks to golf course owners. Do you think Trump will do that?

       Obama specifically protected net neutrality. I find it exceedingly likely a Deomcrat succesor would have kept that policy in place. Gone now, though, right?

       Everyone needs to get off their high horses about election meddling. The two biggest election meddlers on the planet are the USA and Israel, and yet everyone seems to care about Russia more than anything? If people outraged by this were logically consistent, there would be riots in the streets over Israel interfering in our elections and in our media so thoroughly for so many decades. There would be major protests over the fact that the USA meddles in other countries elections through propaganda, through sanctions, hell, sometimes through coups. People care about the Russia story because they were programmed to care about it. There is no logical consistency, they cherrypick this issue and ignore others just like it.

       I'm very interested in it too! Especially since it's one going on right now. How exciting? But a good majority of this sub are busy outright denying it and posting their own propaganda that tries to dismiss it! It blows my mind how a conspiracy sub doesn't entertain the possibility that a person in one of the highest positions of power could be part of a conspiracy.

       That's the tough question, and I'm not really sure I have a good answer. I don't think censorship of political opinions in general is the right move, but there's got to be some level of middle ground to operate on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, political talk is fine if there's a purpose and relation to the subject being discussed, but blatant shit slinging and sniping on the usual left/right tropes is removed? I don't know. I'm not sure I've ever seen a really good way to handle political talk in a message board/forum.

       That's why I'm not as bothered by them throwing things into contest mode. I don't know what the answer is either. I'm guilty of getting partisan as well. There's some good conspiracy shit in politics right now. Almost too good. Both sides are selling something. It's easy to get caught up. When I look around the rest of reddit a lot does seem to be compromised. I don't think the mods here have an easy task in this.

       The contest mode thing bugs me only because (from my own, incomplete point of view) it has only happened for threads that are anti-Trump in the comments. But I'm not around often enough to claim that hasn't ever happened in the other direction.

       And funny that other times you've commented I've seen others calling out that most of the subreddits aren't even active, and yet you've never updated the list. In fact of the first three subreddits I clicked on, one has only three posts and hasn't had any activity in a year, another is private and actually links to t_d, and the other doesn't even exist. Who are you trying to fool?

       Yeah, they pumped out all those subs around the time they changed the algorithm to only allow one front-paged post per sub at any given time. That's undoubtedly their method of blacking out the skies from any valid discussion.

       Rejecting a conspiracy because "normies" can agree with it is the epitome of poor thinking and hipsterism. If one of your requirements for believing in a conspiracy theory is "no one but my little group of 'open-minded thinkers' can believe in it too", then you need to take a long hard look at what this sub and its content really mean to you

       Both sides, well msm took the russia hack side. Everyone else laughed it put becuase of lack of meat on them claims. Everything establsihment and corrupt US has done is contrary to russia collusion claims. Even when simple logic is employed that narrative is weak, when reading reports and somewhere is barried a clause stating that the info provided is not proof, but an indiscator its just wow. When US has been beating its chest with NSA, cia and fbi claims to be masters of hacking and control, suddenly a bunch of russian trolls can outwitt worlds largest defence budgets and manpower. Then there is lack or reporting on any other country hacking. Seriously, you dont smell bullshit when its ONLY russia? What about china, sudan, iran, turkey? What about NKorea and other countreies, do they sort of not exist? Conspiracy dissmisses russia trump collusion becausr they take one look at how trump is running the gov and realise that its all the same, same puppet, same corrupt corporate agenda. Where russians used to be soviets and red scrae was used to dissmental social movements like worker unions, etc all the markers are that this is a diversion. Not an actual conspiracy.

       How does it scream love russia? it screams hate American mass propoganda campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I guess after almost 2 years of russia hate on american channels, I had to expect this level of stupidity to still come around. Its been intensifying on reddit, and i guess its about time its made its way onto conspiracy sub as well.

       I express my opinion. And I am a part of many comunities. Atm the discussion is regarding US and their propoganda. Not russian, russia dorsnt control the media, 6 US corporations do. And the narrative that media spews affects the world because ppaces like austrlia where i am from, this is toxic. If I had to choose I would go with russia, because USA is acting very badly for the last 2 decades. And the people are complacent with the direction their leaders are taking international policy and domestic policy. I want a better world, not one where corruption is so blatant that propoganda that keeps churning shit narrative is influencing millions to support it. I am dead tired of hearing one sided emotionaly manipulative arguments for pro war american efforts. I am not alone anlot of europians have the same option. Yet because its contrary to the establishment of US politics its somehow russia love or russia troll. Yes, lets suppress all views contrary to that, because thats healthy as fuck!

       Maybe I'm a bit too much of an X-Files junky, but that show is what got me into conspiracy theories. So to me, a juicy government conspiracy is 100% where I'm at.

       I disagree. Good conspiracy theorists use an academic approach and lay out all the evidence and try to identify the empirical evidence upon which to build ideas, then critique those ideas to see if they stand up.

       It's because two kinds of people are attracted to conspiracies: the intellectually curious and the extremely ignorant that's fueled by bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       The latter is what most of this sub is. Most people here honestly think of themselves of conspiracy theorists but they're fucking not, they're just people who already made their minds up or want to be contrarian and disagree with the mainstream just to be "different".

       Because he's interested in open-minded dialogue. Discussion with people that are willing to look at it from both sides. You can't get that from the 'pure-left' or from the 'pure-right'. You used to be able to get it from here, but not lately, and not about Trump.

       This is the exact kind of conspiracy I feel like this subreddit was waiting for, hell, I feel like they could have even found some of the ties before Mueller did. And it seems like so few find it interesting. It's one of the best of our lifetime, and it's in the discount bin, like no one wants it.

       It's not in the discount bin, the Donald's bots come here to brigade and channel the conversation away from the Russia conspiracy because they know that Trump's approval is in the gutters and they know that Trump's done some shady shit, now I am not saying direct collusion but he's surely laundered money with Russian firms in the past and the Kremlin probably has some blackmail material on him.

       just go through account histories. Thereve been a ton of accounts come through since the 2 month old requirement, that are suddenly active accounts but maybe 1,2 years old or even older, yet with extremely low karma counts. They are either purchased accounts, or aged accounts. I rez tag them by colors and descriptors and sometimes you can just see a whole thread explode with them.

       Three problems with Trump Russia:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         It is being pushed in ungodly force by the LEAST credible forces alive. Any user of this sub pre 2015 would be as astounded as I am to see the media, politicians, celebrities, and companies being so blatant about the narrative. Trump Russia is not only predicated on Trump's corruption, but that the Intel agencies, mainstream media, and DNC are the "good guys". Nobody here could buy that hence the mass shills.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump's actions in office. It's been over a year now and Trump has been doing pretty much exactly what he said he would. Many parts of this like TPP and calling out fake news were cornerstones of this subreddit's interests. Alongside the shills, there is definitely a section of the user base that rejects the idea that a president could EVER be doing any good but that dwindles as time goes on.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Zero evidence. There is ZERO evidence. None. With the entire establishment against him, they have absolutely nothing on the guy. The only thing left is the argument that the Mueller investigation isn't over yet and you can't know the future. Weak.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Trump Russia is just not a conspiracy.

       We should start looking into ways to prevent this sub from going off track too often. Shills not only try to reinforce mainstream narratives, they probably also post dumb theories to get us distracted and going down the wrong path. The more bullshit they post, the more dilute the sub becomes and the more difficult it is to obtain useful information.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there should be a periodic reminder that
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/70qvx7/updated_list_of_proven_conspiracies_and_hidden/">
        there have been a great deal of proven conspiracies
       </a>
       , some of them being international in scope, and involving large groups of people who got away with it for many years. This completely wipes out several of their main narratives, including the claim that the government must be too incompetent to pull off large conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Periodically focusing on conspiracy facts, rather than theories, especially when many of the proven ones are very similar to current unproven theories, would do a lot of good here.

       I think you bring up some pretty good points. Certain posts would be harder to be intercepted by shills if there were comparisons drawn between past proven conspiracies and today’s theories within the title and description.

       Too many people immediately jump on the "you're defending drumpf" or the "trump can do no wrong" trains.
       <br/>
       Looking at the comments here, you can see that both trains are blaming the other when neither opinion is helping.
       <br/>
       Most of the posts are just a shitty news story with no end games listed and nothing of substance.

       Yeah, I see complaints of the sub being both filled with Trump defenders and filled with liberal shills. So if both sides feel outnumbered, maybe it's more equal than we think? A bit like how the BBC gets equal complaints of left wing and right wing bias.

       I honestly want this to be
       <strong>
        the place

       for non-partisan discussion for conspiracies on both sides.

       It seems like people downvote whatever they don't politically agree with. But you're just supposed to downvote if the theory isn't a theory, or if the comment is 100% not related to the theory.

       Exactly.  We have people regularly posting anti-Russiagate stuff claiming that they're skeptical and sick of hearing about it.  Ok so ignore it?  But no, it's a campaign to smear it.

       What I mean to say is, despite that I did not believe that pizzagate was real, I still found it to be a fascinating conspiracy. So I read about it and followed what people were talking about.

       The question of "why" is 90% of what makes it fun. Would it be to have him be a puppet, and turn the US effectively into an extension of Russia? If that was the goal, they somewhat failed as people are looking into it. But at the same time, politically speaking, we are more like Russia, and Russia is more like us than we have ever been, so maybe that one is not too far off. Or would it be simply to make america look weak so that other countries, like China, have an easier time becoming the world super-power. (China being better buddies with Russia, it would benefit them.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, As Putin likes to just send fighter jets near america on holidays, and weird shit like that, what if it was all just the
       <strong>
        ultimate
       </strong>
       annoying prank? Just a reminder that Russia is clever, and that if they really wanted to, they could really mess shit up. Just like is implied by the jets that come close to US airspace. Though, imaging the amount of effort for a prank seems unthinkable. But then again, maybe
       <strong>
        that is the point.
       </strong>
       That it wasn't much effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is the obvious lack of new sanctions being a perk, so maybe there's some incentive in that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or perhaps it's not Russia, it's another entity (Such as North Korea) doing a good job of covering it's tracks, by pitting the US against it's classic, cold-war era enemy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or even still, and this one is
       <strong>
        my favorite
       </strong>
       : The US government saw a lot of unrest under Bush and even Obama. What would be
       <strong>
        the best
       </strong>
       way to make americans happy for the conventional political system of yesteryear? Make it look like the modern one is compromised! Today it seems like people
       <strong>
        wish
       </strong>
       they had someone like George W Bush, rather than Trump. There's a lot of positive press for McCain, someone who lost a bid at the presidency before. Mueller has become a hero republican to the democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Trump leaves, Russia takes the blame, the US goes back to business as usual, with no pesky "occupy" movements or anything like that. Think about it, if someone just like George W is elected, people will be far less inclined to complain, because "by comparison to the Trump Russia thing, this is great!"
      </p>
      <p>
       America seems to unify when there is a threat. So why start an all-out war when you could just make it look like we've been infiltrated?

       If someone wants to say they think JFK was shot discreetly by the driver, yes, they are probably wrong. There's plenty of evidence that the driver couldn't have done it. But go ahead and let the "what ifs" of the conversation still happen, even though it's basically impossible for it to have been the driver.

       Plus this subs genuine users will actually discuss it. Unlike every post in politics/ news/ets/ess/ tmor etc etc where they won't discuss the actual issues. They just downvote and throw insults if you question anything the MSM, excpet Fox, tells you. Genuine users here are interested in the truth and that's it.

       I have found that, since the introduction of the SS rule, I only have to scroll through the first two or three pages of 'new' submissions to find enough content to keep me busy.

       It is sad how all the real fringe topics has become such a breath of fresh air the rare times they fight the tide of shills and get any attention at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub has been dominated by political conspiracy topics and gaslighting for over a year now. I think that there is a massive interest in subverting the conspiracy community to get in and control counter culture narrative before they become mainstream as a result of Trump using them as a resource during his campaign. There also seems to be QUITE an effort to shill MSM outlet here, which is absurdly ironic and reflects a clear lack of understanding what conspiracy minded individuals would consider credible.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was also a time not long in the past where the REAL gold was in the comments here instead of the main posts. Now it is just a bunch of partisan BS with comments like "This!" heavily upvoted to slide real discussion, and every other post is antagonistic of the one above it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somehow it is also okay to insult the sub in general and its users by calling it full of Shareblue shills or that it is TD_2.0 all the time.

       I mostly agree with what you say, but I did have a point to make about the MSM shill part. I totally agree with being skeptical, and the threat of corporate influence in MSM sources (especially TV) is a real one, but at the same time MSM has been involved in breaking lots of conspiracies over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone else in the thread linked to a list of
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/70qvx7/updated_list_of_proven_conspiracies_and_hidden/">
        proven conspiracy theories
       </a>
       and I see a big list of MSM links and Wiki articles that often make reference to big newspapers and other MSM sources being involved in revealing the conspiracies.
      </p>

       Obviously that doesn't mean you can blindly trust any WAPO article you find, but you should also not completely ignore them either.

       I agree with the IDEA of what you are saying, but I feel like we should be creating the context of what is being reported ourselves, and not rely on the editorial departments to spin it for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some really good, and objective journalists at a lot of mainstream outlets (Washington Post and Fox News included) but their work is usually colored up and defined by the editorial department and that is usually what is actually disseminated to the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       By controlling context, they can publish proof of real conspiracies but control and spin what elements that people focus on and will avoid the difficult questions that point to issues or the larger perspective of what they mean. The outlet will always paint a favorable perspective for those provided the information with the goal of gaining access to the resource for future stories. It is a mutually beneficial relationship in most cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of "known" conspiracies are actually limited hangouts.

       Hey I agree. But put the blame where it should lie: Reddit itself. I just got banned from a conservative based sub-Reddit for questioning the Holohoax narrative. I even offered to submit my sources, but they couldn't even be bothered to accept that. Democrats = Republicans. They're all the same.

       It's entirely possible Mossad played a technical role, because they go around the world doing that sort of thing. But the Israelis don't have the power to stand down the U.S. air defense system.

       Oh, google it, because tons of times he has. He makes a point to do it; he's what we call a left gatekeeper. Says there's "no evidence at all!," gets all upset too. And he wrote a whole book denying that the establishment would have had any reason to kill JFK, which a LIE. Chomsky knows better; he's working for the bad guys, in my assessment.
      </p>
      <p>
       And his linguistics career is absolutely bizarre. Chomsky's big idea was build a machine that could speak and understand all languages in proper grammar. It's something the CIA has been extremely interested in, originally in what they called Project Jason. Google "Christopher Knight Noam Chomsky" if you want a lengthy analysis of his linguistics career that exposes it as reactionary.

       NLP and parsing grammar with machines is an extremely common private sector thing as well. Hell a lot of open source resources are available on it. It's not overly complicated or difficult. Undergrad comp sci major stuff.

       An unsupervised program for parsing any language is definitely much harder. And I'm not an expert in unsupervised grammar parsing. But it's definitely something the private sector utilizes, although probably only applied to languages it's profitable to apply it to. But once you have the parsing down, chat bots to reply aren't particularly difficult.

       Great true quote, but Chomsky definitely likes to pretend that his ideology is not within the spectrum of acceptable opinion. He likes to pretend socialism and progressivism is fringe. Also likes to pretend that the spectrum of acceptable opinion doesn't shift leftwards year after year with few exception.

       This comment is far too sensible. Pretty ironic string of comments given the topic of this post, though. Sad, actually. For what it's worth I think you're correct, clarity is key. People are quick to be defensive when they take differing opinions as personal attacks.

       A 2018 "moderate" would have been a far-left extremist of 1918. And someone with moderate 2018 views will likely be seen as far-right in as little as 20 or 30 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the zeitgeist moves ever leftwards, even liberals who stand still will become seen as "conservatives" of the future.

       A lot of communist policies that were considered looney and radical even 50 years ago are considered mainstream and acceptable to debate now, if they are not currently implemented and accepted by many. "Universal basic income," for example. You would have been laughed out of the room if you had seriously proposed such a thing.

       Universal Basic income was defended by Milton Friedman around 40 years ago. Which other policies?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nixon tried to pass universal healthcare as a republican. Both parties defended unions. The state believed in limiting the size of banks as well as their ability to speculate in both parties. The people believed there shouldbt be unlimited donations from corporations to politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       All those policies used to be thought as rational and now are extreme left wing for Americans. How is that a tilt to the left?

       Both Milton Friedman and Richard Nixon are left of center, so I'm not sure what bringing up two liberals proves. Capitalism (particularly the laissez Faire, free market stuff) is the stuff of liberalism. Adam Smith, Thomas Jefferson. These are "Classical liberals," as in they were the left-wing of their time. But "Classical liberals" today are our right wing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, anarcho-capitalism is about as right wing as you can get while still being left of center. Libertarianism just left of that, then Classical liberalism, neoliberalism from right to left.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is farther right: Richard Nixon or Charlemagne? The Bush's or the Stewart's? Donald Trump or Julius Caesar?

       Milton Friedman left of center? Come on, man. He is vilified by pretty much all the left. He supported Pinochet, established neoliberalism in Chile and supported it around the world. That's the opposite of center left. He believed in even less government interference than Adam Smith refers to in the Wealth of Nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       You measure the left-right spectrum in the present. Or I could say that an anarcho-capitalist is really a leftist because he was in the times of feudalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anarcho capitalism is not as right wing, Fascism could also be on the extreme left. It's not socialism-capitalism. It includes conservatism, the idea of who should have power, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Libertarianism can exist in the left wing spectrum too.

       You can't compare Richard Nixon to Charlemagne in present terms. But if you could compare, Charlemagne was more left wing in his time. As well as Caesar than Trump. But you measure the spectrum according to the time you live, not however you like or else it becomes useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody practices or defends classic liberalism anymore. At least not before Stuart Mill's classic liberalism, which shares many ideas with neoliberalism. It's useless to place it in an spectrum in the last century.

       This is a good observation, but this is where I disagree. While words do sometimes change their meanings over time, and I am not saying that they do not, it's dangerous and downright subversive, nearly Orwellian, to define these politically charged labels based solely on the popular sentiments of the times in which we live without putting them in a historical context. Doing this is exactly what the Chomsky quote is talking about: one is the effect of the other, I'd have to think about which is the cart and which is the horse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not arguing about Obama being to the left of Bush. I'm arguing about the original Chomsky quote about the narrow window that is the spectrum of ideas that is acceptable to debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of a number line. 5 is less than 6. We are freely open to debate any number between 5 and 6. Maybe Chomsky is a 4.9 or a 5.1. Trump is maybe a 5.7 or 5.8. A half century ago we were debating numbers between 6 and 7. Two centuries ago we were debating numbers between 9 and 10. Whether or not there is a concerted effort or conspiracy to drag the debate to lower numbers over time, or if it's something of a feature (or bug) inherent of the current system is up for debate.

       Are you a socialist? Or a Marxist? What I am describing is the dialectic - practically confirming it. Marx was not hesitant to compare feudal times, describing the transition of which to democracy, to capitalism, to socialism, as "progress leftwards" to the eventual goal or telos of communism. (although I disagree with the notion that this dialectic is entirely materialistic in nature.)

       If a moderate centrist person hopped in a time machine from 1918 to 2018, they would come out the other side a far-right winged person even if their beliefs did not change.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not particular of the past century and I don't mean to portray it as such. It's just that we are all more familiar with the 20th century than earlier ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even looking at just communists of 100 years ago compared to communists of today. A 2018 communist would consider a 1918 communist reactionary. Pro-gun, pro-military ww2 veterans, anti-gay, worked in a coal mine, etc. (accurately describes the right wing of today). About their only similarities would be that they're poor and anti-christian.

       It's almost like young people are on the left and as they grow up those ideas become more mainstream so the entire world continues to shift left, but the US is skewed to the right of that for many reasons.

       You're comparing the US to the rest of the world, other commenter is simply saying that the US continues to shift to the left every year. I'm going to go ahead and take a wild guess that generational differences play a huge role in that, and it's easy to see why that is, and why the world continues to move in that direction.

       Just curious, if America has actually been taken over and dragged hard left, what are some contrasting nations that aren't hardcore left wing? Seeing as just about every single developed nation I can think of views the USA as to the right of themselves, I'm having a hard time understanding your perspective. Perhaps Egypt, and lately India (altho they have more socialized institutions than us) are in various ways right of America, but who do you have in mind?

       You're on to it. Keep thinking about it. I'll give you a hint: America has not been "taken over and dragged hard left," unless you go back to around 1776. America dragged the rest of the world to the far-left.

       You're absolutely correct! Now, who would benefit from people not realizing or caring that Bush is actually left of center historically, compared to a monarchy or a czar?

       Take a moment to consider and realize that Europe is traditional left.

       America's "left" is "conservative-lite". The extreme left in the US is basically European centrist. Meanwhile the extreme left in Europe are literal socialists. There are people in the US who think they believe in socialism but they're just very uneducated.

       If your idea of being left is communism, then yes. Sanders is social democrat and solidly within the left wing. He is not just "left leaning." Hillary is more of a populist centrist. She does seem to lean left on most issues/policy, though.

       Even by the standards of Europe my responses would stay the same. I would argue the opposite in that most right wing parties are right-centre in Europe. While their liberal parties tend to be similar to the Democratic Party in America.

       That last bit is certainly true. They're right wing parties, though. Consistently against everything the true left is about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, you can argue that, by saying what's true now is different than from the past. Sure if you want to argue that, then you're right. But the fact is, the left in the past was about giving control to the workers. Labour parties commonly are not really about the workers anymore, despite the name. They do everything in name of the worker, but for some reason keep the problems of the workers intact, like private property.
      </p>
      <p>
       That whole discussion has been removed and now it's about things that shouldn't even be discussed in the first place. That's the shift to the right. Not talking about socialism anymore, but instead on how to survive capitalism as a worker. This shift is quite obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not even wrong that most right wing parties are close to the center. But that's not the issue. It's the fact that left wing parties are far closer to these center parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       The left, economically, is socialism. When left of the center doesn't even entertain the idea of socialism, how are they left wing? Right wing is capitalism, left wing is socialism. How is left/center still capitalism? That makes no sense to me.

       Socialism-capitalism is not an on-off switch. Centre-left would be people who believe in moderately to highly regulated capitalism. Furthermore, economic policy is not the only policy to consider. Social programs and their funding is also a way to rate where someone is politically. I rate Bernie Left Wing since he believes in a lot of social programs and highly regulated capitalism. Simply because you're not fully supportive of a socialist economic system doesn't mean you can't be left wing. I think you're thinking in too black and white of terms. Either socialism or capitalism. There are nuances to regulated capitalism and mixed economies.

       It's funny you mention nuance, because according to what you just wrote, there's socialism on the far left, without any nuance whatsoever and just capitalism anything right from that (including the moderate left).
      </p>
      <p>
       So you're basically saying there's no difference between socialism and communism, there's no nuance there. There's just nuance in capitalism and you can be left wing and pro capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not 100% wrong, of course not, you're not an idiot, I can see that. Most of what you're saying is true. The thing is, this is all part of the shift of politics towards the right wing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also have to comment on your idea that highly regulated capitalism is a left wing principle. It isn't. You can be for or pro regulation within the right wing. Libertarian would be against it. Fascism would be for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes for the left. Libertarian (left, as it originally was) is against regulation whereas those leaning towards the ideas of establishing communism are very pro regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a left/right thing. It's an authoritarian or libertarian thing. These nuances have all disappeared lately. Nowadays you would consider Hillary to be center left. Which in my opinion is ridiculous. Her policies are eerily close to what right wing parties (albeit that they're close to the center) are saying. In certain areas she's actually further right.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is mostly because the DNC is the further left in the two relevant political parties in the states. Take The Netherlands for example, where a far right party like FvD is further right than PVV, which are mostly further right than VVD. Then you've got D66, which are further left than Clinton's policies are, but still considered right wing. Then you've got the labour party, which is considered left but often criticized for being too willing to accept right wing ideas, mind you they're way more left wing than Clinton is. Then you've got a whole bunch of parties that are much further to the left than that. GroenLinks is left wing, but they entertain right wing ideas because those ideas still fit in with the actual left wing ideas. Then you've got a few parties that are left wing by current narrative, without actually being left wing. The type of party I'm against, because identity politics and immigration have nothing to do with left/right wing. The furthest left is the Socialist Party which I criticize for not actually saying anything about abolishing private property, which is the core idea of Socialism. Another indicator that the political spectrum has moved to the right as a whole.

       I didn't bother mentioning extreme leftism (communism and all it's flavors) or extreme rightism (fascism and national socialism). I didn't mean to conflate socialism with communism. I think I may have just ended up arguing semantics, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as regulated capitalism goes, the more regulation you support the more left you are and bice versa. Of course right wing supports some regulations. Anarcho-capitalist are about the only group that support no regulation or government at all.

Dems and Repubs are just slightly different shades of FAR RIGHT economics (NEOliberalism)
and EXTREME authoritarian social issues.

       Republican and Democrat politicians engage in bullshit like:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         EXTREMELY deregulated market and bank economics. NEOLIBERALS (far right).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Removing/reducing funding of social programs OR injecting crony capitalist corporate interference to make the social programs inefficient and expensive (i.e. privatization: using our taxes "for profit" which is extremely right wing and crony capitalist too).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Warmongers....need I say more? NEOCONSERVATIVES (these are far right warmongers specifically/war profiteering).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Democrat party colluded with corporate CNN/MSM
and shat on Bernie 24/7. Bernie's policies were only
of FDR style Social Democracy which is almost American centrist.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Yet Fox was saying "OMG 90% TAX RATE" when it was much less than for the TOP tax rate let alone the normal tax brackets most people fall into. CNN favored extremist TPP Soros WALLSTREET shill CLINTON.
The Dem election was rigged in favor of Clinton.
MSM is not left wing, centrist or moderate right and neither are the parties they shill for.
CORPORATIONS (controlled by banksters) are EXTREME capitalists, not moderate in any way.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Obamacare is crony capitalist, why didn't Obama go for
single payer healthcare? BECAUSE HE'S NOT LEFT WING.
Even NEOliberal Europe has some shitty form of single payer, (some countries
have the crappy privatized form, some might have the legit socialized form)
but America doesn't even have that despite having it during FDR's time.
Instead Obamacare/Repub alternative, they're both corporate shits for profit at our expensive.
They don't give a fuck about us.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         STATE SURVEILLANCE. NSA authoritarian shit. Death penalty too.
War on drugs, private prison system, false flags like 9/11, etc. etc.
Does this shit sound like left vs right? Or far right vs far right?
Makes you think the Deep State theories have something to them.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Since Reagan, the bastard NEOliberals and NEOconservatives have gained power.
Trickle down economics bullshit. 30 years or so since then, the gap between
extreme rich and extreme poor has only gotten much bigger.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elites control these parties, please stop defending them.
They're only after profit and therefore control: FULL NWO fascism/feudalist centralized control:

       You don't know what feudalism means. Don't use that word.
      </p>
      <p>
       You come across as extremely conspiratorial that some class of people out there have complete control. In reality, chaos reigns and people only delude themselves into believing someone or some group has complete control. They don't. They couldn't. Keeping a secret between two people is hard enough, let alone thousands. You have conflated corporate influence and donations as some sort of illuminati-esque conspiracy. Yes, the rich and influential do have lots of power. No, they do not have much ability to influence outside factors or individual decision making.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondarily, your scale makes little to no sense. Hitler advocated social programs distributed along ethnic lines. Only Germans or others deemed acceptable were allowed the social programs. That's certainly not centrist thought. The racial laws and policies to jail, castrate, take rights, take property, and ultimately exterminate undesirables is far from centrist or centre-right. The fact that this graph rates Hitler more leftist and only slightly more authoritarian than most American politicians is laughable. This seriously comes off as a bad joke. You're insane.

       No, I know what feudalism is, and don't tell me what to do.
Ironic you imply me as ignorant and yet you claim the corporate parties that engage in false flag attacks,
globalist economics, insane deregulation, anti-worker rhetoric, etc. as normal. 
They're extremists and hence we have the gap between the super poor and super rich
getting even larger. What's moderate about that? Are you in the wrong sub?
Defending warmongers and wallstreet?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm conspiratorial? Yeah what sub is this? I didn't imply full control,
but certainly disproportionate control and hence why the state of things today are miserable
despite the potential for change. They're just trying to increase it to full slavery levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hitler was extremely authoritarian and so your statement about him isn't contradictory to what my post said. I never said he was centrist.
His economics were slightly right of center but the authoritarianism reveals his corporate cronyism, mass surveillance and racial shit.
I don't know why you're trying to derail.....it's something shills tend to do on this sub. Hmmm.
His economics were not that crazy, far right NEOliberalism is crazy. But he was an extremely authoritarian maniac.
If you can't even look at the American NSA state surveillance, false flags, private federal reserve, wars for profit, basic corruption, rigged primaries, etc. and just resort to calling
me insane because you'd rather not burden yourself with the thought about the corporate fascists who want to take over, maybe
you should re-evaluate your worldview or attitude or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to put your head in the sand while
there's a hostile takeover, be my guest. NEOliberalism has caused major damage in the last few decades
and if we ignore it it's going to get hella worse. But I'm not falling for that shit.
We have extreme capitalists with extreme amounts of power and governments
are infiltrated with secret societies, warmongers and banksters.
Be aware or ignore it at your own peril. I'm not going to waste my time further with shills
and ignorant people. The left vs right spectrum is outdated. Most accurate form is two axes. Economics and social issues.

       Lol what?
I'm a center left libertarian socialist, I don't believe in alt right bullshit (much of it is misguided bullshit at least).
Authoritarians consolidate control and try to centralize the economy. Feudal times were pretty authoritarian, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'm not saying "de-centralized" economics are necessarily a good idea by itself....it would be good as long as you have reasonable amounts of regulation. Decentralized doesn't become benevolent if there's zero regulation (competing or allied mafia corporations would just destroy anyone in their way). Hence, I just suggest removing money from politics and then our politicians will stop being corrupt retards and start thinking about the common man instead of the corporations, when deciding their economic policies.

       Socialism kind of implies the abolition of private property. This needs a definition of where personal property (allowed under socialism) ends, and private property takes over.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could put a dollar amount on that. Like, say, 5 million USD. Everything over that amount is not legal to own. When you hit that amount you have "won" the mini capitalist game inside socialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not having "the abolition of private property" in your program makes you a social democrat at best. They argue for a little socialist game (of income redistribution), inside capitalism.

       That's kinda funny. He's so fringe they were teaching him in my college courses at one of the most mainstream Universities on the entire west coast in classes like Writing and Journalism for Advertising 101, more than 2 decades ago. I learned about him through an International Studies discipline.

       Well that would make sense. I don't remember how what we read from him, ("Manufacturing Consent" was one book), pertained to what I was supposed to be learning about international studies. I also didn't really follow Chomsky himself at all, especially after college. I just get trickle down in places like this sub from other people who prop him up or shoot him down. Whether wingman_joe is right, and Chomsky does think himself fringe or whether it's just some of his angstier fans that do, I honestly don't know. It's a good way to sell books.

       He always came across as long-winded, circle-talk to me. There's no doubt he's smart, but he knows his craft and how to squeeze every ounce of attention from his reader by writing entire paragraphs and chapters filled with academic descriptions and big words to get across a message that could easily have been summarized with the first and maybe last sentence of any given paragraph he wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess, I'm kinda doing the same thing. I could have just said I find him to be long-winded.

       He wrote a book on anarchism. You think anarchism is even remotely acceptable? Even outside of the USA. Take a look at France, Germany, The Netherlands. Why don't they have an anarchist party?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, because anarchism is against the state? So is communism, but we've seen plenty of Communist Parties. Sure the Dutch one disbanded in 1990, but the party did exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read his book On Anarchism. It's a great read and a great introduction to the ideas. You'll see just how far off the spectrum of acceptable opinion he really is, even if he isn't necessarily a typical anarchist.

       Some of his books really opened my eyes to subjects like the media and US meddling in foreign affairs though.

       I guess I wouldn't dismiss his entire body of work out of hand without actually taking a look yourself and making an informed decision from your own perspective.

       We put Saudis on the petrodollar. That’s why we support them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just said the US destabilizes the Middle East, not directly invades. Libya, Syria, Iraq-Iran war, Arab Spring, install dictators. It’s not that hard. Play all sides. Enforce the petrodollar. Get fracking, offshore drill or go low emissions if they get too successful.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a real fear that so much wealth is concentrated in the ground in the Middle East that they could compete globally and be an economic threat. That didn’t happen because of war resulting in unstable markets, brain drain, and resources being spent on war or security instead of economy (Israel has this weakness).

       There is actually an interesting correlation between the founding of Israel and the beginnings of US attempts at destabilizing the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm no expert on historical affairs, but through some light researching it seems that the US didn't really begin attempts at destabilization until several years after the founding of Israel (05/14/1948 according to a google search). The first instance I know about of US meddling in Middle Eastern affairs is the
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup">
        CIA backed coup of Iran in 1953
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from Netanyahu bypassing Obama and going to Congress a couple years back, I'm having a difficult time finding a time when the US has destabilized Israel in any way.

       To be fair before that period the French and British had most of the Middle East under their control, and before that they were the ones doing the destabilizing. The begnnings of US meddling in the region is less to do with Israel being formed and more with the asendency of the US as a superpower following WW2, launching what was essentially a global campaign of meddling in countries in order to protect this status.

       The conspiracies involving Trump are all weak and or over-blown.

       The president is a complete fucking idiot and egomaniac. But is that a conspiracy? Is Russia even really a conspiracy? Why is that more important than the last 20 years of an evil military industrial complex?

       T_d happened. These two-bit mongoloids saw conspiracy as some kind of kindred spirit. They both deconstruct realities after all, t_d just enjoys reconstructing it to fit some political narrative in their eternal holy war vs the "libtards." Unless you get rid of every one of these anti-intellectual bottom-feeding in-breeding dreck humanity then this sub will continue to resemble its lowest common denominator.

       Right they get huge boners when they hear about pedophiles getting exposed, and that's a bad thing? Or do you believe pizzagate is somehow boiled down to a restaurant in DC? Roy Moore is a legit pervert predator, but it also turned out to be true that she faked the signature... So what then? By the way i dont give two shits about this roy moore guy. He was just a way to take the attention off bigger fish getting the limelight shone upon their misdeeds and sexual deviancy...

       Trusting blindly seems very counter-productive to a conspiracy subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your comment seems the most appropriate for this subreddit, and it's shocking to me that it's not higher up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have my political biases, but I really try to leave them at the door in a community like this. But it's gotten so extreme on here that it just feels like an extension of political subreddits. It's not about disproving who you disagree with, it's about
       <strong>
        the conspiracies.

       memes are ideas/actions/behaviors that spread socially. internet memes are just one form. things like stereotypes are memes. gender relations can be memes. customs/politeness are memes. our intellegences runs off memes basically.

       This is exactly it.  Before the internet the only way you could have interactions with people like this sub you could only do it at the library like once a month with probably some of the weirdest creepiest people you'd ever meet.  I mean I remember when there was just 13 channels so the only place you'd hear about anything were from one of them.

       Aka anything that goes against a biased agenda is obviously an astroturf or troll army. Yeah.. it has nothing to do with with that so many people on here are partisan plebes trying to push an agenda. Standing up to misinformation = troll/astroturf apparently.

        Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target's belief.

       I definitely question my sanity when I use this website. For example, I get hit multiple times an hour by comments loudly proclaiming that some subreddit called "T_D" is ruining reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is funny because this "T_D" subreddit has been banned from the front page for months now. So I am not sure how they are spreading their message to the rest of reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       While people on this website scream about the "T_D" menace, I am bombarded by multiple front page posts per hour that aggressively try to plant the seed in my mind that Donald Trump and his followers are the anti-Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       I click into subreddits that have nothing to do with politics and I am hit by submissions upvoted into the thousands that paint Donald Trump and his supporters as the anti-Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       I enter comment sections about topics that have nothing to do with politics and I see top comments upvoted into the thousands that paint Trump and his supporters as the anti-Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       I browse these comment sections by new and controversial and I regularly see comments saying "X user posts in T_D" and these comments are rewarded and the offending commenter gets berated, belittled, and downvoted as if he/she was the anti-Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the reddit that I have been seeing every single day for months now and while I am witnessing this with my eyes and my brain, an extremely loud voice continues to cut through assuring me that members of "T_D" are systematically destroying and "taking over" reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what should I believe? The loud voice that repeats the same thing over and over about Trump and "T_D" members destroying reddit or what I am actually witnessing: members of the anti-Trump brigade dominating the front page every single time I log in or enter 99% of comment threads.

       I find that kind of behavior extremely disturbing. I saw a person accused of being "a Russian troll" the other day and the person accusing him dropped a link to a comment that user had made.
      </p>
      <p>
       The comment was literally "Russian girls are hot" as a response to a Russian ice-skater video on the front page.

       The user accused of being Russian was downvoted into oblivion and the accuser was gang-upvoted.

       One wrong comment in r/"politics" or any of the 15+ anti-Trump subs pushed daily to the front page and you are banned for life. Why do people like you continually pretend it only happens on TD?

       And how delusional are you where you think a subreddit named after Donald Trump and formed as a pep-rally for his presidential run, would allow you to enter and shit all over the person the sub is dedicated to?

       You cannot do that in ANY sub dedicated to any subject. This concept is so simple that a kindergarten kid could understand it.

       Point is, there aren't rules about down voting just because the users history or you disagree with what they said. The point of down voting was always to encourage higher quality commentary to be at the top of the page. That can't exist when armies from either side just go on the attack without wanting to actually engage the other person.

       Sorry it's not for anyone. I tried to have a civil discussion in
       <a href="/r/conservative">
        /r/conservative
       </a>
       and I was banned immediately, I tried  to fact check T_D once, not being a dick, just saying "hey this isn't true, check this article" Boom banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sick of people saying that conservatives have it so rough here, I told everyone on politics to cool their roll when the Russia stuff first started coming up in 2016, I was down voted into hell, but  I WASN'T BANNED. Same with
       <a href="/r/democrats">
        /r/democrats
       </a>
       , I said things against the grain, got down votes but no ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have only been banned in conservative outlets. So when you say having a conservative view on reddit is not for civil discourse, I think it's because they don't allow civil discourse to happen.

       You are so terribly correct it's not even funny. It seems to me that the only people that gaslight are the left. And the MSM pays to persuade them but instead of adverts they pay to control what shows up for sites like Reddit. To go with their narrative. That's why even though I don't think Trump is what is right for this country, we shouldn't be focused on "if Melania loves him" and stupid bullshit I see everyday on FP. Every side is wasting their time arguing with one another online as if it'll change anything even if you do change someone's mind. And you don't change someone's mind by downvoting and degrading them with name-calling as if we're elementary again anyway. I've had some of the most understanding, kind, and empathetic views and comments, go ahead, take a look. See how much I get down voted DESPITE being progressive enough to where I say when I'm wrong and/or didn't think about another view that was pointed out. Even when I get attacked, I never cuss anyone  and I'm always trying to understand why people see the way they see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Source: I'm subscribed to both r/politics and r/the_donald because I'm genuinely concerned that it's all a conspiracy and there is a civil war being implemented in our society. 
Ps.. Everyone is wrong to me. But Trump isn't where your rage needs be focused, he's obviously a ploy, a puppet. Everyone knows the president has no real power. Look at the JFK conspiracy. Let's swallow our pride and figure out what the fuck is really going on. Like the effort y'all put into who's missing on Reddit this week. Cause if we don't all work together how is our country supposed to?

       I feel exactly the same way and I am surprised this topic is not being discussed more. It should really be blatantly obvious to anyone paying attention and not brainwashed by party politics that a very real life-threatening civil war is around the corner if people continue to allow themselves to be whipped into angry internet mobs so easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its like they believe that this hate will somehow stay in the digital realm and that it has no connection to real life. Which is fucking absurd. The hate is real and very real consequences are going to come from it.

       Little of column A, little of column B. Reddit's always been mostly left-leaning politically, but when I first started visiting the site there was at least some back and forth debate whenever politics were brought up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's been a combination of those political groups that have been paying people to astroturf Reddit 24/7 that happen to have the same goals as that Russian troll organization which apparently has been doing the same thing. They've been so loud and so aggressive, that the rest of Reddit's casual users just keep

       But let be honest, what are you hearing from this site about Trump? Ask yourself. Are they good things or are they overwhelmingly negative? You and I both know its 99% negative. Thats not reality. Thats not how reality works. Thats how weaponized information and propaganda works.

       most of us feel this way, some people just let the hate that they have from the presidential distraction cloud their more long term and realistic threats.

       even on 4chan you can see the shills and how effective they are at manipulating groupthink- turning libertarians/democratic socialists into national socialists and communists.

       I still hold the limited federal democratic republic to a high regard. that's what they are most keen on, making us see the faults in our  awesome system.

       This guy is his own worst enemy. He can't keep his mouth shut/ego in check. Whether it be on twitter or whatever, he has no idea what it takes to be a leader in world politics.

       I can understand that point of view, but I think attempting to assassinate the President carries great risk and could even potentially expose the NWO to the general public. Perhaps they see that as a last resort and would rather try to conrol him, contain him, impeach him, or otherwise suppress him first. Or maybe he really is just another puppet, but I find that hard to believe based on the leaked emails and other thing.

       You are the one that said news/reality can't be 99% of the time negative. I'm refuting it. And what's a better example than that?  What percentage of time should Hitler be referred to negatively and what percentage positively to fit into your reality?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes the negatives really do outweigh the positives. Hitler was a painter so I guess he brought art [positive] into the world. But that is not worth mentioning compared to the atrocities he commited.

      <p>
       The media does have control over the context. But that's why you should read a variety of sources.

       You don't seem to understand the basic concept that all of those clickbait headlines you allowed yourself to swallow have affected you.

       I have noticed you sidestepped the point.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Are they good things or are they overwhelmingly negative? You and I both know its 99% negative. Thats not reality. Thats not how reality works.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Do you still agree that this is how reality works? Is there no one that you can think of that would receive mostly negative press? Or do you think everyone get 50% positive and 50% negative?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there sensationalism. Certainly. But it all depends on what media you subscribe to. Im personally into the more well researched news agencies and not random opinion bloggers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would argue that would cause false equivalence in the media. 
An a debate about climate change we pit the combined knowledge of 100 scientists against a single person who has nothing but his opinion and weigh them fairly.

       But that's not really what I'm talking about. I will downvote any of these semi-political-meta-conspiracy threads not because I'm a paid off government shill but because I come to r/conspiracy to read about things like Dyatlov pass, Tamam Shud, UFO's and the like.

And the other half is a bunch of crackpot over the moon paranoia.

       To be honest, I think the majority of people have been into American politics for the last decade or so because it's has been very comical. First with Bush and now Trump it's like watching a surreal reality TV show.
      </p>

       The minority are into American politics because what you guys do DOES make a big impact on other countries, no doubt! So it makes sense to stay informed.

       It is not half and half. I have been here for years and this site has historically been a bastion of liberal and libertarian thought. Only in the last few years have conservatives began to make a voice for themselves on Reddit.

       Trump supporters are a minority, but I do believe they are not as small as some people like to think.

       or, possibly, you underestimated how many former "liberal and libertarian" Reddit users were more centrist, turned to Trump after having our candidate illegal and immorally stolen from us to prop up a corrupt warmongering hack. That we'd refuse to participate and come back to a party that reeks of corruption, did nothing to fix it besides "oh this is a private organization", and is who's antithetical to the whole "anticorruption, anticorporpation and antimeritocracy that many people despise.

       you literally called me a libertarian because of my username. No other indication of my post would say anything about my political beliefs besides my disdain for how the DNC was manhandled by the Clinton campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       fiscal policy is awesome. finally can afford to open up my storefront in town with the new tax proposals. probably be able to provide 2-3 30k a year jobs, pretty good for a town of 5k, and county of 15k.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, I hope national concealed carry is passed. can't wait to visit back home and actually be able to have a gun. so tired of walking the piss smelling streets of southern California, getting harassed by cholos and the homeless, unarmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       deficit doesn't mean shit to me, it's all debt currency anyway. If this shortfall even has a chance of cutting some of our outrageous spending, or better yet, removing the fed, I'm good with it. if not we can always QE as always. I'm good with military spending so I'll just cut you off there.
      </p>
      <p>
       but keep name calling and getting upset because people are adults and don't fit into your bubble.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, it's not about not voting certain parties. it's about some of us remembering Hillary Clinton, how much of a crooked snake she's always been her whole career, the constant corruption both prior and after her husband's election, and then the icing on the cake-burying Bernie.

       that's calling out a user name, which can be anything. you don't know if I'm actually a libertarian or if you're actually Gob bluth, but I didn't mention or make an assumption over that and how it relates to your assumed world view.

       In no way do I deny that happened but I’ve been on Reddit since 2007 and the demographic has always been left-leaning with a hint of libertarianism.   Paying people to post leftist content on here is a total waste of money, IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s also worth noting there’s a high amount of Russian-backed right wing propaganda posted on Reddit too.  Russian twitter bot @GOP_Ten had dozens of top posts on r/The_Donald with at least 5-12k upvotes on each post.

       @GOP_Ten was literally named in Mueller’s indictment last week, and you can easily search T_D for posts from that account.  But persist in your fantasy realm if you so desire.  This sub is supposed to be about seeking the truth even if it may be an affront to your partisan misgivings.

       My very first comment you replied to said I in no way deny the CTR presence, but wanted to note there is an equal but opposite right wing bot/propaganda farm effort here on Reddit.  Some people here (like you apparently?) seem incapable of understanding there is both.  You also seem to have failed a basic reading comprehension of what I posted.  I’d like for you to re-read this thread and I see no reason to respond further.

       Appreciate this comment &amp; took the time to look through the links you provided.  The funny thing is it was obvious just from reading the original comment of his here that he is a partisan troll with an agenda.  What's weird about browsing reddit in 2018 is not knowing if he's just your standard 16yr old 4chan edgelord or a paid troll of potentially foreign origin.

       In order for your theory to work, you need a ton of people leaving their echo chambers and going into the subreddit's they disagree with to passionately try and argue with people that won't agree with them.  So much of the behavior on here is very Trollish or off-topic enough that it tries to dilute the stream.  I think it's easier to stomach that there's a few people controlling a bot farm or whatnot, than it is to suggest that the people of Reddit are Trollish by nature.

       When people do try this, they are typically banned from that sub. When trying to 'debate' the 'other side' they usually take offense, call it arguing or bashing, and then ban you.

       I’m not sure what you getting at.  I don’t necessarily agree with your assumption on banning, but assuming that this sub is banning people at a high rate, what do you think has caused the high amount of comments that are from people that this isn’t their natural world view and/or are antagonistic in nature. Wouldn’t that suggest that there’s either a bot farm that just gets new accounts or that there is a higher than previous amount of people willing to cross over the line?

       The OP was saying we should not fall into "blue vs red" style in-fighting here in r/conspiracy, and I agree. Both sides stink/stank/stunk and will stink.
      </p>
      <p>
       You argue that T_D's are marginalized on other subs, etc. So you disagree with the OP? You think that r/conspiracy should be a battle ground for "blue vs red" style in-fighting?

      <p>
       I've downvoted you, not because maybe you hold pro-Trump sentiments (I hate pro-Hillary sentiments, not people, just as much). But because you fail to put your comment in the light of the points made by the OP: this is not a place for "blue vs red" style in-fighting.

       So you think that this sub should be a blue-red battle ground? Please say it out loud. Because now it seems you are trying to hijack the thread about "let's stop in-fighting" with exactly just that.

       I've been ruthlessly filtering political subs from my front page, and just as you've described, this shit is seeping out into every other normal subreddit as well. Then I have to wonder, "do I filter
       <a href="/r/AdviceAnimals">
        /r/AdviceAnimals
       </a>
       now?" etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       ... and even with all my filters,
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       almost never shows up in the first few pages. There's definitely some shenanigans going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upvoting/downvoting is definitely cancer, if the goal of a discussion board is to avoid being overtaken by shills and trolls and astroturfers. It's far too easy to suppress dissent and completely take over a given subreddit. Or if that doesn't work, they can always take over a mod account and start erratically removing good content just to frustrate legit participants.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all its warts and user-unfriendliness, I have yet to find anything as good as 4chan for unsuppressed discussion. There are plenty of shills but they don't have the power to simply downvote things into oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a fan of purely technical solutions, but somebody definitely needs to create a new forum that utilizes proof-of-work or some kind of web of trust to prevent bad actors from so easily spamming and astroturfing the fuck out of it.

       want us to see every day redditors as some disadvantaged group don't you...  Poor poor trump and his supporters.  It's so awful that people are upset with what they are pushing.  It's so terrible that people don't like racism or class warfare.  It's so terrible that people don't like people taking out debt in their names to give to the 1% while cutting benefits for the poor.

       You want the conspiracy?  It's people like this trying to undermine people being upset with their government.  Posts like this push the line of complacency with the government.  "Supporters good, dissenters bad"

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The term originates in the systematic psychological manipulation of a victim by her husband in the 1938 stage play Gas Light, known as Angel Street in the United States, and the film adaptations released in 1940 and 1944. In the story, a husband attempts to convince his wife and others that she is insane by manipulating small elements of their environment and insisting that she is mistaken, remembering things incorrectly, or delusional when she points out these changes. The original title stems from the dimming of the gas lights in the house that happened when the husband was using the gas lights in the flat above while searching for the jewels belonging to a woman whom he had murdered. The wife correctly notices the dimming lights and discusses the phenomenon with her husband, but he insists that she just imagined a change in the level of illumination.
       </p>
       <p>
        The term "gaslighting" has been used colloquially since the 1960s to describe efforts to manipulate someone's perception of reality. In a 1980 book on child sexual abuse, Florence Rush summarized George Cukor's Gaslight (1944) based on the play and wrote, "even today the word [gaslighting] is used to describe an attempt to destroy another's perception of reality."

       That's not where the term "Fake News" comes from.  It was coined way before that by Craig Silverman (from Buzzfeed of all places), after he discovered 140+ news sites coming from Veles, Macedonia who were profiting off the facebook ad revenue for creating controversial, with-out-evidence new articles.

       I'm usually skeptical of things when I post here, I also have posted on other conspiracy/alt news sites, have been doing so for years. I constantly get accused of being a "shill" for asking questions that should, if the theory I am questioning is legitimate, have a clear answer. I frequently get called a "shill".
      </p>
      <p>
       I have come to the conclusion that the people yelling "shill" are unable to tell a "shill" from an honest poster.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if I were involved with Dr. They or whoever the last place I would pay for shilling would be r/conspiracy. You're never going to change anyone's mind or influence anyone here.

       Good trolls are hard or impossible to differentiate from real users. This is why the technique is so powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the trolls are used to seed and repeat the narrative constantly and build up enough momentum that it becomes the most popular opinion.

       No it isn't, words mean things. A troll refers to one type of person, a shill something completely different. The two types of people engage in completely different behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can one person do both things? Sure, just as a tennis player can also play basketball. That doesn't make Wimbledon and The NBA Finals the same game.

       It just so happened that your list is specifically of one political ideology.  How weird.

       Because the thread topic is literally about how peoples' obsession with individual political ideology is making this subreddit shitty, which you then immediately do.

      <p>
       You might notice that the person you're replying to didn't specify a purposefully catered list that details only a few politically minded organization while serendipitously also leaving out other politically minded organizations that do the same thing in this community.  Also weird.

       CTR and Shareblue are effectively the same thing, the former evolved into the latter, so that's one item that had a Democratic lean.  I don't know of an equivalent group on the Republican side that has the same modus operandi, do you? Otherwise I would've listed that too.

       You started this "political debate" dude, in a weirdly energetic and frantic way. I made a comment reply supporting someone else's top level comment.  I provided the names of specific groups that do what he said.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're misinformed or you don't understand what those groups I listed are, and what they do, and how they do it.  They are completely different than Fox News and Breitbart.  But again, you are completed ignoring that I mention the fucking CIA a JTRIG hand are saying I'm political?(!). You need to read up on them, take a breather, and think of all this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was simply providing a little context to the comment I was replying to.  I did not start a political argument, if that was the goal, I would have made a top level comment and I would not have mentioned anything about CIA or JTRIG.  You went off the rails with this "political argument".  Sorry man, unless someone else here chimes in, I'm done replying.

       I listed Correct The Record because they literally did what the comment I replied to said is the problem with this sub: astroturfing.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correct_the_Record">
        From Wikipedia
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Correct the Record was a super PAC founded by David Brock. It supported Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.
        <strong>
         The super PAC aimed to find and confront social media users who posted unflattering messages about Clinton and paid anonymous tipsters for unflattering scoops about Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump,
        </strong>
        including audio and video recordings and internal documents.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Fox News and Breitbart (as you mentioned) are not super PACs that literally paid shills to troll and astroturf social media sites like Reddit.
       </strong>
       Please, inform me and everyone else of any similar  social media manipulation group that you know of, regardless of political affiliation. CTR was not simply a "politically biased news outlet", as you are saying the groups you and I listed are.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        And again, you fail to acknowledge the 2
       </strong>
       <strong>
        <em>
         apolitical
        </em>
       </strong>
       <strong>
        and covert intelligence community operations I mentioned, and the significance as to why.
       </strong>
       You're the one who keeps seeing "sides" and seeing things through political eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry dude, you calling me a hypocrite is not cool, when you were throwing shade from the start, locked in to your idea that my comment was political when I was literally telling you that was not my intent, and explaining why. Had to address that.  I wish you the best in this crazy journey through life. Over and out.

       The point I'm about to make is
       <em>
        hypothetical
       </em>
       , meant to demonstrate the feasibility of a conspiracy, not provide evidence for the existence of one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that
       <a href="http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2017/msu-scholars-find-21-trillion-in-unauthorized-government-spending-defense-department-to-conduct/">
        over $20 trillion are missing
       </a>
       from Department of Defense records.  How much do 100,000 full-time shills cost at $100/hour, you may ask? $20 billion/year, which is 1/1000th of the missing money.  Theoretically, they would each have no idea of each other's existence and wouldn't need to know the ultimate goals they serve.  They probably wouldn't know they who they work for at all.  Up it to $1000/hour (enough money such that you could keep a secret) and we're still talking about 1% of the missing money per year of this hypothetical program.

       The people who hire these PR trolls (shills) are specifically LOOKING to make it so there's nowhere to gather for anyone who's not giving into the fake social media peer-pressure ("racist!!1") and continuing being a zombie. The only way to gather is sites that don't appear on the news, those are the only ones with real seeming people that aren't afraid of saying maybe the Anti-Trump folks are a bit crazy now. Like imgur.

        <p>
         voat.co - mostly people from the_donald and similar who got fed up with the censorship "glitches".  Then they had to deal with spam and bots, etc so now they have as many rules as reddit

         empeopled.com - a neat idea where you got actual bitcoin for people liking and sharing your posts and comments.  it is currently being "re-imagined" in the blockchain, whatever that means.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         votable.com - reddit-like site that had a good but small community.  it is now shutdown.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         minds.com - kinda reddit and facebook merged where you earn points that you can use to promote your posts.

       Debate.com seems interesting. R/politicaldiscussion is also civil and with good discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was really surprised a while ago when I found Kiwi Farms. On the surface it's a site that's trolling people on the internet. But I stuck to it and found some really eye opening and interesting discussion on all kinds of topics. Even about conspiracies. I wouldn't have believed it, so I'd understand if you thought that I am crazy.

       WHY? That's asinine. You think every single politician is a terrible person? That's just misinformed. I love my rep, Jared Polis. I think Tulsi Gabbard is great too, and quite a few others.

       I know nuance requires more effort than sounding radical, but come on. And these super general threads that hate on the subreddit serve no good purpose, imo. If you don't like it, make it better! Start a good thread. peace

       My first attempt at opening a discussion was pretty much shot down by a total of 2/3 redditors. Only 1 friendly comment, and the gist of it was "we'll never know... it's best to not get wrapped up in speculation."

       You should know that some of us use RIF app and there's an option to hide posts that have been downvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have this option turned on and very routinely downvote posts to hide them, not knowing what content they contain, nor even caring. I mostly use this feature on smaller subs to hide the useless posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit voting is broken, nobody uses it as intended... My wish would be for a feature to hide votea, would definitely go a long way to making me enjoy coming back here...

       It's an option that allows me to use Reddit in a, way that works for me. Before, I would not even visit those subs, now I can actually keep up because of that wonderful feature.

       No one cares about fake internet points, the issue is that you contribute to even more censorship on a platform that was originally created to be a free place for discourse, especially in subs where downvoted items are hidden by default.

       Welp, you hit the nail on the head. This sub was an hourly read or recap for me up until The Great Pizza Caper, whereby suddenly a sub that used to offer a broad range of conspiracies both past and present suddenly turned into a propaganda hammer. If TPB blanketed this sub to push their own agenda,  it won't work on me because I simply don't invest in this sub anymore. It sucks,  and it's been corrupted.

       I wish they never coined it pizzagate. Hard for the average person to even open mindedly look into it with a name like that. Then add how the msm handled talking about it. It's no wonder the average person thinks it's nutso. I've shown a few of my friends the info on PG. Never pushed a narrative or my option. Gave them the info and it's up to them to decide if it's legit or questionable. All of them seemed to be disgusted by it and did say that it should have been looked into Atleast.

        it saddens me as a critical thinker that this sub is at its lowest point in its history.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is the problem with a lot of conspiracy theorists. You claim to be critical thinkers but then reject anything mainstream solely because it is mainstream. Wouldn't a critical thinker evaluate everything individually instead of making blanket rejections because something belongs to a category?
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to be really into conspiracy theories but became disillusioned when I realized that most people would buy into anything that contradicted the mainstream and be dismissive of anything that came from the mainstream. So what I've seen in this sub is a lot more people start to apply their critical thinking to not only mainstream claims but also to conspiracy theory claims, and I think that's a good thing. It might make this place less fun but it does make it more critical which is supposed to be the point.

       This is a fair point. Maybe not rejecting a msm piece outright but at least questioning it would be a fair compromise. Not all msm is 'fake news' as they would say.

       Probably because the whole of conspiracy has been used as a political weapon recently.  The whole Trump thing is clearly to blame.  He figured out how to include conspiracy people in his political speeches in a way that only Ron Paul has really tried before.  It sucks that he has dragged us down with him and now people respect us even less than before. Funny how the same people who fought against Bush during 9/11 are fighting for Trump like he's the savior right now.

       The real reason is the mods had a coup. A fake election was carried out here and new people instituted. A bunch of old and realistically trustworthy users were pushed out and banned.

       This sub is heavily manipulated now, when previously it was more of just being monitored with selective actions. In that respect, it is no different than T_D. The same group may be controlling both, but it's not due to authentic users, it's intentional manipulation.

       I remember coming to this sub during the boston bombing. That was really the golden age of the sub. No much quality. It fell apart when it become a right-wing cesspool during the election. I also became a communist so I can't really tolerate people pretending that left and right are 2 sides of the same coin just because they haven't read Marx yet

       Shills are running rampant on reddit. This week alone any comment contrary ot msm agenda(aka anti establishment and factual fiscussion) gets downvoted and russia. Troll gets thrown around a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats the state of western internet, aka US based sites. They cant manufacturw public opinion as internet gave everyone a voice, so they are now manufacturing everyones voice on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everysub now has russia crap fast tracked to front page, and any estishment comments or anything that can be taken as pro russian(because when dissecting lies and stating facts now is considered pro russian somehow) gets downvoted instantly. Used to be less subtle, like 7 downvotes. Not they are smarter, they start of with 1 or 2, then cascade into tens with comments. When you catch a real person, they dont disagree with the statement, but they dont fully support it. When its a shill or a bot its a simple source needed, or your a russian troll. Seriously, just about done with this site, front page is all agebda politics and lack of intelectualism is starting to get to me. All the subs filled with pilitical aligned posts, even thise that used to have rules against it, like adviceanimals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not on here to read constant lies and propoganda, and then being called a troll when I point out either hypocracies or lack of substancial or any evidence for the claims. I am not here for mindless identity politics and trump/russia hate of the msm. Yet there it is, all across reddit. I come to r/conspiracy to get away from it, where discussion feels more real, like yes there are whacj theories on here and attempts to djscredit, but where else is there left. Used to be nice here, but they(shills, bots, trolls) are invading here as well and its taining comment section and posting. If this is how corporate run america wants to fight the infomrarional cyber war of this 22nd century, its just loosing audience.

       To be fair, accusing someone of being a shill is a trend that was not only started by those paid by election campaigns/governments but also perpetuated by real users here.

       I voted for Hillary in 2016. I'm just a fucking normal, albeit liberal, Citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't tell you how many times my opinion was discounted here by posters because "lol, you voted for Hillary, you're a shill".
      </p>
      <p>
       I try to look into the posting history of people, but the entire point of the Russian influence campaign isn't that they do it themselves. The point is that they deliberately inflame tensions. Which means that their statements are lost, but the people they influence are genuine.

       some of the mods are actively censoring content too, most recently was a YouTube video about some bizarre and unexplainable anomalies in the Florida shooting.

       What happened? The 2016 election happened. Pizzagate Happened. T_D happened. Reddit sold out to advertisers, banned and censored fringe subs. Then they openly let groups like Media Matters in to clean up narratives and control discussions.

       Someone is dividing the people to keep us from uniting. There are all these bullshit extremes now. We all had our minor differences before but now its like everyone is grouped into polar opposite. I wish everyone would realize that above all we are not Liberals, Conservatives, or even Americans for that matter, we are just people. So stand together people don’t let the extremes define you and for fucks sake please think for yourself. I mean cmon this a goddamn conspiracy sub quit letting others define your beliefs.

       I agree with this. I remember a while back this sub sparked alot of my interest in what may actually be happening in the world. What about corporations with too much money or the shady dealings of the US military? What about how television saturates people in the desire to spend money on shit that will give us cancer or give us diabetes? What is reality and why does the government restrict things that make you question it? Why are plants and molecules illegal? Fuck the system even the phone I'm using can be a tool for someone to spy on me or extract my personal information.  There is a reason this sub changed and its because people asked too many questions. All of these big changes happened because people became more aware all of a sudden. Maybe.. maybe not. All I'm really trying to say is we nees to ask questions and spread consciousness.

       They are afraid we sheeple might find some truth and wake up.  They are afraid that If the people find the truth, they will revolt. They are afraid of loosing control.  Everything going on right now is because they are afraid and doing their best to kill anything that might have a shred of truth in it, like this sub. Too bad so sad for them way too many people are becoming aware  of some horrible things going on, especially in most governments.  They should be afraid...

       There seems to be a decline in the overall civility of Reddit. Not gonna speculate on the reasons why, but this is the third post/comment I've read this evening alone lamenting this. These "what happened to this place?" posts are becoming pretty common across a variety of subs I visit.

       Internet chat moderation has always and will always be a failed method of keeping discussion free and civil. It creates echo chambers and is a simple and effective method of censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until there is law against censoring free speech on the internet the same as in public we will continue to run into these problems. This issue has existed in IRC chats and exists now in subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moderators are simply people. And even the most good intentioned are still unable to separate themselves from their own biases, emotions, and desires.

       I know this was not a rule for the sub, but I'm just saying what I thought was fun about this subreddit a couple of years ago was talking about the "what ifs" about these conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stopped visiting this sub when I noticed that a majority of people posting conspiracies insisted that it was "the truth" and were not actually
       <em>
        discussing
       </em>
       it so much as "spreading the word".
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point it started to feel like people who responded should be feeding OP's delusion and not actually discus other possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is harmful two-fold. One, it's not a good way to talk about conspiracies. Two, it can keep other theories from forming based on other established theories. Seems very counterproductive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still visit from time to time, but it's not the same. I used to love just reading what people were talking about on here for hours.

       i think its not this sub, its reddit itself.  banning r/pizzagate and
       <a href="/r/rpizzagate">
        /r/rpizzagate
       </a>
       is a clear indicator that this is a toxic site.  its never the people, its always the system at fault (and the managers / handlers of reddit) and the fact that we still stick around is just the sign of our determination.

       The more I see something downvoted or a rush of trolls coming to detail a convo, the more I tend to believe or research what's being discussed.

       I mean throughout history the more they try to silence a topic the more widely it tends to be believed.

       I used to lurk here everyday for years and have tons of great comments full of information and content that I've saved but I only stop by from time to time now because of what became of the sub during Clinton's emails. At the beginning of this presidency, I came into a thread where the top comment was basically saying how Trump was going against the status quo by electing people to fix the system they got rich off of. I don't even.

       I joined this sub when there were less than 40,000 subscribers. Though I've never commented much, posted even less, I would never dream of posting anything today. I don't mind opposing opinions. but I DO mind being accused of being a shill. I DO mind my opinions being met with ignorance and name calling. This entire website is nothing like it used to be. 
There was a short period of time when the internet was available to everyone, yet there were no stupid people on the internet. That time has passed.

       I try to get discussions going with some of these posters and ops, I often don't agree with them. It's funny how rarely some respond. Alt accounts will respond sometimes to throw the conversation for another loop. sad sad sad.

        If you have too, then you see what I'm talking about. This sub really started to nose dive around the DNC leaks, Seth Rich, and most importantly.... The podesta emails in regards to 'pizzagate' it saddens me as a critical thinker that this sub is at its lowest point in its history. Just rantin' feel free to down vote to oblivion or discuss using our brains.

       You say all this shit then at the end criticize people for looking into a conspiracy. You are just another hypocrite partisan stooge with an account created right about when Fuhrer Clinton lost the election. It is you and your ilk that have ruined this once great sub.   That's why you were down voted. Just another partisan stooge creating another circle jerk post to clog up critical thought and push the MSN narrative.

       Thanks! Just read it.   I suppose I should have stated that latter half in suggest this subs went south around those specific events would be just my opinion, nothing else. Perhaps some cirmustantial evidence too, but that's not stone cold truth. My opinion ultimately. I'm not trying to push any specific narrative here and I do apologize if it's come off that way.

       Even if you disregard political motivations or systems of belief, there seems to have been a pretty significant fall in the average IQ around here.  The overall quality of spelling, grammar, and reading comprehension has plummeted over the last few years.

       Just made the edit.  That is just my opinion.  I'm not trying to convince anyone that a specific theory is or is not true. Just questioning how our community has lowered in quality overall and the sheer amount of arguing that happens here with no real wiggle room for friendly discussion or debate.

       This sub has gotten too political. Lot of the left (like in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       ) are linking here and saying shit like omg they hate America and believe you guys to be a bunch of T_D shills granted there are some here now, as well as left shills). So now it has turned into a political argument and the sub has lost its merit. This isnt about politics. Leave your agendas behind. This about people questioning things.

       What happened to real conspiracy discussions. Like Odessa, the fourth Reich, nazis in the Antarctic, lost civilizations which are now being found with technology and proven to be real (graham Hancock anyone?), mind altering drugs and the dreamscapes (Terence McKenna), ufology, skinwalker ranch, the fact that Robert Bigelow was on 60 minutes last year and flatly said aliens are fucking real and are here, the fact that he said that and is still being contracted by NASA to build inflatable expansions for the international space station, magick and chaos magik the people who practice that and say it's not only real but make MILLIONS from using it like Grant Morrison, the JFK docs that were never released, the fact that for decades we were warned by so many thinkers on the outside that we shouldn't fall for the crap that's obviously made to not only divide us but to distract you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that this post by /isjoshlive where he tries desperately to flail about the R and the L is nothing but the present NEWS of GEO-POLITICS and you're whining that people don't agree with you about politics, not discussing anything that will even remotely expand your mind or conciousness but simply keep you trapped in a panicked loop.

       A lot of those things aren’t conspiracies, they are just cool and fringe subjects. Like... mind altering drugs and the Terence McKenna and Dreamscapes aren’t a conspiracy. The political/financial takeover of the world by a small cabal of international elites is actually by far the most important conspiracy we can deal with. When people say the politics is just in the way of real conspiracies they are wrong, are that politics is just a show, they are wrong. The most important arena we have is against international finance and their conspiracy to take total power.

       Schools of higher thought being hidden from you are the very definition of a conspiracy. It’s disappointing that you can’t see that.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for international finance, if you really care and think it matters. Look up the town that holds the keys to trillions of dollars for families that have been that wealthy since Christ was born. Take total power? It’s been taken. Good luck taking it back, tell me how that and the rest of your mortal coils goes.

       yeah, totally agree. I would go as far as to say this post is exactly what's wrong with this sub. "hey guys aren't we sick of all the partisan bullshit on here" Then real quick with an edit at the end "by the way I totally believe in the partisan bullshit that ruined the sub in the first place".

       The way it's worded is manipulative, almost like it gives the reader no chance to think for themselves and paints you into a corner as far as believing in the pizza gate/seth rich "the left is Satan" meme.

       The problem with the election was trump took the stance of anti-establishment and the masses bought it. Just because we have conspiracies on hil dog and proof the left is a piece of shit, doesn't mean the right isn't. It's all bull guys. Yes there are people for the people out there but they never get close enough to the chair to do anything. That's the way is it. Illusion of choice. :(

       Maybe the sub could try discussing some interesting conspiracy theories once in awhile? All I ever see here is Hillary eating babies, Trump "is not being given a fair chance" , flat earth, chem trails, reptiles, Jews, Podesta is a pedo, and some stupid rock orbiting the planet is a Sumerian satellite. The bar doesn't seem to be set very high at all.

       This sub has gone been over-run by hyper-partisan sissy-boys.  The elite have succeeded in dividing us. They are laughing at us. I think Clintonian elites are bad for the country, I also think Donald J. Trump is bad for the country. Until everyone understands that, this sub will remain a hyper-partisan cesspool.

       Some of the things that are being argued against have been thoroughly debunked.  Example; The pizza parlor pedos.  The parlor didn't even have a basement.  Yet this keeps coming up.  It's junking up the sub for the more interesting, thought provoking ideas.

       Sometimes this place fills up with people from other subs, who all suffer from the Dunning-Kruger Effect. They really feel like they're too bright to be fooled by anyone conspiring against them, like nothing can get past them! It creates a massive cognitive dissonance in their brains, which makes their head feel like it's going to explode.

       I remember when Kathy Griffin did Thst photo of a beheaded trump and her defense was 'he broke me'   you know what broke me? The Podesta emails and how quickly this sub was attacked for digging, doing their own investigations into finding mass amounts of evidence albeit cirmustantial, that back it up. That broke me.  When a non partisan issue like child pedophila is mocked and ridiculed by people and the media alike. Ben swan was doing  the people's work. How's he doing nowadays anyways?

       What the hell happened?
Well, reality beat conspiracies. People here didn't see and/or believe that the BIGGEST conspiracy since Aliens was done by Trump and Russians. If /conspiracy didn't see it, then they were incompetent.
And this sub has been heavily poisoned by Russians.
Yes it has. It is actually one of Russians favorite propaganda/disinformation form, they used it already during Cold War. 
I noticed this here first 2013. And then started to do some digging and find Alexander Dugin. He is notorious nut head BUT Putin send him to Turkey to negotiate on behalf of him.
When I've tried to talk about this ie here, Russian bots attacked to downvote it and do ad hominem etc stuff. Then I knew I was right.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't actually "secret", if you read his stuff, it's all there. Just look at Alex Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember when 80% of the stuff here was anti-Hillary? And who might have been behind that? Russian trolls have a tendency to gather special nut heads behind them, altright was not a accident.
      </p>
      <p>
       So shortly: this sub was blind to the real conspiracy and people flew away. It's like you find out that your doctor is actually plumber who has fake diploma on the wall. 
Russia really killed "anonymity" and make it a bad word.
Oh and Snowden... there he laughs with Putin to all of you fools
and is partly shamed that his people, Americans, are so f-king easy to fool around. Education perhaps? Or good damn hipsters?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, anonyms talking about conspiracies doesn't sound quite healthy. And it ain't.

       Fluoride dumbs down the population and actually lowers IQ. Add carcinogens, BPA/BPS, etc.. and you got a controlled populace that is easily manipulated. Hitler did in WW2 and is now common practice in the most critical economy in the world: America.

       I upvoted you OP, fwiw... Brigading on this sub has been insane the last few days... I'm talking about objective comments been downvoted to -32. That's the level of hypocrisy we have on reddit... They preach all about safe spaces, but shitting on this sub is totally fine. Admins know, they don't care.
      </p>
      <p>
       To regulars, it's pretty obvious (hence your post). My guess is that there is huge pressure with all this indictment stuff going on to drive the Russia narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to believe there's some hope, reddit will die eventually as it has become unbearable due to obvious propaganda. Decentralization is the future, and these controlled spaces will hopefully become obsolete. Don't apologize... Fuck politicians and bankers, we've had enough of their shit and hopefully they will too become obsolete.

       I do get frustrated when trying to discuss an idea or concept and the conversation somehow becomes about the people (i.e. politicians) that are tangentially involved, turning the discussion into a pissing contest of which person is of superior character or has the best track record or blah blah blah.

       CGP Grey has a great video that shows how people naturally devolve into this kind of debate, where the issues cease to matter and it just becomes 'my guy vs. your guy'.

       Trump becoming president made people go crazy so now everything is about politics. There used to be posts on here about aliens, secret societies, paranormal and all that now its all political unless you sort by new, but those posts I’m referring to don’t get uprooted anymore.

       Anyone remember the wave of firstnamelastname accounts (danielatlers, ameliagates etc etc) that popped up around the election? Just general run of the mill sounding names. They stopped being used because I think they were obviously being spotted to easily (no one uses firstnamelastname as a username for reddit unless you are promoting yourself). They would just post prepared comments based on trigger words, and a lot of the time the replies were out of context. It was really obvious something was going on.

       There's no open-minded debate on the Trump conspiracy, because one side thinks that it's all made up by the Deep State, FBI, and Hilary Clinton to make Donald Trump look bad. They can orchestrate a conspiracy so secret and complete- but oh no, they're thwarted by two FBI agents' texts! Oops!

       My conspiracy; donald trump was a DNC mole sent in as a republican candidate to shake the base. They had no idea he would grow as fast as he did and certainly didn't expect him to win. I believe he hit a point of popularity where he went rogue for his own gain and it paid off tremendously.

       Part of the reason is the large population of "skeptics" who routinely come here to start arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've noticed similar types of things with athiests lurking in religion forums and starting arguments, but then banning anyone arguing in their own athiest forums.
      </p>
      <p>
       then there is a coup de tat that occurred here recently. it's all very hush hush but something BIG happened, mods were 'retired' and things are now 'different'

       Samething happened in abovetopsecret. Armies of assholes misdirected and discouraged real discourse. Anothe shill tatic:  flood the boards with endless political drivel. Then you had the anointed experts who jumped on any speculatory posts and bashed the op into oblivion. Now that sites completely fucked. Its all shills shilling the other shills. Alot like this sub

       Just commenting here to mention I made a post regarding this political / mainstream leaning like a month ago. At the time I wasn't even familiar with the whole mass infiltration of botnets but I could see something is up. They are clouding the water (which lets me honest was already cloudy).

       There's a ton of money being thrown around for political shilling. Whole subs have been subverted. Unbelievably for me, I actually have a fair amount of faith in the mods of this sub. Not much they can do about content, that's our job. I've noticed they apply the rules in a manner that benefits genuine conspiracy interested people most times though, which is cool. If you want more conspiracy content, and are sick of seeing shill/normie comments and voting, then be the change you want to see. Stick up for people in the comments, upvote stuff even if it seems pointless, and post stuff that isn't political. Rant off. For now.

       It was gaining a lot of traction when all of a sudden a while bunch of best posts got removed or deleted.

       Pretty sure I caught some sort of weird shadow removal too. My comment shows up in my comment history with no notice of removal and all the comments around it showing removed or deleted. I can't find my comment in the original thread or just about anybody else's including the best comment:

       I see these posts more often now which is great news for this sub but there's always a couple things that irk me. To imply that there is no mystery surrounding Seth Rich's death is pretty ridiculous, and it doesn't take a genius to make a correlation with his untimely, strange, unexplainable, pointless and seemingly random death with the DNC and the leaked documents. That's all I have to say about that. No one will ever know if he was murdered for leaking DNC documents, but I definitely don't think its outlandish to make that claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, if you've been on this sub for several years, as I have, and its so obvious to you that politics are rigged in the US and that politicians are fucked up people, why is it so hard for you to consider that Seth Rich's murder may have been related to this phenomenon? Futhermore, why is the concept of pizzagate so outlandish? I mean until people started turning pizzagate into some partisan political bullshit, it was basically adding seemingly real evidence for the types of shit we were already suspecting of politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not really interested in debating over it, to be honest. Both of those subjects are so long gone by now that there's just no point. I just wonder why so many people keep coming here saying things like "what happened to my old
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       where politicians were bad regardless of party" and then in the same breath, "this Seth Rich shit is such utter bullshit."

       Anti-MSM is the definition of closed-mindedness. People use it as a way of deminishing articles they disagree with, regardless of citations and accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Open-mindedness requires critical thought. Anti-MSM #fakenews screeching is not being open-minded. It is the opposite.

       Lol your account is just 1 year 4 month old. How do you know anything about how this sub was? In any case you are the one shilling and astroturfing here. The DNC leaks, Seth Rich and Pizzagate is what real conspiracies are all about.

       Because I can only have this account to be able to  read and lurk on this sub right? Come on dude. Now you're suggesting I could be a shill? I post on conspiracy, roast me, and the Big Brother sub. No not that big brother the reality show big brother. Good try though.

       I edited my post (edit5)  I completely agree with you. Those alone Imo truly killed this sub. I men Reddit killed the pizzagate sub. No better way to make me feel we were all on the right track than to shut us down. With subs for UFOs and flat earth being no issue at all, but pizzagate is loony and doesn't merit discussion or investigating? We have more evidence to support pizzagate than flat earth that's for damn sure.  Keep fighting my friend!

       Hey. I don't give a shit how many times this topic gets posted. It started actual conversation on this sub for a change. I'm glad to see a lot of us are still here even in this subs current state. I won't message a single mod here. What a waste of time. This is the same spot that shut down discussion on child trafficking conspiracies that were not deemed appropriate for some reason.  Thank you all, trolls and intellects alike for actually engaging in conversation.

       Definitely getting tired of all the labels people are throwing around. Instantly shuts down any debate and all of your opinions and everything about you is automatically assumed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read about pizzagate, looked at the evidence, but to me I just don't believe it since there's too many fill in the blanks and what-if arguments. I need hard evidence to believe such a thing, and a solid explanation why the authorities aren't acting on it since apparently there's so much evidence. Since that's my opinion that makes me a marxist communist lefty nutjob that only watches rachel maddow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I started loving this sub before because it's a melting pot of opinions which was a good source of discussion I would read at work. Alas my American friends are so polarized it's hard to find a conversation that doesn't instantly get combative.

       For sure. Would be great if it all lead to some arrests and exposure of those guilty. There's so much time and effort going behind this one case though... it's a terrifyingly real issue and I feel like we could use the resources a bit wiser. Makes me sad thinking about all the cases that aren't in the spotlight and are probably a lot more provable.

       What I noticed about the PG thing. There are some legit pieces of cirmustantial evidence and other that are stretching. Example: James Elaphatis Instagram. Stretching:  James Elaphatis is French for I love children.   Circumstantial:  the mugshot of Magdalene McCain's potential abductors being dead ringers for the Podesta brothers.  Stretching: video of comet ping from across the street of kids yelling.    It's murky waters we're swimming in here.

       It’s completely obvious what happened to this sub. There’s more paid shills in here than there are organic users. There are an unbelievable amount of people in this sub who’s job is to immediately try to discredit any conspiracy, push the narrative back towards the mainstream, and emotionally shame people who question the official story. That’s what this sub is now.

       I was referring to Hillary, but she and Bill are pretty similar on most issues (She’s more hawkish on FP and he’s not quite as liberal on social issues). He tried to pass universal healthcare and was blocked by Newt’s congress.

       Completely and consistently baffling to me why people keep trying to reduce THE conspiracy of our time, unraveling and unfolding right before us, to 'yawn, partisan bickering, I'm just so OVER it all, you know?'. Or better still, 'that's just the narrative, mannnn, now upvote my post about how the struggling  population of honey bees in North America on Sept 11 2001 means their (((honeybee queen))) orchestrated the collapse of building 7, or I'm gonna call you out as the shill you are! Why are you being so close minded, and mean, I researched it! Me! Some asshole you've never met sourcing personal blogs you've never heard of! Why can't I just ask questions???'
      </p>
      <p>
       Just say you don't care about politics, but don't try to act like it's because 'politics as usual' are to blame. what's going down right now is historic in its scope and depth.
      </p>
      <p>
       ..I know you didn't ask, but what bothers me the most about Trump is the ridiculous double standards. Remember when Obama was unamerican because his radical pastor said god DAMN America with the traitorous, sinister flop sweat only a leftist preacher can produce? It's settled then, FOX news told us, Obama is clearly a commie. After all, everyone knows that you are the company you keep!
      </p>
      <p>
       ..Keeping that in mind, let's look behind the door marked Trump's inner circle: Russian oligarchs and the international political puppets who love them, white nationalists, foreign bank notorious for facilitating money laundering of Russian oligarchs...
      </p>
      <p>
       'You know what, lets not go into that', the Trumpists say, 'they're all deep state plants installed by Hilary clearly.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Which brings me to Hilary! Argh! FUCK this conniving bitch, she's always one step ahead. She can install her people around Trump, who then gain his trust, but then publicly undermine him and his GOD GIVEN authority, and make his life a living hell from the shadows. She can also have killed whoever she wants basically, and even do it personally when her urges get the best of her. But this bitch gets away with it, Every. Single. Time.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then I gotta watch her sipping Chianti, laughing  at OUR PRESIDENT on the Stephen Colbert  show alongside Scottie Pippen, another guest who's just another perennially salty runner-up in his own right? It's all just too much for THIS patriot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I heard this bitch can wipe the memory banks of any Republican congressmen brave, some may say foolish enough to stand up to her, killing any chance of a thorough investigation.
Shes the most ambitious, ruthless psycho in a generation, but take heart! Behold her fatal flaw. She can't rig an election for herself. She just can't do it! That's the hard limit to her power. Some say fucking with the electoral process is against her twisted personal ethical code, kinda like Dexter. Others say the actual raw patriotic, CHRIST-POWERED  democratic force the ballot booth exudes repels and weakens her. Whatever the reason, I'm just relieved to tell you this bitch got a weakness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I digress. Anyway Flynn, Manafort, Bannon, are all, as the Trumpists will tell you breathlessly, are obstacles to Trump's vision for america! So what they turned out to be shitty people, who really KNOWS a man anyway?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tldr: Trump is great! He's just apparently the worst judge of character of all time, but man my stocks are singing a sweet song right now. MAGA

       just my 2 cents.
      </p>
      <p>
       a lot of people with very strong political opinions/agendas come here because it allows them to say things like:
      </p>
      <p>
       "everyone hates &lt;insert political figure here&gt; but its really just a massive conspiracy"
      </p>
      <p>
       they would post these things to other subs and probably do, but those subs are even more massive echo chambers so they feel like it will give them more exposure here.

       Just to add my two cents, it's sentiments like this that keep people from voting.  Between gerrymandering and disillusionment with the democratic process, our government will continue to fail us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have the opposite message as you (I think): Vote.  Get other people to vote.  Get involved with politics in your local community (without getting shot at if you live in a district unwelcome to this kind of stuff). For those with the time, energy, and willingness to get yelled at or worse, have discussions with people and set up booths with information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying your vote doesnt count or that the electoral system of government is rigged DOES NOTHING for your cause.  I know so many people who said "both candidates are bad" and "my vote doesn't matter".... and here we are!  You might not see immediate change (or maybe you will), but voting DOES matter.  Look at Virginia's last elections.  Feel free to disagree with me.  I will continue to back up this argument.

       Hmm. I wonder how his comment is upvoted if this sub is "basically T_D." I see this time and again, over and over. Claims like this are immediately debunked by the number of upvotes, and the users don't seem to understand the contradiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I might be literally the only liberal in this entire sub who admits that this sub is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a Trump cirlcejerk. In most threads, the people getting upvoted in the comments are the ones speaking out against trump. The people getting upvoted are the ones saying "This sub is so controlled by Trump supporters." Then how do those comments get upvoted? They usually respond by claiming it's because the thread made it to
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , but we see anti Trump comments at the top of threads that aren't even the top post in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we can talk about anti-Trump submissions. These do really well in this sub, which I will prove below. Guess what the excuse is? people claim the submissions were upvoted so high because they were on
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       . Oh really? How did the post make it to
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       in the first place if this sub is "controlled by Trump supporters?"
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot more than this, but this is what I could dig up from a quick search. Notice you never see anyone claim "this sub is a T_D circlejerk" in any of the anti-Trump threads. They just pretend these threads don't exist and continue with the anti-
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       propaganda, which is usually heavily upvoted in here for some reason. A lot of people in here hate this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pay close attention to the upvote percentages.

       If you check the comments of supposedly "pro-Trump" posts, anti-Trump comments reign supreme. There's nothing really wrong with that, but the people claiming this sub is one giant pro-Trump conspiracy are deluding themselves. Some people try to claim all of this is explained because this or that post hit
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , but that's complete bullshit. Posts that don't hit
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       are also very anti-Trump in the comments. Anti-Trump posts also couldn't hit
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       in the first place if they weren't heavily upvoted in this sub before they reached
       <a href="/r/all">

       , I'll show you a thread that is below a 1000 with anti-Trump comments. In fact, many of the posts above never made it to
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all

       That's the thing, I'm a very
       <strong>
        very
       </strong>
       anti-Hillary person. I'm also a very
       <strong>
        very
       </strong>
       anti-Trump. I find myself more at odds with the Hillary supporters though because for all the talk about how bad Trump supporters are, I see an incredible number of Hillary supporters acting worse. I see them far more than I see Trump supporters. That wouldn't even be a big deal if it weren't accompanied by them talking non-stop about Trump circle jerks and how Reddit hates minorities and women. Reddit is by and large a very liberal place. As a centerist who leans slightly more left than right, it would even work for me. But the constant act as if they are under attack for seeing an opinion that differs is infuriating. Then you glance at the votes, and they are upvoted while dissenting opinions are downvoted into oblivion. There is basically a demand for confirmation bias, and an almost total lack of self awareness politically, and while neither side is immune or remotely free of it, the left here on Reddit seems to really be championing that cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hope would be that we could understand that political affiliations ultimately don't matter in a sub like this. People should understand that neither their nor the opposition's party is good or trustworthy, but instead we get a constant cycle of both attacking the other side while defending something that is ultimately indefensible. It almost seems that we are at a saturation point with partisanship.

       I would explain my side of things and show supporting evidence. After that it would be out of my hands. There'd still be people talking about it but they were going to talk regardless. At least that way my supporters would have concrete proof from me explaining my side of things.

       So why isn't there a conspiracy that both Hillary and Trump are garbage? Why does one just "have" to be the "good guy"?

       Hillary is corrupt, therefore Trump is not? It seems odd for this subreddit to blindly trust any person with as much power as a president.

       Right they get huge boners when they hear about pedophiles getting exposed, and that's a bad thing? Or do you believe pizzagate is somehow boiled down to a restaurant in DC? Roy Moore is a legit pervert predator, but it also turned out to be true that she faked the signature... So what then? By the way i dont give two shits about this roy moore guy. He was just a way to take the attention off bigger fish getting the limelight shone upon their misdeeds and sexual deviancy...

       One wrong comment in r/"politics" or any of the 15+ anti-Trump subs pushed daily to the front page and you are banned for life. Why do people like you continually pretend it only happens on TD?
      </p>
      <p>
       And how delusional are you where you think a subreddit named after Donald Trump and formed as a pep-rally for his presidential run, would allow you to enter and shit all over the person the sub is dedicated to?

       You cannot do that in ANY sub dedicated to any subject. This concept is so simple that a kindergarten kid could understand it.

       Maybe read the rules of a sub before posting in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, there aren't rules about down voting just because the users history or you disagree with what they said. The point of down voting was always to encourage higher quality commentary to be at the top of the page. That can't exist when armies from either side just go on the attack without wanting to actually engage the other person.

       I can understand that point of view, but I think attempting to assassinate the President carries great risk and could even potentially expose the NWO to the general public. Perhaps they see that as a last resort and would rather try to conrol him, contain him, impeach him, or otherwise suppress him first. Or maybe he really is just another puppet, but I find that hard to believe based on the leaked emails and other thing.

       You started this "political debate" dude, in a weirdly energetic and frantic way. I made a comment reply supporting someone else's top level comment.  I provided the names of specific groups that do what he said.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're misinformed or you don't understand what those groups I listed are, and what they do, and how they do it.  They are completely different than Fox News and Breitbart.  But again, you are completed ignoring that I mention the fucking CIA a JTRIG hand are saying I'm political?(!). You need to read up on them, take a breather, and think of all this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was simply providing a little context to the comment I was replying to.  I did not start a political argument, if that was the goal, I would have made a top level comment and I would not have mentioned anything about CIA or JTRIG.  You went off the rails with this "political argument".  Sorry man, unless someone else here chimes in, I'm done replying.
