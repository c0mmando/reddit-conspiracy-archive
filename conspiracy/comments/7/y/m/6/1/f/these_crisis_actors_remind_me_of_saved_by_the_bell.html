    <div class="md"><p>Not sure how you date these things but where I live there was a school shooting in the 90&#39;s. I think it might have been one of the first in the modern era. In fact the first school massacre in the US was in 1764. Colombine is usually thought of as the first and that was 1999. What happened six years ago? The propaganda law was 2013 and that was just to bring it into the open. The government has used propaganda against the citizens for much longer than that, probably since the beginning. 
Are you talking about Obama? You think he invented school shootings? What are you talking about?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think Obama invented school shootings, but Aurora was the first of a long line of fake shootings and terror attacks that took place which started during his presidency. It was shortly followed by Sandy Hook which became more well-known and well-researched. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what I think about Columbine, but it seems to have an air of fabrication as well. For example there is a video of the police and/or EMT&#39;s dragging around a dummy on the ground on the scene. </p>

<p>After all, it was Obama&#39;s attorney general Eric Holder who met with Connecticut governor Ed Malloy weeks before Sandy Hook. Eric Holder is quoted as having said before, &quot;We need to do this every day and really <em>brainwash</em> people into thinking differently about guns.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing. I am not a fan of Obama because he signed the NDAA and said he did it regretfully. He talked about transparency and promised a change but then when he was in office he claimed sovereign immunity. He not only let Bush and Cheney get away with war crimes, but he also took steps to make anything the President does legal.<br/>
So I&#39;m not fan. He was a great speaker and he didn&#39;t embarrass the nation like Trump does on a daily basis, so I prefer Obama to Trump but I&#39;m not a fan of either.<br/>
Bush played the character of a moron, possibly drawing from the Ronald Reagan guide. When people think you&#39;re stupid and a &quot;regular guy&quot; you can get away with a lot. 
And Clinton had Waco, Ruby Ridge, Elian Gonzalez, and more. 
I&#39;m only saying all this so you know I&#39;m not biased against any particular administration. But to pick out Obama as the administration when any of this started is just not true.<br/>
I&#39;m not 100% sure that Reagan was shot by Hinckley, to name one big one. And the biggest conspiracy since JFK took place under the watch of George W. Bush.<br/>
If you want to somehow mark any of this as beginning with Obama I have to believe that you have some bias against him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The President of the United States of America is nothing more than a puppet. This was as true of Bush and Obama as it is about Trump. </p>

<p>When I say it &quot;began&quot; with Obama, all I&#39;m saying is that the long line of frequent faked terror attacked and shootings began in his administration. The first one was the Tucson shooting hoax where Gabby Gifford was said to be shot in the head, and then faked a brain injury to use for sympathy points to campaign for Hillary and gun control. This was in January 2011. The next was June 2012 in Aurora, and then of course Sandy Hook and it only snowballed from there. </p>

<p>I already said, I don&#39;t know if Tucson was the first fake deadly shooting. It probably wasn&#39;t. As I said there are suspicious elements to Columbine and Waco as well -- even going back to the Manson family murders, there seems to be an element of stagecraft and deception to all of this. </p>

<p>Obviously 9/11 took place during Bush and was more of a heinous false flag/ fabrication than any of these. </p>

<p>So no, I don&#39;t think Obama was masterminding any of this. I simply say that it began during his presidency. By &quot;it&quot; I mean this traveling circus of fake shootings. </p>

<p>And remember, the Las Vegas shooting which was also fake took place during Trump and it now has the title of &quot;deadliest mass shooting.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m no fan of Obama or his tranny wife. But I don&#39;t give him the credit of rolling out this plan. He was just the puppet who happened to be in office at the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, it just seems like a random place to say &quot;it&quot; started. I put &quot;it&quot; in quotes because I&#39;m not exactly sure how you&#39;d categorize the different things we&#39;re talking about and I don&#39;t (usually) think they&#39;re all the same thing. Meaning they are big events that we will never know the truth about. All may have happened as we were told, or none may have. There may be several different types and also degrees of deception. 
We won&#39;t ultimately agree because I can&#39;t call something &quot;fake&quot; when my personal knowledge of it is all based on things I saw on the Internet.<br/>
For example, I wouldn&#39;t call Waco &quot;fake&quot; but I think that lies were told about it. In the end it amounted to &quot;we burned those kids to death to save them from being molested.&quot; Of course it was about those people at the compound being religious fanatics and having an arsenal.<br/>
And the Ruby Ridge thing was similar in that those people were basically trying to escape from society. In both cases the people killed were religious fanatics who were trying to escape the reach of the government while still remaining within the borders of the US. So I sort of felt like maybe these things were messages to fringe people? And also the fact that they just killed all these people and then, in the case of Waco, Bill Clinton said, &quot;I take responsibility.&quot; 
Okay, if I mismanage some sort of action to the point that a bunch of people are burned to death and I &quot;take responsibility&quot; that would surely involve a life sentence? But it was treated like &quot;my bad&quot; and we all moved on.<br/>
I don&#39;t know what 9/11 was but the official story has so many flaws that I think people that believe it do so because they are afraid not to, and not in a conscious way. It&#39;s not that they think they&#39;re going to be dragged off to a FEMA camp. It&#39;s that a lot of people have this relationship with the government, the police, military, and religion that is like &quot;these people take care of me. They know what they&#39;re doing.&quot; It&#39;s like how children feel about their parents until you get to the age where you realize they are just people.<br/>
So I do understand better now. Thanks for answering the question. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s important to agree on everything. It&#39;s more important to test ideas. In the end I don&#39;t think we can ever really know the truth.</p>

<p>NEW YORK DAILY NEWS
Sunday, February 12, 2017, 7:00 PM
“Saved By the Bell” producer Peter Engel has suffered marital woes, drug problems, and professional roadblocks in his eight decades, but his biggest heartbreak?</p>

<p>“It was when JFK was assassinated,” Engel told Confidential. “I think our whole country changed the day he got shot.”</p>

<p>The veteran producer – who’s written a memoir,” I Was Saved by the Bell: Stories of Life, Love, and Dreams That Do Come True” – volunteered to work on Kennedy’s campaign in his younger days, and became one of his handlers on his visits to New York City.</p>

<p>“They didn&#39;t have Secret Service in those days during campaigns,” he recalls. “We became his guys, taking him in and out of crowds. I was with him every time he was in New York.</p>

<p>Secret Service investigates woman for Trump assassination tweet</p>

<p>“I lost him in the crowd of a million people in the Garment District. My job was to get him into the car and he winked at me and walked into the crowd and I said, &#39;Oh my gosh, I&#39;ve lost him,&#39; and he came back and yelled in my ear, &#39;You&#39;ve got to have faith, kid.&#39;”</p>

<p>For the record, Engel doesn’t subscribe to the single gunman theory: “I felt it was definitely a conspiracy,” he says. “I believe there was a plot involving different shooters.”</p>
