       Like you can get imprisoned in Europe for this, why is it that people are labeled anti-semetic &amp; nazi-supporters instantly for merely being rational human beings and questioning things that research leads them to believe isn’t what they’ve been told all of their life. The fact that such a huge emphasis has been put into sheltering this event to such a degree has to be a huge red flag. Why does nobody see this? Also why is Israel’s atrocities to Palestine seemingly okay &amp; swept under the rug?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Also seeing this alot, it really disturbs me at how brainwashed the masses are, like on Reddit even questioning the 6 million number is considered off limits &amp; anti-Semitic hate speech that gets you downvoted no matter what.

So yes, its one of those super taboo topics and there definitely is a whole lot of lies behind WW2 and lot s of interested parties wanting to shut up people talking about it.

       Damnit, the other options would've been south-east asia or russia/former USSR.

       The thing with the holocaust is that the people that don't believe it, or at least most of it, are never people that lived in the places where the jews were taken or taken to. I'm Dutch, we have the evidence in front of our eyes. Half my city was bombed by the Germans because we refused to hand over our jews. My grandfather was a mailboy for the resistance, and the father of my other grandfather helped hiding jews through the local organisation of general practitioners. The thing is that my story is far from unique, everyone here literally knows or knew people (alot of them are old or dieing at the moment) who were there phisically, who've seen people being taken from their homes, who know many homes were uninhabited because the people who used to live there were shot or beaten to death, forced to work until they physically collapsed and died on the spot, or if they were lucky, gassed. There is just such an overload of physical and non-physical evidence here, that it is impossible to deny.

       We got screwed by Russians and welcomed Germans when they arrived here, at least that's what my grandparents told me. I never had any Jewish relatives or friends who were taken by Germans. I guess that just shows the true power of pick-and-choose documentaries and what it can make people believe.

       Ofcourse it is a matter of frame and discours, I'm just saying to everyone here (most of them americans), that it is really easy to type stuff about our history from your chair, and just like any other history it is written by the people who won, but don't underestimate the insane amount of evidence that is still alive and bleeding in the countries that were hit the hardest.

       Wait, who told you that? As someone who's been to both Auschwitz and Sobibor, they were very real and there is boatloads of evidence that they are. There have been samples taken and there is evidence. I assume you are not from Europe, and have never been to either of these places?

       red A. Leuchter is America's leading specialist on the design and fabrication of execution equipment, including homicidal gas chambers. In 1988, Leuchter scraped samples from the alleged gas chamber walls in Auschwitz, Birkenau and Lublin. Cyanide residue would be clearly evident on all these walls if gassings did occur. To his astonishment, Leuchter found no significant cyanide traces in any one of these rooms.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1991, the Polish government repeated these tests to disprove Leuchter's findings, but they as well found no evidence of any gassings ever occurring. The structural integrity of these "gas chambers" is also extremely faulty. These rooms have ordinary doors and windows which are not hermetically sealed! There are large gaps between the floors and doors. If the Germans had attempted to gas anyone in these rooms, they would have died themselves, as the gas would have leaked and contaminated the entire area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, no equipment exists to exhaust the air-gas mixture from these buildings. Nothing was made to introduce or distribute the gas throughout the chambers. There are no provisions to prevent condensation of gas on the walls, floors or ceilings. No exhaust stacks have ever existed.
Though six million Jews supposedly died in the gas chambers, not one body has ever been autopsied and found to have died of gas poisoning. We have been shown piles of bodies from World War II, but most of these persons died of typhus or starvation or Allied bombings and a great many of those were murdered Germans, not Jews. Roughly the equivalent of ten football fields should be packed full of gassed bodies to present as evidence, yet not one body has ever been discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Germans documented everything in meticulous detail from shrubbery to arbors, but no pre-war or wartime plans or documents exist that detail or even mention any gas chambers for reasons of genocide. All documents ever presented were drawn up AFTER the war.
Concerned at the impact of Leuchter's widely-circulated Report, the Auschwitz State Museum, a Polish government agency, commissioned the Institute of Forensic Research (Instytut Ekspertyz Sadowych) of Krakow to carry out its own investigation. The result: In a carefully worded six-page internal forensic report, the Institute's experts essentially replicated Leuchter's findings and implicitly corroborated his conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consistent with Leuchter's investigation, the Institute's specialists detected absolutely no traces of cyanide (or ferro-ferri-cyanide compound) in most of the plaster and brick samples taken from the alleged extermination gas chambers. Traces of cyanides were detected in eight samples, seven of which were rooms in Block 3 of Auschwitz main camp where -as the Institute's experts acknowledge - inmate clothing was disinfected by "gassing" with Zyklon. A barely detectable trace of cyanide compound was found in the eighth remaining "positive" sample, which was sample No. 15 from the alleged homicidal "gas chamber" in Krema building II in Birkenau. Significantly, this is the only sample taken from any of the supposed extermination gas chambers that showed any trace of cyanide. The presence of an almost indetectable trace in this sample is entirely in keeping with Leuchter's conclusion that the room from which it was taken must have been deloused with Zyklon at one time or another.

      <p>
       Altogether, 22 samples were removed, including two control samples from a distant place where contamination with HCN [hydrocyanic acid] would not be possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of the 20 samples removed, ten were taken from rooms in Block 3 in Auschwitz [main camp] (from rooms 1, 2, 3 and 4) where inmate clothing was disinfected with Zyklon B. According to our information, these rooms were white- washed during the war years. In some spots, a blue or dark blue stain shows through.
      </p>
      <p>
       Five samples were also taken from the ruins of the gas chamber of crematory [building] 2 in Birkenau, as well as one sample each from the ruins of crematory [building] 5 and the wall of crematory [building] 1 in Auschwitz [main camp]. No samples were taken from the ruins of crematory [building] 4, because the 30-40 centimeter high wall structure there was reconstructed after the war.

       In addition, the above-mentioned employees of the Institute of Forensic Research were given an envelope containing about 150 grams of human hair (marked PMO II-6-476), which had been obtained by a Museum employee, as well as four pieces of pulverized horse hair material ["wlosianki"] which had likewise been obtained by an employee of the Museum (marked PMO II-6-477 to 480). Concentration of Cyanide in the analyzed material: Sample number as per the procedure of 20 February 1990 Concentration of Cyanide expressed as potassium cyanide (micrograms per 100 grams of material)

       Received at the Auschwitz State Museum, 11 Oct. 1990 / filed: I 4998 To the State Museum in Auschwitz-Birkenau Re: Ref. No. I-8523/51/1860/89 The Institute of Forensic Research, in the name of Prof. Dr. Jan Sehn, Krakow, herewith presents this
Forensic Report,
prepared by the court-approved experts Prof. Dr. Jan Markiewicz, Dr. Wojciech Gubala, engineer Jerzy Labedz, and Beate Trzcinska, M.S. In response to publications and court proceedings in the West, according to which Zyklon B gas was not used to kill people in the Auschwitz concentration camp, the Auschwitz [State] Museum asked us to take samples of wall plaster from the gas chambers and analyze them for the presence of hydrogen cyanide.

       Because there is lots of hard evidence the Holocaust did happen, like the actual camps, Allied soldiers who found the camps with starving prisoners, dead bodies in the ovens, survivors who told their story on radio or even TV, Nazi prisoners telling about what went on, and survivors who still have the tattoos of their serial numbers.

       This was a result of the Allies blockading Germany. The Germans treated their prisoners
       <strong>
        far better
       </strong>
       then the Allies threated theirs. But with the blockade Germany could not feed theirs prisoners. Hence the film footage you refer to was the result of

        our side

       being very effective in
       <em>

       Not to mention the Germans were supposedly the most industrious people. They couldn't come up with a better design for a death camp? (if that's what they were really up to) Why would you put everyone into a shower room with a single door entry and single door exit? How many dead bodies would have to be individually moved from the gas chamber, upstairs to the ovens? Doesn't seem very efficient for a 1930s German war machine.

       They were, indeed, the most industrious people. Being that intelligent then why would they be stupid enough to even attempt to murder "six million" people? The answer is they did no such thing. The mere logistics of such a foolish endeavour are astounding. There were
       <strong>
        no death camps at all
       </strong>
       . The camps were used for slave labour. Why would such a smart nation waste a perfectly good resource? They wouldn't and didn't.

       No, it wasn't. It didn't happen. The showers were to

       the prisoners, not kill them. The Zylon-B gas was to clean the clothing.

       There's plenty of evidence that suggests the holocaust DID happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main argument I see is the whole "6 million Jews" thing, that it was impossible that the Nazi regime killed that many Jews. The thing is, it wasn't just Jews making up that number. It was certainly the biggest demographic of deaths and the one most talked about, but he killed homosexuals, the disabled, people who disagreed with his ideals, I could go on.
      </p>

       If you still insist that the Holocaust never happened despite the mountains of evidence that it did, then you need to have a word with yourselves.

       As the OP said, have you ever seen images of newspaper headlines prior to the dates of the holocaust? They all mention the 6 million figure. Is it more likely that a decade later the exact amount talked about would be killed or is it more likely that some were killed and that they just continued publishing the same 6 million figure?

       A rabbi in NY stated that around 1 million Jews died. That the nazi would round up anybody with at least one jew grandparent. Then they would take their kids and wife too in as jews. Additionally anybody providing haven to jews were also taken in as jews.

       You will get the completely correct trope "hating Israel/zionism and hating jews are not the same thing" in response. However they will never mention the fact that a lot of people in this sub that hate zionism and israel also quite simply hate jews. Somehow, even though they are indeed not the same thing, the people that hold these views are often the same.

       You will also get downvoted for merely stating a mundane truth: no order, budget or plan was ever found for the holocaust - indeed mainstream scholars (including Jewish academics) are perfectly free to debate whether Hitler and top-Nazi brass ever wanted it (or whether it happened spontaneously, out of the coincidental initiatives of low-level bureaucrats).

        Like you can get imprisoned in Europe for this, why is it that people are labeled anti-semetic &amp; nazi-supporters instantly for merely being rational human beings and questioning things that research leads them to believe isn’t what they’ve been told all of their life.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In most countries, you won't be imprisoned, however because almost everyone in Europe including myself, knows people or had family (my case), who either died or fought in the WWII, you will be treated like the retard you are, for denying the holocaust.
      </p>
      <p>
       The further away the country is from Europe, the higher the percentage of holocaust deniers, is usually the rule of thumb. I mean sure some things were never completely cleared up. The number of 6 million is and has always been a rough, but fairly accurate estimate. Interesting things that most Europeans question would be for instance why the narrative is that Hitler only aimed for jews, when it recently has become very likely that they murdered even more Gypsies and specifically Roma than jews (there is also some overlap).

       For America, WW2 was about gaining access to space technology and the build out of the worlds first true Air Force in order to ‘rule the world’.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about the major outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
       After WW2, Germany and Japan were eliminated from the space race.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real kicker though....
      </p>
      <p>
       While the holocaust did occur, and millions were killed, what is missed is that millions were killed in the development and manufacturing of the worlds first Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, as it was a raw and untested process and became the most dangerous manufacturing process ever discovered.  Within this group, was a team testing radioactive elements and their uses as fuel, weapons, and affects on the human body. To understand these two powers, rockets and nuclear science, was going to require a terrible loss of life due to risks and dangers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine a manufacturing plant filled with 25k children under the age of 10 trying to build guns and ammo for the first time with nobody to show them how to do it safely.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world attacked after hitler expanded his efforts to capture slave laborers in neighboring countries, and he knew he needed to invent the bomb and a delivery system quickly...so...Safety procedures were eliminated for speed, everything in the supply chain was dangerous and required a lot of labor. Over a million slave laborers died in the development and build out of V1 and V2 rockets, liquid gas experiments, testing human endurance in the upper atmosphere, and many other experiments dangerous to humans. Millions more from playing around with radiation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main fallacy of the holocaust narrative has to do with the emergence of technological advancements within the Askenazi community, the stealing of the technology by nation states, and the way the ashkenazi scientists were demonized and replaced by nation state figure heads like Einstein and others only to be used as the laborers to create it and be discarded afterward.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many did we rescue with op paperclip? 200? Shame on the Allieds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Operation Paperclip is the main motivating outcome of WW2, once the scientists and schematics and methods were extracted from Europe, the Cold War and modern space race narrative was written and the new space race legacy was born.
      </p>
      <p>
       My two cents.
