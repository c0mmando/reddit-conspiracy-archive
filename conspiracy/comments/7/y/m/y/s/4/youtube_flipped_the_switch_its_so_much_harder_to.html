        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was trying to show somebody one of those collage videos about all of the strange things at Sandy Hook and I noticed that now when you search &quot;Sandy Hook Conspiracy&quot; or &quot;Sandy Hook Hoax&quot; etc. all you get is:</p>

<p>A. MSM videos (either holding the narrative/attacking hoax critics)</p>

<p>B. Channels I have never seen before attacking people who don&#39;t buy the official narrative (i.e. Blue Pillers/Agent Smiths)</p>

<p>There used to be videos with millions of views that broke it down quickly and with ease. It looks like the Youtube algorithms have greatly improved the censorship to keep us in the matrix. They want the platform to continue to be an &quot;echo chamber&quot; for the corporate media. It is time to move our efforts to a new platform that is receptive to free thought, Youtube is dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Wolfgang Halbig is currently Executive Director of the National Institute for School and Workplace Safety and formed a security company, WK &amp; Associates. Previous to founding the National Institute for School and Workplace Safety, Halbig worked in public education as a teacher, and principal, and superintendent of an alternative school. Halbig was also former Director for School Safety and Security of the Seminole County Public Schools, a school district of approximately 65,000 students.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wolfgang Halbig was a former Florida State Trooper in Miami, Florida, and as a United States Customs Inspector. Halbig has presented presentations and keynotes to a variety of organizations, including the National Education Law Conference, the National School Board Association, the Oklahoma School Board Association, the Illinois School Board Association, the New York State School Board Association and the Florida School Board Association.</p>

<p>As a former security expert and consultant,Halibig has provided safety training and school assessments for more than 8,000 school districts nationwide.</p>

<p>Halbig received his Bachelor of Science at Abilene Christian University in 1973 and Nova University in 1985. He has also been featured on Dateline and Good Morning America.</p>

<p>He was legit. But now is actively being portrayed as a conspiracy nut all over media.  He started his campaign to find the truth after being harassed by state troopers at his home telling Wolfgang to stope questioning the narrative immediately.  He did the opposite.  He was then sued by one of the parents of the alleged victims of sandy hook in another effort to stop his campaign.  But he actually was excited for the trial because he knew that only more information and questions might get answered. But pozner dropped the lawsuit.  Higherside chats has a great podcast with him containing a lot of really good info. <a href="https://www.thehighersidechats.com/wolfgang-halbig-sandy-hook-lawsuit/">https://www.thehighersidechats.com/wolfgang-halbig-sandy-hook-lawsuit/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely right we need a new platform that isn&#39;t compromised. It&#39;s sad... because there is so much amazing info on youtube... but they seem to be intent on pushing one narrative and crushing opposition. Who directs this?</p>

<p>Nevermind the fact that this company became one of the richest in the world by screwing artists and forwards thinkers. So much of the content is uploaded by people with no copyrights and selling ads on top of said copyright infringing material and claiming no liability. </p>

<p>I am all for free and open information... I however am not cool with people who didn&#39;t put their blood, sweat, and tears into the work making fistfuls of cash off it while independant artists/thinkers/speakers/content creators starve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would I care about upvotes. I care about the truth. Believe it or not I was a full fledged sandy hooker for over a year ever since a few days after the event. Robby Parker laughing during the press conference, Gene Rosen&#39;s inconsistency in his stories, Dr. Carver&#39;s strange press conference. I&#39;ve seen it all and believed it, until I decided to research the other side. You can believe whatever side you want, it really doesn&#39;t bother me and is inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. But until you&#39;ve actually researched the debunkings for yourself, you&#39;re not interested in the truth in my eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With all due respect, and as someone who is skepticle of the SH conspiracy theories, if you&#39;re going to claim that the evidence has been debunked, the onus is on you to provide the proof.  One side has provided their evidence, so why can&#39;t you?</p>

<p>You say you&#39;re interested in the truth, but do nothing to propagate the truth.  If you have evidence that debunks SH conspiracy theories, some of us would be glad to see it.

    <div class="md"><p>Sibscribe to a VPN like private internet access. When some crap is blocked on youtube aa not availiable in your country, just fire up the VPN and pick a server outside the USA (or whatever country you&#39;re in).</p>

<p>A VPN also encrypts your internet traffic keeping it private from your ISP and your employer (say if you are on work wifi and want to get around any filters they have setup). It also protects you from man in the middle attacks if some hacker is spoofing starbucks wifi, for example, because again all your traffic is encrypted. And if you are paranoid about state surveillance a VPN makes it harder to spy on you.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t tested running youtube searches through an offshore server, though I am certain I have seen people get different search results based on where their IP says they are from.</p>

<p>You all have to be smarter than the algos which isn&#39;t hard. There are plenty of tools and methodologies out there that get around this kind of censorship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I don&#39;t find much of the evidence very compelling. It comes down to &quot;I saw a victim&#39;s relative smile&quot; which we see in literally every event like this, and &quot;why can&#39;t I see the kids bodies&quot; which is honestly pretty obvious why not. But really it&#39;s just the motivation I find questionable. I&#39;m supposed to believe that the CIA/whatever faked an entire <em>town</em>, an operation so risky and massive yet executed it so perfectly that circumstantial crap is all we have. If they could pull that off <em>surely</em> they could find another way to take our guns away that isn&#39;t remotely that complicated. And why even bother orchestrating a whole shooting to show guns are bad? It&#39;s not like there are a shortage of them, just wait a week for a different shooting. Unless we&#39;re going to entertain the theory that the US is the safest place ever and all the gun violence is faked. That&#39;s my rant on the subject.</p>

<p>As for Las Vegas, it&#39;s all about the parties involved. Do some digging on the shooter and the Saudis. There was a massive behind the scenes event going on and we just saw it peek into the normal world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve listed 2 of 20 pieces of circumstantial evidence and I can agree that the smile proves nothing.</p>

<p>The motivation is always JFK and 9/11, proving we are being taken advantage of. It&#39;s not about basing a grand theory off of one particular event.</p>

<p>How often do &gt; 15 people get killed in a shooting? Not very often.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha yes.</p>

<p>For Sandy Hook to be a hoax it would take a conspiracy involving most of the town. A town of 30k people. How can anyone seriously believe &quot;the whole town was involved in a giant conspiracy to pretend to kill children at a shut down school to promote a gun control agenda.&quot;</p>

<p>I just can&#39;t fathom how this could be a thing for a rational mind. It&#39;s unstable at best, and at worst it&#39;s a psy op designed to make all conspiracy theorists look like nuts. </p>

<p>If there is a conspiracy here it has to do with shooters being manipulated mentally, and agencies who do this type of stuff have no problem napalming whole villages full of families.  Is there just an aversion to believing the kids died because they were white Americans?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have really amped up the propaganda on this one. They are pushing gun confiscation but always beating around the bush and just saying vague things like &quot;how many kids have to die before we do something&quot;. It&#39;s very odd because they are all using the same tactics but are seemingly unrelated. There are constantly kids pushing this shit as if they came up with it on their own, and somehow decided to use the same tactic as news pundits etc. </p>

<p>Then they are addressing congress directly demanding anti gun laws clearly setting up the narrative that there is a popular demand so when laws are passed against the people they can pretend it isn&#39;t a decree by the ruling class.</p>

<p>The propaganda machine is getting stronger by the day, this won&#39;t end well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can offer a non-conspiracy answer to this, although it makes it no less palatable. I work in digital advertising, and my focus over the last week has been helping a company to block advertising from videos that they do not wish to be associated with. This generally happens against categories and not individual videos, so for example an advertiser would choose to block all videos related to guns, alcohol, violence, and of course… Conspiracy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s likely that YouTube are altering the algorithm in order to promote videos that are able to be monetised and less likely to be blocked by advertisers. As I said, this is still really uncomfortable, but it doesn&#39;t make a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I already posted a channel that has debunked everything you could ask for. I guarentee you haven&#39;t watched one video from there, but if I had posted a channel that is about how sandy hook was a hoax you&#39;d have been all over it watching every video to further your narrative. </p>

<p>Tl;dr: Don&#39;t watch conspiracy theory videos if you can&#39;t handle researching them get debunked.</p>
