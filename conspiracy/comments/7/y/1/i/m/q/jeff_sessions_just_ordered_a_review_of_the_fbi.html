       In this "review" I'm sure he will find (fabricate) things negative or damaging to the office of the special council. After this review, his "findings" will be the method which is used to disrupt the Russia investigation. I don't find it to be coincidental that this investigation is coming in the same afternoon as the indictment of 13 Russians for meddling in the campaign.

       The FBI employs tens of thousands of people. Are you suggesting that 35,000 FBI employees were all entirely focused on Trump and couldn't take time to investigate online comments?

       Don't know but with that being said maybe they should have had one of those thirty five thousand employees following and keep an eye on this kid. Just like you, I personally would like to know why the FBI flopped on this. They flopped on the a lot of these past shooters to the point that it now should raise an alarm.

       Caught him for what? Comments online that were posted in his name? Unless you can definitively tie these comments to him in real life, there ain't s*** there
      </p>

       You're trying to set an incredibly dangerous precedent for locking people up. The kid had no criminal history. He purchased his firearm completely legally. The most that the FBI could have gone on was comments allegedly made by him and the fact that his peers thought he was strange

       The dude wrote comments on YouTube saying he was going to shoot up his school and owned guns and ammunition. A coconversation as warranted. Everyone's acting like sending him to a gulag is the only way to deter him from killing people. If the FBI knocked on my door and talked to me and my guardians about my YouTube comments and told me they'd be keeping an eye on me, my plans would change right quick.

       quick question. Do you not think it is a problem that this kid could buy this firearm legally? If it isn't a problem that he did, should the fbi of been able to check the fact that he has a firearm after comments he has made on social media.

       Is just cross-checking if the dude actually has a firearm after he said he will be a professional school shooter actually taking action in a negative way? It wasn't just what he said on social media he had many interactions with law enforcement that should of resulted in a deeper investigation

       We're already there, but it's much worse than precogs. There are forces at play that fabricate a target's "pre-speech" and "mind's eye" in real-time, while another party monitors (and hears/sees exactly what they were intended to hear/see), and the unevidenced fabrications are used to justify the complete destruction of the target's life. The destruction is covert and fully deniable via electromagnetic toolkits, and to any uninformed observer, the target has merely started to hallucinate, or made to sound like they've started talking about
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       vile and repulsive subject, by casting manufactured auditory illusions at bystanders.

       I redditrequest'd and made the DEWs sub public recently, but the latter is much more established, and has the correct scope and methods of delivery. We don't have an insider whistleblower like Snowden at the NSA, to prevent the perpetrators from fully dismissing the claims made, yet.

       I don't think its about arresting him before he commits a crime its more about getting the guy some attention and likely help, he was asking for help and no one gave a shit.

       They didn't even share the information given to them with the local field office in Florida. There's a number of things they could have done, but they did nothing. There's a gigantic grey area between "arresting people for what they say on the internet" and doing absolutely nothing with tips and information given to them.

       And it wasn't simply the youtube comment, it was also the called in tip. You are completely right when you say there is a grey area, and that's where this fell. Law enforcement is completely within it's rights to come to your house, knock on the door, and have a chat if they are concerned about your behavior. No rights violated. You don't have to talk to them or even answer the door. If you don't, however, it could be further suspicion that something is off. A further investigation of public or subpoena'd 3rd party information could gather enough evidence (like the 39 previous calls to LE) for a search warrant stating probable cause (not a huge barrier) that would be signed by a judge and then challenged in court proceedings by his defense counsel if it was thought to be invalid or based on inadequate probable cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were solid, established steps law enforcement could have taken in order to mitigate if not eliminate this threat completely that would have violated no established rights. Hand-waving this entire thing off as "what-could-we-have-done" or creating a straw man argument that it's impossible for law enforcement to do it's job without violating rights is childish and infuriating and only leads to more tragedy. We want more gun laws and apparently can't even enforce the laws we have. Law enforcement did NOTHING.

       The solution is not too bad.  We need a reasonable policy that states that credible threats made against the public are investigated and if deemed serious, that they are taken in front of a judge who can sign an order that puts the person on a black-list for purchasing fire arms.  However, there needs to be a way to get off the list by challenging the order, with the burden on the government to prove that the person is still a threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people won't like it though, as they don't trust the government to maintain that list in good faith, and i don't blame them.

       You people will make literally anything about the Russian Investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's reviewing the processes in which they respond to tips and information about potential violence given to them, and the process in which they share that information with local field offices.

      <p>
       That has nothing to do with the Russia investigation. And it most certainly has nothing to do the office of the special counsel.

       I understand all the information is not out there but the FBI did say they did not follow up on a tip about the shooter. I do not see how a whole review of FBI is required? I would just review that one process and what happened. It is probably like any other support job, the person who took the call was at the end of their shift and did not fully record/report as they forgot. When they deal with 100's of these calls it becomes harder to have the incentive to follow up on everyone as nothing happens for 99% of the calls that come in. This is my opinion based on my life experiences.

       I do not disagree reviews are necessary but it is just a very volatile time to do a review. If you do a review when many people have a very strong personal and political interest it can substantially affect the outcome and have strong basis'. This in turn will create worse polices.

       I have an alternative conspiracy theory:
      </p>
      <p>
       The shooting was a false flag in the sense that the patsy was mentally driven off the cliff to do what he did. Obvious goal is to push national firearms regulations to disarm the general public.
      </p>
      <p>
       To counteract this attempt the opposing group puts out this statement through the FBI implying that if it wasn't for gross negligence/incompetence this massacre could have been prevented.
      </p>
      <p>
       This undermines the immediate drive to push gun regulations and puts the focus on the agencies and why they didn't do their job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just theorizing.

       I used to feel the same way about mass shootings, but if that were the case than it would have happened under Obama (who was pro-gun legislation) when the Sandy Hook massacre happened since that school shooting targeted little children.

       The goal isn't to "disarm" the public, it's to raise gun manufacturer's stocks. Every time a shooting like this happens weapon companies stock rises considerably, presumably because people stock up on guns fearing a gov gun grab.

       We're already there, but it's much worse than precogs. There are forces at play that fabricate a target's "pre-speech" and "mind's eye" in real-time, while another party monitors (and hears/sees exactly what they were intended to hear/see), and the unevidenced fabrications are used to justify the complete destruction of the target's life. The destruction is covert and fully deniable via electromagnetic toolkits, and to any uninformed observer, the target has merely started to hallucinate, or made to sound like they've started talking about
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       vile and repulsive subject, by casting manufactured auditory illusions at bystanders.
