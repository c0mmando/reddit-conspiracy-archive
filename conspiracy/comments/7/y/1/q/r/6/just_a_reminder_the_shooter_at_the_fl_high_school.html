<p>I am pro-2nd amendment but adding in an exception to where if you take or have taken within the last x years any kind of anti depressant or anti psychotic drug, you should not be able to purchase a firearm. </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Edit: family “believes” he was on medication. So not for sure. But this guy was flagged for the FBI to investigate and still nothing happened to him. That opens up the doors to another theory: could the FBI be instructed to allow people like this to continue with life normally to allow them to commit atrocities like this so gun control measures can be introduced? Just a thought?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it is certainly a chicken or egg issue, but I see that you are not actually trying to imply the drugs “made him do it.”  Good.</p>

<p>Anti-depressants are so ubiquitous that I don’t know if one could argue that for gun purchases.  Anti-psychotic I can agree with.  Or maybe for both <strong>require a waiver by their doctor or psychiatrist to clear them for purchasing guns and allow that the writer of the waiver to assume liability for a shooting with guns purchased with the waiver</strong>.  That would prevent everyone throwing their hands up and saying “well, the warnings were there, but...”</p>

<p>It is because people are asking the <em>wrong questions</em>.  It always seems easier to address the effects of a problem rather than take on the much more daunting task of finding and fixing the root issue.  Gun control is like taking Sudafed  for a cold, it is attempting to fix a symptom, but it does nothing to fight the infection.</p>

<p>The problem is with society and morals and a shit load of other issues that prompt so many people to <em>need</em> antidepressants and mood stabilizers.  It is about the mental effects on a person of the social and political situation we are in and the effects of the physical chemicals we are all exposed to.  Shootings are merely one symptom of many, removing guns will only direct the violence and insanity to other ways of enacting it.</p>

<p>This is an even harder issue to address, but it the only one that will actually fix anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup.  That is where I run into resistance on some subs when I tell people that SJW agendas are stupid and for that the only thing that matters is the economy.  In times of plenty, people drop prejudices and come together, in times of trouble tribalism and violence occurs.  If one looks at history, every major social breakthrough coincides with times of economic abundance and stability, and every major period of violence coincides with social and economic trouble.</p>

<p>We know this, but only apply it in small views, not bigger picture.  People talk about terrorism linked to Syria’s youth unemployment rate, true enough.  But when do they think about the Holocaust being the result of economic depression, the Civil Rights movement being because of post-War affluence, school shootings and political riots being due to the lack of hope for a future?  Black lives matter didn’t riot and smash businesses because of racist police, the police were acting realistically to deal with the endemic crime of poor black communities, it happened because of the lack of a future that made the criminals become criminals.</p>

<p>This isn’t fixed by diversity training, or trans bathrooms (the whole trans thing is merely a manifestation of the fucked society anyway) or any other liberal or conservative bandaid.  The conservatives are closer on identifying the foundational problem (doesn’t mean they are actually following through with what needs to be done) and the liberals are all about identifying the outgrowth benefits we <em>would see</em> in a healthy society (but they don’t realize you can’t just work backwards from the effects).</p>

<p>If there was actual real progress made to address this, it will cause some pretty bad times for us that would likely take a decade or more, but continuing to put bubble gum in the cracks to keep the thing running will be worse when it all comes down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very well said. A rational comment is a rare find these days around here, so for that, thank you. </p>

<p>There are many reasons why you get such pushback other than the “paid agents” pushing agendas. Most don’t want to look at the larger picture here for a multitude of reasons, it’s too overwhelming, it doesn’t align with “their” side, or just can’t see the forest for the trees. The greed (exploitation) keeps the proper growth from happening. As long as people can be bought, we will continue to have this problem (on all sides) It would take a long time to right the ship, but it is worth it in the long run, IMO. </p>

<p>Until the majority of humanity starts to see/understand , we are destined to continue this downward spiral. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do believe mental illness is a big factor in this, if the reports that he kid was hearing voices are true. That&#39;s a game changer. But I think this is actually more about a kid who fell through the cracks and after the death of his adoptive mother really didn&#39;t have a safety net of any kind anymore. It just seems like nobody really wanted to deal with him, so they passed the baton. And at 19, he was no longer a minor. It also sounded like not many outside the family really knew how bad off he had gotten--except perhaps law enforcement because they were called so often. But we&#39;ll have to see as more comes out. He may have had medication resistant schizophrenia, and in that case, unless he commits a serious crime there&#39;s not a lot people can do. It&#39;s very difficult to have someone committed these days. Still, if his voices were telling him to kill people, he could have just as easily driven into them as shot them, set a fire, etc. This is going to take some time and therapy to unravel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. We saw them crack down on guns in the UK, and what was next? Talk of cracking down on knives because there were more knife attacks. Pretty soon they&#39;ll all be eating with plastic sporks. Then they&#39;ll throw rocks at each other and it&#39;ll start all over from our beginnings. Gun control is always easy thing politicians can grab onto to look like they are doing &quot;something&quot; when really they have done nothing. But when we look at the actual statistics, these crimes have dropped by 2/3&#39;s since the 1990&#39;s. And we&#39;re told what changed that was a change in the crack cocaine market. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I&#39;ve known people who machine their own as a hobby. And 3D printing has now evolved so that one of the guns can fire up to 600 bullets.

<p>We have to figure out what it is about this guy that we need to watch for.  I encounter people on a daily basis who take antidepressants, most of whom are very stable, responsible people. Most of the people I see on anti-psychotics aren&#39;t prone to violence, some are, but are severely ill and institutionalized.  Conversely, I see people NOT on any psych meds who easily resort to violence.</p>

<p>Taking the shooting at face value (i.e., not a false flag, etc) IMO there may be some negative characteristic in these people that gets exaggerated by psychmeds. Something we aren&#39;t seeing, including some Manchurian candidate type stuff. Who knows?</p>

<p>I tend to side with what you are saying, but I believe we should be much more specific- very, very specific- in selecting who should/should not have the right to own a firearm</p>

Also, I think this kid may have had a psychotic break after the death of his adoptive mother. I think that&#39;s a real factor in this, and could have ramped up his symptoms, as stress does that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some of them that seem to affect the minds of younger people more severely, as well. I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s because our brains aren&#39;t fully developed until we&#39;re 25. They need to look into something safer for them, I think. When I look at the list of these people committing some of this violence, what they&#39;re taking and their ages--I can&#39;t help but feel there&#39;s a connection. Where an older person might tend to become more suicidal on some of these medications, I can&#39;t help but wonder if the immaturity of the younger person&#39;s brain could sometimes cause them to project these symptoms outward, just as kids tend to act out in other ways compared to adults. They just don&#39;t have the same impulse control as an older person. </p>

<p>She said the social worker told her Mr. Holmes “was one of the most anxious people she ever had seen, that she thought he had obsessive compulsive disorder, that he had thoughts of killing people but she didn’t think he was imminently dangerous.”</p>

<p>Dr. Fenton said she saw Mr. Holmes roughly a half dozen times, prescribing him antianxiety and antidepressant medications.</p>

<p>He said little in therapy, Dr. Fenton said, and there were signals that something was amiss with Mr. Holmes, whom she described as exceptionally socially anxious. In June, after failing critical exams, he informed her nonchalantly that he planned to drop out of his graduate program and that he no longer wanted to continue therapy, she said.</p>

<p>Alarmed, she said she followed up with those that knew Mr. Holmes, but concluded that his behavior was consistent with how he had always acted.</p>

<p>“He had been that way for many, many years, since he was a child,” she said.&quot;</p>

<p>You never ignore something like this, because there is no way to know just what a person is capable of. In the counseling office where I worked, if real threats were made, they had to be reported, even if most people didn&#39;t follow through. There are just times we can&#39;t take chances because innocent people&#39;s lives are at stake! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe he was schizophrenic, if the reporting of him hearing voices is true. But there are those who are medication resistant. I&#39;d like to hear more about what he was experiencing. If he suffered from &quot;command&quot; voices or if it was really a psychotic break brought about by stress from the death of his adoptive mother in November. I just wonder how he obtained a gun. Unless none of this was ever reported to the proper agency by the authorities so he wouldn&#39;t pass a background check for purchasing a weapon.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;ve been on Mood Stabilizers and anti-psychotics for 23 years, starting at the age of 15. There have certainly been some dark moments, but they were suicidal in nature and not homicidal. So it isn&#39;t quite so simple. I&#39;ve admitted myself into psychiatric hospitals on a few occasions when I was in my early 20&#39;s but as I&#39;m bi-polar (rapid cycling) the treatment really wasn&#39;t suited well for me, and I&#39;ve learned to manage my illness with medication and though it has not been necessary for more than 9 years, I was fortunate to have family and friends by my side when I did need them in the past.</p>

<p>The problem with you logic/argument is that if people fear losing their gun rights for taking anti-depressants or anti-psychotics then they many won&#39;t seek treatment at all, which in my personal experience and observations is a far greater concern.</p>

<p>While I concede that the side-effect of taking many medications, and more-so from abruptly stopping usage are very problematic, I would argue that&#39;s the underlying mental illness and social/environmental elements that play the determining factor(some biological perhaps)as to whether someone self-inflicts harm or engages in acts of violence against others.</p>

<p>I understand you want to find a solution, but it&#39;s  a very complex situation and far too great a slippery slope to propose such a measure.
Look at what happened with similar proposals with regards to Veterans seeking treatment and potentially losing their firearms rights, they stopped seeking treatment. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a responsible firearm owner for the better part of 18 years, though I&#39;m  without a doubt an exceedingly rare exception- in that even in my &quot;dark&quot; moments I had already decided that I would never use a firearm to end my life. I grew up shooting from the age of 8, GF was a Marine, Uncle a Police Officer and I was in the Boy Scouts. I had too much respect for guns, and didn&#39;t want to add to the stigma of mental health and firearm ownership.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Likewise. It takes a great deal of responsibility having an illness that can both make you sad, and irresponsible(manic)
But as long as your aware of your illness at all times, take your medication and don&#39;t have a history of violence(manic or not) it&#39;s a grey area. Bi-polar are like most people with a mental illness, largely a threat to themselves more than anything.
Stay safe and responsible ;)</p>

<p>With every mass shooting,folks like you and I are one step closer to having our right to own firearms preemptively taken away. I understand people are scared and angry, but it&#39;s a very slippery slope when you begin removing peoples constitutional rights before they have committed a crime or exerted a threat in society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very well said. A rational comment is a rare find these days around here, so for that, thank you. </p>

<p>There are many reasons why you get such pushback other than the “paid agents” pushing agendas. Most don’t want to look at the larger picture here for a multitude of reasons, it’s too overwhelming, it doesn’t align with “their” side, or just can’t see the forest for the trees. The greed (exploitation) keeps the proper growth from happening. As long as people can be bought, we will continue to have this problem (on all sides) It would take a long time to right the ship, but it is worth it in the long run, IMO. </p>

<p>Until the majority of humanity starts to see/understand , we are destined to continue this downward spiral. </p>
