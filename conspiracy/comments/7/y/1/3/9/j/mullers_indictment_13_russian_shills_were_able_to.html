       I'm sure you read my post history before you replied. Even if I was, who gives a fuck? At least they're honest about how they feel as opposed to trying to manipulate people like all the r/new fags that come in here and waste everyone's time.

       I don't try to manipulate anyone. I go off of what I believe are facts. People from the_Donald seem to in my experience be incapable of acknowledging them. Before these charges came out many people from the_donald spewed there's no proof Russia interfered with the election nonsense.

       A lot of people were saying that. People who didn't vote for Donald nor like him as president. I personally think they likely 'interfered' (probably only as far as RT had a Facebook page and possibly some ads) but I'd be surprised if they had any effect on the outcome whatsoever. It's really just people blaming others for their incompetence, if you ask me..

       I don't blame people. I get that people want the things they believe in to be true. That's fine and dandy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the conspiracy sub and it's loaded with people screaming there was no Russian involvement. There was. That there was no collusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was at the very least attempted collusion and that's a fucking fact. That was proven by DJTJR releasing his own emails and everyone knows damn well he tells daddy everything. I don't base things off of spin and bullshit. I don't spam garbage. I just want the truth whatever that may be.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, let's cut the bullshit and quit moving the goalposts. I'm sick of people being "oh they can't get him on Russia so now it's having affairs" no, no it's fucking not it's just more shit to throw on the pile of shit. That pile of shit is getting taller than Trump Tower. God damn.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guys a walking talking carnie. He's built his empire fucking people over and people here think he's on their side?
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a douche. Plain and fucking simple. He's played his cards and shown who he is. Come the fuck on.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's surrounded himself with unsavory characters, he won't enact sanctions that were voted on 98-2 and 419-3, he won't say a negative thing about Putin. Open your fucking eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand you guys like him. He says all the right things. He believes in nothing though. It's all right in front of you face if you care to see it.

       Calm down. I don't like Trump at all. Never have. Probably never will.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you can't blame trump. He's a symptom of a bigger problem. The same people crying about him and throwing tantrums on the internet like you are, are the exact people who are to blame for this. You people tried to tell actual American who they NEED to vote for and rigged the democratic process along the way. You said their obligated to vote for this candidate. Regular Americans said fuck that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now normal people live with the consequences of the corrupt politics and their blind followers not allowing the process to work. Anyone who hates trump as bad as you, need look in the mirror to realize he's in office because of YOU. Hell your cheating candidate actually told her people to help trump win in the beginning. She fuckin tried to rig the other side so the eventual victor would be her opponent. It's called pied piper - look it up if you so dare.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm happy to say I'm one of few proud American who can say I didn't fall to the trap of propaganda and hate since I voted 3rd party. If you didn't vote 3rd party, you can thank yourself for trumps existence because you essentially supported the party who inadvertently supported trump.

       So slightly off topic here but how many of that 100k were also fake bots (not necessary Russian)? Because I’ve literally never heard of the @TENGOP handle so I’m assuming they weren’t impactful enough to be mentioned by the MSM? Could be wrong though. Also isn’t Twitter littered with bots and is actually a majority of fake accounts?

       I was duped by propaganda in the 80s and 90s.  I moved past it and in my 40s, this shit is so obvious now.  But I admitted it. That allowed me to move on.

       Grew up in the South.  Believed in zero tolerance, hard on crime. I agreed with government is bad.  I was constantly exposed to racism and ingrained some of it.  I was liberal but bought some of the stuff about the Clintons.  I took for granted things like SS, Medicare and Medicaid.   Luckily I had a pretty liberal mother that kinda helped me see both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the big one was not seeing what the right wing was doing with Starve the Beast and it's many faces.  They are literally making government small by destroying it and it's gotten to the point of being scary.  Starve the Beast is dead, should be Fix the Fucking Beast.

       It seems that reality is the exact opposite to what you say: here is the only place where the moronic "Russia Did It
