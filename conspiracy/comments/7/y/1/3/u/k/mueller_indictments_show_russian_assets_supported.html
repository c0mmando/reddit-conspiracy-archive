       b. On or about November 3, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators purchased an advertisement to promote a post on the lnstagram account “Blacktivist” that read in part: ”Choose peace and vote for Jill Stein. Trust me, it’s not a wasted vote. ”
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        After the election of Donald Trump in or around November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used false U.S. personas to organize and coordinate U.S. political rallies in support of then president-elect Trump, while simultaneously using other false U.S. personas to organize and coordinate U.S. political rallies protesting the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. For example, in or around November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators organized a rally in New York through one group designed to  ”show your support for President-Elect Donald Trump ” held on or about November 12, 2016. At the same time, Defendants and their co-conspirators, through another group, organized a rally in New York called  ”Trump is NOT my President ” held on or about November 12, 2016. Similarly, Defendants and their co-conspirators organized a rally entitled "Charlotte Against Trump" in Charlotte, North Carolina, held on or about November 19, 2016.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Defendants and their co-conspirators used their fictitious online personas to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. They engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.

       Submission Statement. Mueller's full indictment states that Russian assets gave social media support to Stein, Sanders and Trump. Also organized a anti-Trump rally. Does this mean they were just trying to spread discord in the election? Also will we or can we ever know  what effect and impact these Russian social media accounts had and did they even sway any US voters against the overall spending of all election campaigns and US organizations which supported their candidate?

       corporate propaganda?  this is the FBI, funded by our tax dollars, not a private enterprise.  not to mention, a republican dominated FBI.  if what you fear is truly corporate propaganda, think on what 'corporate' means to you.  people with too much money using that money to control information?  putin is the richest man on the planet and america is russia's longtime adversary ever since they had to split territories they captured in WW2, and america has multiple sanctions that are pissing him off.  everything putin has pulled since crimea has been the exact definition of conspiracy and here you are on

       In many ways, the fbi are like attack dogs for the neoliberal establishment. The goal of the intelligence community is to advance the interests of a handful of supremely powerful people. Think the military industrial complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russian people are not the adversaries of the American people. I have no problem with Russians. You’re made to think that because neoliberal propaganda. You take issue with Russia in Crimea but ignore the US in the Middle East.

       What made you think I ignore the US in the middle east? I never said that.  We certainly are very very guilty of horrendous atrocities there, for the driven by the MIC with heavy help from Republicans.  And talk about fooling oneself, you think the country that is run by THE richest man on the planet and has a history of proxy wars with the US (which obviously continue in the middle east, East Asia and ukraine) is not an adversary of the country responsible for numerous sanctions that hinder their economy.  Ffs Russia just attacked the US in Syria.  You obviously admit Russia was against American interests in Ukraine, but dismiss it saying I ignore the middle east. I don't.  I'm also not even saying that America is any more in the right on international affairs than Russia, but it is very very clear that Russia and the US are longtime rivals.  To let your guard down about that is to enable their schemes.  Unlike most idiots on the Internet I am well aware of history and modern geopolitics.  I'm also not really interested in changing your mind, but rather providing truth in the wake of your ignorance for those that are capable of reasonable doubt.

       I read all the leftist pro Clinton MSM bs. They never claim Trump won because of Russia. That's impossible to know. What is certain is that another country trying to attack our democrat should be investigated and there should be a response from the president to defend the USA. Otherwise he is anti American.

       Not that I'm disagreeing with you about your assertion, but do you shills even
       <em>
        try

       to blend in to this sub anymore?  I'm seriously supposed to believe people in

       getting upvoted for debunking conspiracies and quoting politifact is organic conversation?

       At least when you first showed up you tried to push the conspiracy angle, now you're just openly shilling against them.

       I am correcting the conspiracy claim, not "debunking" conspiracies.

       Turns out, the Republicans made the law requiring these voting machines. It was called the Help America Vote Act. And the Republicans control most of the proprietary software. And Republicans have come right out and proudly announced their "partisan gerrymandering" in many states like Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, there is a conspiracy to steal elections, but it's not by George Soros.

       No it's a conspiracy to steal elections by the political elite and agenda setters.  I have a hard time believing anybody that's on this sub for actual conspiracies gives any real credence to delination between parties.  Little difference in corporate Dems and corporate GOP, they're all working for the same people who have taken over our political and government organizations.

       Bipartisanship is the most superficial distinction you can make in politics.

       The partisan comment was here:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        George Soros owns many of the voting machines
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       It is partisan because
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       (1) it is directed at a Democrat AND (2) it is false.

       Your facts are correct, but I think it's pretty clear you're here to shill against the right and for the left (corporate left, anyway).

       I was given free reign to be loosened on the earth, to blind the eyes and deafen the ears of all who look upon me and hear my voice, to take the lofty houses built on the mountains and lay them low, and make the inhabited cities a desolation. Whatever still dwells on the face of the ground will be cast to the winds of destruction, seized and taken away. Then I will return to the one who sent me, and all who follow will meet me under the branches of the Bodhi tree. The rest will be scattered!

       If Russia wanted to spread discord and defang our foreign policy so to speak, they should have jumped behind Gary Johnson, who was the only viable candidate (on the ballot in all 50 states) who would have reigned in our empire.  That would have benefited Russia the most if their goal was to scoop up territory and expand their influence, yet the guy who garnered almost 5% of the national vote was left out of this effort?

       Johnson isn't part of the club. Trump is connected to a lot of private clubs. Guliani helped him with his connection to NY FBI office, then went to Mexico to meet with the left leaning political party their. This whole Build a Wall schtick has two purposes, works domestically,  but pisses off the Mexican voters when you act as if Mexico will pay. Guliani through the Russians coordinating with Trump Co. Introduced the left to the Russians. Guliani made millions consulting for this Anti-Trump political group in Mexico during the election. Manafort in Trump Co was the foreign agent for Russia, he engineered the Ukraine deal earlier, then got set up in Russia with a financial firm that oligarchs dumped a few hundred million in as seed money (this was way back before the revolution in Ukraine), this money was laundered into NY real estate.

       Everyone acts as if Trump is an outsider,  he is part of the same structure as was Bush and Clinton, just slightly different faction. It is more complex than this,  but one side gets off on showy reveal of their control and hidden groups,  and the other is just as globalist but want a more tightly controlled system. It is all the same pyramid though, we just elected the guy from the Black Pyramid mentality.

       I agree, that's why Gary Johnson received no space in this narrative, because that would serve to further legitimize him, and by extent a third party hell bent on taking over, so they can leave you alone......and stopping our wars, to include the drug war.  We can collectively figure out where to go from them imho.

       I like you think Johnson would have crushed it with right wing voters, a lot of moderates, some light left had he been treated fairly. I probably wouldn't have voted for him because I am pretty liberal, but you never know, would have wanted him to talk more about how to fund a welfare program for those in need using a market (capitalist) approach. Also, how to reduce and limit our role in wars while pressuring other large countries to follow suit. On principle he feels correct but I wonder how it works in practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, he is one guy,  you elect him, still have hundreds of politicians with very different philosophies, so really need a bigger third party presence to support.

       Can you imagine the enormous costs associated with electing a third-party candidate? Russia's goal wasn't to destroy us in one swoop. Russia's goal was to undermine our faith in the electoral process and sew social Discord all across the Spectrum

       Ok, I watched it.  He has some very insightful points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I have said before, I think Trump may have colluded, but he didn't do anything different from others in the past(I'm thinking of Reagan negotiating with Iranian terrorist and the hostage release)
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I thinks its all a political show for the US people.  A little payback by the Dems for the whole Benghazi BS.
      </p>
      <p>
       US economy profits greatly by the huge militarization we have, and in order to keep that going, we have to have a big bad guy.(Obama keeping this going, was when you realize, it no longer matters who gets elected, Big business runs things)
      </p>
      <p>
       I never have really seen Putin as a huge threat to the US, and having lived as a kid in the late stages of the cold war, I never understood it either.  What country wants to commit suicide?  Because USSR sending nukes to the US is exactly that, both sides lose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump, IMO is a complete idiot, who by his own measures has created more trouble for himself than any other party could have hoped for.  When he was elected, I at least hoped he would act somewhat respectable, but the dumbass can't stay off twitter)
      </p>
      <p>
       It disgusts me, we have devolved into an ignorant people who are severely gullible(on both sides).  Our degrading public education is mostly to blame for this.

       Rosenstein literally said no American was involved and this had no affect on the election. If you don’t see these indictments as an attempt to save face you’re delusional. Mueller investigation has been a year and 4 month waste of time and tax payer money.

       Rosenstein said that no American was involved in that particular series of indictments.  He said it was unclear what effect it had in the election.  Mueller investigation has been 8 months and has costed less than any major political investigation in the past 20 years or so.

       did you even read it? americans were directly involved.  either you read it or you didn't bother and you're letting someone else tell you what it says.  i think we both know which one of those is the dumb choice.  whether you think its true or not, you should at least read it so you can protect yourself from those who would lie about what it said.

       that sentence doesn't really make much of a point.  if anything you are proving that it worked.  having millions of americans do the same thing- voting for throwaway-vote candidates- was literally their intended goal as it states.  to try and dismiss it by saying that people did what they hoped doesn't even come close to making sense.

       inversely, it's almost as if they were supporting the candidates that did not have a mainstream accepted chance of winning, likely in the hopes of fragmenting the american public.  why anyone even balks at the idea that russia might be out to disrupt america in some way is beyond me.  if what we are to be wary of is the corporate hand behind all things, it should not be understated that putin is the richest man in the world.

       The fact that they continued organizing anti-Trump protests
       <strong>
        after
       </strong>
       the election should explain a lot. The Russians were trolling to get people angry and distrustful. It worked. It spawned #TheResistance which continues to this day.

       That's literally what happened. The fact they waited until after the election is in the indictment. Keep desperately defending traitors though, that's going great for you lot.

       There's nothing to defend. That's what you don't understand. There was no collusion. Your conspiracy theory about traitors and whatnot is completely unfounded. So, yes, it's going great for me.

       The title of this thread is factually false. The so-called "Russian propaganda" teams actually put out more pro-Hillary memes than for any other candidate. (In fact, they paid for protests in front of Trump Tower.)

       I agree, that's why Gary Johnson received no space in this narrative, because that would serve to further legitimize him, and by extent a third party hell bent on taking over, so they can leave you alone......and stopping our wars, to include the drug war.  We can collectively figure out where to go from them imho.

       Rosenstein said that no American was involved in that particular series of indictments.  He said it was unclear what effect it had in the election.  Mueller investigation has been 8 months and has costed less than any major political investigation in the past 20 years or so.

       Mueller also announced a California man has pled guilty to setting up accounts used by this psyop

       Don't forget that the president has been denying any of this happened for the the entire time. Will he finally acknowledge that Russia sought to interfere in our election?

       No it's a conspiracy to steal elections by the political elite and agenda setters.  I have a hard time believing anybody that's on this sub for actual conspiracies gives any real credence to delination between parties.  Little difference in corporate Dems and corporate GOP, they're all working for the same people who have taken over our political and government organizations.

       did you even read it? americans were directly involved.  either you read it or you didn't bother and you're letting someone else tell you what it says.  i think we both know which one of those is the dumb choice.  whether you think its true or not, you should at least read it so you can protect yourself from those who would lie about what it said.
