        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This morning around 10 am, I was driving to my apartment after staying at another house with some friends. I remembered I had some cash inside my apartment I needed to deposit. I parked outside my apartment and quickly went inside grabbed my cash and then ran back into my car. </p>

<p>Side note: I just traded in for a new car that syncs with my phone via Bluetooth, and when I turn on my car they automatically sync. Since I’ve gotten my new car and I’m away from my apartment, I get an apple maps notification on my iPhone saying I’m “—“ miles from my apartment’s address. (Which I never entered into my phone in the first place.) However, I’ve never seen a notification on my phone when I’m leaving my apartment, or I’ve never noticed one at least.</p>

<p>So, when I got back into my car after getting the cash I got a notification saying I was two miles from a certain address. That address just so happens to belong to my bank.</p>

<p>Some extra info: I’m a valet at a hotel and frequently get tipped in cash which I have to deposit. I almost always deposit my cash at night, and today was a kind of spur of the moment decision.</p>

<p>Any ideas about how the hell my phone knew I was going to the bank??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I’ve seen a YouTube video showing a few people who talked about cat food for an entire day even though they didn’t have a cat. A few days later, they had cat food ads on their fb page. This has never happened to me personally but also pretty crazy. I honestly considered what happened to me to be quite different considering this was absolutely a spontaneous decision I made without telling anyone. Plus, it was an abnormal time for me to go to the bank. Definitely appreciate your input though, thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That(the YT vid) doesn&#39;t sound like a very good example.  Most people who talk about their phone spying on them say it happens quickly, not after days.</p>

<p>I suggested a test once before.  Write down a specific product, that you have no reason to own or buy, on a piece of paper, in a room away from any device.  Put it in your pocket or wallet, or somewhere easily accessible.  Wait a week and make sure you don&#39;t ever mention it aloud.  If you come across an ad for it online during that week without mentioning it, toss the paper out and start again with a new product.  Don&#39;t search for it online or click any kind of links to anything like it.  This is to make a control.</p>

<p>Now start talking about the product for a single day, either alone or with friends, and do it frequently.  If you start seeing ads pretty quickly, you&#39;re likely being monitored.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can turn off, “track my location” within the app. Obviously that kind of defeats the purpose of the maps app if you’re using it for navigation, but I never use it anyway. I’ve left it on because I want to see if it continues to guess my destination correctly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol</p>

<p>Yeah that’s a good answer. What gets me is that I definitely go to the bank often, maybe a top 5 destination from my apartment, but at that time of the day I could’ve been going to 3 or 4 more likely places. To me it would be an bad guess if it works on an algorithm that picks the most likely destination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate that there are so many of these &quot;mind reading shitty consumer level electronics that advertise to people who dont spend enough money to justify the use of such high tech apparatus, but for some reason they do anyway&quot;.</p>

<p>No, its called GRAPH ANALYTICS combined with AI.</p>

<p>There is an entire field of science that allows one to predict behaviour patterns with seemingly &quot;mind reading&quot; accuracy.</p>

<p>Combine graph appliances with ultrasonic beacons, geolocation that tells proximity to businesses and residences, cameras everywhere, license plate readers, RFID tags. </p>

<p>All those cheap low tech devices make people who dont take measures to avoid interacting with them, or even to give them so much noise to signal as to fuck with them, think that their mind is being read by a device with zero technical capability to do that.</p>

<p>Youd need something along the lines of an fMRI machine that can actually &quot;read thoughts&quot;. A multimillion dollar piece of equipment that takes a whole section of a hospital, liquid helium, superconducting magnets, a supercomputer to construct the imagery and an expert to read it.</p>

<p>These threads are akin to the ancient myths when people thought Zeus was hurling lightning instead of understanding how electricity works.</p>

<p>These myths need to be destroyed and people need to dive into the subjects related to HPC(high performance computing), spy tech of all kinds like the ones i mentioned, and the fact that the majority of their phone or computer settings are &quot;all spyware enabled by default&quot; and they dont bother to change them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Smartphones can &quot;notice&quot; when certain events coincide with others and use that to predict your future behavior remarkably well. I know that I used to get a notification every time I was about to leave for work because my phone knows where I am at all times, when I&#39;m driving, how long it takes me to get there, etc. If you go to the same place 5 days a week at the same time, it might even assume that location is your &quot;work&quot; and identify it as such. Ditto for your home. If it has seen that pairing to your Bluetooth car means you&#39;re going for a drive, it may start guessing at your destination. If you haven&#39;t been to a frequent destination in a while, like the bank, then that might make that destination be the top guess even if it might be unusual to go at that specific time. It&#39;s not about reading your mind, it&#39;s the fact that the phone tracking all of your location data constantly makes you REALLY easy to predict. </p>

<p>You can change your settings to not see such things. I know I did this because the notifications were always unnerving and never helpful at all, but the metadata about your location and functions your phone accesses are still all there on the device. Welcome to the future. </p>

<p>ps they might be listening through the microphone too. If you said the word &quot;bank&quot; at all right before pairing your phone to your car, the phone might have noticed that and assumed that was your destination. I can&#39;t prove that this happens although we frequently discuss the idea of smartphone mics listening in, but the stuff I said about location tracking data and predicting behavior is 100% documented intentional features. </p>

When I left work a few minutes later, I went to the atm, put in my card, and the first recommendation was get fast cash $200. Usually that first option is for $20.
