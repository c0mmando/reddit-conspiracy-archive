       Ive just noticed a lot of earthquakes in the past couple days. Is it just me or could this be a sign that a very big quake could be coming soon. Especially with the quake in the UK, for conspiracy’s sake,  could it be HAARP? The Chinese? Pole Shift? Blue beam?

       I just find it crazy that they discover all that magma under Japan, then Mexico, California, the UK, and I think New Zealand all get reasonably sized earthquakes within 24 hours of each other. It seems like something is firing up.

       i think we were hit by a cme (coronal mass ejection) from our sun on wednesday. i try to follow some of this space weather? (i think it's called, or disaster prediction) stuff on youtube.. but i believe it's possible that the sun's activity has been affecting our planet. imo.

       The poles are absolutely shifting, it's only a matter of time before the full switch happens. Because of the pole shift we also losing our magnetosphere. We are also entering into a grand solar minimum, some are even predicting a mini ice age type event.

       Yes you are totally right, wasn’t there a guy that was trying to predict earthquakes using solar wind or something? I don’t remember how accurate he was but there might be something there.

       The quake here in the U.K. spooked me. We get them, but certainly not that large, or that close to land, or that high below sea level. We're not remotely near any fault lines and it was big enough to be felt across the country. I'm not an expert on quakes etc but something doesn't feel right about this. I suspect bigger things may be on the horizon.

       A lot of seismic activity on Earth can actually be traced back to the sun.  I haven't checked in the last couple of days but Ben Davidson does a daily "space weather" report daily that'sd about 5 minutes long and sums everything up that you might like to know.

       I watch this religiously.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have had a HUGE lack of sunspots recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sunspots seem to be magnetic phenomena that has something to do with the magnetic birkeland current ropes that connect the sun and various planets in our solar system. (No one up to date on the electric universe is probably completely unaware of what I speak of)
      </p>
      <p>
       It is possible this has caused a weakening of our magnetic field, which may give it the fuel to flip, as its possible these currents keep the magnetic field in some type of equilibrium (my theory).
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes though, we were recently directly hit by a small CME from AR2699 which is about to vanish from our view.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the electric universe information coming out, the sun is a big confusing mess to me.

       I think we're in the GOD universe.  Like, the main one.  There's probably many others, but they all route through this one.  I think Earth is basically Midland, which is funny because someone just stated in a related discussion that I was having that they were Nordic Pagan.  Anyhow, I was in that thread talking about Lucifer and someone else  went on a little rant about how Jesus (or Lucifer according to them) was meant to snare the elect (apparently the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       Jewish people), who are gods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I don't know if you are aware of the jubliee idea in Judaism, but it is high time that the Jews release their debtors.  They cannot pretend to uphold their laws in exactitude if they do not follow one of the most important ideas.  The jubilee was a huge celebration historically.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that humans are meant for much more in this universe and beyond, and rather more quickly than not.  And there are certainly stories of mankind being assisted in the past, and it looks likes we're in line for that again.  I saw a UFO when I was four.  I have no doubt they are keeping tabs on us, and it may be basically like Kaku says in that humankind may have to be a bit more united before real contact occurs.  As in not having people directly in power that are intent on holding back humanity.  Humans are
       <em>
        like
       </em>
       gods, and perhaps we do become gods after death.  But I have a feeling it's deeper than that.  I actually think things are gathering on or around Earth.  Onamuamua may have been a precursor of sorts.  But it's more than that.  Humans themselves may not be all they seem.  MKUltra aside, I think there is a real possibility that angels and demons inhabit people, but gods and goddesses do as well.  Greek and Roman mythology is replete with gods chasing humans, but it makes more sense if they are humans with the souls of gods.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could keep going, but last year being 5777 in the Jewish calendar and the director of the IMF's speech on magic 7's were kinda the icing on the cake.  And all the weirdness.  Lotta weirdness these days.

       I'm a Christian as well.  There is one GOD.  That does not mean that there is nothing else.  Just that you should not worship other
       <em>
        gods
       </em>
       besides him.  First commandment, right?  Doesn't that intimate the existence of other gods?  :)

       Sure they had their powers, but every theologian/teacher I’ve talked to would agree that came from Satan, who’s great at copycat/lying. If other gods existed, why wouldn’t Baal have burnt the offering in the OT when the prophets were summoning him?

       Hey, no one is saying that figures like Baal wouldn't have to kowtow to God, if they were real.  Or, maybe invocation isn't an absolute thing.  And maybe if you worship another "god", you are automatically cast into Satan's lot.  Actually, that makes a lotta sense.

       Well, that's why this age is interesting, because with information we get to really see who is on who's "side", in a way.  Funny how fame and/or the search for it may be one of the things that sets the baddies apart.  If you've ever looked at old magicians' posters, many used to credit the devil or satan (so much so that it was in every poster).  David Blaine even has.  It may be compulsive, like the Azazel reference in the recent Justin Timberlake video.  It's fascinating to me.

       Just that people who pray to demons or lesser entities for power  seem to have to pay homage to them in some way.  And with more information being out there, it's becoming more and more clear who those people are.  Like, why are Jay-Z and Marina Abramovic
       <em>
        tight
       </em>
       ?   Strange bedfellows if ya ask me.

       The poles are absolutely shifting, it's only a matter of time before the full switch happens. Because of the pole shift we also losing our magnetosphere. We are also entering into a grand solar minimum, some are even predicting a mini ice age type event.

       Hey, no one is saying that figures like Baal wouldn't have to kowtow to God, if they were real.  Or, maybe invocation isn't an absolute thing.  And maybe if you worship another "god", you are automatically cast into Satan's lot.  Actually, that makes a lotta sense.

       Just that people who pray to demons or lesser entities for power  seem to have to pay homage to them in some way.  And with more information being out there, it's becoming more and more clear who those people are.  Like, why are Jay-Z and Marina Abramovic
       <em>
        tight
       </em>
       ?   Strange bedfellows if ya ask me.
