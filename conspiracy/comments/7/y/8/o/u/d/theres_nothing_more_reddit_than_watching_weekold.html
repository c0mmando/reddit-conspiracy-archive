    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;d say so. He&#39;s in charge. He has the house and the senate and the supreme court.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you can make the argument that Trump has been &quot;anti establishment&quot; in any way, either. He&#39;s done exactly what you&#39;d expect a Mitt Romney or a Bush to do - same appointments, same tax plan, same everything. Doesn&#39;t matter what he campaigned on or what promises he made, the proof is in the results.</p>

<p>I disagree that he has absolute control over these things. He quite simply doesn&#39;t. I&#39;m unclear if your just unaware of how things work on the hill but it takes a majority to pass things. And not all Republicans are so eager to get on board. Take immigration reform as an example. Polls show Americans overwhelmingly want it. They&#39;ve wanted it for some time. I personally believe his plan is fair. And yet where are we with it? Democrats want the votes, Republicans want the cheap labor. That&#39;s what this boils down to. THEY don&#39;t want to fix it and since it takes a majority in Congress to make law, no progress has been made. And whether you want to admit it or not he&#39;s been very clear on what he&#39;d sign. And yet nothing can get through Congress. It&#39;s disappointing how there&#39;s such a misconception of how things actually work. I do believe he&#39;s been trying to do what he promised. He&#39;s just getting stonewalled by Congress.</p>

<p>I always look at it this way: He has all these plans, and he gets in there, and he&#39;s got the Bankster Crew running shit on 1 side, the M.I.C + AIPAC + Zionists + FEDeral Reserve on the other, the I.C&#39;s on the other, the relationship with Saudis has to be good because they can crash the Dollar, the globalists want war, the Citizens want they want, and basically, he&#39;s very limited with what he can do with all the groups that surround him.</p>

<p>So for example, if he wants to hook up the people, he has to also hook up each of the groups just mentioned with something, and pay a price for every move.</p>

<p>Tax cuts, my checks are bigger, as are the ones of everyone I know. Did not sign TPP/Paris Agreement, globalist scams.

    <div class="md"><p>Again I&#39;m not an economic wizard and was a kid in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s, but I remember people had jobs. There was a booming middle class. Remember the &quot;yuppies&quot;? They weren&#39;t 1%ers. They were middle class. You can laugh at me all you want. I think Trump want&#39;s to bring back the 80&#39;s. Which means jobs, jobs, jobs. It also means crazy military spending and a massive war on drugs. Those two things scare me. But after watching my town fall the fuck apart, watching the protest/riots in Ferguson and Baltimore, which I believe has more to do with folks having no hope because the jobs they once had either moved across the border or across the ocean, I&#39;m willing to sell my soul a bit to get people back on their feet and give them hope of a better life again. And in case you weren&#39;t aware, the tax cuts are for you too. And I believe Ted Cruz has introduced a bill that would make those tax cuts as permanent as the corporate ones. Will the Democrats get on board or will they stonewall because it&#39;s coming from a Republican? Maybe you should contact your representative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Technically the decline started in the 60&#39;s. Did you notice the sharp drop off that began in 2000? There&#39;s no doubt in my mind that NAFTA played a ginormous role in that. Trump had a meeting with members of Congress the other day that didn&#39;t get much media attention regarding tariffs. I read the transcript of the meeting and what I found most revealing is that the Democrats in the room were more eager than a few of the Republicans to enact fairer tariffs on things like steel being shipped into the US. That&#39;s the kind of shit that has had a negative impact on manufacturing jobs in the US. That&#39;s the kind of stuff I expect from a president. Looking out for American workers. And that&#39;s precisely why if Trump renegotiates NAFTA or pulls out entirely I&#39;ll be all in 2020. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m somewhat unclear on exactly when they left but according to this report it was at least as early as 2010.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During their meeting in 2010, Obama asked Jobs how to bring all the iPhone manufacturing jobs back to the United States, according to the New York Times.</p>

<p>&quot;Those jobs aren&#39;t coming back,&quot; Jobs replied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/10/17/technology/apple-china-jobs/index.html">http://money.cnn.com/2012/10/17/technology/apple-china-jobs/index.html</a></p>

<p>Also from the same article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mitt Romney said the solution is &quot;very straightforward.&quot; The United States must pressure China to stop manipulating its currency, he said, and the federal government needs to &quot;make America the most attractive place for entrepreneurs&quot; by lowering taxes. He supports reducing the top corporate tax rate to 25%, down from its current 35%. President Obama offered a starker answer: &quot;Candy, there are some jobs that are not going to come back, because they&#39;re low-wage, low-skill jobs.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is what they are bringing back:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.  That&#39;s a huge fucking stretch.  What left is manufacturing jobs and what&#39;s coming back is 38 billion in under-taxed revenue that they earned under Obama but were doing so well that they could afford to just let it sit offshore while they waited for someone like Trump to get elected and give them a blowjob of a tax bill.  </p>

<p>Those manufacturing jobs aren&#39;t coming back and these guys just gave Apple a huge tax break.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s less you can never question them and more that the Republican Party suddenly started turning on the IC after one of their own was investigated. Fox News is putting the CIA on blast for supporting a war they were calling people traitors for not supporting a decade ago.</p>

<p>It’s really not hard to see why when trump, who has a long history of lieing and Fox News and people like Sean hannity suddenly launch gigantic smear campaigns against something liberals start wondering why that is.</p>

<p>You’re reasoning is the IC has a very checkered past, which is true, but the people asking us to trust them are Fox News and newt Gingrich, all the while doing the exact same thing the IC has been doing for decades: trying to frame every act of liberal civil disobedience as domestic terrorism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember not that long ago the left was pro free speech and pro civil liberties. The only difference between then and now is that Trump was surveyed using that system and the left want&#39;s Trump gone no matter how. No doubt Fox and Hannity especially, are pushing a narrative. But it&#39;s just a counter to what the rest of MSM has been pushing for a minute now. </p>

<p>I was scared after 9/11. I think a lot of were. So when the Patriot Act was passed I went along with it. But it wasn&#39;t too long before I recognized that they were using fear as a motivating source and I took issue with it and Bush. I voted for Obama not once but twice and he did the same. Those agencies have a lot of power. And we all know what power does. Especially when it goes unchecked and their people go unaccountable.</p>

<p>I understand that lots of folks don&#39;t like Trump. I didn&#39;t vote for him. I recognized he&#39;s quite the manipulator. But Clinton is too. We all watched her lie repeatedly about those damn emails. We watched the FBI close a case because they deemed her &quot;intent&quot; wasn&#39;t there. That&#39;s shit we&#39;d be in prison for and I believe deep down you know this. That&#39;s the same FBI that took an unsubstantiated piece of evidence to a FISA court to get a warrant to wiretap folks. This shit is real. And if it happened in 2016 who knows how many other times it&#39;s happened.</p>

A much better argument would be pointing out that <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7t90pv/id_like_to_hear_an_explanation_for_why_trump/">Trump added Goldman Sachs cronies to his staff.</a> </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen several variations of this same argument, and all you have to consider is this: If you want to make Trump supporters out to be &quot;pro-Establishment,&quot; pro-government bootlickers, everyone who now trusts the Intelligence community, the Democrats, the anti-Trump Republicans, and the anti-Trump side of the media are also bootlickers. I think it&#39;s most reasonable to distrust both factions of power because both factions have proven themselves to be liars over and over again. </p>

<p>A lot of conspiracy theorists and other &quot;anti-Establishment&quot; types have taken a liking to one or more of the rare &quot;anti-establishment&quot; presidential candidates or politicians. That might include Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Trey Gowdy, Bernie Sanders, Gary Johnson, and yes, even Trump. These politicians have marketed themselves as &quot;anti-establishment.&quot; If one of them becomes president, there will be some conspiracy theorists who support that president. When these conspiracy theorists see that the FBI, CIA, NSA, and almost the entire media have a clear agenda against Trump, that could reinforce their belief that Trump is doing <em>something</em> that they don&#39;t like. If Trump was completely in bed with &quot;the establishment,&quot; then we wouldn&#39;t see such a uniform anti-Trump attitude coming from the Intelligence Community and most of the media. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or there are different factions of the establishment, or maybe major media organizations are capitalist and are capitalizing on the anti-trump market, or maybe a lot of truth just happens to be anti-trump.</p>

<p>Trump has made incredibly pro-republican establishment moves, he has endlessly pandered to the establishment through religion and unquestioning faith in law enforcement </p>

<p>Trump can simultaneously be hated by a lot of establishment figures but also give them everything they want, personally I don’t think the powers that be are going to give a crazy reality tv host the keys to the country unless he agrees on some terms and conditions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The downvotes on my comment after that user posted that shows this tactic works. You can make anyone seem like a Trump supporter if you just claim that they are, even when you support your assertion by claiming the person says &quot;Trump&quot; a lot on Reddit, therefore they must support Trump. TIL anyone who discusses Trump often must support him. Ridiculous... </p>

I think some of it has to do with ShareBlue being banned in politics. I think we got a few refugees. That and the FBI/DOJ/HRC collusion conspiracy theory really took off and there are folks trying to bury that line of thought. Don&#39;t be discouraged. Keep positing counter arguments and citing facts and links. True conspiracy theorists recognize what this is. I think the Russian bot&#39;s narrative being pushed will be somewhat eye opening for many folks who were oblivious to this tactic. I think&#39;s it&#39;s quite possible it could have the opposite effect than what they were intending for it to have. Bots/shills exist and they aren&#39;t all Russian.</p>

I’ve been posting on reddit everyday for like 7 years (multiple accounts for different subs). I only got to the top of an askreddit thread once. Maybe I’m just posting in the wrong threads since I don’t really participate in political discussions, but I regularly see people from the_donald and politics with your level of karma and every post they have is around 5k upvotes. They are either brigading or being brigaded without them knowing. Either option is unsettling since I think it takes like 30 karma and a few supporting posts to trick the hive mind.</p>

<p>Either way, reading someone&#39;s post history is a completely valid way of determining what kind of bias filter you should apply to their comments.  Which is also completely valid.  Back in the days where conservatives and liberals could actually have conversations I used to listen to a conservative talk show where the host&#39;s main theme was &quot;Tell me where you sit before you tell me where you stand.&quot;. It makes a lot of sense.  For instance, let&#39;s say someone wants to have a conversation with me about differences between the races.  If that person is a professor of anthropology I would be interested to hear their views.  If that person has swastika and 88 tattoos, not so much.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember when Reddit tried to aid the shilling by banning people from even calling shills out?</p>

<p>The reasoning was: &quot;It hurts people&#39;s feelings to be called shills. Therefore we will ban anyone who even SUGGESTS that astroturfing goes on by political advocacy groups, George Soros, or ShareBlue.&quot;</p>

<p>In other words, they don&#39;t want attention called to the phenomenon for fear of it losing its efficacy.</p>

<p>They wanted us all to shut up about it, so that the shills could go about their work with impunity and no push-back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The downvote brigading over the past few days has gone to record levels from what I&#39;ve seen ever since this russian narrative started getting pushed hard. Many of the suspicious comments, if you check their histories, are putting an insane amount of effort into buried threads to discredit and bury the opposing comments. r/canada now has a post too pushing this narrative and a insane amount of downvoting happened to anyone who questioned it or even mentioned ctr. Much of this happened between 1am and 3am while most of Canada was asleep. The irony of bots and shrills pushing a narrative of russian bots and shrills is pretty amusing but damn orwellian</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again I&#39;m not an economic wizard and was a kid in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s, but I remember people had jobs. There was a booming middle class. Remember the &quot;yuppies&quot;? They weren&#39;t 1%ers. They were middle class. You can laugh at me all you want. I think Trump want&#39;s to bring back the 80&#39;s. Which means jobs, jobs, jobs. It also means crazy military spending and a massive war on drugs. Those two things scare me. But after watching my town fall the fuck apart, watching the protest/riots in Ferguson and Baltimore, which I believe has more to do with folks having no hope because the jobs they once had either moved across the border or across the ocean, I&#39;m willing to sell my soul a bit to get people back on their feet and give them hope of a better life again. And in case you weren&#39;t aware, the tax cuts are for you too. And I believe Ted Cruz has introduced a bill that would make those tax cuts as permanent as the corporate ones. Will the Democrats get on board or will they stonewall because it&#39;s coming from a Republican? Maybe you should contact your representative.</p>
