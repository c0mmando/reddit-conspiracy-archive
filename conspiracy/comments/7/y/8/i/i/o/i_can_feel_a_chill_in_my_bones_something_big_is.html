    <div class="md"><p>I feel like our government is really eager to get the war on guns over with and the next event is going to be one of the worst, and possibly the final flag before our second amendment is taken from us. The SXSW (Sound by Southwest) music festival is coming up and there are nearly as many attendants as Coachella, but less security (as far as I know) because it is not as well marketed and well known. I think this could possibly end up as another slaughter of innocent Americans used to gain traction in the war on guns and I just have a terrible feeling about it. Obviously I have little to no evidence supporting my claim but since we&#39;re just talking about bad feelings, there&#39;s mine. And if it isn&#39;t at the music festival, I still feel a horrible attack coming after the recent shooting. Then they will finally remove our right to bear arms and if anyone objects, they are SELFISH and BLIND because so many Americans have just been killed by GUNS! I mean, anyone who objects must WANT Americans to die, right?! Probably gonna get investigated for making this comment after what&#39;s happened but the gov. has shown their eagerness to once and for all take our means of self defense through the frequency of recent shootings that have been controversially investigated and have evidence of possible premeditation by our own government.</p>

Just find a King James Bible and believe every word of it.  All of these shows like GOT are depicting the future return of Jesus Christ when he comes not as the Lamb to be sacrificed but as the Lion to conquer the world.

<p>Rev 19:11  And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.
 </p>

<p>Rev 19:12  His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.</p>

<p>Rev 19:13  And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.
 </p>

<p>Rev 19:14  And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.</p>

<p> 
Rev 19:15  And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.</p>

<p>Rev 19:16  And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.</p>

<p> 
Rev 19:17  And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;</p>

<p> 
Rev 19:18  That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.</p>

<p> 
Rev 19:19  And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.
 </p>

<p>Rev 19:20  And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.</p>

<p>Rev 19:21  And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh. </p>
