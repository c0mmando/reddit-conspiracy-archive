<p>Walking, eating, driving, or engaging in other activities while sleep, without remembering the next day have been reported. Abnormal behaviors may include, <strong><em>aggressiveness</em></strong>, agitation, <strong><em>hallucinations</em></strong> or confusion, in depressed patients, worsening of depression, including risk of suicide may occur. <strong><em>Alcohol may increase these risks</em></strong>    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>hmmm I don&#39;t know about you, but back in highschool is where I drank the most. </p>

<p>so, I pull up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eszopiclone">the wiki </a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eszopiclone, marketed by Sunovion under the brand-name Lunesta, is a nonbenzodiazepine <strong><em>hypnotic agent</em></strong> used in the treatment of insomnia.[2] <strong><em>It is slightly effective for this use.</em></strong>[2] Eszopiclone is the active dextrorotatory stereoisomer of zopiclone, and belongs to the class of drugs known as cyclopyrrolones. It is also classified as a therapeutic sedative hypnotic and pharmacological cyclopyrrolone.[3]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>wait.. wut? First of all, Hypnotic agent? seriously?  Maybe all this MK-ultra shit is just these people? but I digress. Notice Slightly effective? DUDE, for all these side effects this  better be on point? Risk vs reward. Is it worth it? How slightly effective are we talking about?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eszopiclone is slightly effective in the treatment of insomnia where difficulty in falling asleep is the primary complaint.[2] Kirsch et al. found the benefit over placebo to be of <strong><em>questionable</em></strong> clinical significance.[2]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>wait.. questionable? lol.  How questionable are we talking about?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a controversial 2009 article in the New England Journal of Medicine, &quot;Lost in Transmission — FDA Drug Information That Never Reaches Clinicians&quot;, it was reported that the largest of three Lunesta trials found that compared to placebo Lunesta &quot;was superior to placebo&quot; while it only shortened initial time falling asleep by 15 minutes on average. &quot;Clinicians who are interested in the drug’s efficacy cannot find efficacy information in the label: it states only that Lunesta is superior to placebo. The FDA’s medical review provides efficacy data, albeit not until page 306 of the 403-page document. In the longest, largest phase 3 trial, patients in the Lunesta group reported falling asleep an average of <strong><em>15 minutes faster and sleeping an average of 37 minutes longer</em></strong> than those in the placebo group. However, on average, Lunesta patients still met criteria for insomnia and reported no clinically meaningful improvement in next-day alertness or functioning.&quot;[19]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>JESUS FUCKING CHRIST.  You&#39;re telling me we have agitated suicidal zombies walking around for fucking 37 extra minutes of nap time?   </p>

<p>Ok, ok ok.. this can&#39;t be that bad. how many people are on this shit?  I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s hard to find that kind of information, but ....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Texas poison control centers reported that during 2005–2006 there were 525 total eszopiclone overdoses recorded in the state of Texas, the <strong><em>majority of which were intentional suicide attempts.</em></strong>[13]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, this is for that reply who is going to say  &quot;bro.. they have to report everything.. it rarely happens, even if it happens once, the have to report it.&quot;  READ IT AGAIN.  *** 2005–2006 there were 525 total eszopiclone overdoses... majority of which were intentional suicide attempts*** </p>

<p>These numbers are alarming! How many people are taking this without any issues? 90%? more? doesn&#39;t matter! you have approx 500 suicide attempts in ONE year, in ONE state, on ONE drug! HOLY SHIT! and this data is from 10 years ago! Im sure it&#39;s a lot more now. I&#39;m surprised we don&#39;t have more of these events honestly. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how we are going to get ourselves out of this predicament. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you wanna go down a real rabbit hole, look up what L Ron Hubbard was saying all the way back in the 50&#39;s. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our enemies are less than twelve men. They are members of the Bank of England and other higher financial circles. They own and control newspaper chains and they, oddly enough, run all the mental health groups in the world that had sprung up […]. Their apparent programme was to use mental health, which is to say psychiatric electric shock and pre-frontal lobotomy, to remove from their path any political dissenters […]. These fellows have gotten nearly every government in the world to owe them considerable quantities of money through various chicaneries and they control, of course, income tax, government finance — [Harold] Wilson, for instance, the current Premier of England, is totally involved with these fellows and talks about nothing else actually</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interestingly the horror stories don&#39;t start until his successor David Miscavage took control of the entire organization while LRH was living in international waters hiding from US Intelligence agencies. When he died soon after, Miscavage declared himself successor with no written record, just a claim that LRH appointed him on his death bed. Tons of original members bailed at that point, and some say that Miscavage himself was a CIA infiltrator who turned the organization into what it is today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m sorry to hear about your buddy, and I hope he finds peace soon.</p>

<p>I can vouch for that bullshit as well, I don’t know if it was PTSD, but after my first deployment(combat) it took me a really long time to reintegrate, and I still don’t think I have 100%, back into normalcy.</p>

<p>I was given Lunesta (among a heap of others) to help both with my insomnia and anxiety.</p>

<p>Now, admittedly, I had some issues with my temper, but it was never too rough. 
While on Linesta I was definitely more agitated, maybe that’s just more anger from being tired and taking another shit pill, but still.
I had a freak out that was a lot more aggressive than it should have been.</p>

<p>None of that crap works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I nearly lost my marriage and my life due to this &quot;autopilot&quot; thing. After a car wreck, I was prescribed 500mg pills of percoset for pain as needed. I went through 80 of those pills in a month and a half. This was 5 years ago. I can not recall many things from a year before the wreck or after. I would do things that made no sense. My wife tells me all the time that I acted like a normal person, but I wasn&#39;t me. I was becoming someone else. Look it up. Percoset can literally change who you are. I didn&#39;t realize I had a problem until we were halfway across the country for some emergency marriage counciling. I came down hard off the pills. I got very sick. I will never go down that road again. </p>

I got Tboned from a car going about 50mph. I didn&#39;t see her and she didn&#39;t see me so it was full force. Our cars didn&#39;t separate either. It was the worst pain I&#39;ve ever experieced. The worst part was that they didn&#39;t all break at the same time. Hairline fractures in two of those ribs snapped one morning when I woke up a few days later. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>in high school, my buddies and i found that mixing dextromethorphan (coricidin, cough medicine) with diphenhydramine (sominex, sleeping pills) would lead us into what can only be described as a dream world. One moment I&#39;d be tripping balls in the backyard, room, park,etc. the next i&#39;d be submerged into a different reality experiencing tactile sensations, audio and visual hallucinations and full blown conversations with beings, people, memories and such. In hindsight, i realize how stupid we were for this and many other drug things. A few of my friends didn&#39;t make it out of those years unscathed and are now medicated as an attempt to reverse something that fried or popped in their heads, or maybe they saw something that scared them on the inner side. Anyways, man-made drugs are..probably,most definitely..not good..sometimes.</p>

<p>Even scarier, though, IMO is Cogentin. It&#39;s an atropine-based drug they use for Parkinson&#39;s. Holy hell, don&#39;t take this stuff.

    <div class="md"><p>I know the exact post black-out blankmind feel you mean. what a fuckin trip, my neighbors called cops cuz i was trying to use my key on their door for a good 20 minutes i guess. Cops found me sitting on my porch <em>talking</em> to my buddy who left hours earlier.  I don&#39;t think i ever fucked with cogentin, the puddle thing you mention evokes a very particular sort of scary though. i&#39;m happy to hear you made it out too. <strong>we&#39;re sages now, don&#39;t forget.</strong></p>

<p>I take melatonin on the nights i can&#39;t sleep and it works really well.  </p>

<p>I took a prescription sleeping pill from a doctor for about 4 days a couple years ago. I woke up with a nosebleed every day.  I told the doctor next time i went back and he said to stop taking them. </p>

<p>Yeah no shit guy. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t even go in for a sleeping problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s an interesting TED talk that I saw awhile back talking about this very thing. It&#39;s important when Dr.&#39;s are prescribing things for us to ask about NNT. The numbers needed to treat. It&#39;s something I don&#39;t think many think about. I think a lot of folks like an easy fix to something, popping a pill. I personally know folks with this line of thought. In any case this is a link to that talk if your interested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was on anti-depressants for years for chronic clinical depression. I never got better.</p>

<p>I quit taking them and grew magic mushrooms so I could microdose. The mushrooms cured my depression. Psychotropic meds are fucking poison that create a psychic prison or psychic ruts that you can&#39;t get out of. They, the anti-depressants, may have kept me alive, my life, however, was very monochromatic. Now, it&#39;s full technicolor (as an analogy, I&#39;m not permanently tripping).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of this is misunderstanding warning labels and drug effects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Alcohol may increase these risks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is referring to the risks of the drug. If you take the drug and alcohol as well, the chances of those effects occur. If you don&#39;t take the drug, just alcohol won&#39;t do anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>wait.. wut? First of all, Hypnotic agent? seriously?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A hypnotic agent basically puts you to sleep. Makes you tired/exhausted/sleepy. Lunesta is a sleep medication. It&#39;s the intended effect and what people buy it for.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Notice Slightly effective? DUDE, for all these side effects this better be on point? Risk vs reward. Is it worth it? How slightly effective are we talking about?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s just legalese. Have you never taken sleeping pills before? Takes about a half hour to kick in, and it makes you tired, like yawning and such. Melatonin does something similar with much less sides and risks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>wait.. questionable? lol. How questionable are we talking about?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s questionable that it treats insomnia and actually helps you fall asleep. Not questionable that it makes you tired/sleepy. So basically they think it might just make you tired, but not actually help you sleep.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. You&#39;re telling me we have agitated suicidal zombies walking around for fucking 37 extra minutes of nap time? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>People usually take sleeping pills to get to sleep, not to sleep longer. But yes, 15 minutes is about what you&#39;d expect for this. Melatonin works in about 30 mins. 15 is kinda quick. Most people fall asleep within 7 minutes, and peopel like me who have a hard time can take up to an hour. Which would give about 30 mins of extra sleep. This matches the findings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>READ IT AGAIN. *** 2005–2006 there were 525 total eszopiclone overdoses... majority of which were intentional suicide attempts*** </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Most people who make suicide attempts OD on pills found in their home. That&#39;d mean stuff like lunesta would be on the top of the list.</p>

<p>But yes, welcome to the world of barely effective pharmaceutical drugs. When you actually dig into what they do, they don&#39;t seem so great anymore, huh? It isn&#39;t a conspiracy. This is just what the drug actually does, and it&#39;s a well known effect.</p>

<p>Yeah, it means it puts people to sleep. It doesn&#39;t mean to hypnotise them...</p>

<p>All benzodiazepines have the same properties whether it be Valium, Xanax and so on, just at different levels.</p>
