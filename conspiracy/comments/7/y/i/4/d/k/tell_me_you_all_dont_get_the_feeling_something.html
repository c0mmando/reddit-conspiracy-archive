I dismissed the whole fake alien invasion theory at first but goddamn everyday I look at this world and it’s problems I feel something ominous coming in the future and I know you can feel it too, I can’t be the only one. I don’t mean that there will be a fake alien invasion but something of that magnitude that will still in the end fuck us is coming. My bullshit detector has just been off the charts lately idk just with everything in the news and  everything else being released just feels like an ever failing disguise for something terrible that will eventually be revealed that will cause some kinda anarchy idk. I’m not just talking about TPTB and the elite and their existence or pedogate and stuff I mean even crazier shit than that that many of TPTB know, and it seems like more and more people know everyday figure it out and can’t say anything. Idk that’s just the feelings I’ve been getting recently considering our current events. I may be going crazy, or not, who knows anymore with this age of information you would think people wouldn’t be more uncertain than ever like we are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you’re not crazy. I feel it happening too, it seems like we are on the verge of global economic collapse. You can feel it just by walking around I feel like. I don’t feel like people are as sociable as they used to be. There is no longer a great sense of community among the people. Everyone kind of seems isolated. I have a strong feeling this is the case for many people even though my life is like this to the extreme. Also I believe stuff like this was completely orchestrated by the top or the Illuminati, and what is happening is just a natural reaction to what they have done to us. </p>

<p>But a more factual way to look at it would be like this. Did you know 41 million Americans are below the poverty line and that number is growing every day? Did you know the bottom 90% is having to spend more and more percentage of their income on housing and groceries, and in turn they aren’t able to pay for as many luxuries, and vacations. More and more people are having to accept government benefits. The middle class is being completely wiped out and I feel like TPTB are just trying to build up a control grid so they can monitor us and make sure we don’t leave or have an uprising when this economic depression hits. </p>

<p>I think your instincts are right on. There has been a lot of horrid events throughout human history, it’s just part of the life cycle. It’s too bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, too. My mom told me that her investment guy called her earlier this week and told her that her bonds are maturing and she will need to reinvest in new bonds, but he won&#39;t be able to get the same interest rate....it will be much lower.

    <div class="md"><p>Your mother should listen to her financial advisor. Interest rates have been low since 2008 so not getting the rates she was getting is no surprise. Don’t listen to the idiots on here to not buy Treasury Bonds. You mother needs the interest from the bonds to live on; not investing will result in her burning through her balance in short order. Hugging your family like one of the replys stayed won’t pay for utilities or food; very bad advice. Your mom can buy Corporate Bonds which have a lot higher interest rate than treasury bonds currently have.  She can also invest in stocks/mutual funds that pay dividends and capital gains but are slightly more riskier than treasury bonds. I’m 64 years old and been retired for several years and never owned a Treasury Bond because the coupon rate is so low. Have your mom ask her financial advisor for some different ways to make money while keeping her balance intact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes I agree on an economic collapse. while I agree with a lot of the posters points here on: there is always &quot;something&quot; happening, behind closed doors, or the powers to be &quot;want&quot; you to think something big is going to happen; I truly think that the &quot;BIG&quot; thing that WILL happen will be another economic collapse.</p>

<p>And it will continue to happen as long as we have the current economic system in place. over and over and over again. well... maybe once most of the population is literally feeding off dog scraps on the streets, there won&#39;t be too many crashes anymore... oh well, let&#39;s do our best.</p>

Hello Globalism. 
This is why all people of every race and religion should question the narrative of Multiculturalism<sup>tm.</sup> There is no such thing. Once you mix everyone up, EVERYONE loses touch with their cultural identity and we become a nation of consumers. Our identity will be rooted in consumption. You see it everywhere today. Real life is compared to Star Wars tropes, Trump is compared to Voldemort, Africa is just like Wakanda. </p>

<p>The elites want nothing more than a group of people so thoroughly mixed up that they have no identity to fall back on for support. Take someones cultural identity, you take their means of defense as they have nothing to defend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to point out that one of the mechanisms of control imposed on us is the &quot;fear of impending disaster&quot;... </p>

<p>They want people to fear a global catastrophe or the next &quot;9/11&quot; all the while they are slowly degrading and taking away our rights from under our noses.</p>

<p>They take the &quot;boiling frog&quot; approach. It is slow and calculated and one day we will wake up under complete slavery and wonder wtf happenned.</p>

<p>The &quot;huge&quot; thing is currently happening, and has been happening for a long time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been building since the 50&#39;s. They realized how much trouble the general populace could be when they had power. Kings lost influence, CEO&#39;s lost profit, and the common man realized his time was worth a comfortable life. They&#39;ve been slowly chipping away since then, here and there introducing things like video games, HDTV, computers, better and more powerful cars, casinos, fast food, etc to make us more docile and comfortable while not increasing our actual value and by letting wages stagnate while corporate profits climb. </p>

<p>We&#39;re ~70-ish years in. Most people that fought against the communist and Nazi regimes in WW2, the Korean War, Vietnam, etc are all dead or on their way. (Vietnam ended ~45 years ago, meaning the youngest people involved would be ~60-65 now if you add the minimum 18 years old age to join.)</p>

<p>During that time, we have the hippy movement in the 70&#39;s, the crack/poverty epidemics in the 80s/90&#39;s, and a general dumbing down of the population both by easing the curriculum and by students voluntarily deciding school/education is stupid. </p>

<p>Now, we have the internet. It combines the dumbing down with allowing those with fringe beliefs to strengthen their ideals while selectively ignoring everyone else&#39;s by blocking anyone they don&#39;t agree with and only going to websites/forums that align with their beliefs.  And it&#39;s still being controlled enough that they can keep pushing the racial narrative, the GOP v Dem narrative, the middle-class v lower-class narrative, etc etc etc. They can do all this while hiding the real problems like mental health, an overmedicated populace, and the fact that the top 1% continues to amass wealth while the rest of us stay where we are or go down. </p>

<p>In the grand scheme of things, they aren&#39;t doing this for them. It&#39;s too soon for them. They&#39;re doing it for their kids and grandkids and history of the empire. The Soros&#39; and the Clinton&#39;s of the world know they can&#39;t effect change fast enough. 70 (A human lifetime-ish) years isn&#39;t enough, but 140 is, and 210 is almost long enough to have completely erased any true history and replaced it with your own narrative. It&#39;s totalitarianism in a connected society. </p>

<p>Having money allows you to spend more time thinking and planning for the future, while being paycheck to paycheck makes you worry about your own present and getting your kids to 18. And the more you can think and pre-plan, the more you can focus on a real long-term strategy rather than a &quot;five-year plan&quot; or a human-life long strategy. </p>

<p>We&#39;ll never win if we stay divided and their wealth keeps growing. We&#39;ll just keep losing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spread positivity don&#39;t let the negitive feeling you feel take over. If everyone is positive we will be positive. If something did happen would you rather, you and everyone go through it positive? Letting go and feeling relief is healthy. Idk if your religious but either way if your not evil whatever happens will be positive..we all know REAL evil. It&#39;s not most everyday normal people. I always just think will be in a good place or a higher state of consciousness with the people you love or maybe even born again. The soul is real and who knows what happens. While we are here we need to get rid of the evil in the country and world though...then maybe we can advance to something bigger.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve decided that there is nothing I can do about it anyway so there&#39;s no point in stressing about it. I&#39;m going to continue to live my life and do what I can to make my family and myself happy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I felt it too man and it has been a very hard couple weeks for me. I have been absolutely glued to my phone, like you had to pry it away from my face with a crowbar. I have been obsessively refreshing my Twitter feed, afraid that something else in the world has gone to shit. I’d get engrossed in replies with people arguing one way or the other about every topic imaginable - gun rights, human rights, politics, sports, everything.</p>

<p>And then I deleted Twitter, Facebook, and everything else that I kept obsessively checking up on in my phone (not reddit obviously but I’m working on just making it an at-my-PC-only activity). I couldn’t take it anymore. I was up at 4 AM obsessively refreshing and wondering who was being shot at today, or whose career would be ruined by another allegation, and it got too overwhelming. The most sickening thing was that I would be trying to feed my 6 month old his bottle with one arm so I could keep the other hand free in case I needed to check Twitter again.</p>

<p>This shit is making us paranoid and addicted like only the hardest street drugs can. I put my god damn phone down for like 2 days straight this weekend and enjoyed my children, enjoyed the sunlight, tackled some home improvement projects, took my wife out to lunch and just enjoyed her presence and you know what? This place is better than we give it credit for. </p>

<p>I’m not saying we are going to be okay in the long run, I’m not even convinced we’re going to make it to 2020. But media has absolutely created this atmosphere of fear and paranoia and panic, and if you aren’t careful you are gonna get swept up in the bullshit tidal wave my friend.</p>

<p>All I’m saying is... try to surround yourself with what really matters in your world.  Protect your own first and foremost, then worry about everyone else in ascending order of what/who you can or cannot live without easiest.</p>

<p>I hope this helps brother, I definitely feel the negative energy you’re experiencing and I’m not saying turn a blind eye to it because that would be foolish. Just keep your loved ones close and don’t take them for granted. It’s all you can do during this turbulent times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if the ultimate conspiracy is that we create our realities out of our fear or our love... what if you and others aligned with your beliefs create a version of reality in alignment with your beliefs... the more people and the stronger their beliefs align might they create a version of reality that splits off and creates that which aligns most with their combined beliefs? IDK, but might be worth investigating. I choose as many days as possible to believe in a wave of monumental goodness sweeping across the world and changing it every day for the better. It&#39;s my dream, and every day I see more and more evidence it is coming true. Yep, you might call me crazy, but I&#39;ll take my version and belief in some huge coming to reality over every belief that the something huge is bad. That&#39;s not my cup of tea but I will never deny you the right to believe in the future you want to either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I see it is shit goes wrong then the change will be quick and we&#39;ll live or die. As long as our communities learn and work together survival is possible. Know how to grow food, know how to make a fire and know how to fire a gun. Keep growing and hope for the best.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen countless &quot;something big is coming&quot; post over the years and nothing that dramatic has change. Sure the MSM landscape has changed to be a bit more reality TV then we&#39;re used to but thats the natural progression of the circus. Its all about the game and how you play it. Its all about control and who you give it over to. Be it yourself or some absurdly rich magi dickheads who are more demon then human. End of the day yeah shit is really kind of terrible if you look at the big picture, but all you have is the bubble you live in and what kind of influence you push out there.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not going crazy, you&#39;re just beginning to grasp just how absurd this world is. Need to make sure you balance your life properly, enjoy it now while you can. If the world does goes to shit may as well enjoy &quot;The Good Times&quot; as much as we can right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m burned out on these sorts of feelings, honestly.  You sense something big coming, and sure it comes, but then it just goes over your head and we all sort of keep going somehow.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in Utopia any more, in either the positive or the negative sense.  The universe tends towards equilibrium.  That means you&#39;re not going to get Heaven, but you&#39;re not going to get Hell either.  Granted, some might say that in theoretical or legal terms it keeps gradually getting less free, but I&#39;ve been living in my bedroom for most of my life anyway, so I&#39;ve never really noticed all that much.  In my experience, humanity is only really unhappy as a collective.  Alone, and with God, you can be as happy as you want.</p>
