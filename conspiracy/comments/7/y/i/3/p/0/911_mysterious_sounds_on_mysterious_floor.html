        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey all! I&#39;m looking for a video that I just remembered hearing a few years ago. It was a pretty long interview (I think for a podcast), on YouTube, of a former World Trade Center employee. He talks about some of the odd power downs that were going on weeks before 9/11, and of particular note - mentions that there was a mysterious floor where loud &quot;dump truck&quot; sounding machines could be heard. He said it would rattle the floors below, and kick down dust from the ceiling... something along those lines. I believe he also said the sounds frightened him because they felt abnormal.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not Willy Rodriguez &amp; <em>his</em> mysterious 34th floor story, but I wonder if they&#39;re related?? </p>

<p>Anybody know what I&#39;m talking about? If you do, please post that interview below! I can&#39;t seem to find it anywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, not. I&#39;ve heard these 2 before.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m referring to is a long interview from a few years back (2010? 2012?). He was a former employee in WTC, right up to 9/11. And in the middle of the interview, the guy mentions there was a floor that was known to be empty, but that a few days before 9/11 he heard lots of commotion on that floor... One sound he described like a &quot;dump truck&quot; which - if I remember correctly - he said caused him immense fear &amp; confusion...</p>

<p>Any others??</p>

<p>sounded like a dumpster on wheels rolling around above </p>

<p>Searching for that phrase in DuckDuckGo.com with &quot;9/11&quot; at the end resulted in this link: </p>

<p><a href="https://im42na.wordpress.com/tag/at-wtc-with-willy-rodriguez/">https://im42na.wordpress.com/tag/at-wtc-with-willy-rodriguez/</a> </p>

<p><a href="/u/prototrash">/u/prototrash</a> is this correct? </p>

<p>&quot;It was a powerful, ominous, “rumbling” sound of something extremely heavy being rolled about.  It sounded like a “huge metal dumpster on steel wheels, containing something extremely heavy–tons–being rolled around” a floor that he knew to have been totally empty–devoid even of furniture.  Yet, Rodriguez categorically maintains there was “someone” on that floor moving some monstrous contraption about.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a long interview (an hour? 45m?) with one person &amp; and an interviewer, professional quality audio, I think for a podcast circa 2010-2012. Possibly RedIceRadio, or John B. Wells, or something along those lines but I have no idea who specifically (could be an entirely different podcast / radio show). </p>

<p>I believe the interview had no accompanying video; it was a still Photoshop image, I think of a silhouetted person in front of a drawing or photo of a WTC hallway, but my memory may be failing me at this point.</p>

<p><a href="/u/TooMuchPork">/u/TooMuchPork</a> is the only one who&#39;s responded thus far who&#39;s also seen it. His recollection is spot on: &quot;He said dust was all over the window sills every morning even after he cleaned them. He heard carts rolling around above so he went to poke around and it was empty. The floor was vacant. No furniture or anything&quot;</p>

<p>Hope that helps! Still haven&#39;t found anything...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;As I stood there on the 33rd floor [on 9/11 while he was helping to evacuate people], I heard very strange noises on the 33rd floor. Now the 33rd floor was an empty floor, a floor that did not have any kind of walls or doors … It was totally hollowed out. There was nothing there and I heard very heavy equipment being moved around and it sounded like dumpsters with metal wheels being moved around and I got scared because I knew it was an empty floor. Nobody was supposed to be there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As a matter of fact, not even the elevators stopped there. You have to have a special access key to open the door on the 33rd floor. So to find that there were strange noises there … and I continued – bypassing that floor because I didn’t [need] to open the door on the 33rd floor.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you also recall hearing someone told not to go on a certain floor or something close like that? And/or this happened just before and to a few months before?</p>
