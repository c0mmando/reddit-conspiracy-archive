I would like to say that we would all learn to love each other for our differences and flaws, but given how division-oriented and tribal we are, that seems unlikely.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s solid advice.  But I will say some politicians will try this tactic, but slightly down play their skeletons, hoping that it wont be worth it for some one to bring up their old habits.</p>

<p>But their old habits may be a little worse than smoking some pot and going streaking through the neighborhood.  They may have some actual skeletons in their closet.</p>

<p>But yes own up be an adult and admit you fucked around as a kid or what ever.  And if you really screwed up then give a real apology if you&#39;re sorry, none of that Kevin spacey shit.</p>

<p>The difference is that is rumored and there is no physical evidence that Benjamin actually participated.</p>

<p>No doubt in my mind that older generations took part in salacious and compromising activities, but the technology to record it was limited and all one had was word of mouth. For generations to be, everything they do can be recorded both visually and audio-wise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that this is the truth. When that 10-year old audio clip of Donald Trump and Billy Bush sprang up during the election a chill ran up my spine. That was just a peek at what was possible - imagine how much compromising shit people who have sent a greater part of their lives growing up with the internet may have swirling around in the database. It doesn&#39;t even need to be something definitively horrible since any given context can be removed at the wielder&#39;s pleasure. All it takes is a reason to fish it out, sprinkle in some spin, and you&#39;ve got a potentially devastating scandal ready to go.</p>

<p>Trump was able to succeed despite this because his campaign was lightning in a bottle. If it were anyone else it wouldn&#39;t matter what the circumstances were; it would ruin them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Politics is dead or at the very least dying.  The division neccessary to maintain the illusion of safety created by our politicians is GONE.  Next step is to create a system where this cannot happen.  Have you done your research on the Anti-Federalist arguments (public debate regarding the construction of the US Constitution.  Look at it this way, all politicians recieve campaign funds, the giver of the funds will expect a return on the investment, the politician is corrupt from the git go.  Electing representatives is an absolute failure (look up Johnson&#39;s ballot box 14).  We must remove the corruption from Congress, how do we do this?  Random selection of citizens for a term of Congress.  Schools will be forced to teach critical teaching, people will be more focused on learning than the crap that is fed to them...the pluses are high.  The alternative is to repeat the same actions and expect different results.  What basis is there for this?  Our Bill of Rights - DAMN IT WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE OUR HAPPINESS - and our Congress is to politically polarized to find their own asses in the dark.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This shouldn&#39;t oppose us from running. Only stupid people will continue to vote in pedos, rapists, criminals, and thugs like they do today. </p>

<p>We must start becoming our reps, local city council members, senators and such before its too late. No matter how much shit they have on us. Change your life around, have a reason for your actions. And always do what is best for your community. </p>

<p>We all make mistakes. Society must not look at things as if they were some show on Netflix.</p>

<p>Use everything at your disposal to get young people to vote or encourage them to spend their money on things that matter. 
 i.e international ngo&#39;s, non-profits, local homeless etc. </p>

<p>We just have to believe it is possible that we can become politicians and not just activists. We have to encourage ourselves and others to believe the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Turns out politicians are mere humans with plenty skeletons in their closets. Who&#39;d have thought.</p>

<p>I mean, I fully get and understand your point but it&#39;d be all but delusional to think it has ever been any different from that. If public image and a persona of the &#39;good righteous guy/gal&#39; matters more to you than the human/person that&#39;s all good but it wasn&#39;t and won&#39;t ever be for me.</p>

<p>Since you brought up Hillary yourself: You just look at her and your intuition should tell you everything you need to know about her. If your alarmbells aren&#39;t ringing then I don&#39;t know what to tell you. The E-Mails are at best the tip of the iceberg of a very twisted nature that hopefully will never be truly revealed in all its depths, for the sake of the mental states of plenty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect that a lot of attitudes will change about your typical social media type of picture since people of the age to be in them have seen so many of them and been in so many of them they won&#39;t find them controversial.  Plus I suspect in 20 years pot will be effectively legalized nationally which will neutralize a lot of controversial photos.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also wonder how many digital photos will be lost, either because phones were lost, the computer they were backed up to was lost, the social media site went bust and disappeared, etc.  In some ways the Polaroid generation had more to fear, a shoebox of Polaroids seems harder to lose.</p>

<p>Nudes/sex pics may not even be that big of a deal.  In 20 years there might even be applications that let you take a normal picture of someone and feed it into some AI that finds the perfect nude body match and does a perfect photoshop on it.  When you can perfectly fake nude/sex photos of anyone, real nude/sex photos lose their impact.  It&#39;s not a scandal unless verifiable proof exists it&#39;s a real photo.</p>
