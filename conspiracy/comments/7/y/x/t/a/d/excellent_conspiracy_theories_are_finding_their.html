    <div class="md"><p>Generally, I find that people here are &quot;debunking&quot; the simpleton conspiracy theories commonly advocated are actually advocating deeper or more sophisticated conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>For instance, to think that &quot;Saudi&quot; assassins were responsible for Vegas shooting simply because either a &quot;Saudi&quot; owns some floors in the hotel or that some &quot;Saudi prince&quot; was in Vegas at the time is a &quot;simpleton theory.&quot;  By that, it is easy to spot, does not require any inventiveness, and was spotted by hundreds of people within hours of the shooting.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you did believe there was a conspiracy behind the Vegas shooting.  One that is very elaborate and sophisticated.  One that few people have seen yet, and even fewer people believe.  People like you want such ideas banned on this sub and only the &quot;official&quot; conspiracy theories can be discussed.  </p>

<p>Any &quot;sophisticated&quot; conspiracy theory is going to largely incorporate facts from the MSM.  The reason is that a sophisticated conspiracy would be so subtle as to not be easily spotted by hundreds of people within hours of executing the plot.  It will not be as simple as &quot;a Saudi owns the hotel.&quot;  Instead, it will be more like taking facts from various sources and uncovering hidden motivations and associations behind what the MSM is saying.  Obviously, analying motivations behind what the MSM is saying requires that you talk about what the MSM is saying and largely accept the core facts as true -- because a &quot;sophisticated&quot; theory is about the true motivation for those facts. </p>

<p>That is just a hypothesis, it can&#39;t really be &quot;debunked&quot; based on the evidence we have available. And it can be pretty clear what a person&#39;s intentions are. Someone who respectfully disagrees with a conclusion based on good evidence is fine. Those aren&#39;t the people I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>Someone who goes into a thread like you mentioned, thinking its a &quot;simpleton theory,&quot; already has a toxic mindset if you ask me. The point is to entertain a hypothesis and to see if any more leads can help expand on it. If you don&#39;t want to do that, and instead just want to reject a hypothesis straight away, you aren&#39;t helping, you&#39;re actually just shitting in the thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t the thread to &quot;debunk&quot; any theories.  Nor did I say it should be debunk.  Nor did I say it was not true.  What I said is that it was a &quot;simpleton&quot; theory.  Does not make it false.  Just makes it easy to spot, easy to understand.  Sometimes &quot;easy&quot; theories are correct.  </p>

<p>I have no interest in &quot;debunking&quot; it, because it holds no interst for me -- get this, because it is too simple.  Again, doesn&#39;t make it false, just boring.  It doesn&#39;t require that anyone use their brain or think creatively.  &quot;A suadi owns the hotel, so a suadi was behind the shooting.&quot;  Ok.  Got it.  In terms of entertainment value, for me, 0, zip, nadda.  </p>

<p>In any case, you state, &quot;That is just a hypothesis, it can&#39;t really be &quot;debunked&quot; based on the evidence we have available.&quot;  Ok, great.  Then no point in discussing it because it can&#39;t be proven either way.  It would be like saying,  &quot;Hey, I think a group of aliens in Alpha Centaury are planning to blow up the earth.&quot;  When people refuse to &quot;debunk&quot; my conspiracy theory or &quot;discuss it and expand on it,&quot; I accuse them of being &quot;toxic.&quot; See how it works?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>But this is a pretty strange attitude to take. People want to discuss it because they find that it might be true. By discussing it, you can come closer to a conclusion on whether it may be true or not. That&#39;s sort of the point of conspiracy theory discussion, imo. If they were easily capable of being proven true or false, they wouldn&#39;t be conspiracy theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just said we didn&#39;t have enough facts.  &quot;Discussing&quot; things does not create additional facts.  Perhaps when additional facts come out, those new facts can be discussed and determine whether they fit within any conspiracy theory.  </p>

<p>In any case, such theories are not worth discussing because no matter what facts come out, it will not disprove the theory.  The CIA could come out tomorrow and say &quot;Yep, it was us. He was running guns for us and we accidentally dosed him with MK Ultra drugs and he went crazy.&quot;  And the &quot;Saudi&quot; group will just say,  &quot;Yeah, the Saudis are the ones that dosed him because a Saudi owns the hotel.&quot;  If you can&#39;t understand why people do not like discussing such theories, perhaps read the following:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect</a>  </p>

<p>Neither.  But we have been watching how the MSM operates long enough to know that Trump isn&#39;t literally Hitler.  They went waaaaay too huge on the character assassination and it backfired, Trump won and they were calling for impeachment before he was even sworn in.  Now they have a problem on their hands that isn&#39;t going away with Russian Twitter trolls as an explanation.  </p>

No. Has he expanded private prisons and civil asset forfeiture. Yes. Seriously man, I see you here a lot. I respect your devotion. But Trump is not an the ally you thought he was.

<p>No he has been busy defending his right to the presidency by federal prosecutors and a bunch of blue haired retards wearing pussy hats.  Has he passed tax cuts? Yep has he fixed immigration? He has surely tried but again is dealing with le resist. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>It was actually a frequent subject here before /politics showed up and buries every mention of it.</p>

<p>Fact, without Trump the deep state wouldn&#39;t he an everyday term used and understood by most Americans.  The fake Media would be sucking Hillary&#39;s asshole and hardly anyone new would be questioning it.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Trump is going to fix everything that is wrong with the country but he has already caused a mass Awakening and we still have years to go.  Also investigating every fart produced by politicians is no longer off the table.  There will never be another president that gets a &quot;no questions asked&quot; free-pass from the media.  Trump has already exceeded my expectations so I&#39;m not going to just abandon him because of the latest rumor pushed by CTR/shareblue.  This is our only real change for reforming the government... Period!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I pay taxes too buddy. My break wasnt that significant because I&#39;m not rich. Plus the cut is only half of the equation. Some one is going to pay for all that debt. They pretty much just shifted the tax burden away from the wealthy and corporations. Now they are talking about raising the gas tax, slashing, medicaid, medicare, and educations budgets. And if they dont our taxes will have to go back up eventually anyway. </p>

<p>Hilary was a terrible but I dont think she would be threatening countries left and right like trump is. Trump is still bombing Syria, kept troops in Afghanistan, its trying his hardest to tear up the peace deal with Iran, push Israel into war, paying out big to the Saudis, is daring NK to launch missiles. Could it really get much worse? Also same thing will selling out economically. Maybe Clinton had good relations with Wall St. but Trump has surrounded himself by nobody but lobbyist. </p>

<p>Finally, socially has done nothing but divide us. His entire persona is to antagonize everyone he disagrees with. You think you have won some small battle against PC culture but Trump is just adding fuel to this fire. People still hate each other. Clinton may have been allied with a lot of annoying movements but like Obama was never came close to the mean spiritedness of Trump. I really dont see how anyone could be much worst than Trump. It&#39;s actually quite amazing how we can see things from such different perspectives. And really I dont know why I typed all this. It&#39;s not like either of us will change our minds.</p>

 Right now all you know about me is that I made a comment to someone commenting about how you&#39;re being hostile. And all of a sudden I&#39;m from r/politics and trying to change r/conspiracy?</p>

<p>This is the hostility and projection I&#39;m talking about. Instantly labeling me as an &quot;enemy&quot; that is trying to subvert the subreddit. </p>

<p>But r/politics is a shithole and I&#39;m pretty much middle of the road, and I&#39;ve been on r/conspiracy for most of my 6 years on Reddit, as you&#39;ll see if you bother even taking some time to research who you&#39;re talking to rather than instantly labeling them as the enemy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People do not need &quot;endorse&quot; any conspiracy theory.  For any event, there are numerous different conspiracy theories, some conflict, some overlap.  The problem is that if people don&#39;t &quot;endorse&quot; the conventual narrative version of the conspiracy theory, they are seen as not being &quot;official&quot; conspiracy theorist.  </p>

<p>For instance, my version of the Las Vegas shooting is that Paddock was in a video poker cheating system starting in about 2000.  He acted alone in the shooting and it related to the issues with the video poker cheating system.  As such, I regularly discount and &quot;helicopter&quot; theories, any &quot;Saudi assassin&quot; theory, and certainly any &quot;multiple shooter&quot; theories.  Because all of those conspiracy theories are inconsistent with the facts as well as being inconsistent with my own conspiracy theory of the shooting.  </p>

<p>On this sub, if you don&#39;t believe conspiracy theory A, B or C, then you are not an &quot;official&quot; conspiracy theorist and people like you say &quot;Show me your papers.&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Short&quot; version:  Paddock and an accomplice either discovered or developed a video poker cheating system See <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/10/cheating-video-poker/">https://www.wired.com/2014/10/cheating-video-poker/</a> for an example of a similar such cheat -- but obviously, they didn&#39;t use the exact same one.  Paddock and X were able to exploit this for years and it explains how Paddock was able to win substantial amount of money at video poker.  In September 2015, as stated by Lombardo, his winning steak ended and he lost about $2 million per year for the next 2 years.  It was in September 2015 that the cheat was fixed and/or turned off.  Most likely that accomplice was an insider at the casino.  Paddock either threatened the accomplice or anonymously threatened the casino to turn the cheat back on or he would end up costing them more money.  (If you work through how such a cheat would work, you will see that he could do it anonymously.)  The casino refused and Paddock was left with having to make good on his threat.  The information destroyed by Paddock related to communications regarding the cheat.  I also suspect that the &quot;burglary&quot; of Paddock&#39;s house was probably done by the casino and/or accomplice to recover information relating to the cheat.  When the police first searched the house, they were more focused on weapons and such things and may have missed a small memory stick hidden in the pocket of a coat in the closet.  Paddock himself had no incentive to reveal the cheat because his entire ego was build up around him being the smartest person in the world.  Essentially, Paddock worked out a blackmail plan to get his gambling habit back on winning streak, it didn&#39;t play out and he was backed into a corner.  Because of his extreme narcissism and heavy addiction to gambling, he was more willing to kill dozens of people that reveal that he was nothing more than a simple cheat that would not longer be able to gamble (because he was running out of money). I suspect that someone at MGM/Mandalay Bay was aware of the anonymous threat and either ignored it or deliberately told him they were not going do anything -- and that is the secret that MB is hiding, not some bullshit security camera footage.  MB has seen enough magic shows to know how to distract the audience.  Everyone is looking at the security footage while the tiger climbs out of the cage behind a curtain and then look, no tiger. </p>

<p>There are explanations for the large number of guns he used, why the doors were closed, why he killed himself when he did, why he cased out other locations, etc.  Perhaps I&#39;ll do up a larger post about it, but frankly, few people here are interested in anything but the &quot;big 3&quot; conspiracy theories for Vegas.  As soon as you say Paddock acted largely alone and the conspiracy was hatched over a decade ago, the down votes flood in -- which triggers a corresponding lack of meaningful dialogue. </p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t understand how the cheating system would work.  It takes a little creativity to come up with how the system would work -- that is, how he would not get caught.  But all electronic gambling systems have been cheated -- video poker, lottery, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for writing this up! That is actually a really interesting perspective and something I think I can get on board with. I really can&#39;t find a place to poke holes in it, unlike the other, more &quot;out there&quot; theories.</p>

<p>It would also explain why none of the footage has been released. I personally think it&#39;s because the investigation is ongoing but this would just add to the need to keep it from the public. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m really curious about who could be working with him inside the casino. </p>

<p>Do you think Danley has always been an accomplice?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think Danley was the major accomplice, because the accomplice was likely the one that broke into his house and Danley was out of the country at the time.  Exactly what Danley&#39;s role was could be determined by analyzing exact when Paddock started his amazing winning streak, but I suspect this began well before he met Danley. </p>

<p>Whomever is the inside man is most likely connected, and his buddies at the LVMPD will ensure that people keep speculating about multiple shooters and Saudi assassins -- just running out the statue of limitations (the accomplice was not in on the murders, just the cheating), and then poof, no tiger. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how it could. The people I&#39;m talking about seem incapable of entertaining certain conspiracy theories that go against their chosen narrative or worldview, and immediately set out to &quot;debunk&quot; it.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, for starters:</p>

<p>The fix was in after all.</p>

<p>Last year&#39;s presidential primary between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders was rigged by the Democratic National Committee - just as Sanders&#39; supporters suspected - to hand the nomination to Clinton, according to a bombshell claim by Donna Brazile. The onetime Clinton confidante, CNN commentator and former interim party boss made the explosive claim Thursday while touting a new book that could sever her ties to Team Clinton for good.</p>

<p>“I had promised Bernie when I took the helm of the Democratic National Committee after the convention that I would get to the bottom of whether Hillary Clinton’s team had rigged the nomination process, as a cache of emails stolen by Russian hackers and posted online had suggested,” Brazile wrote in a piece for Politico Magazine.</p>

<p>“By Sept. 7, the day I called Bernie, I had found my proof and it broke my heart,” Brazile said.</p>

<p>The proof, according to Brazile, was a joint fundraising agreement document between the DNC, the Hillary Victory Fund and Hillary for America. It had been signed in August 2015, four months after Clinton announced her candidacy and a year before she officially secured the nomination over Sanders.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/02/donna-brazile-found-proof-dnc-rigged-nomination-for-hillary-clinton.amp.html">https://www.google.com/amp/www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/02/donna-brazile-found-proof-dnc-rigged-nomination-for-hillary-clinton.amp.html</a></p>

<p>Still, that is just one small sliver of evidence Hillary and the DNC colluded against Bernie.</p>

<p>Now back to my question, any proof/sources to back your claims that it was the Republicans who rigged the primaries and not the DNC/Hillary?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where in any of what you posted is there proof that Republicans rigged the DNC primaries? Purging voters hurts both candidates and did not give either Hillary or Bernie an edge. In fact according to your second article, this has been going on since at least 2012.</p>

<p>&quot;Arizona, the poster child for voting problems in the primary, closed the highest percentage of polling places in the study. “Almost every county in the state reduced polling places in advance of the 2016 election and almost every county closed polling places on a massive scale, resulting in 212 fewer polling places,” says the report (emphasis in original). Tucson’s Pima County—the second largest in the state, which is 35 percent Latino and leans Democratic—“is the nation’s biggest closer of polling places,” from 280 in 2012 to 218 in 2016.&quot;</p>

<p>I definitely believe elections are tampered with, but there is absolutely zero proof that the Republicans or Russians had anything to do with it. The main evidence shows Hillary and the DNC rigging the primaries against Bernie Sanders, and this comes straight from the mouth of onetime Clinton confidante and head of the DNC Donna Brazille, which you conveniently ignored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just showed you proof that you continue to blatingly ignore. Donna Brazille herself said there was collusion. Please, continue to ignore it as there is plenty of other evidence.</p>

<p>That may be true — but two Democratic officials tell NPR that Brazile and Perez are referring to two different things. In addition to that joint fundraising agreement the DNC reached with both campaigns, the party and the Clinton campaign struck that separate memorandum of understanding giving the campaign staffing and policy oversight.</p>

<p>That document was signed on Aug. 26, 2015 — before, among other things, Vice President Joe Biden ruled out a run for president.</p>

<p>The DNC has not denied this characterization or timeline.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/11/03/561976645/clinton-campaign-had-additional-signed-agreement-with-dnc-in-2015">https://www.npr.org/2017/11/03/561976645/clinton-campaign-had-additional-signed-agreement-with-dnc-in-2015</a></p>

<p>CNN asked Senator Elizabeth Warren if Mrs Clinton&#39;s contest against Democratic rival Bernie Sanders was rigged, and she said: &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>Another Democratic official writes in a new book about the party&#39;s &quot;unethical&quot; agreement with the Clinton campaign.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-us-canada-41850798">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-us-canada-41850798</a></p>

<p>In its recent leak of 20,000 DNC emails from January 2015 to May 2016, DNC staff discuss how to deal with Bernie Sanders’ popularity as a challenge to Clinton’s candidacy. Instead of treating Sanders as a viable candidate for the Democratic ticket, the DNC worked against him and his campaign to ensure Clinton received the nomination.</p>

<p>One email from DNC Deputy Communications Director Eric Walker to several DNC staffers cites two news articles showing Sanders leading in Rhode Island and the limited number of polling locations in the state: “If she outperforms this polling, the Bernie camp will go nuts and allege misconduct. They’ll probably complain regardless, actually.”</p>

<p>Instead of treating Sanders with impartiality, the DNC exhibits resentful disdain toward him and the thousands of disenfranchised voters he could have brought into the party.</p>

<p>“Wondering if there’s a good Bernie narrative for a story, which is that Bernie never ever had his act together, that his campaign was a mess,” wrote DNC Deputy Communications Director Mark Paustenbach to DNC Communications Director Luis Miranda, in response to backlash over DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz shutting off the Sanders campaign’s access to voter database files.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/observer.com/2016/07/wikileaks-proves-primary-was-rigged-dnc-undermined-democracy/amp/8">https://www.google.com/amp/observer.com/2016/07/wikileaks-proves-primary-was-rigged-dnc-undermined-democracy/amp/8</a></p>

<p>However, the DNC’s attorneys never bothered refuting the lawsuit’s claim that the primary process was biased against Sanders. </p>

<p>Instead, they argued the DNC has a right to conduct primaries however it chooses, and, furthermore, that Sanders supporters knew the primaries were rigged, therefore relieving the DNC of any responsibility it might have had.</p>

<p>This, from the New York Observer: “DNC attorneys claim Article V, Section 4 of the DNC Charter -- stipulating that the DNC chair and their staff must ensure neutrality in the Democratic presidential primaries -- is “a discretionary rule that it didn’t need to adopt to begin with.” Based on this assumption, DNC attorneys asserted that the court cannot interpret, claim, or rule on anything associated with whether the DNC remains neutral in their presidential primaries.”</p>

<p>Also ...</p>

<p>“The Court would have to find that people who fervently supported Bernie Sanders and who purportedly didn’t know that this favoritism was going on would have not given to Mr. Sanders, to Senator Sanders, if they had known that there was this purported favoritism.” </p>

<p>Zloch confirmed this in his judgment: &quot;The Court must now decide whether Plaintiffs have suffered a concrete injury particularized to them, or one certainly impending, that is traceable to the DNC and its former chair&#39;s conduct -- the keys to entering federal court. The Court holds that they have not, which means the truth of their claims cannot be tested in this Court.&quot;</p>

The evidence that has come out from an investigation that has been going on over a year is flimsy at best. That is my opinion of the matter.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s critical thinking with debate and then there&#39;s outright hostility and insults which is what I get and see from many commenters on this sub recently. Debating conspiracies should be done respectfully and I can tell you a good 90% of the time it is not. We all supposedly believe in conspiracies and come at many things considered &quot;truth&quot; from a inquisitive angle but there are definitely those on this sub who genuinely don&#39;t believe in any conspiracies and come here to berate and harass those of us who do. Their agenda has become extremely obvious.</p>

<p>As for conspiracy theories, yes they should hold up to debate but do realize they are just theories and therefore lack definitive proof one way or the other. If we could prove them, they would no longer be theories but fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;t now how a theory works though.  Theories are not guesses waiting around to become fact.  Theories are supported by facts.  If a theory can be refuted by facts, it stops being a theory.  </p>

<p>As for people being assholes, that&#39;s just it.  Some people are assholes.  The sub has gotten fairly large recently because every single media outlet has been throwing the word conspiracy around when it comes to US politics in multiple categories.  So people are going to gravitate here and a lot of people suck.  The solution is to ignore them and engage the people who are properly debating the validity of your theory.  The solution is not to try to rally people around an echo chamber.  If you need to blame someone for it all, blame the two echo chambers called &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; that have dragged their playground fight into your yard.  They&#39;ll pass eventually, just like previous political infighting waves.</p>

If we only discussed ideas that were solidly based in proven facts we would have almost nothing to talk about, since most conspiracies are hidden and/or covered up.

    <div class="md"><p>That application of the definition does not apply to conspiracy theories. With definitions, you don&#39;t apply all of the ones listed, only the closest one. Here is another example from the Meriam-Webster definition.</p>

<p>b : an unproved assumption : conjecture</p>

<p>c : a body of theorems presenting a concise systematic view of a subject theory of equations&quot;</p>

<p>This is the part of the definition of a theory that applies to conspiracy theories.  For the full picture, I will post the entire Meriam-Webster definition below and you can see for yourself which definition of the word applies in this case.  Not all definitions apply. The one that does apply is the third definition: 3a.</p>

<p>Definition of theory</p>

<p>plural theories</p>

<p>1: a plausible or scientifically acceptable general principle or body of principles offered to explain phenomena the wavetheory of light</p>

<p>3a : a hypothesis assumed for the sake of argument or investigation</p>

<p>Proving someone is subverting/denigrating/attacking the sub <strong>for money</strong> (ie a shill) as opposed to attacking the sub because they are an arsehole, is almost impossible. Fortunately, rule 10 covers both categories and is used frequently to remove personae non gratae.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how it could. The people I&#39;m talking about seem incapable of entertaining certain conspiracy theories that go against their chosen narrative or worldview, and immediately set out to &quot;debunk&quot; it. They may think they&#39;ve entertained the thought,  but my impression is that its highly unlikely that they&#39;ve actually done so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Short&quot; version:  Paddock and an accomplice either discovered or developed a video poker cheating system See <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/10/cheating-video-poker/">https://www.wired.com/2014/10/cheating-video-poker/</a> for an example of a similar such cheat -- but obviously, they didn&#39;t use the exact same one.  Paddock and X were able to exploit this for years and it explains how Paddock was able to win substantial amount of money at video poker.  In September 2015, as stated by Lombardo, his winning steak ended and he lost about $2 million per year for the next 2 years.  It was in September 2015 that the cheat was fixed and/or turned off.  Most likely that accomplice was an insider at the casino.  Paddock either threatened the accomplice or anonymously threatened the casino to turn the cheat back on or he would end up costing them more money.  (If you work through how such a cheat would work, you will see that he could do it anonymously.)  The casino refused and Paddock was left with having to make good on his threat.  The information destroyed by Paddock related to communications regarding the cheat.  I also suspect that the &quot;burglary&quot; of Paddock&#39;s house was probably done by the casino and/or accomplice to recover information relating to the cheat.  When the police first searched the house, they were more focused on weapons and such things and may have missed a small memory stick hidden in the pocket of a coat in the closet.  Paddock himself had no incentive to reveal the cheat because his entire ego was build up around him being the smartest person in the world.  Essentially, Paddock worked out a blackmail plan to get his gambling habit back on winning streak, it didn&#39;t play out and he was backed into a corner.  Because of his extreme narcissism and heavy addiction to gambling, he was more willing to kill dozens of people that reveal that he was nothing more than a simple cheat that would not longer be able to gamble (because he was running out of money). I suspect that someone at MGM/Mandalay Bay was aware of the anonymous threat and either ignored it or deliberately told him they were not going do anything -- and that is the secret that MB is hiding, not some bullshit security camera footage.  MB has seen enough magic shows to know how to distract the audience.  Everyone is looking at the security footage while the tiger climbs out of the cage behind a curtain and then look, no tiger. </p>

<p>There are explanations for the large number of guns he used, why the doors were closed, why he killed himself when he did, why he cased out other locations, etc.  Perhaps I&#39;ll do up a larger post about it, but frankly, few people here are interested in anything but the &quot;big 3&quot; conspiracy theories for Vegas.  As soon as you say Paddock acted largely alone and the conspiracy was hatched over a decade ago, the down votes flood in -- which triggers a corresponding lack of meaningful dialogue. </p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t understand how the cheating system would work.  It takes a little creativity to come up with how the system would work -- that is, how he would not get caught.  But all electronic gambling systems have been cheated -- video poker, lottery, etc. </p>
