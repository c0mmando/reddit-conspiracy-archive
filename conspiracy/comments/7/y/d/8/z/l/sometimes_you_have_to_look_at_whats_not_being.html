       Another thing you can take from this is their limitations, some how you know about it, and there is people reporting this, their hold over the information is not as complete as it was in the "tv only" era, before they restrict the internet we have a chance to win, they are limited and human, we are starting to see their face and the people who is not in but was fooled is waking up, like I did after being a supporter for many years, keep up the good fight!

       This garbage isn’t even being reported by the alternative media. Alex Jones is supposed to be the guy that comes through for us and reports on things like this, but he has completely failed and exposed the fact that he is controlled by the same people who control the mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       The USA controls a lot of land and a lot of oil field in Syria, so the idea that they will withdraw their troops is absolutely ridiculous. I really don’t know if Assad is controlled or not, I worry about his connection with Putin and Russia. But I think it’s good to see that the US funded rebels are being pushed back a little bit by Assad’s Forces. It’s about time the US doesn’t get their way.

       You bring up a couple of good points. Oil being one of them..then Russian influence/Iran influence also..these are factors that can't just be dismissed..but they are also factors that now exist because of US foreign policy being complete bullshit in the middle east..
      </p>
      <p>
       So..yeah, I agree..all in all its about time the US doesn't get it's way on this...latest I've heard is that they are stating up a 10 year occupation plan in Syria...the insanity needs to stop.

       Trump doesn't read intelligence briefings. And around the time of him firing off those missiles, it was a news story making the rounds.

       So you can only blame Agent Orange. The "Deep State" wasn't invited to the planning meetings for his little fireworks display.

       The ridiculousness of your comment on a point by point basis :
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump read no intelligence briefings regarding the chemical attack...it was widely reported that he did in fact read the reports.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yeah there was plenty of reporting on the missile launches...mostly by mainstream media anchors having orgasms while reporting it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump didn't confer with any of the intelligence agencies and they were not privy to or present at the meeting that finalized the decision to launch the missiles. That's so completely ridiculous it's hard to believe that you yourself believe it.

       You wanaa see how the media in the UK work?

      <p>
       Watch the brilliant Charlie Brooker's:"
       <em>
        Year number
       </em>
       Wipe " (any year). He is a writer/comedian and the creator of the awesome Black Mirror series too but he sees the BS and news wipe series whilst completely satire shows how obvious the MSM is when it comes to theatre.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Yearly wipes are the best as you can see the agenda for the year unfold as he presents the nonsense going on in a dry satirical way but yet shows you how obvious it all is when you are awakened to it.

       You do understand that these remarks are referring to current reports of attacks and not the confirmed use in Khan Sheikhoun, right?

       This meme started in a Newsweek article that has since been debunked over and over.

       Gotcha, I didn’t know there were new allegations of sarin use so I was still thinking in context of the April 2017 strike. Thanks for a link to the full transcript.

       I still think the rebels did it to their own people in 2017 to get our military to attack Assad.

       No, and BellingCat is about as biased of a source as you can get. Newsweek isn't much better, but they do have better reporting
       <em>
        in comparison
       </em>
       .

       Assad has no - absolutely zero, zilch, nada - reason to orchestrate these gas attacks. Let's get the narrative straight. Assad, who is winning the war and reclaiming territories seized by extremists, crosses the only red line established by the West, gassing
       <em>
        random civilians
       </em>
       , not even a military target, guaranteeing his downfall. Not only that he uses chlorine gas, which is  one of the most ineffective weapons he could have used.

       Thanks for the information, I'll read through it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said though, I'm not expecting this to change my view for the sources you linked themselves are very lacking in credibility themselves too, but I will give them the benefit of the doubt and at least read what they have to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile if you happen to come across a more professional criticism of BellingCat, feel free to send it my way, as I do enjoy some critical thinking and truth-finding any day of the week.

       OK..I've gone back through all of it...and you are correct...regarding the specific point that Mattis was not referring to the Khan Sheikhoun incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said...I have yet to see proof by the OPCW or the JIM from the UN that's shows Assad used Sarin at Khan Sheikhoun...but this does not matter or is it relevant to the points/assumptions I make in this post.

       Well, a few thing:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The sources I linked are not lacking. Consortium in particular has a history of fact-based reporting.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Thank you for being open-minded.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Another example: BellingCat
       <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2016/12/14/bana-alabed-verification-using-open-source-information/">
        published a "fact check"
       </a>
       on the psy-op twitter account for Bana Alabed. This twitter account has long since been outed as a propaganda account. Alabed's family ALL have ties to Al-Nusra, and ALL of the pictures taken of her were at terrorist-held strongholds.
       <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/eva-bartlett-exposes-the-lies-on-syria/">
        Here
       </a>
       is an interview with Eva Bartlett on the Corbett Report. She's an excellent investigative journalist who has been to Syria dozens of times.
       <a href="http://ingaza.wordpress.com/">
        Here
       </a>
       is her blog.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Yes, Corbett Report is very, very, credible. Don't take my word for it though, check out some of his other work, like
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vNwe7yKbwo">
        this segment on the White Helmets.
       </a>
       His Big Oil documentaries are incredible as well.

       So Mattis said they used Chlorine gas on civilians and are still investigating Sarin gas use.
      </p>
      <p>
       How much of a difference it makes whether you get gassed by Sarin or Chlorine gas I don't know.

       welcome to the beauracracy of war? it's only okay to gas civilians using certified approved nerve gas.
      </p>
      <p>
       similarly, some bombs are allowed, while others are not. if the end result is destruction and death, what's the difference between a cluster bomb and a targeted strike?  collateral damage, i guess?
      </p>
      <p>
       as far as sarin vs chlorine, maybe it's the difference between a quick and painless gassing death vs a tortuous and painful gassing death?

      <p>
       That bombing run was a trick, medias fell for it and some even called Trump presidential when there were calling for his impeachments minutes before. It was a trick because you don't warn your enemy when you are going to bomb him, also when you do bomb him, you take shit out, the base was operational hours after the bombing run...

       Mattie’s statement was in specific reference to a recent series of alleged Sarin gas attacks, not the earlier gas attacks the US retaliated to.
      </p>
      <p>
       His comments, taken out of context, do not specify that. They only say “no evidence he’s seen of gas attacks”. That’s why it isn’t being heavily reported. Context matters.

       That being said...I have still seen no solid evidence given by the OPCW or have I seen a statement by the JIM from the UN that proves Assad used Sarin at Khan Sheikhoun in April of 2017....
