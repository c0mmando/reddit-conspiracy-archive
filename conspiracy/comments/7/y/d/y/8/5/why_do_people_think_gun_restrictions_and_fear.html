       It seems pretty obvious to me:
      </p>
      <p>
       Guns aren't going to ever be removed completely from circulation. There are so many guns and so many people that would refuse to give them all up(hide them if not fight back) that they simply cannot be 'banned'.
      </p>
      <p>
       So given that guns aren't going anywhere, the only option is to embrace them. The majority of people are not psychopathic, and generally want to do good. If there were more people who were trained and carried a gun, there would be less innocent deaths.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me it seems like the problem is not guns but gun culture, and putting in a solid effort to teaching people and training them to be safer firearm owners while putting out public education in a positive light to increase good citizens to carry to out weigh the bad.. That this would go a long way to reducing gun casualties more so than any other method possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy? Why is this not pushed more? Why so much hate towards such proposals?

       YES. Violence is baked into our culture. I defer to Tolstoy on this one— as long as there are slaughterhouses, there will be battlefields.

       This is why I've acquired an interest in psychology. How could someone see another killers publicity, and think it's a good idea to do something similar, for what? A month of infamy on MSM while simultaneously throwing your whole life away? How's it that worth it?

       It's not worth for you, but you can't speak for others. If people can mass genocide each other, rape, oppress others. There always will be sick fuck capable of doing this shit. So it's not impossible, that some interest groups use it to their advantage.

       I get suspicious every time a shooting happens using an AR15. Those guns are not ideal, heavy and large, non maneuverable and not concealable, extremely loud and overall not something often used in close quarters. Yet sure as shit it's an AR15 EVERY time.

       Well he did purchase the AR about a year before hand, and coincidentally that was about the time he was in contact with the FBI as I understand it. Most 19yo, actually 18 at the time,  don't have a spare $1500+ to buy a nice fire arm like that when they could just as easily by a nice pistol for $300. .. And with today's youth if they had several hundred saved up they would probably spend it on a gaming station or something first before they ever had a spare $1500. Unless he just have well off parents or something.

       Something to note though, is that a decent AR-15 is not $1500+ anymore, and decent rifles now run roughly comparable in price to a nice pistol. They can be had for under (sometimes well under) $1000 and still function perfectly fine and reliably. It's not outside the realm of possibility that he spent his money on a gun versus a game system.

       It's the idea of people only trusting themselves, how ironical it sounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       People
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       from themselves they won't abuse guns or kill people. They mistrust everyone else though.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why not vote to take all weapons away? I mean. I won't shoot anyone, but if other's don't have guns they
       <em>
        can't
       </em>
       shoot anyone. It's a win-win.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only they seem to forget that the biggest enemy is the army (martial law). And they will always have guns. And if the time comes we have the need, and most of all, rights to defend ourselves.

       Criminals don't follow the law and will attain weapons regardless. I can never understand the reasoning to take arms from good people that could defend themselves against criminals, tyrants, police,military ect.
Even if you point to the past where tyrants such as Mao, Hitler, Stalin, Pao took the guns from the people and then l later slaughtered millions of defenseless people.

       Realistically it's both gun restriction and mental illness. It's not one or the other,
       <strong>
        the real conspiracy is why do they keep making it out to be one or the other
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If this last shooter, who was obviously mentally disturbed (I believe I read somewhere he was going to therapy after losing his mother at some point last year) wasn't able to obtain a gun as easily (especially with his checkered past) then this wouldn't have been a problem. Part of the issue is you need both to do it's job effectively. If it's more difficult with people who have had checkered pasts, severe mental issues, or if we have better waiting periods for obtaining a gun nation wide AND if he was able to feel he was able to speak freely in his therapy sessions about his problems this tragedy wouldn't have happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       On another note, realistically banning the purchase (not removal from people who already own them) of the AR-15 or any other weapon that can shoot over 100 rounds a minute would have helped as well. If this sicko was able to bypass the above solution and only obtain a handgun or something of the like the amount of people killed wouldn't have been nearly as high. And it would have potentially easier to subdue him. The problem is with the AR15 and guns like it, they can be easily adjusted to fire more and more rounds per minute because that's what these types of guns are for, they are for sport showings so they are easier to mod and those mods are easier to obtain. It's no coincidence that in nearly all mass shootings this gun or a gun like it is involved.

        realistically banning the purchase (not removal from people who already own them) of the AR-15 or any other weapon that can shoot over 100 rounds a minute would have helped as well.

       Apparently from someone who has NEVER shot an AR.  An AR mag can be from 10 to 50 rounds.  Then you have to reload.
      </p>
      <p>
       AND if you are pulling the trigger at that rate, you ain't hitting ANYTHING.  The AR is nothing more different than any other semi-automatic.
      </p>
      <p>
       AND a weapon does not kill others UNLESS there is a person using it.  Plain and simple.

       Hey thanks for responding. I know these type of debates get heated so just know any response I make is 100% sincere and not meant to be taken personally or that I'm talking down at all.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        AR15s on stock purchase only have mags that hold 10-50 rounds. But because of the prevalence of AR15s in skill shooting competitions there are TONS of attachments and items easily available for purchase in order to increase the shooting power and capacity of these weapons. In the link I provided above, in my initial comment they go into a bit of detail about it.
       </li>
       <li>
        If you pull the trigger at the rate it's fired you're not hitting a target your aiming for. So one target directly in front of you, probably won't be hit. But in a public place where there are potentially loads of targets precision doesn't matter. What matters is being able to hit a lot of targets in a short amount of time. So you're correct 1 target with no others around are not easy to hit at that rate. Multiple targets surrounding that 1 target ARE
       </li>
       <li>
        Finally, you're right. Guns don't kill people, people kill people. The argument also used is when people drive drunk we blame the driver not the car company. Which is also correct.. The issue though is, especially in the USA, if you drive drunk in general and you're caught, in addition to multiple fines you have your restrictions SEVERELY revoked. And even when they are given back, there are heavy loops someone has to jump through to prevent it happening again. Even before that, even to own a car, you need to go through 3 years of driving experience (potentially), pass a written test, and go through background checks to possess a car. After you pass all that then you're good to own them. There a tons of loops created to prevent people from drunk driving because of incidents that happen around the country. Why, not with weapons to?
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       As a note, I actually support gun ownership. I think riffles, handguns, and shotguns are fully fine to own specifically because they have to do with hunting. It's the AR15s I have a problem with and the regulation of being able to purchase a gun from state to state is totally different. It should be the same regulations nation wide for background checks and purchasing a gun, but it's not.

       First buying a rifle or pistol one DOES go through a background check.
 To buy one, I would need to fill out a 4473 -- a six-page form from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd have to write my name and address. My Social Security Number is optional. And there's half a page of "yes or no" questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Have you ever been convicted in any court of a felony, or any other crime, for which the judge could have imprisoned you for more than one year, even if you received a shorter sentence including probation?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?"
      </p>
      <p>
       The dealer calls the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services Division, in Clarksburg, W.V., and they give them only the most basic information: name, address, driver's license number. The FBI runs a background check and then usually gives a yes or no.  Most dealers charge you for a NO answer for wasting their time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If in Maryland (and other states), and say you want to buy a semi-automatic, like the AK-47 on the wall, or the Colt Officer's Model in the glass case. That would require additional paperwork.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, you need to show Arthur your certificate from a firearms safety training course. (You can take one online in 30 minutes.) Then, there's a form that lets the Maryland State Police check for any record of a mental disorder or violent behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It's just four more pages of paperwork," Arthur says. "It's just red tape."
      </p>
      <p>
       On another form, you have to list current and past employers, and three personal references. And the state does keep track of what you buy.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Arthur, "They get the make, the caliber, the type, the finish, the barrel length, the model, the serial number, and what country of origin it was from."
      </p>
      <p>
       You do this in quadruplicate. Arthur mails one copy to Maryland State Police Headquarters.
      </p>
      <p>
       State Police Headquarters is in Pikesville, outside of Baltimore. The Licensing Division is across the street. Sgt. Marc Black says he can't take me inside, but he can tell me what happens here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several investigators go through applications, checking 16 databases. By law, the State Police have seven days to do this. But according to Black, investigators have been "extremely busy."
      </p>
      <p>
       "There is an increase in applications for firearms," he says. "We are working around the clock to take care of those increases."
      </p>
      <p>
       If Bob Arthur doesn't hear back from the State Police after seven days, Maryland law says he and the customer don't have to wait any longer. He can hand over that Colt pistol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, it usually a state background check takes a month.
      </p>
      <p>

        So to legally own a gun is not like the media says how it happens

       Hey thanks for posting this, this is really helpful for a lot of people here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with what you posted though, is that's on a state to state basis. So, currently in (what sounds like Maryland for you) as well as other states like California, NJ,  Massachusetts, and the like they all have strict gun laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       But places like Texas as long as you have ID, pass a background check, and complete some paperwork you can get a gun in the same day.
       <a href="https://m.wikihow.com/Buy-a-Firearm-in-Texas">
        Source
       </a>
       . Other states like Utah, Arizona, and Alaska make it easier to purchase guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is that some states require you to go through what you posted (which I agree with). Other states do not. The fact that there isn't a nationwide standard to me seems odd. It'd be like my aforementioned drunk driving statement being state to state, where some states say you can drive with a 1.0 and others say it can't be over .02.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, this debate is important to have and I'm glad to be having it. Thanks so much for responding, looking forward to hearing any rebuttal and potentially having my viewpoint changed.

       If this was enacted nation wide to purchase an AR15, then totally fine with anyone owning one.
      </p>
      <p>
       ^
The obsession with the AR15 is quite telling. There are literally dozens of other firearms with the exact same capabilities, and hundreds more with similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       The AR15 is simultaneously a Boogeyman and a Trap. The media drives this one specific rifle into the conciousness of the population, and repeatedly points to it as the problem. This rallies people against this one gun, it seems like a simple solution to a grave issue - but most people don't understand that banning/restricting the AR15 is opening a flood gate for banning/restricting countless other guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, even if the AR15 is banned/restricted/regulated, what's stopping the psychos out there from simply choosing a different rifle?

       You're absolutely right, and the media using it as a bogey man. You're also right in saying they can go to countless others that impact it, which is what circles back to my original points in that:
1. We do need to have better mental healthcare access to people of all backgrounds. Seeing a therapist or the like should be looked at as common as seeing a dentist or health care physician. If we make it common place, more people can sort out issues easier.
2. Banning/restricting certain types of weapons to people with mental illnesses, with checkered pasts, and also making purchasing guns a bit harder nation wide (not just in some states) it can potentially help stop this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is just doing one or the other isn't going to work. It's not a black and white solution so sometimes it's trying to find enough similarities between things and sensing patterns to help stop them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You mentioned that the AR15 is basically a buzzword and really not the problem. But when consistently nearly all mass shootings since 2012 have involved an AR15 that's an issue. There's a pattern with that gun that for some reason attracts people looking to do a lot of damage quickly.

      </p>
      <p>
       Once again, I'm not proposing a full on ban of guns like in Australia, I'm proposing something closer to what Japan has enabled and it seems to have worked fairly well for them
       <a href="http://www.conservapedia.com/Gun_Control_in_Japan">
        Source on Japan
       </a>
       . Once again, this isn't about (for me at least) rounding up all the gun owners and forcing them to give up their guns. It's about stricter regulations for people looking to purchase them AND proper mental health screenings by trained professionals.

       I disagree with your initial statement. Guns will never fully be gone because politicians would lose their base if they tried such a thing. Getting guns back from people is certainly doable.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't want the US to embrace guns. Common sense gun control is what I would support - licensing requirements, training requirements, no guns if you have a history of violence, and no semi-automatic or automatic guns.

       You are so mistaken. There are an estimated 600 million+ firearms in this country. They banned asbestos, its still around. They banned trans fat, its still around. Etc etc etc.

       WHY? WHAT IS THE SOCIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL REASON FOR THESE MASS SHOOTINGS?? What could it be about our culture SPECIFICALLY other than guns that would drive someone to kill a bunch of people randomly.

      <p>
       For starters, we make them FAMOUS!!
Name and face on every news channel for a week.
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE SHOOTERS is a male. What about men? A male’s archetypal instinct to provide... when economics are WEAK and the middle class in america is DISINTEGRATING?
What about SSRI’s and their overuse by pill pushing doctors who use very little psychotherapy if any to address underlying problems?

       Look at Ontario Canada specifically in and around Toronto, strict gun laws, especially on anything other than shot guns and hunting rifles(true wood stock-most bolt operated-). Toronto and its suburbs still have terrible gun violence. Gun laws will never stop people from, who wish to, to do harm. However I will say these incidents aren’t targeting “innocent” civilians, they’re gang shootings where some times civilians get hit.

       Getting some guns back from people is doable, all however, is impossible. An individual may have 10 guns purchased in their name, and currently own none of them. And on the opposite someone who has no guns registered in their name could have 1, 10, or more. Not to mention the fact that it would take people to actually remove guns from civilians, law enforcement officers that you would have to convince to betray the constitution. Or get 38 states to pass an amendment to say the semiconductor amendment is no longer valid.

       Right. So we're back to it not happening because politicians won't make it happen. I have no illusions that we'd be able to get all guns. Getting most of them and stopping circulation of new guns would definitely help.

       Stopping production would be easy. Collecting them would admittedly be difficult. It would be local police or the military collecting them. They're so ingrained in our culture that I'm sure it would be a very complicated proposition to get them back.

       So you think that the police of the country are going to go door to door 'collecting' (confiscating) guns?

       Great plan. I'm sure you'll have no difficulty convincing the PD to do this and even less problem convincing the population not to engage in 'to the death' defense of their guns.

       It's the dead kids I'm concerned with. I'm less concerned with the "come for my guns, prepare for the bullets" crowd. If you feel like dying for your guns, that's up to you. I'm not going to feel bad because you made a shitty choice. None of this will happen either way, which is why I specified that I'd be happy with simple regulations.

       You can 'think of the children!'(to be read like when the Simpsons priests wide screams such statements) but some of us prefer to think about the whole country instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, cars kill more kids than guns every year.. How 'against' cars are you? And those things you need a licence and to pass practical tests to get behind the wheel of - legally, which covers the vast majority of car related deaths. No cars for anyone!!
      </p>
      <p>
       And what about obesity? Won't SOMEONE think of all the fat kids who are being setup to live in a body that is trying to kill them? How against unhealthy food being available(to everyone) given how many children(those poor children!) are dying or having their health majorly impacted? No 'junk'/processed food for everyone!!
      </p>
      <p>
       And what about bicycles! Have you heard how many kids are dying riding bikes?!?!?! Around 650-850 cyclists die every year - a significant portion, hell even only 10% of that total being children, would have bikes FAR more dangerous than the total of mass school shootings.

       Your examples are absurd and you know it. Let's set the same licensing, training and insurance requirements on guns. Let's set some standards for what we consider appropriate gun designs - similar to safety requirements we place on auto manufacturers. Let's track guns the same way we track cars, via registration requirements. Let's require people to present their guns periodically to confirm they still meet those safety requirements. Let's do it, let's treat guns the way we treat cars.
      </p>

       So despite cars being responsible for literally 10's of thousands of unnecessary deaths every year, including many children and innocent parties - you think that this same system is obviously enough to reduce the comparatively small amount of gun related deaths?
      </p>
      <p>
       And at the same time, you propose no further measures or proposals on how to reduce those thousands of car related deaths. No, you seem completely OK with them based on no proposal to reduce ease of access to cars or criminal punishment for misuse.

       You're adding a lot to my comment for some reason. The safety measures we have in place reduce what would be even higher numbers of deaths. And I do support additional safety measures and look forward to the day we have self-driving cars. I also support expansions and enhancements to public transportation. Sorry, your weird attempt to point out hypocrisy has fallen kind of flat.

       Oh it'd just that you didn't mention anything at all when car deaths were brought up. I mean, you seem
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       concerned about people dying from guns that I figured that surely you are
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       pro-car reform given that it kills many times more people than the guns you are so very concerned about.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just weird. I mean.. You call my example absurd yet its quite telling really. You don't care about how deadly cars are as much as guns otherwise you would have said something when cars were brought into this.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have an overt fear/hatred of guns - one that doesn't have the numbers to back up. You will probably continue to live in denial of this despite my bringing it to your attention.

       Again, cars already require a host of safety measures. And I am extremely pro-auto safety and will be a proponent of driverless cars. Do you really think this is a convincing way to have this discussion? Just point and shout "but cars?"

       I've already explained why. Cars already have safety mechanisms that are constantly being updated. I provided evidence that those safety mechanisms and their impact on auto related deaths. Go back far enough in my history and you'll see that I'm an advocate for public transportation and self-driving cars.

       Gun law and training is constantly being improved too. Yet you still care so much about it.. Despite it killing far less than cars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just admit you are overtly concerned with guns, and it's not about how many die from them. You clearly care about it far more than cars.

       Why aren't you calling for cars to be banned? You want something far less deadly banned. Why not cars?

       You'll see me pushing for a ban on cars once self-driving cars become a viable alternative. We live in a society that necessitates driving, not one that necessitates shooting. Every individual can do without guns in their lives, but many need cars. There's such an evident difference between cars and guns. I refuse to believe you don't understand that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you bring up the safeguards being improved for guns. Why don't we go ahead and implement the safeguards we already have for cars? Are you in favor of licensing requirements? Training requirements? Registration of all guns?

       It worked before things like drones existed when the fight was being waged in foreign lands. It'll never happen here, but it's utterly ridiculous to believe that civilian gun owners would stand any sort of chance against the US military.

       There is no pinnacle of technological achievement that would suddenly make conflict obsolete. The inventor of TNT thought his invention was so powerful that it would put an end to all conflict. Yes you are right that drones are a very powerful weapon and that civilians are outmatched technologically. But extrapolating a win or a loss is an exercise in futility because no one would really know what would happen if the people fought back. But knowing that the people do have that option would at least make the ones in power think twice.

       When dealing with major backlash in the form of bullets as a definite outcome to your 'mission', then you'll try and avoid that. It's a deterrent. And armed population is very hard to capture and imprison. Yes you can but you've got to 1: have a very eager force willing to get into firefights regularly for you, fight to the death etc and 2: that same eager force you have at your disposal is willing to shoot/kill other Americans defending the constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's definitely a lot harder than simply having a force willing to kidnap/abduct/arrest unarmed civilians for
       <em>

       I support common sense gun laws but no semi automatics? I hunt waterfowl, small game and deer with a semi automatic shotgun. A side from pump action shotguns are we supposed to go back to exclusively break barrel and hammer cocked guns? That takes every pistol other than muzzle loading pistols right away. What about states that allow open and concealed carry? Also a citizen legally owning a full auto weapon is so hard to obtain there’s never even been a mass shooting with one...

       What you want is a full 2A repeal and why don't you just admit it. "Common sense gun control" is a euphemism used by liberals when they don't want to tell the public their true goal: gun confiscation and 2A repeal.

       I do want one. I don't pretend not to. I would love for the 2nd amendment to be entirely repealed. I'll settle for regulations though. Canada had regulations and still has high gun ownership. Sweden is the same way. It helps, even if it isn't perfect.

       People have the right to free speech. That right sometimes means that people say unfortunate things. People have the right to bear arms. That means that unfortunately sometimes people will use those arms to do unfortunate things. Any right can be abused, but that's not an argument that we should give all our rights away for the vague hope that government is going to take care of us. As Benjamin Franklin once said, "those who would sacrifice liberty for a little temporary security deserve neither."

       I disagree with you, obviously. Simple stating that something is a right isn't a remotely convincing argument for me. The Constitution has been wonderful, but it's also 200 years old. I'd prefer to view it as a living document that requires periodic revisiting. I'd say we've long reached the point where we need to reconsider the 2nd amendment. No, I don't feel the same way about the other amendments. Yes, I recognize that you believe they're all sacred. Sorry, we disagree on that point.

       Semi automatic weapons have been around for over a century. They’re not going anywhere. Don’t act like safety is the goal here . This is 100% about banning guns starting with semi automatic rifles . Something like 80-90% of gun crime is committed with a hand gun, but semiauto rifles and cosmetic features are always the target

       I have heard people talk about putting armed security guards into schools. That's an interesting concept, I'm figuring you would need at least two because, well you know if it's only one...well then they are the first ones to get shot. The two guys from Columbine put in a lot of planning on their killing rampage, if there had been a couple of security guards you don't think these would have been the first to get killed? And who is paying for this new security? Jesus the GOP are not exactly throwing money at schools. How many teachers and school programs would need to be cut to pay for armed security? I guess you could arm all the teachers, but again considering the US already has an alarming deficit, why not throw a few more hundred million onto the increasing pile. Arm all the teachers, put them through extensive training! The NRA would love that, lots of $$ for their members. If this latest killer couldn't get his hand on a gun how many people would he have killed with a knife? Anyway America won't change, gun advocates have too much power in Washington and spend too much cash to ensure politicians maintain and open door policy on guns. And at the end of the day what's it matter, it's all Gods will!! And I'm sure God has an AR15 hanging off his hip. God bless America!

       Because that's what worked for every other western country. I think it's mostly just people like me that don't understand what the benefit is of having 7000 gun incidents a year with 1900 deaths of which more than 70 are under the age of eleven. I don't see how anything that yout think you gain from being able to have guns, outweighs almost 2000 killings a year. And don't give me the "the bad guys will still have guns" bullshit, because every other country in the world that did this found that it is way easier to unarm criminals when there are strict laws against guns. And please, please don't give me that fake meme thingie about stabbings in the UK, that one is simply false.

       Guns are symbolic of freedom.  Freedom from the crown wasn't handed to America willingly, it was earned by blood and gun. To think it can be safeguarded without them is foolish and naive. Death is unfortunate and most tragic when it involves children. Solutions aren't black and white, so while guns certainly aren't ideal the reality necessitates them, just as it does with abortion. Also stabbings and acid attacks aren't a meme. Why would you say such a thing?

       America at its core was, is, and I hope to God always will be about individual rights and freedom. The constitution sets out to make sure an individual’s rights always outweighs the capitualtions of the state. The
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       thing that ensures that is a well armed populous.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Every other western country” might have benevolent (arguable) governments right now, but the people have literally no recourse when they find themselves too far down the slippery slope of having no guaranteed freedoms.

       The other western world countries did not have the same amount or criminal component to their societies. No country with such a high ratio of gun:citizen has rid themselves of guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Australia is not that great of an example, they have plenty of gun totting criminals and the gun related deaths to go with it.. But stabbings is where you miss the ball.
      </p>
      <p>
       Countries with reformed gun laws or long standing anti-gun laws have terrible stabbings and far more frequently. Sure it's harder to take down a whole crowd with a knife but people fucking do it! Acid attacks too. How many on UK this year? 100? 1000? More?
      </p>
      <p>
       My op is not trying to claim there is any solution to a gun violence. We will never reach 0 gun related deaths/accidents as long as humans exist. It's about what is
       <em>
        best
       </em>
       given the ingredients of the situation. And best being defined as least negative/destructive/danger impact, and switching that around where ever possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well more good people having guns sure seems like the better option to the current one of 'scare and demonize the idea of carrying firearms as a good citizen and have the majority of those carrying guns do so with illegal and negative intentions'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that every time a school shooting happens it increases the factor of 'you are a psycho and/or murderous and crazy because you carry a gun' to the average citizen through propoganda etc is what I think is really hurting the American public.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many men have been convinced by their wives(not trying to sound sexist but I know of this happening) to not have guns in the house, to not carry a gun and to shelter the kids from gun use as much as possible. Someone that could be 'the positive' in society in related to the unavoidable 'gun situation', is scared away from taking on that role because of stigma and brainwashing from the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       This happens more and more, it becomes 'weirder' and 'weirder' to carry a gun.. Then itll be 'weird' just to own one. Then itll be 'weird' and a 'dangerous nazi thought' to even be pro guns or just neautral about it.

      <p>
       When you don't understand the numbers you are looking at, and/or don't apply them correctly to reach an accurate conclusion.. Then yes it seems pretty undebatable.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you are forgetting a few things. For one, Australia did not have a constitution that included the right to bare arms. The very foundation and the words that formed the rules of the land did not include anything about an inherent right to protect yourself and own firearms.
      </p>
      <p>
       USA however does have this. Which means you are comparing(at the time) about 20mil people who havnt been I taught and told they have the right to guns vs 350mil people who
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So right there you have a significantly large part of the United States that would simply never give up their guns and would be very likely to fight such action.
      </p>
      <p>
       So.. Your 'take the guns away' is already, without any further examination, going to lead to shit loads of people dying. Yet you still think it's going to result in less death.
      </p>
      <p>
       OK, let's say you managed to pull that off
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       large scale revolt/militias fighting the cops/military. Somehow.. Magic, whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say 1% of the population are 'bad'. 1% of 25million? 250k. 250'000 bad guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the US? 3'500'000 bad guys. Three and a half million people, who are bad, who are now the majority/only holder of firearms.
      </p>
      <p>
       And 1% is pretty damn low in your favor. So what are you gonna do about these 3.5mil armed bad guys now that the rest of the population is at their mercy??
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure no one will be raped, or murdered, or robbed. Right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or would it go a bit more like this. With lots of good people fighting the govt, and then after a lot of those otherwise 'good' law abiding citizens are slaughtered, there would not only be 3.5mil bad guys to rape and pillage with little to no worry, but the country now lacks the biggest deterrent and protection from these people due to all the good guys standing up for their rights against a tyrannical government?
      </p>
      <p>
       A country with about
       <strong>
        14 times
       </strong>
       as many people, with twice the rate of gun ownership and inter-generational 'right to gun ownership' mentality set in stone by the property that founded their nation VS A small English colony that had no right to bare arms, has way less gun ownership and far less gang related issues including vastly lower breaking and entering/home invasions etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's incomparable.

       And this link shows a halving in deaths basically if you account for the increasing population size. Maybe a bit more than half.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, as someone who knows a bit about Australia - the Australian government/police have been tackling gang activity and the underworld
       <strong>
        HEAVILY
       </strong>
       since the 90's. There was a lot of corruption in the police that was weeded out around this time, especially in Sydney which was a hotbed for gun related crime
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of a much more effective, focused, better funded and less corrupt police force - the Australian govt has allowed the police force to become much more controlling of the population. Roadside checkpoints where they make you perform a swab on the spot to determine if Marijuana or meth are in your system are pretty much commonplace across the cities/suburbs now. Infact general police presence is extremely high - every train station in the major cities have these 'half assed' community cops with limited powers. When you travel around Australia, you will regularly be looked over or physically checked depending on where you are and what you look like - it's becoming more and more authoritarian. Ask any aussie whose born 1990 or before and they'll back this up.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the Australians are awarded and ever increasing and expanding authoritarian govt that increases restrictions and creates harsher rules with tougher enforcement while the Australian population has to just sit back and take it because now that all the guns have been taken away, there's nothing the govt fears as retaliation for acting out like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point in this post is that there's many factors to account for regarding reduction in homicides, not just the guns being taken away. We can't ever actually know what impact the gun removal had but it certainly isn't the only thing responsible. I think the far more focused Australian police tackling gangs is to thank more than anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean I could line up a graph with the release of the Gameboy with those statistics and it would seem to the ignorant viewer that Gameboy is directly responsible for reduction in homicides.

       Well to answer your first question, I am very much against anyone owning guns. However you have to understand my perspective; I am Dutch and if my country were to say any law obiding citizen can get a gun, I would feel a million times less safe. Because the thing is that criminals, even in the netherlands, have guns. However, criminals, contrary to popular american view, don't just randomly go out and shoot innocent people. Chances of you accidentally and unintentionally getting shot by a law obiding citizen are higher that you getting shot by a "criminal" who targets you (unless you are a criminal yourself, that increases the chance by quite a bit.) From my position every gun is one too many.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that I do think that there should be a mandatory buy back with market conform offers.
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer the final paragraph, you will never know if you never try, and you will never try if this is your basic proposition. (however we would classify 7000 shootings a year as a civil war already, aside from it being a hypothetical.)

       There's a big cultural divide on the issue. You can't compare other counties on the guns, it's so complex and there's so many differences in regard to culture, population, Geography. One thing other countries do better in in regards to taking care of its citizens when it comes to healthcare. It's all about laying a foundation for people to be in a better position. Universal healthcare would help my  country reduce violence a lot I believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you really support people like me being forced with to give up my guns? Wow.  Even Though  I've done nothing wrong. Again, i would not give them up. And the starting bid would be 10 times the amount I paid for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again it would not work in America, it would be impossible. Do you know how many guns there are in the the United States ? And how people are not willing to give them up? The US could not afford it montarity and it would lead to a civil war so blood will be on people's hands who advocated this.  And beside why the hell should we invest so much money into violating the constitution? This country needs to invest in the environment/climate change, education and Heath care.

       So you say that USA just has to accept the fact that every year 7000 people are shot, more than 2000 people die from those shootings, with amongst them more than 300 children. You claim that the USA situation is too complex to analise with statistics or current and historical comparisons, yet in your same comment you are 100% certain that there is no way to even begin thinking about gun control without a civil war breaking out. Do you actually feel like your opinion and experiences are worth more than models made in many fields of science?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean don't get me wrong, I don't think enforcing gun control in the USA will be easy or will go fast, but refusing to believe the models, to think about good ways to start taking aways guns, simply because it might lead to a civil war.... I find that too philosophically nihilistic. To me that is simply not being open to solving the actual, urgent and very real problem of gun shootings and killings in the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       And believe me, I understand you like your guns, but are your guns really worth those 7000 shootings a year. Can you just sell the idea to yourself that because "you don't want to give up your guns, because you don't abuse them", noone has to give up their guns and therefore in the next ten years 70.000 shootings will happen. At how many casualties would you value your guns?

       I think the cross-cultural comparisons that are made about gun-free European countries, Australia or Japan are really influential with people in favor of gun control.  They provide an alternate reality where gun control seems to work.  IMHO, it's an oversimple comparison that doesn't take into account a whole panoply of differences between the US and these places that calls into question why it seems to work there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Australia is considered especially good for comparison because of the relative social similarity with the US and the fact that they actually did ban guns and force gun owners to relinquish their weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that even if you decided to accept the premise that banning guns accomplished something, the logistics of doing so in the United States in a manner that was actually effective (ie, removing black market guns at the same rate as legal non-criminally owned guns) is nearly impossible.  And given the size of rural populations where guns have legitimate uses for pest control or farm management (or in wilderness areas where it may be about personal safety), you wouldn't be able to totally ban them and this would be an injection point for more black market arms which would feed public safety problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also funny how
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       laws there are that regulate guns that gun banners don't think exist.  I think part of this is due to how many gun laws, especially Federal laws, don't get prosecuted, and thus seem not to exist to gun banners, creating a perception that there is no legal regulation.  It really should feed the notion that more laws and regulations aren't effective or are only selectively enforced.  Most everyone, especially those with criminal records, who commit gun crimes should be prosecuted for Federal gun crime violations but they seldom seem to be, usually only serving time for their specific crime (robbery, etc) with perhaps a slight enhancement for the involvement of a gun.

       There have been repeated amnesties, and there is probably a scenario where if you get caught with a piece in one of the cities, you can possibly expect to get shot yourself, or at least treated with serious prejudice by the police.  I don't know how hard it actually is to get guns here though, because I haven't tried; although I am very certain that there are rural areas in the north of the country where people have guns for feral dogs and such, and the police either don't care, or don't try and do anything about it because they don't want to get shot at themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person's perspective on guns is going to be purely dependent on life experience.  The main reason why people in cities are opposed to guns, is because they never experience situations where they need them.  There are no wild animals in the cities, and very few people get their homes broken into, although in my experience the cops will only do something about a home invasion if they feel like it.  It's very easy in that type of situation to start thinking that criminals or psychos are the only people who have a use for guns, and that police are the only people who need them.  I on the other hand have been on the wrong end of a tiny bit of violence in my life; not necessarily much, but enough that I'm a bit more open minded about gun ownership than most.
      </p>
      <p>
       90% of the urban population go from cradle to grave without a single encounter with the cops, whether good or bad, so they have no practical reason to assume that they are anything but the heroic protectors that the media wants us to think they are.  If more people actually had contact with the police, then you might see the opinion on gun ownership change, a bit; it can be educational to ask someone who has had bad experiences with the police, whether or not they are pro-gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only really endorse gun ownership for use against animals; either for hunting, or for cases like the wild dog plagues up north where they sometimes have to worry about an entire pack storming a property and eating livestock.  If you own a gun for the purpose of shooting people though, then eventually you are going to get shot yourself; it is only a matter of time.

       There is no organic push for increased gun control coming from the public.
       <br/>
       It's an issue that's being jammed down the public's throat via staged events, corrupt MSM and corrupt institutions of education, for the purpose of division and disarmament.

       They are being completely removed from circulation. It's just happening at a slow enough rate that you didn't notice. In the end there will still be some guns in some homes but (1) that's why the most recent generations are being primed to accept a ban on citizen-owned guns, and (2) the PTB don't really need to disarm the public 100%; just 98% or so, which will happen easily at the current rate.

       The thing about stricter gun laws is, the qualifications you need to stop some of these shooters from obtaining guns is really high. And the best would be a mental health check. However most of these people don’t go to a therapist or any doctors to have this checked out. And making laws that strict would more than likely push more individuals with mental health issues deeper underground, in fear that they might not be able to participate in some different areas of our country(not only guns). Besides what would qualify for a mental health denial, being a sociopath? Depression? ADHD? Because there are COUNTLESS mental health issues that don’t even have a name yet, and many that can’t be narrowed down to a single name. But since I was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder as a child, and have since grown out of it and the needs for medication to help it, I might not be able to own a gun? What’s next after that, a car or a drivers license?

       I agree there should be more focus on gun culture and gun safety.  I also want to point out that there is a lot of evidence to support the notion that gun bans and fewer guns translates to fewer deaths.  Look at all the evidence from European countries.

       In the case of the US, you have a situation where the state does not take care of people who are mentally ill very well.  These people can buy guns freely assuming they do not have a previous criminal record.

       The US has so many more guns across so many more people than any other nation, let alone ones that have banned guns. Can you even point to one nation that is just

       No, it's a post that's here to incite discussion. Basically, why is it believed that gun banning is the solution which is pushed so hard when it's
       <em>
        not possible
       </em>
       and why is responsible uptake of firearms not pushed when that
       <em>
        is possible
       </em>
       . And to add to that, one 'solution' sees more or the same amount of bad people with guns and LESS good people with guns and one sees the same thing but more good people with guns.

       No, that isn't at all comparable. Child abuse isn't heavily supported by a large part of the country, who will fight, to the death in some cases, to retain their rights to abuse children.

       The urban Left are Utopian in their outlook.  They think police are completely trustworthy, because in most cases their life experience has never given them reason to believe otherwise.  If you think there are criminals who are untrustworthy, but believe in the idea that the police are exclusively heroic, then it is easy to think that the police should be the only people to have guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gun control advocacy is usually based on two main ideas; the belief that gun ownership unavoidably leads to dead children, and willful naivete about the real nature of at least a large percentage of the police.  Both of said beliefs are hysterically emotive, and people who hold them are generally not receptive to rational thought or persuasion on the topic.

       Automatic guns are notoriously hard to get permits for(usually on the 'not gonna happen' spectrum). They are basically illegal beyond collecting and movie production. There also hasn't been any mass shootings done with automatic weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty much every gun you will ever see any American carrying is a semi automatic or lesser.
      </p>
      <p>
       So sorry, what exactly do you want?

       Semi-Automatic are superior to full auto, from a personal safety, ammo conserving viewpoint, even in most war situations. But law abiding citizens should be allowed to purchase whatever firearm they want. Not because they want war, but because they want their goverment to think twice before they decide to agressively oppress, attack their rights or harm them. Goverments should fear it citizens, not the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thankfully the Founding Fathers understood that the more power a government gets, the more oppressive and evil they become. Look at China, citizens are censored and have to watch what they say and type. If they accidently piss off a local official , the offender and his entire family could end up missing , shipped off to a labor reeducation camp. That's how goverments work when they have nothing to fear.

       It's interesting because so many people do not know what gun shots sound like. As seen in Vegas there were people that had no plan to get away, and some just laid down. I wish people understood guns more at least to know what they sound like, know what cover is, and have a strategy to survive. People just seem to be terrified of guns because of what they have seen on the news and movies.

       Here's my deal about it. I wouldn't never want absolute gun control. I think that it should be like a drivers license. If you are below a certain age (or not whatever works) you need to take a safety class that when you pass you get a license that allows you to own and operate a gun. No new restrictions on certain guns, just you need a license to legally operate and purchase one. I don't understand how taking a gun safety test in order to own one legally is a bad idea. If that was the case then wouldn't that mean if we just got rid of a requirement for drivers licenses then traffic related deaths wouldn't go up? I don't think so.

       There is no pinnacle of technological achievement that would suddenly make conflict obsolete. The inventor of TNT thought his invention was so powerful that it would put an end to all conflict. Yes you are right that drones are a very powerful weapon and that civilians are outmatched technologically. But extrapolating a win or a loss is an exercise in futility because no one would really know what would happen if the people fought back. But knowing that the people do have that option would at least make the ones in power think twice.

       It just means they can't take you and your family from your home like a bunch of helpless ww2 German Jews being led to the slaughter so easily.

       When dealing with major backlash in the form of bullets as a definite outcome to your 'mission', then you'll try and avoid that. It's a deterrent. And armed population is very hard to capture and imprison. Yes you can but you've got to 1: have a very eager force willing to get into firefights regularly for you, fight to the death etc and 2: that same eager force you have at your disposal is willing to shoot/kill other Americans defending the constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's definitely a lot harder than simply having a force willing to kidnap/abduct/arrest unarmed civilians for
       <em>
        insert unnamed mission that's 'for the good of the country, don't you worry soldier'.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not just about the actual revolution and being able to fight a tyrannical govt - its also about deterring the govt from even thinking its an option.

       I do want one. I don't pretend not to. I would love for the 2nd amendment to be entirely repealed. I'll settle for regulations though. Canada had regulations and still has high gun ownership. Sweden is the same way. It helps, even if it isn't perfect.

       WHO decides that you are mentally fit to own a gun?  Some gov't worker?
      </p>
      <p>
       You do know that the right to self defend yourself is "a God given right" not a government privilege?  Because once a higher authority has been ruled out then there is only mankind to decide your fate&gt;&gt;&gt; and we all know how the last 120 years killed millions WHEN the gov't decides what you should and should not have.

       Hey thanks for posting this, this is really helpful for a lot of people here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with what you posted though, is that's on a state to state basis. So, currently in (what sounds like Maryland for you) as well as other states like California, NJ,  Massachusetts, and the like they all have strict gun laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       But places like Texas as long as you have ID, pass a background check, and complete some paperwork you can get a gun in the same day.
       <a href="https://m.wikihow.com/Buy-a-Firearm-in-Texas">
        Source
       </a>
       . Other states like Utah, Arizona, and Alaska make it easier to purchase guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is that some states require you to go through what you posted (which I agree with). Other states do not. The fact that there isn't a nationwide standard to me seems odd. It'd be like my aforementioned drunk driving statement being state to state, where some states say you can drive with a 1.0 and others say it can't be over .02.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, this debate is important to have and I'm glad to be having it. Thanks so much for responding, looking forward to hearing any rebuttal and potentially having my viewpoint changed.

       And we've amended the Constitution several times. It's time to make another. If we just change the language, then it stops being your "God given right." Simple enough.
