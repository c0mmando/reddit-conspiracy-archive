        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems pretty obvious to me:</p>

<p>Guns aren&#39;t going to ever be removed completely from circulation. There are so many guns and so many people that would refuse to give them all up(hide them if not fight back) that they simply cannot be &#39;banned&#39;.</p>

<p>So given that guns aren&#39;t going anywhere, the only option is to embrace them. The majority of people are not psychopathic, and generally want to do good. If there were more people who were trained and carried a gun, there would be less innocent deaths.</p>

<p>To me it seems like the problem is not guns but gun culture, and putting in a solid effort to teaching people and training them to be safer firearm owners while putting out public education in a positive light to increase good citizens to carry to out weigh the bad.. That this would go a long way to reducing gun casualties more so than any other method possible. </p>

<p>Conspiracy? Why is this not pushed more? Why so much hate towards such proposals? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well he did purchase the AR about a year before hand, and coincidentally that was about the time he was in contact with the FBI as I understand it. Most 19yo, actually 18 at the time,  don&#39;t have a spare $1500+ to buy a nice fire arm like that when they could just as easily by a nice pistol for $300. .. And with today&#39;s youth if they had several hundred saved up they would probably spend it on a gaming station or something first before they ever had a spare $1500.

    <div class="md"><p>Something to note though, is that a decent AR-15 is not $1500+ anymore, and decent rifles now run roughly comparable in price to a nice pistol. They can be had for under (sometimes well under) $1000 and still function perfectly fine and reliably. It&#39;s not outside the realm of possibility that he spent his money on a gun versus a game system.</p>

<p>People <em>know</em> from themselves they won&#39;t abuse guns or kill people. They mistrust everyone else though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Realistically it&#39;s both gun restriction and mental illness. It&#39;s not one or the other, <strong>the real conspiracy is why do they keep making it out to be one or the other</strong>.</p>

<p>If this last shooter, who was obviously mentally disturbed (I believe I read somewhere he was going to therapy after losing his mother at some point last year) wasn&#39;t able to obtain a gun as easily (especially with his checkered past) then this wouldn&#39;t have been a problem. Part of the issue is you need both to do it&#39;s job effectively. If it&#39;s more difficult with people who have had checkered pasts, severe mental issues, or if we have better waiting periods for obtaining a gun nation wide AND if he was able to feel he was able to speak freely in his therapy sessions about his problems this tragedy wouldn&#39;t have happened. </p>

<p>On another note, realistically banning the purchase (not removal from people who already own them) of the AR-15 or any other weapon that can shoot over 100 rounds a minute would have helped as well. If this sicko was able to bypass the above solution and only obtain a handgun or something of the like the amount of people killed wouldn&#39;t have been nearly as high. And it would have potentially easier to subdue him. The problem is with the AR15 and guns like it, they can be easily adjusted to fire more and more rounds per minute because that&#39;s what these types of guns are for, they are for sport showings so they are easier to mod and those mods are easier to obtain. It&#39;s no coincidence that in nearly all mass shootings this gun or a gun like it is involved. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/02/14/ar-15-mass-shootings/339519002/">Here&#39;s a source I just looked up as a reference point on the above</a> </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Apparently from someone who has NEVER shot an AR.  An AR mag can be from 10 to 50 rounds.  Then you have to reload.</p>

<p>AND if you are pulling the trigger at that rate, you ain&#39;t hitting ANYTHING.  The AR is nothing more different than any other semi-automatic.</p>

<p>AND a weapon does not kill others UNLESS there is a person using it.  Plain and simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey thanks for responding. I know these type of debates get heated so just know any response I make is 100% sincere and not meant to be taken personally or that I&#39;m talking down at all. </p>

<ol>
<li>AR15s on stock purchase only have mags that hold 10-50 rounds. But because of the prevalence of AR15s in skill shooting competitions there are TONS of attachments and items easily available for purchase in order to increase the shooting power and capacity of these weapons. In the link I provided above, in my initial comment they go into a bit of detail about it.</li>
<li>If you pull the trigger at the rate it&#39;s fired you&#39;re not hitting a target your aiming for. So one target directly in front of you, probably won&#39;t be hit. But in a public place where there are potentially loads of targets precision doesn&#39;t matter. What matters is being able to hit a lot of targets in a short amount of time. So you&#39;re correct 1 target with no others around are not easy to hit at that rate. Multiple targets surrounding that 1 target ARE</li>
<li>Finally, you&#39;re right. Guns don&#39;t kill people, people kill people. The argument also used is when people drive drunk we blame the driver not the car company. Which is also correct.. The issue though is, especially in the USA, if you drive drunk in general and you&#39;re caught, in addition to multiple fines you have your restrictions SEVERELY revoked. And even when they are given back, there are heavy loops someone has to jump through to prevent it happening again. Even before that, even to own a car, you need to go through 3 years of driving experience (potentially), pass a written test, and go through background checks to possess a car. After you pass all that then you&#39;re good to own them. There a tons of loops created to prevent people from drunk driving because of incidents that happen around the country. Why, not with weapons to? </li>
</ol>

<p>As a note, I actually support gun ownership. I think riffles, handguns, and shotguns are fully fine to own specifically because they have to do with hunting. It&#39;s the AR15s I have a problem with and the regulation of being able to purchase a gun from state to state is totally different. It should be the same regulations nation wide for background checks and purchasing a gun, but it&#39;s not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First buying a rifle or pistol one DOES go through a background check.
 To buy one, I would need to fill out a 4473 -- a six-page form from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p>

<p>I&#39;d have to write my name and address. My Social Security Number is optional. And there&#39;s half a page of &quot;yes or no&quot; questions.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you ever been convicted in any court of a felony, or any other crime, for which the judge could have imprisoned you for more than one year, even if you received a shorter sentence including probation?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?&quot;</p>

<p>The dealer calls the FBI&#39;s Criminal Justice Information Services Division, in Clarksburg, W.V., and they give them only the most basic information: name, address, driver&#39;s license number. The FBI runs a background check and then usually gives a yes or no.  Most dealers charge you for a NO answer for wasting their time.</p>

<p>If in Maryland (and other states), and say you want to buy a semi-automatic, like the AK-47 on the wall, or the Colt Officer&#39;s Model in the glass case. That would require additional paperwork.</p>

<p>First, you need to show Arthur your certificate from a firearms safety training course. (You can take one online in 30 minutes.) Then, there&#39;s a form that lets the Maryland State Police check for any record of a mental disorder or violent behavior.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s just four more pages of paperwork,&quot; Arthur says. &quot;It&#39;s just red tape.&quot;</p>

<p>On another form, you have to list current and past employers, and three personal references. And the state does keep track of what you buy.</p>

<p>According to Arthur, &quot;They get the make, the caliber, the type, the finish, the barrel length, the model, the serial number, and what country of origin it was from.&quot;</p>

<p>You do this in quadruplicate. Arthur mails one copy to Maryland State Police Headquarters.</p>

<p>State Police Headquarters is in Pikesville, outside of Baltimore. The Licensing Division is across the street. Sgt. Marc Black says he can&#39;t take me inside, but he can tell me what happens here.</p>

<p>Several investigators go through applications, checking 16 databases. By law, the State Police have seven days to do this. But according to Black, investigators have been &quot;extremely busy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is an increase in applications for firearms,&quot; he says. &quot;We are working around the clock to take care of those increases.&quot;</p>

<p>If Bob Arthur doesn&#39;t hear back from the State Police after seven days, Maryland law says he and the customer don&#39;t have to wait any longer. He can hand over that Colt pistol.</p>

<p>Right now, it usually a state background check takes a month.</p>

<p><strong>So to legally own a gun is not like the media says how it happens</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey thanks for posting this, this is really helpful for a lot of people here. </p>

<p>The problem with what you posted though, is that&#39;s on a state to state basis. So, currently in (what sounds like Maryland for you) as well as other states like California, NJ,  Massachusetts, and the like they all have strict gun laws.</p>

<p>But places like Texas as long as you have ID, pass a background check, and complete some paperwork you can get a gun in the same day. <a href="https://m.wikihow.com/Buy-a-Firearm-in-Texas">Source</a>. Other states like Utah, Arizona, and Alaska make it easier to purchase guns. </p>

<p>The fact is that some states require you to go through what you posted (which I agree with). Other states do not. The fact that there isn&#39;t a nationwide standard to me seems odd. It&#39;d be like my aforementioned drunk driving statement being state to state, where some states say you can drive with a 1.0 and others say it can&#39;t be over .02. </p>

<p>Either way, this debate is important to have and I&#39;m glad to be having it. Thanks so much for responding, looking forward to hearing any rebuttal and potentially having my viewpoint changed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this was enacted nation wide to purchase an AR15, then totally fine with anyone owning one. </p>

<p>^
The obsession with the AR15 is quite telling. There are literally dozens of other firearms with the exact same capabilities, and hundreds more with similar. </p>

<p>The AR15 is simultaneously a Boogeyman and a Trap. The media drives this one specific rifle into the conciousness of the population, and repeatedly points to it as the problem. This rallies people against this one gun, it seems like a simple solution to a grave issue - but most people don&#39;t understand that banning/restricting the AR15 is opening a flood gate for banning/restricting countless other guns.</p>

<p>Besides, even if the AR15 is banned/restricted/regulated, what&#39;s stopping the psychos out there from simply choosing a different rifle?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely right, and the media using it as a bogey man. You&#39;re also right in saying they can go to countless others that impact it, which is what circles back to my original points in that:
1. We do need to have better mental healthcare access to people of all backgrounds. Seeing a therapist or the like should be looked at as common as seeing a dentist or health care physician. If we make it common place, more people can sort out issues easier.
2. Banning/restricting certain types of weapons to people with mental illnesses, with checkered pasts, and also making purchasing guns a bit harder nation wide (not just in some states) it can potentially help stop this. </p>

<p>The problem is just doing one or the other isn&#39;t going to work. It&#39;s not a black and white solution so sometimes it&#39;s trying to find enough similarities between things and sensing patterns to help stop them. </p>

<p>You mentioned that the AR15 is basically a buzzword and really not the problem. But when consistently nearly all mass shootings since 2012 have involved an AR15 that&#39;s an issue. There&#39;s a pattern with that gun that for some reason attracts people looking to do a lot of damage quickly. <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/latest-mass-shootings-all-have-ar-15-in-common/">Source</a> </p>

<p>Once again, I&#39;m not proposing a full on ban of guns like in Australia, I&#39;m proposing something closer to what Japan has enabled and it seems to have worked fairly well for them <a href="http://www.conservapedia.com/Gun_Control_in_Japan">Source on Japan</a>. Once again, this isn&#39;t about (for me at least) rounding up all the gun owners and forcing them to give up their guns. It&#39;s about stricter regulations for people looking to purchase them AND proper mental health screenings by trained professionals.</p>

<p>Thanks for responding, looking forward to chatting more!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with your initial statement. Guns will never fully be gone because politicians would lose their base if they tried such a thing. Getting guns back from people is certainly doable.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t want the US to embrace guns. Common sense gun control is what I would support - licensing requirements, training requirements, no guns if you have a history of violence, and no semi-automatic or automatic guns. </p>

<p>Read up on Switzerland. They have the HIGHEST gun ownership rates, yet a smidgen per capita of gun violence.</p>

<p>WHY? WHAT IS THE SOCIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL REASON FOR THESE MASS SHOOTINGS?? What could it be about our culture SPECIFICALLY other than guns that would drive someone to kill a bunch of people randomly.</p>

<p>For starters, we make them FAMOUS!!
Name and face on every news channel for a week.
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE SHOOTERS is a male. What about men? A male’s archetypal instinct to provide... when economics are WEAK and the middle class in america is DISINTEGRATING?
What about SSRI’s and their overuse by pill pushing doctors who use very little psychotherapy if any to address underlying problems?</p>

<p>The FBI’s sheer idiocy and lunacy to not investigate and MONITOR the people they are repeatedly warned about.</p>

<p>You can &#39;think of the children!&#39;(to be read like when the Simpsons priests wide screams such statements) but some of us prefer to think about the whole country instead.</p>

<p>I mean, cars kill more kids than guns every year.. How &#39;against&#39; cars are you? And those things you need a licence and to pass practical tests to get behind the wheel of - legally, which covers the vast majority of car related deaths. No cars for anyone!! </p>

<p>And what about obesity? Won&#39;t SOMEONE think of all the fat kids who are being setup to live in a body that is trying to kill them? How against unhealthy food being available(to everyone) given how many children(those poor children!) are dying or having their health majorly impacted? No &#39;junk&#39;/processed food for everyone!! </p>

<p>And what about bicycles! Have you heard how many kids are dying riding bikes?!?!?! Around 650-850 cyclists die every year - a significant portion, hell even only 10% of that total being children, would have bikes FAR more dangerous than the total of mass school shootings. </p>

<p>No more bikes for everyone!! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh it&#39;d just that you didn&#39;t mention anything at all when car deaths were brought up. I mean, you seem <em>so</em> concerned about people dying from guns that I figured that surely you are <em>really</em> pro-car reform given that it kills many times more people than the guns you are so very concerned about.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just weird. I mean.. You call my example absurd yet its quite telling really. You don&#39;t care about how deadly cars are as much as guns otherwise you would have said something when cars were brought into this.</p>

<p>You have an overt fear/hatred of guns - one that doesn&#39;t have the numbers to back up. You will probably continue to live in denial of this despite my bringing it to your attention. </p>

<p>When dealing with major backlash in the form of bullets as a definite outcome to your &#39;mission&#39;, then you&#39;ll try and avoid that. It&#39;s a deterrent. And armed population is very hard to capture and imprison. Yes you can but you&#39;ve got to 1: have a very eager force willing to get into firefights regularly for you, fight to the death etc and 2: that same eager force you have at your disposal is willing to shoot/kill other Americans defending the constitution. </p>

<p>That&#39;s definitely a lot harder than simply having a force willing to kidnap/abduct/arrest unarmed civilians for <em>insert unnamed mission that&#39;s &#39;for the good of the country, don&#39;t you worry soldier&#39;.</em></p>

That&#39;s an interesting concept, I&#39;m figuring you would need at least two because, well you know if it&#39;s only one...well then they are the first ones to get shot. The two guys from Columbine put in a lot of planning on their killing rampage, if there had been a couple of security guards you don&#39;t think these would have been the first to get killed? And who is paying for this new security? Jesus the GOP are not exactly throwing money at schools. How many teachers and school programs would need to be cut to pay for armed security? I guess you could arm all the teachers, but again considering the US already has an alarming deficit, why not throw a few more hundred million onto the increasing pile. Arm all the teachers, put them through extensive training! The NRA would love that, lots of $$ for their members. If this latest killer couldn&#39;t get his hand on a gun how many people would he have killed with a knife? Anyway America won&#39;t change, gun advocates have too much power in Washington and spend too much cash to ensure politicians maintain and open door policy on guns. And at the end of the day what&#39;s it matter, it&#39;s all Gods will!! And I&#39;m sure God has an AR15 hanging off his hip. God bless America! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because that&#39;s what worked for every other western country. I think it&#39;s mostly just people like me that don&#39;t understand what the benefit is of having 7000 gun incidents a year with 1900 deaths of which more than 70 are under the age of eleven. I don&#39;t see how anything that yout think you gain from being able to have guns, outweighs almost 2000 killings a year. And don&#39;t give me the &quot;the bad guys will still have guns&quot; bullshit, because every other country in the world that did this found that it is way easier to unarm criminals when there are strict laws against guns. And please, please don&#39;t give me that fake meme thingie about stabbings in the UK, that one is simply false. </p>

<p>America at its core was, is, and I hope to God always will be about individual rights and freedom. The constitution sets out to make sure an individual’s rights always outweighs the capitualtions of the state. The <em>only</em> thing that ensures that is a well armed populous. </p>

<p>“Every other western country” might have benevolent (arguable) governments right now, but the people have literally no recourse when they find themselves too far down the slippery slope of having no guaranteed freedoms. </p>

<p>And Australia is not that great of an example, they have plenty of gun totting criminals and the gun related deaths to go with it.. But stabbings is where you miss the ball.</p>

<p>Countries with reformed gun laws or long standing anti-gun laws have terrible stabbings and far more frequently. Sure it&#39;s harder to take down a whole crowd with a knife but people fucking do it! Acid attacks too. How many on UK this year? 100? 1000? More? </p>

<p>My op is not trying to claim there is any solution to a gun violence. We will never reach 0 gun related deaths/accidents as long as humans exist. It&#39;s about what is <em>best</em> given the ingredients of the situation. And best being defined as least negative/destructive/danger impact, and switching that around where ever possible.</p>

<p>Well more good people having guns sure seems like the better option to the current one of &#39;scare and demonize the idea of carrying firearms as a good citizen and have the majority of those carrying guns do so with illegal and negative intentions&#39;.</p>

<p>The fact that every time a school shooting happens it increases the factor of &#39;you are a psycho and/or murderous and crazy because you carry a gun&#39; to the average citizen through propoganda etc is what I think is really hurting the American public.</p>

<p>How many men have been convinced by their wives(not trying to sound sexist but I know of this happening) to not have guns in the house, to not carry a gun and to shelter the kids from gun use as much as possible. Someone that could be &#39;the positive&#39; in society in related to the unavoidable &#39;gun situation&#39;, is scared away from taking on that role because of stigma and brainwashing from the media.</p>

<p>This happens more and more, it becomes &#39;weirder&#39; and &#39;weirder&#39; to carry a gun.. Then itll be &#39;weird&#39; just to own one. Then itll be &#39;weird&#39; and a &#39;dangerous nazi thought&#39; to even be pro guns or just neautral about it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>When you don&#39;t understand the numbers you are looking at, and/or don&#39;t apply them correctly to reach an accurate conclusion.. Then yes it seems pretty undebatable. </p>

<p>But you are forgetting a few things. For one, Australia did not have a constitution that included the right to bare arms. The very foundation and the words that formed the rules of the land did not include anything about an inherent right to protect yourself and own firearms. </p>

<p>USA however does have this. Which means you are comparing(at the time) about 20mil people who havnt been I taught and told they have the right to guns vs 350mil people who <em>have</em>. </p>

<p>So right there you have a significantly large part of the United States that would simply never give up their guns and would be very likely to fight such action. </p>

<p>So.. Your &#39;take the guns away&#39; is already, without any further examination, going to lead to shit loads of people dying. Yet you still think it&#39;s going to result in less death. </p>

<p>OK, let&#39;s say you managed to pull that off <em>without</em> large scale revolt/militias fighting the cops/military. Somehow.. Magic, whatever. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say 1% of the population are &#39;bad&#39;. 1% of 25million? 250k. 250&#39;000 bad guys. </p>

<p>For the US? 3&#39;500&#39;000 bad guys. Three and a half million people, who are bad, who are now the majority/only holder of firearms. </p>

<p>And 1% is pretty damn low in your favor. So what are you gonna do about these 3.5mil armed bad guys now that the rest of the population is at their mercy?? </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure no one will be raped, or murdered, or robbed. Right? </p>

<p>Or would it go a bit more like this. With lots of good people fighting the govt, and then after a lot of those otherwise &#39;good&#39; law abiding citizens are slaughtered, there would not only be 3.5mil bad guys to rape and pillage with little to no worry, but the country now lacks the biggest deterrent and protection from these people due to all the good guys standing up for their rights against a tyrannical government? </p>

<p>A country with about <strong>14 times</strong> as many people, with twice the rate of gun ownership and inter-generational &#39;right to gun ownership&#39; mentality set in stone by the property that founded their nation VS A small English colony that had no right to bare arms, has way less gun ownership and far less gang related issues including vastly lower breaking and entering/home invasions etc etc. </p>

<p>It&#39;s incomparable. </p>

<p>And this link shows a halving in deaths basically if you account for the increasing population size. Maybe a bit more than half. </p>

<p>However, as someone who knows a bit about Australia - the Australian government/police have been tackling gang activity and the underworld <strong>HEAVILY</strong> since the 90&#39;s. There was a lot of corruption in the police that was weeded out around this time, especially in Sydney which was a hotbed for gun related crime </p>

<p>On top of a much more effective, focused, better funded and less corrupt police force - the Australian govt has allowed the police force to become much more controlling of the population. Roadside checkpoints where they make you perform a swab on the spot to determine if Marijuana or meth are in your system are pretty much commonplace across the cities/suburbs now. Infact general police presence is extremely high - every train station in the major cities have these &#39;half assed&#39; community cops with limited powers. When you travel around Australia, you will regularly be looked over or physically checked depending on where you are and what you look like - it&#39;s becoming more and more authoritarian. Ask any aussie whose born 1990 or before and they&#39;ll back this up.</p>

<p>So the Australians are awarded and ever increasing and expanding authoritarian govt that increases restrictions and creates harsher rules with tougher enforcement while the Australian population has to just sit back and take it because now that all the guns have been taken away, there&#39;s nothing the govt fears as retaliation for acting out like this.</p>

<p>My point in this post is that there&#39;s many factors to account for regarding reduction in homicides, not just the guns being taken away. We can&#39;t ever actually know what impact the gun removal had but it certainly isn&#39;t the only thing responsible. I think the far more focused Australian police tackling gangs is to thank more than anything. </p>

<p>I mean I could line up a graph with the release of the Gameboy with those statistics and it would seem to the ignorant viewer that Gameboy is directly responsible for reduction in homicides. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well to answer your first question, I am very much against anyone owning guns. However you have to understand my perspective; I am Dutch and if my country were to say any law obiding citizen can get a gun, I would feel a million times less safe. Because the thing is that criminals, even in the netherlands, have guns. However, criminals, contrary to popular american view, don&#39;t just randomly go out and shoot innocent people. Chances of you accidentally and unintentionally getting shot by a law obiding citizen are higher that you getting shot by a &quot;criminal&quot; who targets you (unless you are a criminal yourself, that increases the chance by quite a bit.) From my position every gun is one too many. </p>

<p>Having said that I do think that there should be a mandatory buy back with market conform offers. </p>

<p>To answer the final paragraph, you will never know if you never try, and you will never try if this is your basic proposition. (however we would classify 7000 shootings a year as a civil war already, aside from it being a hypothetical.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a big cultural divide on the issue. You can&#39;t compare other counties on the guns, it&#39;s so complex and there&#39;s so many differences in regard to culture, population, Geography. One thing other countries do better in in regards to taking care of its citizens when it comes to healthcare. It&#39;s all about laying a foundation for people to be in a better position. Universal healthcare would help my  country reduce violence a lot I believe. </p>

<p>So you really support people like me being forced with to give up my guns? Wow.  Even Though  I&#39;ve done nothing wrong. Again, i would not give them up. And the starting bid would be 10 times the amount I paid for it. </p>

<p>Again it would not work in America, it would be impossible. Do you know how many guns there are in the the United States ? And how people are not willing to give them up? The US could not afford it montarity and it would lead to a civil war so blood will be on people&#39;s hands who advocated this.  And beside why the hell should we invest so much money into violating the constitution? This country needs to invest in the environment/climate change, education and Heath care. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you say that USA just has to accept the fact that every year 7000 people are shot, more than 2000 people die from those shootings, with amongst them more than 300 children. You claim that the USA situation is too complex to analise with statistics or current and historical comparisons, yet in your same comment you are 100% certain that there is no way to even begin thinking about gun control without a civil war breaking out. Do you actually feel like your opinion and experiences are worth more than models made in many fields of science?</p>

<p>I mean don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t think enforcing gun control in the USA will be easy or will go fast, but refusing to believe the models, to think about good ways to start taking aways guns, simply because it might lead to a civil war.... I find that too philosophically nihilistic. To me that is simply not being open to solving the actual, urgent and very real problem of gun shootings and killings in the USA. </p>

<p>And believe me, I understand you like your guns, but are your guns really worth those 7000 shootings a year. Can you just sell the idea to yourself that because &quot;you don&#39;t want to give up your guns, because you don&#39;t abuse them&quot;, noone has to give up their guns and therefore in the next ten years 70.000 shootings will happen. At how many casualties would you value your guns?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the cross-cultural comparisons that are made about gun-free European countries, Australia or Japan are really influential with people in favor of gun control.  They provide an alternate reality where gun control seems to work.  IMHO, it&#39;s an oversimple comparison that doesn&#39;t take into account a whole panoply of differences between the US and these places that calls into question why it seems to work there.</p>

<p>I think Australia is considered especially good for comparison because of the relative social similarity with the US and the fact that they actually did ban guns and force gun owners to relinquish their weapons.</p>

<p>I agree that even if you decided to accept the premise that banning guns accomplished something, the logistics of doing so in the United States in a manner that was actually effective (ie, removing black market guns at the same rate as legal non-criminally owned guns) is nearly impossible.  And given the size of rural populations where guns have legitimate uses for pest control or farm management (or in wilderness areas where it may be about personal safety), you wouldn&#39;t be able to totally ban them and this would be an injection point for more black market arms which would feed public safety problems.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also funny how <em>many</em> laws there are that regulate guns that gun banners don&#39;t think exist.  I think part of this is due to how many gun laws, especially Federal laws, don&#39;t get prosecuted, and thus seem not to exist to gun banners, creating a perception that there is no legal regulation.  It really should feed the notion that more laws and regulations aren&#39;t effective or are only selectively enforced.  Most everyone, especially those with criminal records, who commit gun crimes should be prosecuted for Federal gun crime violations but they seldom seem to be, usually only serving time for their specific crime (robbery, etc) with perhaps a slight enhancement for the involvement of a gun.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I think Australia is considered especially good for comparison because of the relative social similarity with the US and the fact that they actually did ban guns and force gun owners to relinquish their weapons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There have been repeated amnesties, and there is probably a scenario where if you get caught with a piece in one of the cities, you can possibly expect to get shot yourself, or at least treated with serious prejudice by the police.  I don&#39;t know how hard it actually is to get guns here though, because I haven&#39;t tried; although I am very certain that there are rural areas in the north of the country where people have guns for feral dogs and such, and the police either don&#39;t care, or don&#39;t try and do anything about it because they don&#39;t want to get shot at themselves.</p>

<p>A person&#39;s perspective on guns is going to be purely dependent on life experience.  The main reason why people in cities are opposed to guns, is because they never experience situations where they need them.  There are no wild animals in the cities, and very few people get their homes broken into, although in my experience the cops will only do something about a home invasion if they feel like it.  It&#39;s very easy in that type of situation to start thinking that criminals or psychos are the only people who have a use for guns, and that police are the only people who need them.  I on the other hand have been on the wrong end of a tiny bit of violence in my life; not necessarily much, but enough that I&#39;m a bit more open minded about gun ownership than most.</p>

<p>90% of the urban population go from cradle to grave without a single encounter with the cops, whether good or bad, so they have no practical reason to assume that they are anything but the heroic protectors that the media wants us to think they are.  If more people actually had contact with the police, then you might see the opinion on gun ownership change, a bit; it can be educational to ask someone who has had bad experiences with the police, whether or not they are pro-gun.</p>

<p>I only really endorse gun ownership for use against animals; either for hunting, or for cases like the wild dog plagues up north where they sometimes have to worry about an entire pack storming a property and eating livestock.  If you own a gun for the purpose of shooting people though, then eventually you are going to get shot yourself; it is only a matter of time.</p>

<p>They are being completely removed from circulation. It&#39;s just happening at a slow enough rate that you didn&#39;t notice. In the end there will still be some guns in some homes but (1) that&#39;s why the most recent generations are being primed to accept a ban on citizen-owned guns, and (2) the PTB don&#39;t really need to disarm the public 100%; just 98% or so, which will happen easily at the current rate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about stricter gun laws is, the qualifications you need to stop some of these shooters from obtaining guns is really high. And the best would be a mental health check. However most of these people don’t go to a therapist or any doctors to have this checked out. And making laws that strict would more than likely push more individuals with mental health issues deeper underground, in fear that they might not be able to participate in some different areas of our country(not only guns). Besides what would qualify for a mental health denial, being a sociopath? Depression? ADHD? Because there are COUNTLESS mental health issues that don’t even have a name yet, and many that can’t be narrowed down to a single name. But since I was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder as a child, and have since grown out of it and the needs for medication to help it, I might not be able to own a gun? What’s next after that, a car or a drivers license?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The urban Left are Utopian in their outlook.  They think police are completely trustworthy, because in most cases their life experience has never given them reason to believe otherwise.  If you think there are criminals who are untrustworthy, but believe in the idea that the police are exclusively heroic, then it is easy to think that the police should be the only people to have guns.</p>

<p>Gun control advocacy is usually based on two main ideas; the belief that gun ownership unavoidably leads to dead children, and willful naivete about the real nature of at least a large percentage of the police.  Both of said beliefs are hysterically emotive, and people who hold them are generally not receptive to rational thought or persuasion on the topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Semi-Automatic are superior to full auto, from a personal safety, ammo conserving viewpoint, even in most war situations.

Goverments should fear it citizens, not the other way around. </p>

<p>Thankfully the Founding Fathers understood that the more power a government gets, the more oppressive and evil they become. Look at China, citizens are censored and have to watch what they say and type.

If you are below a certain age (or not whatever works) you need to take a safety class that when you pass you get a license that allows you to own and operate a gun. No new restrictions on certain guns, just you need a license to legally operate and purchase one. I don&#39;t understand how taking a gun safety test in order to own one legally is a bad idea. If that was the case then wouldn&#39;t that mean if we just got rid of a requirement for drivers licenses then traffic related deaths wouldn&#39;t go up? I don&#39;t think so. </p>

<p>The problem with what you posted though, is that&#39;s on a state to state basis. So, currently in (what sounds like Maryland for you) as well as other states like California, NJ,  Massachusetts, and the like they all have strict gun laws.</p>

<p>But places like Texas as long as you have ID, pass a background check, and complete some paperwork you can get a gun in the same day. <a href="https://m.wikihow.com/Buy-a-Firearm-in-Texas">Source</a>. Other states like Utah, Arizona, and Alaska make it easier to purchase guns. </p>

<p>The fact is that some states require you to go through what you posted (which I agree with). Other states do not. The fact that there isn&#39;t a nationwide standard to me seems odd. It&#39;d be like my aforementioned drunk driving statement being state to state, where some states say you can drive with a 1.0 and others say it can&#39;t be over .02. </p>

<p>Either way, this debate is important to have and I&#39;m glad to be having it. Thanks so much for responding, looking forward to hearing any rebuttal and potentially having my viewpoint changed. </p>
