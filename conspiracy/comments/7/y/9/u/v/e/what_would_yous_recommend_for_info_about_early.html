       Like info about civilizations before the civilizations we are taught were 1st (Sumerians "Ur", Mohenjo-daro, etc) I heard Sitchen is a hack supposedly and looked into Dr. Heiser. Just was wondering if yous could recommend any information of that sort that you know of. Thanks in advance

       People bash Sitchin and say he was CIA but he was one of like 5 people on Earth that could read cuniform and translate the tablets. Are they perfect, I seriously doubt it. Dude was human, people make mistakes. Recently Oxford translated the book of Enki, which adds Abit more credibility to Sitchins work. Now people are using to their computer to translate the tablets, so hopefully more and more texts are accurately confirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said I like Gerald Clark, he's a Sitchinite though. Clark is very thorough and really knows the Sumerian stories very well. I also like Michael Tsarion and his lectures on YouTube. Dude is brilliant and has a very wide range of topics he talks about, including Sumerians and Atlantis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out the Aratta civilization. They are older than the Sumerians by 20,000 years. They also mention the Annunaki, which is amazing because it confirmed the Sumerian stories. Really important. Good luck

       Personally I don't. As I said a crew from Oxford just translated some more tabs. The one was called the book of Enki or something like that. These 2 separate translations compliment each other as names, and places match up. So that's good. Also there's computer programs that translate cuniform now and I've seen vids of people doing exactly that. It'll take some time but right now it's looking like his efforts were authentic.

       Question. I see you're open to ancient civilizations and that's cool. But why would you disregard what the Sumerians wrote down? Do you think they are lying? Or how about native American tribes claiming star people visited, or Indians, the Japanese, Chinese, Africans, south Americans, etc. all claiming vehicles came down from the sky? Could they all be lying?

       if you can navigate whit the help of the stars, and knowledge is the true power and you maybe wanna keep that secret,
and people start noticing you looking up at the stars.
      </p>
      <p>
       best way to hide your intention would be something like " you see that star there, its where we come from" 
and the idiots believes your bullshit and starts to worship the stars...

       you know about the 4 ages in greek mythology and the 4 yugas of Hindu mythology? i think they are the one and same and tells the story of 4 cycles of civilization. whit a global natural catostropy between the cycles ( like the younger dryas impact was the catalyst between the third and forth cycle ) 
if we could creat hot air balloons in 1783 why not in one of the past cycles?
      </p>
      <p>
       both the Hindu and Greek mythology says we are in the darkest of cycles. god knows how the golden age of humanity was like

       Fair enough,to each their own. I've considered Blu beam but it was actually the Dogon knowledge of Sirius A/B back in to the 70s that got me. They knew about the mass and gravity of B that should have been impossible to know at that time.  Modern technology could not confirm until 2005. How did they know this info? They claim sky people called Nommo came down and told them.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's actually one of many,many pieces of a puzzle that for me, makes it impossible to deny that it's a very real possibility and IMO the most likely way that humans were created. I could type about 10 pages for why I believe it I'm not here to proselytize. Best of luck friend!
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, to each their own. Just like discussing this stuff. Best of luck

       The Prometheus kind of angle coming to earth to get gold to suspend in their atmosphere is kind of hard to agree with imo. But Sitchen came up with this in the mid-70's where using metal in the atmosphere to reflect the sunlight wasn't even a dream yet, supposedly.

       Ok. In my 5 mins of research before dinner, wiki said it only exists in sumerian myth, but a bunch of other sites say it was in Ukraine. I don't know if Ukraine is home of gold, silver, and lapis lazuli

       It predated Sumer by 20-40, 000 years or something like that. So it was a myth to them. The excavation I saw said it was in modern day Ukraine.

       Considering that captain won't even consider that building construction is responsible for sinking buildings I would rule cultural later as silly kids games too.

       Here's the "I'm interested in real history" starter pack. The Wikipedia link for the Kali Yuga is important. Look at what it says about modern society. Trust me it will give you a better understanding of things. The article gives you a glimpse into the shitstorm of the end of the last ice age. The first youtube link is for a channel that covers and covered many ancient sites, that one will keep you busy for quite a while. The second youtube link is a slightly more active channel for theorizing. Good luck. I almost forgot. Look at a site called Gobleki Tepe. Once again, good luck out there.

      <pre><code>I looked at the yuga thing. So there is like over 400,000 more years of a shitty time but we're in the middle of the 10,000 year golden time???
 And the testing of a 170 sites that all showed massive fires is pretty interesting. The supposed comet could be 62 miles wide and it would've  fucked up the ozone. 1 question I have would be if that was so, how'd the ozone recover pretty quicly?
 I didn't even start the vids yet. I decided to first look into Aratta. Was watching this one last nite where the supposedly found it in Ukraine. Like they found proto-sumerian writing there. It just sucks most of the findings have never been translated from Ukrainian and I can't read that

       I mentioned the Kali Yuga, because once you perhaps start reading religious texts or just really old texts, there's always talk of an 'enlightened age'. The Kali Yuga has two different interpretations. Some say we are in the golden age, and others say the golden age was when whatever people were around during the ice-age. But the events that are supposed to happen during the Kali Yuga are happening.
Here's a few examples:
Lust will be viewed as socially acceptable and sexual intercourse will be seen as the central requirement of life.
Sin will increase exponentially, while virtue will fade and cease to flourish.
People will become addicted to intoxicating drinks and drugs.
Rulers will no longer see it as their duty to promote spirituality, or to protect their subjects: they will become a danger to the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last one is debatable, but there are some leaders that are like this. One example is the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan saying that Islamic terror will be a part of life in London. The ozone question is a really good one. Nobody took this topic seriously until about 40 years ago. So not much attention was given to data about this period, to my knowledge. Language barriers can be quite common concerning this topic, since most people think we are just going to talk aliens all day. Proto-Sumerian writing was also found on a bowl in South America. Ancient Egyptian writing was found in Australia as well. Two more things. Sorry for flooding you with information. You will eventually notice the complete absence of any structures that could be older than ~10,000 years in Mesopotamia. If you can figure out why, you'll be considered a the next Graham Hancock. Also you'll see the following patterns a lot.

        Two brothers or magicians do something.

       <li>

       <li>
        12 of something.
       </li>
       <li>
        One or more tall or perhaps short bearded men give people something.
       </li>
       <li>
        Handbags. Or just somekind of bag. Usually depicted with a god or hero.
(Exclusive to Egyptians)
If you go deep into Egyptian myth and legend. Their god's history's are as detailed as Achilles, or Alexander the great.

       Hey man, no personal insults. I said I "heard he was a hack supposedly" That leaves room for correction/argument of the statement. I wasn't calling him one, I've just heard that he was one. The Prometheus kind of angle coming to earth to get gold to suspend in their atmosphere is kind of hard to agree with imo. But Sitchen came up with this in the mid-70's where using metal in the atmosphere to reflect the sunlight wasn't even a dream yet, supposedly. I'll say he does have that

       i think the whole ancient aliens stuff was pre-work for the upcoming "project blue beam"

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Or how about native American tribes claiming star people visited.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       if you can navigate whit the help of the stars, and knowledge is the true power and you maybe wanna keep that secret,
and people start noticing you looking up at the stars.
      </p>
      <p>
       best way to hide your intention would be something like " you see that star there, its where we come from" 
and the idiots believes your bullshit and starts to worship the stars...

       you know about the 4 ages in greek mythology and the 4 yugas of Hindu mythology? i think they are the one and same and tells the story of 4 cycles of civilization. whit a global natural catostropy between the cycles ( like the younger dryas impact was the catalyst between the third and forth cycle ) 
if we could creat hot air balloons in 1783 why not in one of the past cycles?
      </p>
      <p>
       both the Hindu and Greek mythology says we are in the darkest of cycles. god knows how the golden age of humanity was like

       The Prometheus kind of angle coming to earth to get gold to suspend in their atmosphere is kind of hard to agree with imo. But Sitchen came up with this in the mid-70's where using metal in the atmosphere to reflect the sunlight wasn't even a dream yet, supposedly.

       I mentioned the Kali Yuga, because once you perhaps start reading religious texts or just really old texts, there's always talk of an 'enlightened age'. The Kali Yuga has two different interpretations. Some say we are in the golden age, and others say the golden age was when whatever people were around during the ice-age. But the events that are supposed to happen during the Kali Yuga are happening.
Here's a few examples:
Lust will be viewed as socially acceptable and sexual intercourse will be seen as the central requirement of life.
Sin will increase exponentially, while virtue will fade and cease to flourish.
People will become addicted to intoxicating drinks and drugs.
Rulers will no longer see it as their duty to promote spirituality, or to protect their subjects: they will become a danger to the world.
      </p>

       The last one is debatable, but there are some leaders that are like this. One example is the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan saying that Islamic terror will be a part of life in London. The ozone question is a really good one. Nobody took this topic seriously until about 40 years ago. So not much attention was given to data about this period, to my knowledge. Language barriers can be quite common concerning this topic, since most people think we are just going to talk aliens all day. Proto-Sumerian writing was also found on a bowl in South America. Ancient Egyptian writing was found in Australia as well. Two more things. Sorry for flooding you with information. You will eventually notice the complete absence of any structures that could be older than ~10,000 years in Mesopotamia. If you can figure out why, you'll be considered a the next Graham Hancock. Also you'll see the following patterns a lot.

      <ol>
       <li>
        Two brothers or magicians do something.
       </li>
       <li>
        72 of something.
       </li>
       <li>
        3 of something.
       </li>
       <li>
        12 of something.
       </li>
       <li>
        One or more tall or perhaps short bearded men give people something.
       </li>
       <li>
        Handbags. Or just somekind of bag. Usually depicted with a god or hero.
(Exclusive to Egyptians)
If you go deep into Egyptian myth and legend. Their god's history's are as detailed as Achilles, or Alexander the great.
