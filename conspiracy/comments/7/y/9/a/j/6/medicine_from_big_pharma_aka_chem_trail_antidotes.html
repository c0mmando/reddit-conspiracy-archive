<p>Now since getting sick, we are compelled to buy these medicines, causing big pharma to get a profit.</p>

<p>Big pharma might just be an illusion put in place to get you to buy their products... but idk for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hold up on your aggressive attacks on the op! They have a very plausible hypothesis for what they see happening around them.  To give this kind of conjecture,  the op indeed is an informed individual able to connect dots they have researchedand observed around them.  I too have these same ideas and feel like I am being sprayed by chemicals and diseases and god knows what else on me almost daily through chemtrails.  They are a real thing whether you want to distort the truth or not,  they are not from regular jets,  I have eyes and know the difference.  Jets don&#39;t make checker boards in the sky and do loops and weird flight patterns while expelling some white lines that dissipate into hazy cloud like covering.  I wish I had a lab and could analyze what&#39;s coming down on us,  but I don&#39;t.  Until then I will keep looking for those scientists willing to step up and look into this shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you watch WITWATS, what inthe world are they spraying, they tell you exactly what is in the those trails by what ends up in ground water and soil.  Patents for SRM (solar radiation management) and other geoengineering tools tell you exactly whats going on.  Global dimming and other related byproducts of these actions all are a good place to start.</p>

<p>Not saying chemtrails don&#39;t exist.  They certainly do.  I think the idea of putting colds and flu or worse in them is unsupported and possibly used to discredit the topic of geoengineering in the eyes of those who may research the topic.</p>

<p>You can start with all the aluminum, barium and strontium that has been found, expose the topic for at least those crimes agains us and if it turns out they are putting something else that makes people sick....so be it.  </p>

<p>Consider what falling into that potentially easy trap can do real damage to us all as we try and expose what is being tested on us every day.</p>
