<p>I never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said “it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.” The Russian “hoax” was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Donald Trump says he again asked Vladimir Putin if he interfered in the US election and the Russian leader reassured him &quot;he absolutely did not meddle&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it,&quot; Mr Trump told reporters on Air Force One.</p>

<p>He said every time he sees the Russia leader, Mr Putin tells him: &quot;I didn&#39;t do that&quot; and is &quot;very insulted&quot; by claims he interfered.</p>

<p>&quot;You can only ask so many times... He said he absolutely did not meddle in our election,&quot; said the President.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People were concerned about collusion - we know Russia meddled but we didn’t know if Trump worked with them.  Ideally, Trump is just an idiot who’s been manipulated by Russia and he honestly had no idea they were doing it.  It would be sad if our president was compromised by another country willingly.</p>

<p>And, no, your example isn’t gaslighting.  People saw evidence of Russian interference and now we have enough proof to bring it to court.  That might make some people feel vindicated.  It is not the result of any of the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target&#39;s belief.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s what Trump does.  Trump cares more about his image than the truth.  He says whatever he wants, he lies constantly, he makes random accusations, and it’s all done to maintains his image.  If you’re a fan of his rhetoric then you’re one of his targets.  You’re the type of person Trump knows how to manipulate.</p>

<p>He talks about Putin, so he definitely specifically meant Putin didn&#39;t personally do something. He wasn&#39;t talking about Russia, just Putin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to be a stickler, but narcissism is a personality disorder, not insanity.  </p>

<p>Gaslighting is annoying, but if people don&#39;t want to, they don&#39;t HAVE to believe his lies.  There are actually extremely dangerous aspects of Trump being sick like this.</p>

<p>He is easy to manipulate.  Why do you think he has those strange &quot;you are the best, we worship you&quot; round tables?  Is it because he&#39;s wonderful, and everybody really wants to thank him for allowing them to exist in his radiant presence?  Not really.  Those people want him to behave, and the way they get him to behave is to stroke his ego.  Same as when he disclosed Israeli intelligence secrets to the Russians.  He just wanted to be big and important and be admired in powerful circles, and he will do what he needs to do to be &quot;liked&quot; by a major world nuclear power, who cares if they are generally enemies of the USA?  </p>

<p>He has no empathy.  He can fake caring about miners or whoever, because he wants them to vote for him.  But if he actually had to help a miner, in the flesh, he wouldn&#39;t do it because he doesn&#39;t care.  That&#39;s why he doesn&#39;t help Puerto Rico.  That&#39;s why he whores around, even after Barron was just born.  </p>

<p>When something goes &quot;wrong&quot;, Trump will blame someone else for it.  He is unable to take personal responsibility.  That&#39;s why he keeps firing people.  I mean, he hasn&#39;t attracted the best talent to begin with, but that isn&#39;t due to the personality disorder.  The personality disorder is the reason that his loyalty only goes one way.  The problem with this, is that it causes a constant instability and chaos in the group of people who should be focused on doing their jobs.  There&#39;s also the risk that Trumpsters will believe his claims that the problems are all somebody else&#39;s fault, but there&#39;s really no hope for that cult anyway.</p>

<p>Trump also becomes aggressive when threatened.  This is why he attacks everyone who insults him with such vigor.  This is why he holds grudges.  This is why he does such a blatant job of obstructing justice.  If justice is coming for him, he&#39;ll attack every single institution and person involved in holding him to account, using every single tool at his disposal.</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t care about anything that does not relate directly to benefitting himself.  This is why he can&#39;t handle intelligence briefings.    He just doesn&#39;t care what is happening in the country.  He may be smart enough, but he just DOES NOT CARE. This is why he only cares that he has good ratings, and big crowd sizes, who visits his hotels, etc.  This is why he wants loyalty oaths from everybody.  Probably also why he thinks using nuclear weapons is a viable option.  What does he care if the rest of the country gets vaporized?  He&#39;ll be in a bunker protected by the secret service.  This is the most dangerous aspect of narcissism.  Because Trump will betray the country if it benefits him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The collusion allegations have handicapped Trump is several ways, assuming his ultimate innocence. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>If he admitted a Russian op to influence the election, he admits phase one of the collusion narrative (you need &quot;meddling&quot; to be true in order to establish the notion of subsequent coordination).</p></li>
<li><p>If he admitted a Russian op influenced the election, he puts a portion of his own victory in doubt and indirectly admits that he had help, as part of the program was to prop him up and take down his opponent. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>So as I&#39;ve seen it, his resistance to admit meddling from day one has always been a political move to shift public perception and indirectly defend himself against collusion allegations. </p>

Take some true fact or statement, then intentionally take it out of context or impute meaning to it that the originator did not ever intend (and so he clarifies, which he shouldnt have to do, but has to constantly do), all to try and push an agenda and make people THINK he meant what the propagandists want.

    <div class="md"><p>he has repeatedly said the SC was a witch hunt, and NO COLLUSION. you said yourself he said this twice in the same thought stream. How manybtimes would be enough, your highness? how about it doesnt matter, because like all other leftstream media puppets on a string all you care about are more excuses to give you confirmation for propaganda narratives you bought into long ago. And then you tell me to leave because the truth shatters your worldview.</p>

<p>Sorry, bud. the rules of this sub say its NON PARTISAN. that means I am free to civilly and with great affection point out bullshit leftist media propaganda narratives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think you guys were just unbelievably stupid, but it&#39;s becoming clear you&#39;re actually malicious trolls.  You just accused me of confirmation bias in the same post where you ignore that I said Trump has called the investigation a witch hunt multiple times and once even said verbatim that the entire thing is a witch hunt and then took my statement out of context that he&#39;s only mentioned collusion and witch hunt together twice.  That is literally confirmation bias and I think it proves that you guys know exactly what you&#39;re doing.  </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s not going to do any good but I&#39;m going to explain to you how logic works.  You made the claim that it was disgusting that MSNBC claimed that Trump called the Mueller investigation a witch hunt.  You made the claim that Trumplethinskin was only referring to the collusion aspect.  It&#39;s actually up to you to show that every time he said witch hunt he was talking about collusion.  I did your job for you and actually showed that he used the phrase witch hunt several times without ever mentioning collusion.  </p>

<p>Who the fuck am I to tell someone they have to leave?  I was merely advising you that no one outside of your echo chamber is buying your shit.  Feel free to hang out and spew whatever you want, sunshine.</p>

<p>You act like Trump respects the meddling part of the investigation, because he was ONLY referring to the collusion part as a witch hunt.</p>

<p>he specifically ADDRESSED the russian meddling part already. Then he had to REMIND everyone, because leftstream media tried to lie (of course) and say he called the entire thing a hoax, which he didnt.</p>

<p>Im not outraged by anything. I am horrified that supposedly intelligent people cant detect that the leftstream media is nonstop 24/7 propaganda, and yet are so mind controlled, so brainwashed, that they swallow each and every Trump hate narrative, so that he literally HAS to take to twitter to remind people of the truth.</p>

<p>And the media, SO HATEFUL that Trump  has his own communication channel and can expose their lies - HAHA - continues their indoctrination having you magpies call what HE says &quot;propaganda&quot;?</p>

<p>Hey dum-dum.</p>

<p>Which is more likely to be propaganda?</p>

<p>A single guy and his twitter feed?</p>

<p>Or an entire global mediaplex that permeates nearly every piece of modern society?</p>

<p>Since you are such a genius, I will leave that to you to figure out. It isnt a tough riddle. And even if you want to call BOTH of them propaganda, do you have ANY idea at all what 2 sides each fights for in reality? </p>

<p>Im sure you dont.</p>

<p>Thankfully, doesnt matter. Trump&#39;s still president.</p>

<p>We have been over this already. Trump even had to send ANOTHER tweet to remind everyone because media fired up all you mind controlled hate zombies that he said SEVERAL TIMES that the &quot;COLLUSION&quot; was a hox and withc hunt - which it is - he said when SPECIFICALLY ASKED about &quot;meddling&quot; that he agreed there was attempted interference and from a variety of unknown sources. He literally said that. So he never denied interference, or at least attempts at it.</p>

<p>You guys are such pied piper material. MSNBC spouts it and you nod your heads dutifully and parrot (they actually called Nunes a russian agent the other day). Unreal. I cant tell if you are really this indoctrinated or if you are shariablue payroll.</p>

<p>for about the 5th time, he called &quot;COLLUSION&quot; a hoax, a ruse. And a witch hunt. He NEVER said there was no interference, which was the other part of Muellers 2 part appointment. In fact, when asked specifically about interference, he said SOMEONE <strong>DID</strong> attempt to interfere.</p>

<p>You are literally making up his own words. Because media told you so. This doesnt get any more frightening as far as a study in brainwashing. You LITERALLY defend the media TELLING YOU what Trump said, instead of accepting his REMINDER to you of what he actually said!!   I mean HOW INSANE is that?</p>

<p>Media has literally driven you insane.</p>

<p>If you have a tweet or video of Trump saying specifically that &quot;interference&quot; or &quot;meddlng&quot; is a hoax, then post it right here right now. Not your paraphrasing you got from a <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> headline, but the source. Right here. Right now.</p>

<p>Yes, he did.  Yes, he did. I&#39;m not arguing whether he ever said there was no interference, moron.  I like how you change the narrative, though. I challenged you to tell me whether he ever called the russia investigation a hoax. NOT the colluding part, but the meddling part.  Go google his 9/22/17 tweet.

    <div class="md"><p>ok, so if he SPECIFICALLY said there <strong>was</strong> interference of some form from some quarter(s), which he did, but yet you want to point to his 9/22 tweet where he said the facebook ads were part of the russia hoax?</p>

<p>He could have meant a hundred different things by &quot;russian hoax&quot;, and he had already specifically said SOMEONE interfered. Several times, actually.</p>

<p>2) puppeted by leftists - usually well-meaning rabid libs. This is by far the overwhelming majority.  And increasinlgy not US citizens, because the major vehicle to indoctrinate and puppet is the leftstream media, which has become a laughing stock in the US but still powerfully globally</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not to be a stickler, but narcissism is a personality disorder, not insanity.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gaslighting is annoying, but if people don&#39;t want to, they don&#39;t HAVE to believe his lies.  There are actually extremely dangerous aspects of Trump being sick like this.</p>

<p>He is easy to manipulate.  Why do you think he has those strange &quot;you are the best, we worship you&quot; round tables?  Is it because he&#39;s wonderful, and everybody really wants to thank him for allowing them to exist in his radiant presence?  Not really.  Those people want him to behave, and the way they get him to behave is to stroke his ego.  Same as when he disclosed Israeli intelligence secrets to the Russians.  He just wanted to be big and important and be admired in powerful circles, and he will do what he needs to do to be &quot;liked&quot; by a major world nuclear power, who cares if they are generally enemies of the USA?  </p>

<p>He has no empathy.  He can fake caring about miners or whoever, because he wants them to vote for him.  But if he actually had to help a miner, in the flesh, he wouldn&#39;t do it because he doesn&#39;t care.  That&#39;s why he doesn&#39;t help Puerto Rico.  That&#39;s why he whores around, even after Barron was just born.  </p>

<p>When something goes &quot;wrong&quot;, Trump will blame someone else for it.  He is unable to take personal responsibility.  That&#39;s why he keeps firing people.  I mean, he hasn&#39;t attracted the best talent to begin with, but that isn&#39;t due to the personality disorder.  The personality disorder is the reason that his loyalty only goes one way.  The problem with this, is that it causes a constant instability and chaos in the group of people who should be focused on doing their jobs.  There&#39;s also the risk that Trumpsters will believe his claims that the problems are all somebody else&#39;s fault, but there&#39;s really no hope for that cult anyway.</p>

<p>Trump also becomes aggressive when threatened.  This is why he attacks everyone who insults him with such vigor.  This is why he holds grudges.  This is why he does such a blatant job of obstructing justice.  If justice is coming for him, he&#39;ll attack every single institution and person involved in holding him to account, using every single tool at his disposal.</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t care about anything that does not relate directly to benefitting himself.  This is why he can&#39;t handle intelligence briefings.    He just doesn&#39;t care what is happening in the country.  He may be smart enough, but he just DOES NOT CARE. This is why he only cares that he has good ratings, and big crowd sizes, who visits his hotels, etc.  This is why he wants loyalty oaths from everybody.  Probably also why he thinks using nuclear weapons is a viable option.  What does he care if the rest of the country gets vaporized?  He&#39;ll be in a bunker protected by the secret service.  This is the most dangerous aspect of narcissism.  Because Trump will betray the country if it benefits him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wow thats an excellent psychological profile of someone whom you have never met and whose words and actions you only see/hear thru a leftist filter (whether intentionally or unwittingly).</p>

<p>that he seems to have some of the psychological traits is only relevant in that, in my own view, anyone who would even attempt to take on the establishment cesspool NEEDED to have those traits, extreme self confidence, pugnacious attitude.  What you label abhorrent, I consider vital.</p>

<p>And where we disagree is your opinion of his thoughts and motives. Again whether you are a leftist or just a well meaning lib who has been brainwashed by the leftist media narratives, it is vile and revolting to me and tens of millions of Trump supporters who know that Trumps motives are pure, he is a patriot the likes we have never seen in our lifetimes. How do we know?</p>

<p>Just look at what he has DONE. While in office. Yes, the congress and judiciary have hobbled, obstructed, and hamstrung his every MAGA agenda move. But the important part is that he has attempted and is still working at FULFILLING EVERYTHING HE SAID HE WOULD DO.</p>

<p>that alone should show his character. It does to anyone sane and rational. But leftist haters and their zombie army of the media brainwashing wont see that and instead spout the vile and despicable psychoanalysis as you have.</p>

<p>I am <strong>GLAD</strong> he&#39;s an asshole, only an asshole could have fought back against the media brainwashed zombie army that includes  dummies such as yourself.</p>

<p>So <strong>YES</strong> him doing what he promised to do <strong>DOES</strong> show his character. It shows he has integrity, that he isnt a &quot;conman&quot;. Ya know, like the last 4 presidents in a row, in our rigged system where the figurehead is selected behind the scenes.</p>

<p>I didnt say he was Jesus, I said he has integrity, and his actions have PROVEN IT. Incredible how your media brainwshing has you SO full of hate you cant even acknowledge the simplest truths. Media mind control is actual frightening.</p>

<p>No, they dont ATTEMPT to do what they say. They actually do whatever their donors tell them once in. If you dont know this, then you are intentionally blind, or perhaps just incredibly stupid. In contrast, Trump has done EVERYTHING he said he would do, with that caveat that if 2/3 of the government blocks him (and they have) he has the limitations of his office. But that isnt what we have had from past presidents. We had literally say one thing then do another.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump talks trash about everyone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not <strong>everyone</strong> - he talks trash about the fucksticks that attack HIM or are harming America, he calls out the propaganda leftstream media, he refuses to just let them lie to the public 24/7, which is what they have been doing for decades, controlling the thoughts of magpies like you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can YOU prove it was &quot;no trolls required&quot; that borne you your &quot;A HA moment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I can.  I remember the exact moment.  It was a few months before the election. I though Trump was a racist and although I respected him as a businessman and TV person, after all he was well known and liked for decades, but I was buying in to the media stories - just like everyone else.</p>

<p>I remember the day, anyways, when a couple months before the election, I was using Google news to aggregate the news articles for me - a common thing I think - and I happened to notice that ALL EIGHT of my headlines under &quot;politics&quot; were literally RABID Trump hate stories. I mean, over-the-top &quot;Trump is Satan&quot; stories, everything from the hitler line to racist to xenophobe muslims will be in camps, the whole bit.</p>

<p>I stopped and though, &quot;waittaminit - I dont care WHO it is, no one could be this pure evil, and if it WAS true, from a figure who has been in the public eye for decades, wouldnt all this be common knowledge by now&quot;?</p>

<p>And these werent &quot;Russian Troll&quot; articles I was viewing, they were all the WaPos, NYT, LATimes, all mainstream media.</p>

<p>Thats when the light bulb went off, for me. Because when you realize they arent merely publishing news, they are pushing an opinion on you, it is a huge AH HA moment.</p>

<p>So I began to dig. WHAT were they overall trying to do? And why?  Werent they just &quot;news&quot;?</p>

<p>I can tell you tens of millions of Trump supporters have had that moment. And Trump hadnt even called out the fake news yet. Later, he would, and by now it is a commonly known thing, <em>MAINSTREAM MEDIA IS, IN FACT, LEFTIST PROPAGANDA</em></p>

<p>My hatred for them is not that they are leftists, it is that they lied for so long and pretended to be innocuous and trustworthy &quot;news&quot;, they played on - AND RUINED - our trust.</p>

<p>So, nothing to do with &quot;russians&quot;. It was our OWN media.</p>

<p>Please feel free to awaken from the matrix they have created at your own pace.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen that before.</p>

<p>Its quite good.</p>

<p>I agree with the theories.</p>

<p>This is why the primary point I try to get across to anyone who hates Trump is that Im not going to try and STOP them from hating Trump. Im merely going to expose some reality, which I myself wasnt aware of until a few months before the election.</p>

<p>That reality is that the global news media, the entire entertainment mediaplex, is very largely, nearly exclusively, a propaganda tool for the left.</p>

<p>Hardly any liberals realize this. Some leftists do, and yes to me a leftist/marxist is different than a liberal. Liberal ideas are common for any decent people, unfortunately they are used as props and tools by the left, whom I find vile.</p>

<p>Back in the day when I was a child, I actually asked my mom as I watched the TV news one night if it was illegal to say a lie on the news. she laughed.  The POINT is that all of us in the public with a tiny exception group at one time TRUSTED the news media and entertainment in general to be a-political, neutral. In the measurmement called the &quot;Overton Window&quot;, we all assumed (because they assured us so) that they were Centrist and honest journalism.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, nothing is farther from the truth.  And its all I REALLY try to expose on Reddit.</p>

<p>Of course, once you realize that, for many it sets off a chain reaction called &quot;red-pilling&quot;, because enlightened people do not generally promote a system where they will eventually be slaves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well it applies to me in that I know am instantly DISTRUSTFUL of anything put out by the leftstream media.</p>

<p>And of course, that isnt fair, either. They do some honest and good reporting. Just seldom. And their out-of-control propaganda is outrageous.</p>

<p>I mean, seriously. They were screaming at the top of their lungs before the election that Trump was going to incarcerate Muslims in concentration camps!</p>

<p>I think calling them &quot;fake news&quot; is exceedingly kind.</p>

<p>Its also not the point. Their dishonesty is the point.</p>

<p>Getting back to that article, how I react is beside the issue. Yes, the media may introduce ideas I may resist. But my reaction is incidental. What is relevant is : &quot;are they presenting this news honestly or not?&quot;</p>

<p>If their track record SCREAMS &quot;not&quot;, then my &quot;resistance&quot; to their ideas is not only normal, it begs the question of why people should bother reading/watching them at all?  To try and pick out the few truthful crumbs of data?</p>

<p>And BTW, that is a horrendously overused lefty talking point to accuse me of &quot;label anything that goes against your ideals as Fake News Media?&quot;</p>

<p>I dont &quot;label anything&quot;, I expose propaganda for what it is. If it is truthful, it isnt going to &quot;go against my ideals&quot;.  I see articles critical of Trump all the time that have some merit to the criticism.</p>

<p>I am against the dishonesty and the extreme nature of the supposed &quot;news&quot;. Any clear headed person should be.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>However my opionions are irrelevant,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I ahve no problem with Canadians - but I DO think the US public has more completely come to realize the joke that the media is than other countries citizens have.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do you support trump?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I <em>support</em> his agenda. Its what I voted for. I <em>admire and appreciate</em> his personality. he is a tough leader, a good negotiator, a winner. He does what he says he would do. He was already famous, in the public eye for decades. He was already rich, a billionaire. he didnt take money from special interests and large donors, he owes no one.  His pugnacious attitude are absolutely essnetial in fighting off the VILE and disgusting mess we have become with the triumvirate of the media/corrupted deep state/moneyed lobby interests in government.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do you consider establishment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>anyone in federal government as part of the group of elected officials or the bureaucracy of political appointees who puts self interests (including donor interests) above the interests of who are SUPPOSED TO be their constituents, which are the people and the country. There are many examples, and the term usually refers to them as establishment because it is what happens to well-meaning politicians once they GET INTO office.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wouldn&#39;t Trump being rich mean he is apart of the Elite?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would it? Elite are those who put self interest ahead of constituents or country. Their financial status is not relevant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you give me a list of all the things he has done that are in reference to MAGA?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are many lists compiled already - use google.  Most importantly he has proposed or attempted pretty much EVERYTHING he said he would as opposed to the last 4 or 5 presidents, who all said one thing (to get elected), then did another (to serve their donors). Establishment.</p>

<p>It isnt actually that complex. Establishment HATES him, because he doesnt play the game they had down pat. In fact he exposed it, so tens of millions of Americans like me, who werent even AWARE of the game, now know, and wont let it continue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think you guys were just unbelievably stupid, but it&#39;s becoming clear you&#39;re actually malicious trolls.  You just accused me of confirmation bias in the same post where you ignore that I said Trump has called the investigation a witch hunt multiple times and once even said verbatim that the entire thing is a witch hunt and then took my statement out of context that he&#39;s only mentioned collusion and witch hunt together twice.  That is literally confirmation bias and I think it proves that you guys know exactly what you&#39;re doing.  </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s not going to do any good but I&#39;m going to explain to you how logic works.  You made the claim that it was disgusting that MSNBC claimed that Trump called the Mueller investigation a witch hunt.  You made the claim that Trumplethinskin was only referring to the collusion aspect.  It&#39;s actually up to you to show that every time he said witch hunt he was talking about collusion.  I did your job for you and actually showed that he used the phrase witch hunt several times without ever mentioning collusion.  </p>

<p>Who the fuck am I to tell someone they have to leave?  I was merely advising you that no one outside of your echo chamber is buying your shit.  Feel free to hang out and spew whatever you want, sunshine.</p>
