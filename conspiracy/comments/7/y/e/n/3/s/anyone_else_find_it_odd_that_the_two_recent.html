    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I still think the downing of the Russian Red Army Choir was another that was likely intentional, among several now. The silence from Russia on all of these downings implies imho, that they know they&#39;re being targeted. All the way back to the MH17 being shot down by .. &quot;Russians&quot; in Ukrainian territory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree. there was always something fishy about that plane with the Russian choir. out of all the possible planes.</p>

<p>You can add the russian plane from the Sinai that was felled by a bomb.</p>

<p>The common thread between these plane disasters (including the &quot;disappeared&#39; MH370 and MH17) is how little came to be known about those crashes. </p>

<p>Chances are Russia knows exactly what&#39;s happening but we can easily see why it wouldn&#39;t be in its best interest to disclose what is known (except for the MH17, where a sabotage of the navigation system was not required to understand what really happened. The only unknown there is whether the plane was brought down by air-to-air fire, or just the Buk missile, or a combination of both. Of course, the Dutch know the answer as well, but cannot say openly).</p>

<p>For a while now I have been convinced that the MH370 was the first trial run of a remote take-over. Why choose malasia has a simple answer - it has little power and is a Muslim state, which combine to make it rather weak in pressing its case. Since &quot;they&quot; had to choose something somewhere, and the decision must have been made to target a civilian airline for a most impressive demonstration, and the target airline couldn&#39;t be from one of the major geopolitical players and/or affiliates, it made a lot of sense to pick a smaller south Asian country whose plane would be ditched.</p>

<p>An aside; like in many of these cases it was not the actual event that went wrong with the MH370 but the cover-up. Pieces of the plane were supposed to be found in the Indian ocean but perhaps the ocean did not co-operate.</p>

<p>4/5 of the holders of a semiconductor patent also died on one of the Malaysia flights. The 5th holder is Jacob Rothschild. </p>
