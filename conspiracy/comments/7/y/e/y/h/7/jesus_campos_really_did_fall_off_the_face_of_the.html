I’ve read that at a close range it would take about a dozen surgeries to repair the damage from a round that he was firing.

    <div class="md"><p>I just went through the report, it’s 81 pages but it refers to him walking to his final assignment, room 32-129 on that wing(Paddock was in room 33-135 on the corner with 32-134 next to it).  He heard what he thought was automatic gunfire coming from the end of the hall and then realized he had been hit. He notified dispatch of his findings advised he was shot with either a BB or pellet gun. He took cover into the alcove of 122-124. </p>

<p>This was CLOSE! The next door alcove down from Paddock was 132-130, the alcove after would be 128-126, Campos took cover immediately after being shot in the 24-22 alcove or the 3rd alcove from the end of the hallway. It can be assumed he did not run toward the gun fire to take cover, so whatever the distance from the 3rd alcove down is to the end of the Hall is the maximum distance that BB traveled from that automatic gunfire to strike him. There is no mention of a bullet fragment as you state, but one can use that terminology to downplay the impact of a .223 bullet from an AR-15 at a close distance. But if you re read the LVMPD 81 Page report and find the fragment mention, I would definitely stand corrected. I am using my mobile and couldn’t find a way to search for the fragment in leg statement you put in quotes as if it were cited word for word.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Security Officer Campos was not shot with a BB gun

<p>Also the report says it was a fragment of a bullet on page 12.</p>

<p>Makes sense that Campos thought it was BB or Pellet gun if he was hit with only a fragment of a bullet</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes total sense. My initial comment was requesting the extent of the injury theories , but it sounds like they just slapped a band aid on him and sent him frolicking into the night and we all should just chill out and stop trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. I don’t quite remember but I did read or hear someone theorize that a .223 round at that distance would do some damage and wanted to know if anyone else had the link since I could not find it, nothing more...<br/>
But yes he hears the automatic gunfire, grabs a phone, calls it in and tells them he’s been shot with a BB or pellet gun and hunkers down as more automatic gunfire is heard. That’s what I would’ve thought had a bullet fragment just struck me in that random casino hallway while I was on my regular patrol that ended just outside the door of a mass murderer opening fire out of his window like he was in Al Nasiriyha circa 2004. Honestly I truly think it should have been quite easy to explain his actions and observations and answer simple questions and I wish to God he would have just done the interviews that were requested of him. Only doing the controlled environment on Ellen interview and canceling the rest of them while he was in demand and slipping away into obscurity only adds to the intrigue for me. And that’s why I am here quite honestly, I found Jesus Campos and the entire incident intriguing. I am fortunate to not have known anyone involved in the incident, I live across the country from Vegas and I was stunned and saddened by this massacre. I come here to listen to alternative theories and try to work them out. That’s what this sub is. I suppose if I wanted to be spoon fed the LVMPD narrative I should be over in one of Reddit’s many news subs no? Do you come here to read everyone the police report? It is helpful and necessary to have open and honest dialogue but seriously to just ask if anyone had heard or read the theory about the power of the round and the damage it would have done at that range in the conspiracy sub and be neatly directed by hand over to the police report like a toddler is hilarious to me. I’m exhausted already there really is no point in coming to this sub with regard to certain subjects, the spirit of the sub has jumped the shark. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>??</p>

<p>You asked information about the type of ammo he took to the leg. I answered that it was said to be only a fragment in the report. I answered because I thought you were wondering why the injuries weren&#39;t bad and on that basis questioning if he was even hit.</p>

<p>Then you started to break down the report slightly misrepresentig it and even claimed that the information I delivered about the bullet fragment was not there. Then I just pointed where it was.</p>

Holy shit, what a lucky guy to only get struck  in the calf by a bullet fragment that close up from the gun of a man that was spraying .223 rounds indiscriminately into a concert full of people murdering 58 and injuring hundreds.
