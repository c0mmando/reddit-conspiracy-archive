       That's easy to explain. The Soviet Union fell in 1991. The USA didn't have to worry about providing a nuclear war with Russia because they were the only superpower left and could become the world police.

        Vietnam? War! Korea? War! Cambodia? We financially supported the most brutal state socialist regime in history, the Khmer Rouge, because they were politically opposed to the Vietnamese Communists. We ALSO dropped more bombs on southeast asia than in the entire Pacific Theater of WWII.

        Funny how all these actions seem to have, in effect, kept these countries' markets open for western exploitation! What a wacky and hilarious coincidence, right? Isn't it totally crazy how these countries just happen to now make all of our cheap shirts and clothes and shit?

       Idk what point you're trying to make. Are you saying that the U.S. did not wage war against a leftist regime? Are you further suggesting that this war has had no long term effects on the Vietnamese, politically or economically? Golly, maybe they've sold their people out to neoliberalism because their country was left in tatters. Good thing they "won" though?

       I'm sure that has nothing whatsoever with their position as a buffer and proxy vs the Chinese and NK attracting military and industrial investment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, still not sure what that has to do with anything, the U.S. still waged overt warfare against a leftist regime.

       I'm sorry that all the clandestine coup d'etats perpetrated against democratically elected leaders weren't enough for your attention span, so you've chosen to focus on these two examples?

       It's just like how the homeless crisis reached a fever pitch under Reagan and Bush, and then disappeared completely when Bill Clinton got elected.

       The numbers in the title are basically garbage statistics. I searched for this title on Google and found

        this article
       </a>
       , which OP probably meant to link. That article uses statistics from the Congressional Research Service report
       <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R42738.pdf">
        <em>
         Instances of Use of United States Armed Forces Abroad, 1798-2017

       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that the report doesn't call these interventions, and the uses of armed forces are
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       varied. The U.S. fighting in World War II, with more than 400,000 U.S. deaths, counts as
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       . And the 1974 action, "United States naval forces evacuated U.S. civilians during hostilities between Turkish and Greek Cypriot forces," also counts as one.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the United States' actions during the Balkan conflicts and aftermath (1993-2004) count as
       <em>
        forty-three
       </em>
       !
      </p>
      <p>
       The number of entries each year is determined by how the writers of the report decided what to include and how to group them. This is influenced by how each president has decided to report military actions to Congress under the War Powers Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare the listings for 2007, with 2 entries, to 2016, with 9 entries, and to 2017, with 25 entries. Note that Iraq is not mentioned for 2007, even though there were 904 U.S. military fatalities in Iraq in 2007! By contrast, the 2017 list contains many routine deployments and troop rotations.
