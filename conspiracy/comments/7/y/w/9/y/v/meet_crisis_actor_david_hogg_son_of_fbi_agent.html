       Nuked hard, this is Reddit.  People are dumb, obviously using a Mainstream medium like Reddit will be very easy to manipulate/control.  We are literally giving all conspiracies to the government or whoever we believe is running shit.  So while we think we are helping by discussing.. Its giving all of our ideas right to the people we are trying to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if we say this David Hogg kid is a puppet, they already can be steps ahead of us and bring up "proof" that he isn't.

       I can't say one way or the other if this person is a crisis actor but is it not possible that some people go on holiday from one state say Florida to another say California?

      <p>
       Could the argument also be made that most people who go through a traumatic experience would struggle to sound coherent? Not to say that others who have gone through traumatic can't go to the other extreme and appear too calm.

       This is a conspiracy forum, where we are often forced to speculate on circumstantial evidence. That’s the nature of theory. If it bothers you, stick to mainstream news subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should hope that if concrete evidence of a conspiracy to defraud the American Citizenry were ever made public, that it would be covered far and wide by national news media and prosecuted in the highest courts.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, we both know that isn’t going to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The notion that 1. Conspiracies don’t happen and 2. Media and Authorities can’t be complicit is demonstrably false, so it’s safe to say, just about anything is possible here.

       Funny how you seem to be replying to stuff I didn't say but just to cover your points 
Speculating on circumstantial is fine but in this example there is none
I agree that Conspiracies do happen and Media and Authorities can be complicit.

       I can't because I normally lurk this sub. I am happy to admit that I don't believe in most Conspiracies but I like this sub because government and Media have a lot of power and a check against that can be a good thing. I'm not a religious person either but I still enjoy discussing and reading about religions.

       It's fine to speculate on various theories, however, that doesn't mean people here should be forbidden to be skeptical of those theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope too that if there is concrete evidence that can support a theory that the law and media would take it seriously. Yet that doesn't mean we should pretend we have evidence that doesn't exist or use speculation as an argumentative tool.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that anything is possible is not evidence that a particular thing is possible. Or just in other words, just because something could be true, doesn't mean it is.

       So you found 3 in less than a minute (there are obviously more there).  Imagine if you actually search for more.

       Eh its about introducing the face to the societies psyche if you will. Subsconsiouly people remember him and alot of people 'took his side' if you will right? When he comes up on the future he becomes even more memorable and likeable. It's weird entirely that this dudes dad is fbi and suddenly hes in our nations latest school shooting after also being a viral story a few months back.

       The only people who would remember him would be people in southern California who watched the human interest story that rolls during the last 2 minutes of the five of clock news on one channel, for one airing, one time. Who the hell is going to remember a kid who had a few seconds of air time at the last minute of the local news show that aired exactly once, six months ago???

       Our verdict is almost never trusting the official narrative put out by the club of pals who own ALL the media. And giving less and less credibility to the FBI. When weird inconsistencies arise, we start scrutinizing more things. Don't be conferencing. Try and just sell the best truth you can. Otherwise eat a bag of dicks.

       You think it's easier to threaten an adult than a child? This statement is so completely devoid of any sort of logic that it is truly laughable. Also, who said anything about threatening? If they are indeed crisis actors, one would assume they are doing it willingly.

       I didn't say they wouldn't think about it. What I'm saying it that if you put a 17 year old in front of huge amounts of the mainstream media, with the promise that has to say this or bad things will happen to his family, they are probably more likely to believe that whisteblowing in that moment, in front of all those cameras, is worth it. That it will work out because of the massive public impact of saying it right then and there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are adults not as likely to do this? Well firstly because the sort of person who could walk into your home and tell you this is what you are going to do would register completely differently to an adult then a 17 year old. To an adult, this person is the sort of boogeyman that you thought was just restricted to films and tom Clancy novels. He can and will kill you, and make it look like an accident, even if you say that sort of things in front of all those people, because the only way a man like that exists is because he is successful at having done stuff like this before. The same goes for his threats to your family.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, a threat to your child is in some way different to a threat to a parent. Because of how a 17 year old might view their parents, they might think that they have a chance at protecting them by talking to the media. For an adult, the position of vulnerability a child is in, means that even taking that chance would be too much to risk. A 17 year old can't be called, told "Get out of town and run, people are coming to kill you." with any expectation they'll make it far. With an adult, you might be able to manage something, at least enough to believe speaking out might work.

       The point I was making is that you can, as an adult, readily believe your 17 year old son is too vulnerable to even consider risking the chance for you to whistleblow in the hopes of also by doing so protect him.
      </p>
      <p>
       A 17 year old might not believe this. And no, I don't imagine your average 17 year old has enough life experience and understanding of the world to actually understand the amount of danger they would be in just by sharing a room with that person. I don't know quite how to phrase it, but for someone who is 30 years old, having lived through life, the understanding of what that person IS and what they signify would be completly different compared to a younger person.

        n. evidence in a trial which is not directly from an eyewitness or participant and requires some reasoning to prove a fact. There is a public perception that such evidence is weak ("all they have is circumstantial evidence"), but the probable conclusion from the circumstances may be so strong that there can be little doubt as to a vital fact ("beyond a reasonable doubt" in a criminal case, and "a preponderance of the evidence" in a civil case). Particularly in criminal cases, "eyewitness" ("I saw Frankie shoot Johnny") type evidence is often lacking and may be unreliable, so circumstantial evidence becomes essential. Prior threats to the victim, fingerprints found at the scene of the crime, ownership of the murder weapon, and the accused being seen in the neighborhood, certainly point to the suspect as being the killer, but each bit of evidence is circumstantial.

       Local news is barely "mainstream media" unless that term has expanded to mean literally anyone who films with something that can't fit in their pocket. 
The kid is a vlogger. He makes a vlog about him going to the beach. His friend gets into an argument with a lifeguard and he records it. Soon later an LA local news station does a story on the incident and interviews him as a witness. His dad worked for the FBI but is retired four years ago. 
It's not that hard to believe.

       Why do people in r/conspiracy pay attention to account date creation?

      <p>
       If you're in r/conspiracy but aren't creating a new account every X number of months then you must be just here for entertainment purposes because any conspiracy theorist worth their nuts is gonna want to reboot their identity every now and then.

       I think it's part of the shill-calling culture that's evolved here and general paranoia. It's become a way to dismiss people instead of actual discussion or making strong arguments.

      <p>
       This sub bans quite a number of people so it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that there are new accounts around. Additionally, people buy old accounts, or, as you mentioned, regularly wipe their accounts history, so really not always a good way to tell if someone is disingenuous or not.

       I don't think its proof that he is a crisis actor, I think its a piece of information that might fill in the bigger picture at a later date.

       The chances of getting on the news in this country is extremely low, like once in a lifetime event.
      </p>
      <p>
       To get on the news twice in 5 months is so rare when your a just a average person and considering he was across the country just having a normal day.  To be involved in a school mass shooting is extremely rare just by itself.  To have all of those three things happens to someone, is almost seems like it was on purpose.  I have a feeling we will be seeing more of David for years to come.

       All I'm saying is it's unlikely for one of those things to happen for the average person in their life, its even more unlikely for two of them but to have all three occur in a period of 5 months is probably freakishly rare, maybe winning the biggest lotto 5 times in a row kinda rare.

       It’s unlikely that someone would be involved in two separate TV interviews, especially in two states on opposite ends of the country. Even more unlikely that this person, a tv production student, was selected randomly. The California event was not a tragic event, and that commenter should edit their post.

       Ok so here's the thing:
      </p>
      <p>
       If you go look at his YouTube channel, he's vlogging his trip to California.  Also, was the boogie board thing really a crisis?  His buddy put a boogie board on a trash can, then got into a shitfit with the lifeguard over it.  They posted the video everywhere and the local news picked it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy hopes to be a video personality and always has.  He's running the little school TV station there on his campus.  It doesn't seem weird to me that he would consistently put himself out there on video.  It also doesn't seem weird to me that he'd make a few camera-ready preps because of this, to include preparing what he's going to say.  He's also 17, so it's not weird to me that he'd fuck those lines up, either.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just me.

       During an active schooling shooter threat, you think a 17 year old kid would be filming himself blaming congress and demanding gun control, asking other kids how they feel about gun control? Because that wouldn’t be my reaction

       Depends how threatened you feel.  While I was stationed in Iraq we were being attacked at least once per day.  During the summer period of that year we had indirect fire 168 times in 126 days.  Only twice were we even nervous, because your brain tends to hold you calm if the threat is not imminently apparent.  On the two occasions that mortars hit near our location, we were singing a different song altogether and took far more concern in our PAR sweeps.  Rest of the time the alarm red was... annoying, I dare say.  We even had a guy making jokes about how he volunteers for PAR sweeps because then he gets to have a smoke before the all-clear is sounded.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is, he never had direct contact with the shooter.  He got hustled into a hiding spot without ever getting a glimpse of the reality of the situation he was in.  Hell, according to his testimony, he ended up in the hallway because he heard the fire alarm and started just filing out of the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now compare his video to the one the kid took who actually saw the shooter.  Had Hogg actually seen the shooter, I imagine the two videos would have been far more similar.

       Good point, proximity definitely a factor, although its a little stretch comparison of active deployment soldiers and unarmed school kids.

       For many of the people I was out there with, the age and experience levels were not all that much different.  Regardless, my point is that for most people it's easy to dismiss a threat that's not right in front of your face.  This is why environmentalism is such a debate, or how nobody's freaking out that we're all just hurtling through infinite space on a high speed rock with zero control, and there are literally billions of things out there that could snuff us all out just by floating nearby.  Your amygdala is a fascinating little hunk of meat.

       Are you trying to start a personal argument instead of joining the debate? I agreed with the poster, but a bunch of high school kids is not the same as active duty soldiers, who experienced combat nearly every day.

       It's also weird how so many top comments here seem to just know he was vlogging his trip to California like it was a common fact. Why would anyone even know that? Almost like it was a planned response.

       That wouldn't be your reaction, but go to a high school and ask every single kid their thoughts about school shootings and gun control.  That would definitely be at least one of their reactions.

       Also if there's an active shooter I'm not trying to talk and make noice hinting at where I may be hiding.   I would make the video after.

       I used to lurk over 8 years ago and the posts were about aliens, Iran contra, the government doing weird shit, and 9/11.  The comments were more "you're wrong and this research says why" or watch this and tell me if you agree...  So on and so on.  Now its "you're wrong, you shill" "how can you believe that conspiracy" and then when you provide your evidence its all shitting on your source with no facts or othef information backing up why the source is bad

       I think any reaction could be normal because not every brain works through trauma in the short term in the same way. The last time someone close to me died, it took 4 days before I started feeling anything in a really major way, and it was when I was asked what I wanted at a drive through. Brains are tricky, and in crisis, they'll do anything they can to maintain focus rather than lose control. It's an evolutionary defense mechanism. Some people are able to zoom in on something to focus on so they can compartmentalize the freakout until they're in a situation where they're less likely to die. Some people freak out right away, some people take videos because in that moment which may be their last, they feel it's the only thing they can control.

       No, but are you saying that it's impossible for that to be a potential reaction? Because if you agreed with the top explanation, I don't see how you can argue with the bottom. People react differently to different stimuli because every brain works differently.

       Intuition is not key to human thought, otherwise you have to explain why people who intuit the same events differently.

       Intuition is an important aspect but it isn't key; in fact I'd say our ability ignore intuition is more important. Ignoring something that feels intuitive is what allows us to use the scientific method.

       Read Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and Thinking Fast and Slow if you want a decent answer to your debate here.
      </p>
      <p>
       What chess players do at a GM level is not intution per se, but the internalisation of non intutive knowledge to the point it becomes like intuition. Same as chinese number counters who can do multiplications faster then anyone else, but then can't tell you the actual process or the middle numbers of their calculations. That is not intuition in the same sense as "I just heard a twig snap. That means someone is nearby" or "I intuit that I can jump the distance between these two gaps" or "I intuitively feel that opera is more complex then rap".
      </p>
      <p>
       Intuition is a cornerstone to human thought, yes, but it is also the most easily tricked part of human thought. Intuition is tied up very often with emotional and psychological predisposition and while scientific theory is not completely unbiased, it actively works to avoid corruption by such variables.

       It's still intuition and pattern recognition.

       I'm not saying it's correct 100% of the time, I was just saying that it's critical to human thought and we shouldn't throw out intuition. It was a response to the commenter saying intuition is less important than scientific process; he's got it backwards. There can be no scientific method without levels of intuition.

       There is no normal reaction to such a situation. Some people will panic and start screaming; some people will be very calm and help others; some people will freeze; some people will become very analytical; some people will cry; some people will get angry; some people may even laugh at the insanity of what's happening.

       I think you should read a couple books on psychology.  That statement is very ignorant to how the human brain works.  We aren’t all made in a factory and human behavior isn’t anywhere near as objective/black and white as you are making it sound.

       The problem is that he didn't have all the facts.  What if it turned out that the gun used was stolen from the FBI (as many guns are)?  What if the gun was purchased with a fake ID or otherwise illegally purchased?   His entire narrative turned on the fact that the gun was legally acquired -- a fact that he did not know at that time and would make him look pretty stupid if it turned out that the gun used was stolen from his dad (who is an FBI agent) or otherwise acquired illegally.

       Not sure, I mean I’m willing to ignore the “CNN coaching video” because the kid could just be nervous and having trouble speaking. But this? It seems too bizarre. If I went to this school, I would have known the shooter (cruz, who Hogg identifies in the video) and Id be more freaked out about how I and others knew he would do something like this (as the police reports, FBI reports, and School punishments suggest) rather than make some speech against congress?

       Seems to me like you're applying post-shooting logic to the past in order to advance the anti-FBI line.
      </p>
      <p>
       You imply it's strange that the kid seems to know what to say and is being 'coached' on it by CNN, yet you also seem to think that this shooting was done by a regular kid looking to shoot up the school (read: authentic shooting, not a 'false flag' attack) that could have been prevented.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this shooting was done by a mentally disturbed kid, it was on a random day that nobody besides him could have expected. Do you honestly think that the kid was coached by the dems/MSM on what to say, before the shooting happened? Because them a) finding a kid willing to say what they are told to say b) 'coaching him' is not something that could have happened in the period of time between after the shooting started and those videos being taken place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'it could have been prevented by the FBI' and 'the dems taught them what to say' ideas are mutually exclusive unless you do some serious mental gymnastics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you're misreading them knowing it was Cruz. It's not that they said they knew he would do that. They said that when it happened, they knew it was him because he was the obvious suspect. A lot of high schools have that trouble kid who everybody jokes about being a school shooter. Just because he was the likely suspect doesn't mean they knew he was going to do it.

       So far everything points to him being a normal kid.  But what’s strange if they knew Cruz was reported to the fbi.  I would guess Hogg’s father would be on top of that shit faster than a fly.

       Yes, it's a simple explanation to come to if you're not actively trying to discredit the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI gets so many of these reports. I'm sure you had a kid in your high school that everybody thought might snap and shoot up the school on a random day. Lets say you're the and you FBI get a tip that a kid said he was going to shoot up the school. Unless you're going to take that tip as evidence and lock him up (which you can't in a fair society), you have very little actions you can take to interfere with his life. You can actively watch him, but that's about it. You also need to remember that most shooters that are serious (and most criminals, terrorists, etc) aren't going to publicly tell people about their plan. You also need to respond to the hundreds of other reports of somebody threatened to shoot something up, while remembering that the majority of such reports are nothing. So in reality, there's a limit to the number of resources you can put to one individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either that or you can assume that
      </p>
      <p>
       a) ALL the FBI is looking at Trump and so they are distracted (which people who don't know how the FBI works are saying)
      </p>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <p>
       b) the FBI knew that the kid wasn't a threat but didn't do anything hoping that the kid would shoot up the school so Hogg can go on camera and ask for gun control after being coached by the dems, which is idiotic because it literally rests on a roll of the dice and this narrative was made after the shooting by connecting dots that were not connected before. And if that's what you think, see my previous post:

       <p>
        Seems to me like you're applying post-shooting logic to the past in order to advance the anti-FBI line.

       In one video they showed Cruz leaving a comment on YouTube saying he’s going to be a professional school shooter.  That was reported to the fbi and fbi concluded they can’t find him the poster of the comments.
       <br/>
       They can’t find someone that’s attending the same high school of a kid what his father is former FBI.  Idk... just wacky

       This literally had nothing to do with the investigation. The dad is former FBI, and for all we know he might have worked on white collar crimes or drug stuff. Again, just because there are dots that you can connect doesn't mean they are connected.

       Lmao he's not an actor/journalist. He is a kid that went to high school. There is literally no evidence of him being an actor/journalist aside from him being in a local news story in CA about a viral video, which is not actual evidence.

       He also did that just as eloquently literally

        during
       </a>
       the shooting while the school was in lockdown.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the right wing conspiracy theory to be right, they must have know that the shooting would happen and prepped him ahead of time, OR they prepped him during the shooting. Both of which are preposterous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, all these theories only make sense if you're coming in from a perspective that is trying to discredit the FBI. It's why nobody has ever blamed the FBI like this following the many mass shootings that have happened the last few years; nobody has had a political reason to blame the FBI.

       It takes no serious mental gymnastics to connect the FBI, the Sheriff, and CNN to the Clinton Mafia.

       Ask some questions.

      <p>
       Why the scripting? By Hogg, by CNN?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why the deceptions from the Sheriff as to what the situation on the ground was (and we find out later 3 deputies were there and did nothing)?

      <p>
       Why the immediate full-court political press?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why still no answers from the FBI? Why more interest in getting resignations from them than answers? Why the immediate scapegoating of specific officials?

       Why the continued full-court political press in the face of overwhelming evidence of repeated system failure?

       I said it stinks like a dead fish and everyone involved appears to be slime which begs the question of motives. AKA foul play - something that should not be a mind-blowing concept.

       There was just a school shooting in Kentucky not too long ago that had people talking about it.  Las Vegas wasn't that long ago.  Orlando only a year before that.  Sandy Hook came up quite a bit in the 2016 elections because of Alex Jones' association with Trump.
      </p>

       When you're in a school shooting and political minded and on the left your first thought is going to be to blame congress and the NRA.  Because those are the people they hold responsible.

       Except they are not responsible. Calling the NRA and 2nd Amendment supporters child murderers is emotional manipulation of the highest order and it's fucking disgusting.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so obviously not true. The big problem pis that the left is doing what they always do, launch a series of emotional appeals bc their arguments don't have a fucking leg to stand on. Call their opponents names, absolutely ridiculous ones in this case, and refuse to get into a logical discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no desire to compromise on the left, it's either David Hogg's way or you're a child murderer.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this is going to do is cause gun owners to dig in their heels. Most of them are going to be pissed off and this emotional manipulation isn't going to work on them anymore. Very similar to what happened in the election.

       Agree...I’m not a gun owner or nra member, and typically I’m one of the few “undecideds” each election and it’s become sickeningly disgusting and obvious to me what’s happening here. A kid who cares more about fame and attention than anything else and willing to sell himself to cnn, alienate tens of millions of people,  throw out many immoral and patently disgusting comments about innocent people (Rubio and Loesch) and trash our god given right to self protection all to gain what he craves. I hope and believe more that share my political moderation see how obvious and embarrassingly awful this is and once again coalesce into the silent majority that ends up showing him how hollow making arrogant and hollow choices are when this whole movement is crushed overwhelmingly when they move to take away a civil right we’re given by god and the constitution. And perhaps then he’ll learn the history and philosophy he’s extremely ignorant in and finally get the education his school has deprived him of that put him on the wrong side of history.

       You guys are all playing this little twat’s game.
       <em>
        Plenty of people
       </em>
       use a tragedy for personal gain, and that is what this kid is doing.  You really think a 17 year old can’t seduce what message will get him national media attention!?
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably a narcissist or sociopath, doesn’t give two shits about people being killed as long as he can use it for his own gain.  Watch the movie “Nightcrawler” for a portrayal of the same thing.  Not everyone is “moved” by people getting killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop giving this guy attention.

       It wasn’t an ad hominem. It was a perfectly reasonable response to your dumbass argument of “durh it’s not what I would do and everyone knows what I would do is the only possible thing that could be done so that kid is an idiot!”
      </p>

       The world doesn’t revolve around you. Just cause you would do something doesn’t mean it’s the right thing to do at that moment.

       To me it doesn't provide any proof either way. I mean he recorded it himself; it's not like he was caught lying.

       If this was some big crisis actor false flag thing, wouldn't they at least remove the video?

       I think the issue is that he has no issues lying and manipulating people - so why should we believe his very suspicious video - outtakes and all - if truly genuine?  You have to admit it's odd.

       The point is he's lying about that so why couldn't he be lying about being at two locations and surviving both shooting events for publicity? It's not the first time that this has happened nor is it unusual for the press to not background check those they put on television if it suits their narrative.

       I'd assume everyone interested in this theory has already heard the commonly pushed MSM narrative for Kevin Hogg. Why go and share the idea as if it's your unique perspective on the matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does this comment have 100+ upvotes? It adds nothing new to the discussion. All you've said is that you basically don't think this theory is correct but you haven't provided any depth behind that thought, you're just being completely dismissive of the idea before we even start talking about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you not entertain the idea that maybe government agencies like the FBI could be involved in some way with the recent school shooting? You're right, Kevin Hogg could be a totally normal kid, but that's not the idea we're discussing here.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Kevin Hogg is honestly involved with the FBI, wouldn't you want to know that?

       If he were at two different school shootings, I'd be listening.  However, we're not talking about that.  We're talking about him being at a school shooting, and this one time his friend had a spat with a teenager-hating lifeguard and they recorded it.

       That would be your biggest misconception. You seem to think the truth just falls into your lap. In order to find out more, we have to actually discuss and investigate the possibility in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, when you come in here and basically shut down the conversation before it begins, it seems kind of counter-productive.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact still stands, David Hogg is a former FBI agent whose son is now involved as basically the face of public relations with a bi-partisan message for a controversial school shooting and that is worth investigating more to me.

       That's all the reasoning I have for what? The desire to have a conversation about the possibility of a theory? Yes, you got me, all I have is an idea shared by OP and a dream to discuss.

       Why do I need evidence to discuss an idea? If anything, the violent out-lash of negative comments against this theory is evidence enough that the idea is worth discussing. This negative reaction has only given the idea more traction. All that you and comments like yours have done is motivated the usual people in this sub to explore this idea more.

       Open discussion is cherished here, so please do keep on your crusade to belittle everyone's ideas, it only makes them grow stronger.

       I am fine with open discussion. What I am doing is being sceptical of claims being made, which is an essential part of an open discussion, when we are talking about the death of 17 people being a false flag attack, wherein the children we now see on tv are being called liars and sociopaths.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that the more criticism an idea gets, the MORE it should be valued is counter to literally every school of investigative discussion. While you don't NEED evidence to discuss an idea, if you want anyone to consider it plausible, you need supporting evidence, of which we right now do not have, beyond a 17 year old boy having a father who works in federal law enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       I promise you the ides that the florida shooting is a false flag attack is getting weaker, not stronger, since most reasonable people are not seeing many convincing IDEAS, that prove it to be so.

       Outright dismissal of the subject is not skepticism. Nobody said anything about the “value” of an idea but you. The value of an idea is completely subjective, you can’t quantify the value of an idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said the negative backlash is only going to make people in this sub more interested in exploring the idea. You put words in my mouth and twist others, you stifle discussion, and lie by omission. I think we’re finished here. Don’t quit your day job.

       I agree with all your points, except his interview about the shooting is clearly him recalling lines that are scripted.  I've been in TV and Movies a long time, i see people reheasing, ad libbing, etc take after take all day long.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying it couldn't be that this kid prewrote his statement to get his thoughts together, maybe he even trying to be a reporter oneday, and wanted to show he could maintain composure.  It's just definititely a script he's recalling.

       Here's the thing:

      <p>
       You cannot be at two shootings that's just impossible because no one makes plans to be at a second high school for vacation that just doesn't happen.

       It's not unusual for the government to use crisis actors it happened in Charlottesville when they bused in both the KKK and BLM actors on the same bus and then drove away as quickly as possible hoping no one would notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, it's not unusual for the media outlets to never background check their personalities before bringing them on tv.

       Any truth to the story that he claims "I remember Columbine" , a horrific event that happened a year before he was born? Hell, I wonder if he remembers the Alamo too.

       An Insufferable attention seeker whose points are diminished by f-bombs. I think he should hook up with the "Cash me Ousside" charmer. Perfect match IMO.

       Listen, I was IN an actual school when a shooting went down outside (gang related). As soon as the gun shots went off ALL the class clowns and silly kids went deadly silent. Fear shot across everyone. Kids are not going to be trying to post shit to youtube or doing interviews. That is just asinine.

       Shooting outside, that was over, not a 'barricaded in doors while someone is going around executed people' situation where people have time to react out of adrenaline or shock.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all the Nancy Gracy school of evaluation and it drives me up a wall.  People do not react in a uniform way.  But how many fucking times does a jury hear a copy say "The husband just didn't seem to be sad his wife died" when an innocent man is sent away for murder because lazy LE just tries to pin it on the spouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basing your speculation that something is fake because someone is behaving oddly during a fucking school shooting is simply misguided.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go on youtube - go on youtube right now - and look at all the fucking videos people post when they shouldn't be recording.

       Yes, outside. I can't image how much stronger the fear would be if we knew the shooter was within the school.

       Also, I'm NOT disagreeing that people act in different manners during shock. The issue I have with these events is they follow patterns that are ABNORMAL, even for shock.

       The only thing that is of note is that his dad is in the FBI. That is something to at least start with, but I haven't seen anyone substantiate this claim. You can't just stop here and say, "okay it was a MiHoP or LiHoP" but this isn't a ridiculous position devoid of merit either. What's next?

       He says it in one of the early on interviews where he was praising the FBI (of course he defends them - he respects his dad). He was also on CNN sitting right next to his dad, the FBI agent in a whole segment yesterday about these claims that he was a crisis actor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some links to the later interviews but I'm not going to go dig up the other one. This ought to be good enough:

       Ok listen, and listen very carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think that they chose Hogg because he probably speaks much more eloquently than his peers...but I also know for a fact his father is FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, moving on, Hogg never saw the alleged shooter actually shoot anyone. It could have been anyone and the alleged shooter was just the scapegoat. No one actually saw the alleged shooter shoot anyone. We can only go by what the news has told us. That is the problem...no one saw the alleged shooter actually shoot...a gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, not everyone HAS to know about a False Flag...the only people that need to know are the key players and then getting everyone else to buy into it. It's actually a very easy thing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kids died on this day - for an agenda I am sure - but kids definitely died. Just because it is a FF it doesn't mean it's not real and people don't die(9/11).
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't say for certain if the alleged shooter actually did shoot the gun and neither can ANY of us. What I can say is that his face is very reminiscent of the other mass shooters in that it looks like he has no FUCKING clue what happened, and no I am not blaming the drugs, I am blaming the fact that they all look like they had been brainwashed severely and made to believe they actually did some shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it like this, you're drugged, a stranger puts blood on your hands, kills someone, leaves you next to the body and calls the cops and bolts. When the cops get there - you have no alibi at all and you're fucked. THAT is how easy it is for them to do something such as this. You think TPTB are going to botch something so simple? No, and that's why people believe official narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe what you want, but before you do, consider everything you possibly can before coming to your conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay vigilant.

       Lets actually think about how many people would need to be in on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, lets agree that 17 children have actually died. Furthermore,  lets says those children were killed at least sometime BEFORE the shooting occurred, so that they could be brought on site and dumped there in such a way as to incriminate the kid
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, lets agree (for the sake of argument) that the powers that be have some way of brainwashing this kid so that he has no alibi, no defence, etc etc. Possibly the use of heavy barbiturates or opiates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on these two factors alone, how many people would need to be "in on it?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Well lets get the basic ones out of the way. The people who killed the kids, moved the bodies and drugged the shooter. If they do exist, they are some very special people who can be relied upon to be silent, so no worry there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the slightly more difficult ones. A coroner would have to sign off on the death certificates of these children. They would (if they got the bodies within a day or so) notice a number of things worth mentioning. Like the time of death not matching the bodies stay of decay, and the presence of congealed blood pooling  on their backs, showing the bodies were stored after death in a static environment. While this happens naturally, Im pretty sure from my armchair reading that you would see noticeable differences. So coroner would have to be in on it. Emts for the same reason. There is a significant difference in how a body appears two hours after dying, and six to tweleve hours after dying, which the EMTs would have alot of experience in recognising,
      </p>
      <p>
       On the police front you have a much more difficult situation. Crime scene investigators, forensic analysts, the list goes on. Remember, the "special people" we mentioned first would either have to set up the bodies during the day of the shooting (so witnesses) or do it somehow earlier and hide the bodies on site for someone else to reveal. Both of which would cause many MANY tell tale signs that the body did not just die when it fell. Blood spatter analysis especially, since they thickening and dying of red blood cells means that even if they kept the blood of these children with them to arrange the crime scene, it would not be impossible for someone to notice something very off about the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far our conspiracy numbers at its smallest maybe 10 people. A 5 man team of killers and movers, a coroner, and four people in positions of significant power in the medical and police departments to hush others.  However, considering trying to hush people about a faked school shooting is probably not exactly easy, I would argue that many more people would need to be in on it. In reality, to pull this off, I think you'd need to have the silence of atleast 15-30 people. Those numbers are off the scale for keeping a conspiracy of this magnitude under lock and key, atleast in my opinion.

       This has all spawned from Stormfront, all geared to angering pro-gun and NRA supporters and making them feel there is some larger conspiracy against them and the 2nd Amendment, thus angering them further, thus further distracting from the bipartisan cultural issue of mass shootings in the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep feeding this backward narrative, it just increases the chances of someone you love being one of the next victims. Bravo.

       Not necessarily hate, but I believe his rhetoric and decisions have caused the rest of the world (those that are generally immune to the conspiracies posted here) to look at the US administration with the same distain that we reserve for dictators in second world countries.

       Good. It's time for other countries to be critical of the US government and our policies. We're not necessarily that shining light of hope that we once was. The people of the US need to be leery of what our government is doing and where we are heading.

       Let me get this right: you think a bad leader is necessary so that we will lose the respect of other nations (which is the government's only real reason for putting on a charade of caring for the citizens)?  With the alternative of having a leader that inspires protection for the citizens and wellbeing for all other countries, this (the opposite) is your hope?!  (Also... I'm not sure if this is your defense of Trump or you have just given up on the US... a bit unclear here.)

       Sorry dude... but as soon as you stop trying to impress your peers, there is nothing holding you back from showing your true colors.  This is not something we need.

       I'm not a fan of Trump BUT if Hillary was in office right now all the corruption that's being exposed right now would not have happened. This country needs a reckoning and it's happening right now regardless of what our peers think of us. If we do not fix our justice department and arrest people who believe they are above the law, then we will become as corrupt of these other countries that you consider to be below us.

       We already ARE as corrupt as some of those countries.  The only thing stopping us from sinking to the same actions that many of them institute is the illusion that we are civilized.  Lose that illusion and the reality comes to light.
      </p>

       We talk a lot about corruption and elitism, but it's always been there... lurking just under the surface.  Sometimes it is more prevalent, sometimes it is more buried, but if it ever surfaces we suffer.  We may call for truth, but the truth is that some things you want to bury so far down that it can't be trudged back up.

       Look at history and tell me that the "bugs" are new.  There is no reason to shake them out unless you want to see the worst of humanity only to go back to the way it was.  We don't need to identify it, but we do need to replace it with something better.

       Many reasons actually.

      <ol>
       <li>
        people don't usually questions/attack kids

       <li>
        people have more sympathy with kids
       </li>
       <li>
        being awkward is a kid thing so bad acting isn't a big deal
       </li>
       <li>
        being an FBI agent's son means he is able to be controlled more easily (does this even need to be said?)

       only your fourth reason gives us anything for why it would be the son of an FBI agent.
      </p>

       Would that alone be worth the red flag that would come up from so many groups (such as this one) when they find that the father is a former fbi agent?

       Your first three answers focus on the fact he's a kid, which wasn't really in question. It's a school shooting. You think they're gonna get Judd Nelson in there acting 17?
      </p>
      <p>
       AND, there's ~35k current FBI employees according to a quick search. Tack on former agents and you get to a point where yes, at some point someone involved in a national event will be related to an FBI employee.

       Yes, I'm sure this "false flag" will inspire the Republican-controlled congress and NRA-sponsored president to act!
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, it's amusing that people think anything will happen, or that this was a "false flag." In general, a "false flag" actually has something to gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if Sandy Hook WAS a "false flag" then you'd figure that the orchestrators would figure this: if no gun control legislation happens under a liberal president who loathes the NRA, it's probably not gonna happen under a president with record donations from the NRA.

       from what I've seen, the people calling for gun control now are the same people who called for gun control in prior years, while those against more gun control remain unmoved.
      </p>
      <p>
       it just seems like both sides are louder, though I don't see an increase or anything. rest assured -- Red states are still STAUNCHLY opposed to anything modifying gun rights.

       I mean, Trump doesn't really care about what the people want. 70% of Americans are in favor of marijuana legalization, yet Jeff Sessions remains the AG and is escalating the War on Drugs. fwiw, 90% of the country disagrees with the War on Drugs -

      <p>
       perhaps if the amount of people for gun restrictions was over 90%, then yeah - he may feel pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
       in reality, the only people clamoring for more gun control are those in blue states, which Trump could care less about.

       So where does he live, Florida or California?  I don't think that it matters if he's upset if he is a paid actor like those in the Sandy Hook affair.

       Can we not explore that possibility or should we just feel ashamed about this and call this an outright impossibility?

       That's a tactic that was used hard in an effort to get people to back off from investigating 9/11...They would actually say that believing the WTC's came down because of Controlled Demolition was a sign of mental illness or it was "disrespectful" to the 9/11 families or it was "unpatriotic" or as Tucker Carlson once said to David Ray Griffin...

       This kid was literally the survivor of a mass shooting. Even this sub was never that low to run some kid who was on the news while on vacation, but also a school shooting survivor through the mud. There is so little here, here. His dad retired years ago. This is weak and deserves no attention. The people who want to give this attention should find a safe space for it on subs such as The Donald where outside opinions get insta-banned.

       I remember the days when people would write off the shooter as an MK-Ultra victim.  That way you at least have a real event with real victims.  But I guess conspiracy theorists decided they needed more moving parts and more loose ends and more people sworn to perpetual silence despite having no motive to do so.

       It follows correct the record shilling. If the kid is practicing lines for a travesty he witnessed then he is either soulless or it didn't happen. Enter his dad being an FBI agent is another reason to question the motive. The FBI already missed their chance to protect the school where an FBI kid is enrolled? Come on.

       Attacking the students and claiming false flag is not going to work on this one as well as the crisis actor BS being spread. I live very close to Parkland and this was as real of an event as you could see and the students coming forward are genuine in their pain and their desire for some change in how easily guns are obtained by the wrong people.

       And nobody said it was fake.  Many actors talk about politics.  Pointing out that they are actors or being told what to say does not mean that the underlying event was fictional.  Perhaps try understanding why so many people are commenting on the subject.  Many of the students coming forward are genuine in their pain.  We are discussing one student who appears to be less than genuine or appears to be coached.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally I discount the students various proposals of keeping guns from being obtained by the wrong people because they are simplistic solutions that are not thought out.  Criminal routinely steal guns from the FBI.  If we can't keep criminals from stealing guns from the FBI, then how is any gun legislation going to work?  The only thing it will result in is more guns being stolen from the FBI.

       When you make it a 20 year minimum penalty, you won't see many taking that risk.  Would you?  Certainly the FLA punk, or Dylan Roof would not have the ability to buy a $20,000 illegal weapon.

       About 600,000 guns are stolen each years.   Please tell me your plan to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.  You want it more expensive to buy a gun?  You want a longer wait?  Then it will be 700,000 guns stolen each year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Numerous weapons are stolen from the FBI itself.  Even more from local police forces.  And you solution is to make it a 20 year sentence to steal guns from the FBI.  It is already a 30 year sentence.  So, you want to reduce the punishment for stealing guns?  I don't understand your "logic" in the least.  Generally, decreasing the penalty for a crime means that more people are likely to commit it.

       Forget the crisis actor or whatever for a second. Does anyone else out there agree there is something off about David Hogg's eyes and facial expressions? He looks like a psychopath.

       I completely agree man. That's the feeling I got yesterday when I was watching him. Conspiracy theory aside, I do think that a lot of people instinctively pick up that something is "off" about this guy. We feel that he is mimicking what a "normal emotion" is like. There's a YouTuber that does body languages called Bombards or Bombard. She is really biased so you gotta take what she says with a grain of salt but in her video, she said that there is something off about the guy cuz his expressions and behaviors aren't that of people his age. And during an interview, it seemed like the dad was less assured than his son. 
I did a google search and came to this page. I don't think he's an actor and we shouldn't attack people for surviving a mass shooting. That being said, I do think this guy is a psychopath.

       Retired in 2014. Also still not really a good argument either. People thinking for themselves and disagreeing with a severely flawed theory aren't "shills." How exactly does his dad having worked for the FBI prove that he is a crisis actor.

       There are 35,000 FBI agents in the US, so if any of there family is in a mass shooting the shooting is fake?  Or if the kid happens to be visiting L.A. and is interviewed over a minor altercation, that is proof that he is a crisis actor?

       It's about questioning in general, not questioning just whenever we feel like it. Nothing wrong with questioning fringe narratives either. A narrative doesn't have to be "official" in order to qualify as being questionable. It's important to stay open minded, but maintain a healthy level of skepticism at the same time. Relying on blind faith and jumping too fast to conclusions is not how you breakdown a conspiracy.

       Can we talk for a minute about how outrageous the concept of a "crisis actor industry" is? How in the world would you even manage to have such a thing without it getting busted wide open IMMEDIATELY?
      </p>
      <p>
       To be successful, you'd need: 
* A large pool of actors that are coached months beforehand to play their unfamiliar roles to perfection
* Actors who somehow have no family or friends that will see them on TV and go WAIT, WHAT? 
* The ability to erase an entire school / town's collective memories so they don't see these strangers on tv and go WAIT, WHAT? 
* The ability to have them fade back into relative obscurity so they can somehow be used again
      </p>
      <p>
       It's absolutely ABSURD.

       I thought there was something shady about this kid when I first saw him. Just gave me a weird vibe. So I spent a good bit of time combing through his reddit account today (not hard to find) and I don’t think he’s a crisis actor. He seems like a lonely kid with big aspirations (either journalism or FBI like his dad) looking for a way to make a difference. He moved from California to Florida in high school and hasn’t found many friends there and spends summers back home (where the lifeguard video was filmed). He wasn’t very vocal about Trump or Hillary or any of the previous shootings. Most of his posts and comments are in small subs and askreddit. I think he recognizes that he may have a chance to make a difference right now and probably cares more now that it hit close to home and maybe has his journalistic future in mind with the way he is conducting himself. I honestly feel bad for him after reading his comment history. He seems like a fragile teenager trying to find his way and I hope he doesn’t get too jaded by the scrutiny he’s under.

       If you believe he is a paid actor, answer a couple of questions for me (and try not to sidetrack in to a tangent, stay on point please):
      </p>
      <p>
       Have any of the students there claimed to not know him ? Like if was a paid actor sent in to give interviews, would it be strange that none of the students are coming out saying "wait, we don't know him, he doesn't go to this school" ?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were going to pay some actor to be in a high-profile scenario, would you re-use one that is already easily findable on youtube ? Was that other incident a "crisis" that anyone would actually pay for ?

Start of School Year in Broward Co: 8/21/2017.  #2) Why is there a 6 month gap in Videos from 8/16/2017 thru 1/8/2018. #3) His Vlog frequency was almost 2 vids per month prior to 8/16/2017 , why the change in frequency? #4) Where and who did he learn Gun Policy from to be calm enough to go on national TYV with ease, interview a student during the shooting ect? #5) Residency record from Cali and Florida from 1/1/2017 thru 2/20/2018 show how many moves?  #6) Why did YouTube take down video claiming he is a crisis actor, if he certainly is not then let the records prove he is a real student there…why censor, the truth always stands. To just take the video down makes it seem like youtuibe/google is hiding  ... Perhaps all coincidences and perhaps nothing, but Y can't we ASK!!!

       Even if he's not a crisis actor, he's a smug fucking douchebag. Typical leftie who only cares about pushing his agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yea calling everyone who disagree with him a child murderer, that's a great way to get what you want and doesn't at all make you look like a histrionic elitist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why doesn't he just call everyone who wants to respect the second amendment and have a real discussion about what could be done deplorables?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is exactly what the left did during the election. Fuck David Hogg, fuck the cable news networks for using teenagers to savagely beat their opponents on an emotional level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course they don't have a choice bc their arguments could never stand on their own. They're not logical, nor are they practical, nor would any of the measures that this dickhead is screeching about have stopped the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy here is that the mainstream media is using these children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look this shooting clearly happened, don't focus on this rubbish. Focus on how the leftist media is coaching this arrogant, ignorant asshole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Focus on the fact that the left is standing on the graves of dead children just like they did at Sandy Hook. It's despicable.

       Here's what I just don't understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your a retired F.B.I. agent. A guy trained by the government to handle special tasks, case sensitive shit.  The one thing you teach your kids, is how to be a smart minded individual, never to try to cause a lot of public fuss so you can maintain your posture and operate accordingly. That's what they teach police, that's what they teach S.W.A.T. That's what they teach detectives. That's what they teach D.E.A.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a universal tool that they teach operators on day one in the class room. Shut your mouth, Listen, and operate as needed to complete any task at hand so that you do not risk your position in the politics, the strategy, and most importantly, your life.
      </p>
      <p>
       This kid, son of an agent with the F.B.I., walks up to the news podiums with a HUGE mouth and tells the whole world that he exists and that he wants more restrictions on the guns. . . . .
      </p>
      <p>
       SO DON'T YA THUNK, this FBI agent who is well trained, would have had a talk with his son in a concerned voice????
      </p>
      <p>
       "Hey dude, maybe you shouldn't be waving flags around with your last name on it, opening your mouth about your ideals to the whole United States, bringing me - THE FORMER F.B.I. AGENT, into the mix of this. . ." PLUS, you know DAMN WELL that agent is trained in self defense. It's absolutely baffling that his son doesn't admire self defense, tactics, how to read people, how to stay calm, how to act in a tense situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, he's on his phone complaining that life went haywire and he wasn't ready for a bad day on planet earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess what kid, your Dad's probably either ashamed, or in on whatever the fuck it is your trying to say and he's going to teach you how to man the fuck up in a hostile situation, grab your sack, and man the fuck up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not claiming anything, I wasn't their, I have no facts or evidence. It's history. I can't back up what I'm saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you can ask any military/federal family. . . , what David's doing is not common sense, AT ALL.

       from what I've seen, the people calling for gun control now are the same people who called for gun control in prior years, while those against more gun control remain unmoved.

       I mean, Trump doesn't really care about what the people want. 70% of Americans are in favor of marijuana legalization, yet Jeff Sessions remains the AG and is escalating the War on Drugs. fwiw, 90% of the country disagrees with the War on Drugs -

       perhaps if the amount of people for gun restrictions was over 90%, then yeah - he may feel pressure.

      <p>
       in reality, the only people clamoring for more gun control are those in blue states, which Trump could care less about.

This country needs a reckoning and it's happening right now regardless of what our peers think of us. If we do not fix our justice department and arrest people who believe they are above the law, then we will become as corrupt of these other countries that you consider to be below us.

       Understanding is fine, but he's not in close proximity of the shooter. Obviously your reaction and priorities would change.

       In one video they showed Cruz leaving a comment on YouTube saying he’s going to be a professional school shooter.  That was reported to the fbi and fbi concluded they can’t find him the poster of the comments.
       <br/>
       They can’t find someone that’s attending the same high school of a kid what his father is former FBI.  Idk... just wacky

       Im not pointing to conspiracy. I’m saying this oddly strange.

       I completely agree man. That's the feeling I got yesterday when I was watching him. Conspiracy theory aside, I do think that a lot of people instinctively pick up that something is "off" about this guy. We feel that he is mimicking what a "normal emotion" is like. There's a YouTuber that does body languages called Bombards or Bombard. She is really biased so you gotta take what she says with a grain of salt but in her video, she said that there is something off about the guy cuz his expressions and behaviors aren't that of people his age. And during an interview, it seemed like the dad was less assured than his son. 
I did a google search and came to this page. I don't think he's an actor and we shouldn't attack people for surviving a mass shooting. That being said, I do think this guy is a psychopath.
