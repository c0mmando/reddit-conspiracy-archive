    <div class="md"><p>Why aren&#39;t people outraged by publicly owned companies in the EU?!?! Many EU countries tout themselves as being less corrupt than the USA specifically because of this lobbying deal yet their governments give preferential treatment to companies owned partially or wholly by the state!!??!?! And they have even worse stifling regulations there that makes competing with state owned companies even harder than it is to compete with corporations in the USA!!!!!!!!!! Europe is literally the capital of monopolistic capitalism, and like Ayn Rand said, <strong>&quot;No monopoly exists without government coercion.&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>Furthermore, trying to prevent people from bribing the leadership is about as futile as trying to prevent people from ingesting narcotics. It will literally never fucking happen! It&#39;s human motherfucking nature! People with more resources can <strong>always</strong> assert themselves more effectively and to negate this advantage would take totalitarianism! In democracy, the lowest common denominator of intelligence and decisions making wins, and companies spend billions brainwashing the masses! Are we going to make media, including social media, promotion illegal??!? How futile will that statist violence be? Less futile or more futile than the statist violence against evolved monkeys trying to change their consciousness with plants or chemicals?!? </p>

<p>Basically the fight needs to be against authoritarianism, and our efforts focused towards peeling back the layers of statist control! The government, or all collectivist institutions, are the instrument which corporations use to assert their control and monopolistic advantage. As long as government, or collectivist authority, exists; there will be groups that use it for their own self interest. The argument in support of anarchism and libertarianism is an objective one that has no real counter. </p>

<p>No actual libertarians want to wake up tomorrow and declare anarchy! The results could be dangerous. But rather we need to practically start reducing the government layer by layer in order to find out which level of minarchism we are capable of! This is objectively true and would benefit our planet. <strong>Would you rather threaten children with punishment in order to get them to behave or have them grow up and mature to the point where they behave well without the threat of punishment?!??!&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>Our communities can never mature to the point that they don&#39;t require violent threats in order to function if we keep using the government to solve society&#39;s problems!!!!! The government is like a crutch that prevents individuals, communities, and society at large, from becoming self sufficient! Is it a coincidence that any threat to the need of government is brutally demonized by the media?!? I was watching some British political debate where they were demonizing a cancer charity because they helped cancer patients get treatment, solely because they were so scared it threatens the demand placed on the NHS! </p>

Why don&#39;t liberals ever talk about collectivizing online and pooling their resources together using crowd funding platforms to help homeless people or anything like that?

<p>Hasn&#39;t been tried yet while socialism has proven to result in unimaginable tyranny. Instead of wasting your time trying to convince patriots to give away their freedoms that energy would be better served trying to organize and pool your resources together with other people who believe in altruism.. the advantage is that you don&#39;t have wait OR give any more power to an already corrupt government. Don&#39;t you love how Bernie Sanders complains about how corrupt the government is then tells you that you need to give them MORE MONEY!?!? Funny and ironic. </p>

<p>If you gave more money to the American government how much would really be given back to help poor people? How much would be spent on bombs and prisons? How much would line the pockets of corrupt bureaucrats? I worked for government for awhile and I remember one day 60k of computers showed up which just sat in storage. I learned that our managers had accepted the computers simply because there was no advantage bureaucratically for declining them yet they weren&#39;t needed and we had enough computers. This is the kind of unaccountably which runs rampant in the public sector. </p>

<p>Furthermore, we are on r/conspiracy! Have you fucking forgot about Rumsfield saying that 2.3 trillion was missing from the pentagon?!?!? They now admit that it&#39;s over 6 trillion. Catherine Austin Fits, who was a financial officer under Bush Sr. and now is a forensic accountant thinks the amount of money missing from the US government and economy totals 20-40 trillion!!!! The government is already 20 trillion in debt additionally!!! All of this means the government and economy is very very very unhealthy and there is systemic corruption in the government and <strong>centralized financial institutions!!</strong> AND YOU WANT TO INCREASE SPENDING AND/OR TAXES?!?!?!??!! Those fuckers need to bled dry (metaphorically, as in financially.) </p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you put your energy into promoting a creative use of blockchain technology which could help provide a social safety net for people?  The problem is that society doesn&#39;t have a collective memory learned yet of voluntary social safety nets.. at one point in time agriculture was absent from our collective memory also. Socialism is remembered but it&#39;s a very grim memory indeed and the EU is ramping up its tyranny every day and <strong>soon Europe will be America tier in terms of crime and economy... you cannot have welfare states and open borders hahaha it&#39;s just fucking basic economics, forget racism and xenophobia!</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahahaha do you know how to read? Seriously was what I said so ambiguous that you have to ask me to repeat my argument instead of addressing the myriad of other points?</p>

<p>Tyranny is increasing in Europe, especially where the European Union has power. The evidence of this is more people imprisoned for breaking non violent rules, like drug crimes, and also an increase in surveillance by the police state. In addition freedom of speech is not being upheld even in Britain which seceeded from the EU. In Britain there are literally police that will arrrest you if you say mean things on the internet or <strong>even if you make rational points against immigration that are not overtly racist or xenophobic or prejudice AT ALL!</strong> The lack of freedom of speech exists also in the EU states. </p>

<p>Also, I think democracy is overrated for something like making choices about individual freedoms, which are god given natural rights and laws do not ethically take them away every. But members of a community have a right to contribute to decision making when it comes to immigration and EU membership. There have been many many decisions like that made without votes in the EU states when the population was against what the politicians did! In addition Catalonia, which wishes to seceded like Britain, was not even allowed to HOLD AN ELECTION! The jackbooted thugs beat old ladies just trying to write their name down on a piece of paper because the state was so terrified of there being an &quot;official&quot; record of popular disagreement with the laws in place! Meanwhile polls on social media showed overwhelming support for cessation in Catalonia! </p>

<p>Europe is a WELFARE STATE. That is a branch of <em>capitalism</em> which is related to socialism but not real socialism itself. But like any collection of people that has benefits for being a member of.. open membership defeats the ability of the group to keep providing benefits because eventually so many people will show up that the resources cannot meat the demand. In other words to maintain a welfare state that gives handouts to citizens CLOSED BORDERS are a necessity! It&#39;s literally economy 101 that welfare states need borders and extremely limited immigration policies in order to remain viable! Look at Australia&#39;s welfare state, which gives out less benefits, but has to keep restraints on the immigration of <strong>mouths to feed!</strong> </p>

<p>Depending on which source you believe the number of immigrants to Europe seeking welfare instead of work is 40-60%. Absolutely unsustainable especially because many of these countries have not really seen economic growth since the dot com bubble!!!! Specifically the countries giving out the best welfare have the most depressed economies! <strong>How long before welfare benefits are unavailable to the native population because so many immigrants have shown up to receive welfare!??!?! The answer is that it&#39;s already happening and in many of the countries welfare pay outs have decreased!! You think that is sustainable!??</strong> </p>

<p>Crime. Crime is SKYROCKETING in Europe, and it&#39;s not racist or xenophobic to say that it&#39;s correlated with the rise in immigration! It&#39;s just true. But in many countries it&#39;s actually illegal to say this, which creates a giant dilemma and is clear evidence of real life tyranny in Europe! Anyway, many of my friends are immigrants and my family and myself are immigrants, although we are white. </p>

<p>I am very very acutely aware that most people immigrating to Europe are non violent people and will try to follow the European laws (as terrible as some of the laws may be) to the best of their ability. That being said, many of them come from horrible situations where there has been war or incredible poverty. In many of the countries where these people are fleeing from violence is a very real part of daily life. This means that on average there will be more people that have acquired violent survival adaptations to their environment in those populations. It&#39;s not racist or homophobic to say that, and a lot of them have PTSD as well. I have the utmost sympathy for these people and I know what it&#39;s like to grow up with violence and I would not wish it on my worst enemy. But it still means that there is a greater likelihood that someone coming from these populations has a higher chance of being violent compared to privileged and wealthy populations of Europe where crime is almost non existent except for bar room tussles. </p>

<p>I travel to and from Europe quite regularly and have some family there. I have seen how it has changed lately. There is less money and jobs and more people asking for handouts, as well as much much much more violence. In areas that I thought were completely safe, in the last few years i have seen them radically transformed. And although I am happy to see that immigrants are finding some jobs sometimes and even working in the tech industry.. it&#39;s not worth losing such gems in the world like Sweden, Switzerland, or Norway! These used to be literal fucking Utopias! No crime and tons of hot chicks! The world needs examples like these so there is hope and people see how good life could be! Now those examples are being eroded by authoritarians that profit from the instability their policies are causing! One politician in the country my family lives in made money investing in low income housing that he knew would be profitable with the waves of immigrants. </p>

<p>Just this year i have seen 3 fights in my usual hangouts in Europe, and I am not someone who drinks often and these fights happened in broad daylight among crowded streets!! My friend was robbed twice by the same people last summer! I almost got mugged myself about a year ago but an actual immigrant was the one who saved me! The point is that the vast majority of the people moving there are non violent but because these places are so privileged it still has a drastic effect on the crime rate and brings them closer to the global mean of violence which is literally <strong>America tier.</strong> </p>

<p>So that is what I am saying. <strong>I absolutely do not want Europe to become America tier.</strong> What we are witnessing is leftism fall apart and eat it&#39;s own tail. The policies and ideologies which once created literal utopias are now destroying those same utopias. Like libertarians have always been saying, those policies and ideologies are not sustainable and easily corruptible. That is what we are witnessing. We are witnessing the slippage of Europe into America tier poverty and crime. Soon the welfare state will be overly burden and then non existent. Then there will be roving bands of homeless people in Europe like there are in America. There actually already are roving bands of homeless in Spain and Greece! How long before there is not one single nice country left in the world?!?!?! </p>

<p>That is why I am advocating for more robust libertarian solutions to these problems that are less susceptible to corruption and subversion, as well as being more advantageous for economic growth! Like a two year old, it&#39;s time for society to learn how to keep their rooms clean without the threat of punishment. We need to dial back the authoritarianism! We need to encourage communities to form their own social safety nets like humans did as tribes long ago! We need to pool our resources on the internet to provide additional social support instead of creating enemies with billionaires by threatening to extort them!!!! </p>

<p>I want people to have all the social benefits that they had in the welfare state but I want them to achieve that ethically without threatening people with violence! It&#39;s absolutely possible and it&#39;s very very very shameful that leftists are not willing to try this idea just because they are so stubborn, lazy, selfish, jealous, and spiteful! Neoshitlibs are being outclassed by conservatives that provide soup kitchens and homeless shelters to people in the United states!??! Have you ever thought about that?!? If it wasnt for christian conservatives there would litearlly be nothing for homeless people in America! Leftists need to put their money where their mouth is and start being creative with how to take care of societal problems without relying on statist violence! </p>

<p><strong>And these immigration polices are not just bad because they are people from third world countries!</strong> Their race actually has little to do with the opposition against these policies. The idea that people in Europe that oppose these policies are racist or xenophobic is just purely propaganda by the left to try and discredit their opinion. There are rational reasons why mass immigration is a bad idea right now and we can see the evidence in the statistics! <strong>Most people would oppose the same amount of Americans moving to Europe!</strong> Most people would oppose these immigration policies whether the immigrants where black or asian or dutch or whatever! Race is actually the least important part immigration! Added to the fact is that 80 percent of them are MEN! Who wants more poles showing up to the party!?!? Have you ever been to a party where there are more poles than holes?! All this demonization of men in the media yet they are also advocating for increasing the number of men!</p>

<p>It&#39;s not racist or xenophobic to say that most people do not want more men coming to their community UNLESS <strong>they can provide some kind of benefit to the people already there!</strong> Most of the men that arrive in Europe seek welfare!!!!!!! And the small amount of women usually do not date westerners! It&#39;s not racist or xenophobic to want to preserve social dynamics in a community, especially when they are very positive! Like having a country full of young attractive women is considered virtuous by most men and it&#39;s no wonder that so many are trying to get into the party but it&#39;s very understandable that the people already there do not want to invite people in there unless they are seeking to date them or do business with them! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is that the leaders of Europe are basically telling their citizens that they have to accept a decline in the social and economic standards of their communities because they are evil white people that need to take on the burdens of the world&#39;s worst problems! That is absolutely not fair! And it&#39;s not a net gain in the world because soon there will be no more nice places left and everything will just be the global mean like America! And america is still probably a lot nicer in most places than the global average but it&#39;s also headed there just like Europe. This is mostly because of authoritarians. </p>

<p>Lastly. All this talk about immigration in Europe. But one of the most important things to remember is that the immigrants, like me, that are already living there do not benefit from rising levels of crime and economic hardship, which mass immigration policies create! Another lie that the left brainwashes immigrants with is making them feel like they need more of their kind in that country and that white people are bad! They are trying to split people into these groups so they can be controlled. And the left knows that it can control the immigrants and get them to vote for their politicians as well as profit from instability. They also bribe voters by promising welfare!?!? This thread was started about political bribes yet the left are the ones that tell voters they will literally get money, extorted from demonized rich people, if they are elected! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, Europe, and the left in general.. is much more racist than your typical freedom loving American! At least there are actually large swaths of the population in America left that actually love freedom and appreciate their friends without prejudice!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p><em>The left on the other hand.</em> Well they are literally trying to genocide white people right now.. and there is just so much evidence about this that I cannot even begin to start writing about it to you. Just take for example how immigration is considered so positive by leftists <strong>specifically because it decreases the ratio of white people compared to other races.</strong> This shows how the left actually cares about race more than average people! Most people don&#39;t give a flying fuck about what race someone is but the left seem to think it&#39;s a virtue to be brown rather than white! Notice this? <strong>Race really should be the last factor, actually it should not be a factor at all, when deciding whether a person should be invited to a community or not!!!</strong></p>

<p>The left really are the largest group of racists out there. There are not that many right wing racists. Their numbers are in the single digit millions, if that. The left however is tens of millions strong unfortunately and tens of millions of them actually think there is something better about brown people vs white people. They think it&#39;s better for an immigrant to be brown vs white! They think that brown people should be given preferential treatment in all sorts of ways!?!? Is that not fucking racist?!?!??!?!? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of my family lives in northern Europe and I travel there for work multiple times a year so I end up spending a few months a year there. I have worked within this northern European government as well for over 9 months. I have been acutely tuned in to the changing conditions within this northern European country and the western world at large. This fucking northern European country/city that has been a part of my life since I was a child used to be a literal fucking utopia where the streets were shiny clean and there were no homeless and no crime but now it&#39;s literally fucking approaching American levels of dystopia and it will not be fucking long before the situation is worse here because the trend is so fucking steeply negative!!!! </p>

<p>The only reason you don&#39;t notice the same changes, consciously, is because your deep desire to believe that the social democrats in charge have your best interests at heart. For you it&#39;s easier to lie to yourself than to accept the fact that you live in a place that is quickly becoming a dystopia and your leaders have every intention of ruining your life for their own profit. You want to believe so badly that the government there is like a benevolent guardian that keeps you safe because that paints a rosy warm picture of what t he world is like and your reality. But if you even once had experiences which opposed the state&#39;s interests you would know what i mean!!!!!!</p>

<p>What if you are a drug addict in Europe?!?!? What if the government throws you into a cage because of the medications you need to feel normal and function and not feel like hell on earth?!?!? What if to get these medications you either had to deal with organized crime or write your name on a list that precludes you from working in certain industries, running for public office, receiving pain medication, and owning and shooting firearms?!??! Of course I am talking about these government heroin programs in places like switzerland or methadone clinics that collect surveillance on their patients and mark on their permanent records that they are drug addicts so that they are treated like second class citizens the rest of their life! <strong>If you were a drug addict in Europe you would feel like there is tyranny!</strong> </p>

<p>I am not a drug addict myself.. i have never used drugs, but I volunteered working with drug addicts and homeless for much of my life and I know what kind of horrible treatment these people are enduring at the hands of the state! There is a literal fucking holocaust still going on against drug addicts yet shitlibs act like social democrats could do no wrong and that drug addicts deserve to have doctors make all the deciions about their body for them because no normal citizen should ever be permitted the agency to make medical decisions about their body!! Yet you think that women should be able to kill babies inside them because of &quot;body sovereignty!&quot; Why don&#39;t you care about drug addicts as much as you care about women&#39;s uteri!!!??!?!?! </p>

<p>Why do you pretend that European governments are not complicit in this kind of holocaust against drug addicts the same way the United States is?!??! They have marginally less drug addicts in prison but it&#39;s still hundreds of thousands of lives destroyed by the state and millions overall throughout the history of the drug war!! For some people the holocaust never ended and they are still treated like vermin that have to hide in society because there is always someone out to get them!! IMAGINE FEELING LIKE A RAT YOUR WHOLE FUCKING LIFE! Talk about oppression ahahaha these are the most oppressed and persecuted people in the west! Their suicide rate is close to 50 fucking percent!!! </p>

<p>Yet shitlibs and leftists support the drug war because they think doctors should be the ones making choices about people&#39;s body and individuals shouldn&#39;t have the agency of being able to have a free market when it comes to medications and medical treatment!!! Think how many more people could afford medications if they were able to self diagnose themselves!!!!! My fucking father is a doctor and they fucking use google most of the fucking time anyway! And one time if I had not googled my treatment options there was a surgeon that was 5 minutes away from taking out one of my fucking organs! I called the surgery off as i was being prepped for the OR because I found a different treatment on google being offered in the same goddamn hospital that allowed me to keep my organ! </p>

<p>The moral of the fucking story is that individuals need to have the ultimate authority over their own body and it&#39;s unethical to prevent people from purchasing their own medications! Furthermore we all have a right to &quot;prep&quot; for emergency and stockpiling medications is a neccesary part of that to make sure we are safe if medical services are unavailable! Yet shitlibs and neo leftists do not want individuals to have any sort of hedge against government tryanny! Shame on them!!!!!! </p>

<p><strong>Now about immigration.</strong> What fucking rock have you been living under?!??! How much violence have you witnessed in the recent few years compared to before? How much violence have you heard rumors of as compared to before?!?! How much violence have you been a victim of as compared to before?!?!? Are you completely sheltered somehow from violence where you live or something?!?!? <strong>In my own experiences around this northern european city I have never experienced violence, except on one occasion, before 2 years ago and I have been coming here my whole fucking life!!!!!!</strong> And the amount of violence that I have encountered in the last two years fucking rivals the amount of violence that I encounter in a fucking American City, which is actually known for crime!!!!!!! It&#39;s literally not a fucking exaggeration either! More of my friends have been victims of violence here in Europe than back home in America!! </p>

<p>It is only a matter of fucking time before the fucking situation is actually worse in this northern European city because we all fucking know that welfare states require closed borders! The fucking economy is about to fucking fall out from under the floor!!!! An over burdened welfare state with open borders is literally fucking suicide! Any ecnomist will tell you this much, well except the delusional psychos that follow keynesian fake economics! But ask any actual economist and they will fucking all agree that welfare state&#39;s with open borders, especially if they already are in recessions, is like trying to put out a fire with fucking gasoline!!! </p>

<p>Are you very fucking young??!! Are you in some kind of very sheltered community?!?!?! Are you not exposed to the grimmer parts of the city?!?! Are you in some kind of sheltered rural community!?!? What is the deal?!??! How have you not experienced what I am talking about?!?! Are you just too young to remember what it was like before!!?!?!? Do you not remember that kinds of jobs available in Europe in the 90s??!?!?! Those were real opportunities but they are gone because no one in their right mind would invest here! Have you really not witnessed communities changing negatively lately?!?!? <strong>I don&#39;t believe you and I expect some kind of anecdotal evidence to the contrary if you are still going to attempt to argue your bogus position!</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>for us whose gone through various stages of privatization that the state monopoly provided by far the best service for the buck spent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AHAHAHAHHAHAHA! (breaths in) HAHAHAHAHA Wtf are you talking about?!?!? <strong>Cite specific examples!</strong></p>

<p>Now I really suspect that you are very very young and have never actually tried applying yourself in life! If you had then you would realize how fucking hard it is to start a business in Europe and how hard it is to fucking compete with government monopolies that just raise money for statist violence anyways!! The fucking Euro social democracies literally try to make it as hard as fucking possible for their citizens to make money independently and even impose all kinds of weird rediculous taxes on financial traders and such just to limit their ability to profit and circumvent their authoritarian control methods! </p>

<p>They want everyone to be locked into little coffin sized studio apartments that go to work for companies owned by the state and they don&#39;t want you to have any other options like making money online, which is what I mostly do! SO yes, the Euro Social democracies try to make wage slaving seem to be attractive and comfortable (it&#39;s not as waking up early sucks no matter what) but once you have a taste of financial independence you would never go back! They dont even want you to get a taste!!!!! </p>

<p><strong>How the fuck has these state monopolies directly benefited your life?!?!? How have you been directly harmed by privatized solutions??!?!</strong> </p>

<p>You have never even really experienced free markets or free enterprise! Those things do not exist in large markets and they are usually corrupted by statist authoritarians that take bribes! <strong>And state enterprise is literally fucking bribery as those companies ALWAYS have exceptions from the regulations and taxes!?!?!? How is that fair?!?!?!</strong> Does fairness not even matter to shitlibs?!?! Is it really only the equality of outcome they are concerned about?!?! </p>

<p>Also how is it not a political bribe to promise more welfare payouts?!?!? Which btw are decreasing!!!!!!!! <strong>HAVE YOU NOT WITNESSED LESS PAYOUTS IN THE WELFARE SYSTEM BECAUSE IT IS OVERBURDENED!!?!?!</strong> That is what is happening here and the people are very fucking pissed and the EU will have to stop at some point or the bad kind of anarchy is going to happen! I dont support bad kinds of anarchy though only the peaceful good kind that comes with careful dismantling of authority layer by layer instead of all at once and violently!</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve already shown in this thread, the number of revolvers for <em>the entire gun lobby</em> is 26. Pharmaceutical industry? 926. That&#39;s literally <em>900 more politicians who were revolvers for pharma than gun rights.</em> 926 vs 26....  But please, keep laboring under the illusion that the gun lobby is somehow worse about this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NRA has spent $203.2 million on political activities since 1998.</p>

<p>So, in 20 years of political activity... they haven&#39;t even totaled <em>one single years worth of political expenditures</em> by pharmaceuticals, who spent $277 million in 2016 alone</p>

<p>That is an excellent point to put things in perspective.</p>

<p>Since 2008, pharmaceuticals have spent $880 million on lobbying alone. That&#39;s over 4 times the gun lobby&#39;s entire expeditures... in <em>half the time</em>.</p>

<p>Let me just give you some choice quotes from <a href="https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/09/18/20203/pharma-lobbying-held-deep-influence-over-opioid-policies">this article</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Drug companies and allied advocates spent more than $880 million on lobbying and political contributions at the state and federal level over the past decade</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see those numbers for the gun lobby, buddy. Something tells me they aren&#39;t even close. Finally:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The opioid lobby&#39;s political spending adds up to <strong>more than eight times what the formidable gun lobby recorded for political activities during the same period.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay. I think it&#39;s time for you guys to start providing data for your claims that actually backs up what you&#39;re saying; otherwise, you are a waste of my time.</p>

<p>Then why are you arguing against me in a thread that started with someone saying &quot;The NRA is the largest lobbying group in the US&quot; and me disagreeing with that and proving it wrong with numbers illustrating the issue?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To deny that, one must either be stupid or dishonest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The gun lobby is orders of magnitude less influential than pharma and healthcare. They are a blip on the radar compared to these giants. The numbers show this. To deny that, one must be stupid or dishonest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact that you&#39;re arguing NRA vs the ENTIRE pharmaceutical industry </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except I clearly have stated that I have used numbers for the <em>entire gun rights lobby</em>.</p>

<p>Literally from the comment you just replied to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As I&#39;ve already shown in this thread, the number of revolvers <strong>for the entire gun lobby is 26.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I get why you&#39;d try and lie about that because the numbers don&#39;t support the picture you&#39;re trying to paint.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does the NRA spend a lot of money to influence policy? Unquestionably. Do others spend more? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. <em>vastly</em> more. And they influence more policy, and own more politicians, and out more of their guys into elections... <em>and</em> are more under the radar as evidenced by the people like you who come out of the woodwork to deflect away from the raw numbers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>one of the most powerful</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, they are one of thousands, and their numbers are light compared to the top dogs. They aren&#39;t even top-tier.</p>

<p>To even compare them to the top lobbies is disingenuous, let alone claiming that they are <em>the largest lobbying group</em> and having multiple people come out of the woodwork to try and back up the claim. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a good point about the outside spending, though. 54 million is really bad. But, to my point, still doesn&#39;t put them even in <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?indexType=i&amp;amp;showYear=2017">the top 20 for lobbying money</a></p>

<p>Another interesting detail is that the number of groups in that category dwindles to 170 because 501c&#39;s don&#39;t need to disclose their donors.</p>

<p>Can you give me something to go on with this? I&#39;ll admit I haven&#39;t dug into their lobbying practices vs other industries but I&#39;m open to what you have.</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve learned, they are neither the most potent nor the most toxic lobbying force in the US.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t follow... you just said that they were the worst, as did the person I replied to. I just found that to be a little convenient if not concern trollish given the current political climate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where do gun rights and regulations come in?</p>

<p>This is a post about lobbying, not gun rights. The person I replied to said, &quot;The NRA is the largest lobbying group in the US and currently under the radar.&quot; In reply to the OP about lobbying. They have since edited the comment.</p>

<p>So when you said this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NRA is number one far and away on the particular issue </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assumed the &quot;particular issue&quot; to be lobbying, given the OP and the context of the comment I replied to. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you get &quot;the worst&quot; out of &quot;neither the worst&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I meant that you <em>just said they were number one in lobbying</em>. So when I said, &quot;i don&#39;t follow&quot;, it was acknowledging that you had just said &quot;neither the worst&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s in the constitution and most don&#39;t know what lobbying is - just that it is part of politics and people do it for...stuff.  It was supposed to be for Americans to lobby the government and have people do it on their behalf.  Simple example would be farmers hundreds of miles from the capital needing a voice to go bring their issues to the government since they all cant just leave their farm and homes and families to try and be heard.   </p>

<p>Now, its simply Jewish interests controlling the capital.  Israel owns the largest lobbying groups - larger than the actual government itself.  Most are dual citizenship and have no affiliation or ties to America and push immigration, gun control, anti-free speech in the name of &quot;hate speech&quot;, affirmative action/anti-white racism, punishments for any that boycott Israel or refusal of aid to Americans in need and so on.   </p>

<p>None of it has anything to do with what lobbying was originally intended to be for, but these people control the government, media and school system, so you will never be taught what lobbying is, what it was for or how it has been corrupted and you will never hear anything negative about it nor a hint of changing it.</p>

<p>Lol, wtf kinda talking point is this?</p>

<p>The NRA is a fringe interest group- they don&#39;t have a fraction of a fraction of the power and influence that pharma does.</p>

<p>The NRA spent 3 million lobbying in 2016. Big pharma spent 278 million.</p>

<p>Do you realize how ridiculous you look comparing the two?</p>

<p>The NRA donated 1 million in campaign contributions in 2016. Pfizer, which is simply a single entity of the Pharma lobby, among many... did 2.8 million in campaign contributoons.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Life, as well as citizenship, is not clean cut.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While some of my more interesting musings lean to corporations being aggregate entities with something resembling life, there is still plenty of obvious differences that, again, a 3 year old can recognize them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>. Unless we clearly define everything, significant loopholes will be found </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree, the <em>more</em> we clearly define things, the more verbiage we add to the law, the more interpretive loopholes are found. </p>

<p>A great example of this is the Establishment clause of the First Amendment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Congress shall make no law <strong>respecting</strong> an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(emphasis mine)</p>

<p>Originally, the word &#39;respecting&#39; was unambiguously understood by layman, lawyer, and academic alike to mean &#39;pertaining to&#39;. </p>

<p>Except in 1962, Engel v. Vitale, the Supreme Court ruled (6-1 iirc) that the meaning of &#39;respecting&#39; was instead the modern connotation, i.e. &#39;favoring one establishment over another&#39;. </p>

<p>Which is how they came to the decision that prayer in schools was unconstitutional, because it &#39;respected&#39; (promoted) a specific religion, regardless of the ambiguity of the wording of the prayer. </p>

<p>The thing is, the modern connotation of &#39;respecting&#39; (giving respect to) did not exist in anything but poetic usage at the time. </p>

<p>The SC also had full access to the historical notes of the discussion during the framing of the 1st Amendment where it was clearly stated that both the spirit and the word of the Amendment were intended to prevent Congress from passing any laws pertaining to the creation of, or the free exercise of religion where it did not contravene established criminal law (e.g.: human sacrifice is not protected, as murder is already a crime). </p>

<p>The wording was deliberately re-interpreted to prevent a &#39;spirit of the law&#39; breach where the SC did not want schools forcing their students to pray. </p>

<p>And the worst part about all of this? That pretty much opened <em>everything</em> to reinterpretation in the modern connotation, which no legislation drafter could ever effectively predict when such laws are initially penned. </p>

<p>And leads to things like this, where corporations are &#39;people&#39; and people are Human Resources. </p>

<p>The reinterpretation of non-ambiguous wordings to cater to the personal opinions of judges. </p>

<p>Fucking disgusting, and renders the Rule of Law effectively null, because the Law becomes whatever the authoritative wielder says it means. </p>

<p>And no one seems to have a problem with that. </p>

<p>I disagree... many people have a problem with it.  But there is a difference between the people trying to fix it (by using precise wording in their laws [which I&#39;ve already said is a fallacy] even if it doesn&#39;t solve the problem), and those that bitch about it and state the obvious (we&#39;re all screwed and there is no coming back from it).</p>

<p>There is a reason for the saying &quot;there is a different set of laws for the rich&quot;.  They can hire linguistic academics to word the rules however they see fit.  The normal people can&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thought terminating cliche</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only if you are convinced that you have the one right answer and anyone that disagrees with you is wrong.  Others, like myself, would see it as the introduction to another concern about the fundamental fault on which our laws were built:  we assume that the &quot;spirit&quot; of the law should be respected without ever stating it explicitly.  Fact is, assumptions are the reason that the supreme court is able to &quot;update&quot; (aka rewrite) laws and (given the right people making the changes), this is how we can correct it.</p>

<p>Yeah, that&#39;s pretty much how I operate, and I&#39;m very rarely proven wrong. Call it arrogance if you want. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>we assume that the &quot;spirit&quot; of the law should be respected without ever stating it explicitly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Especially for the Establishment clause, this is not the case. As again, we have historical documentation by the hands of the drafters themselves over their choice of words and what the purpose of the wording was. </p>

<p>The only way you can assume otherwise is to disregard the documented correspondences of those involved in the drafting. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>act is, assumptions are the reason that the supreme court is able to &quot;update&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, especially in the 1st Amendment case, this is unwarranted and spurious. </p>

<p>Meaning of words change over time with semantic drift, no law can be written that will not mean something completely different as the language changes. </p>

<p>The concept of law transcends words on paper, they are enshrined concepts that the words on paper only point to. </p>

<p>And if the SC can ignore the root concept of any amendment or law, then as I stated before, the Rule of Law is meaningless because the law has now become subjective and available to reinterpretation whenever a judge gets it in their head to become activists instead of the impartial authority they were appointed to be. </p>

<p>And we&#39;ve seen the beginning of this.  Again (as I said before) if you don&#39;t state explicitly that the written intent should be considered when enforcing the written word it becomes just that:  a stand alone statement with no context.  Those original papers don&#39;t need to be considered (as much as they should be), because it is never stated explicitly that they are important.</p>

<p>Look.  I agree with you, but we are not discussing the way it should be, we are discussing the way it is.  And currently, laws are suspect to interpretation based on the current understanding of the words... not on the intent on which they were written. //</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because when large multinational conglomerates decide to take unlimited funds out of their general fund -- funds they earned off of us, the consumers -- they fill up all the free speech space with very expensive speech so that few can get a word in edgewise.</p>

<p>They are in business to make profits, not to be bastions of expensive free speech. They should not have any rights.</p>

<p>Corporations are entirely undemocratic. If I buy a box of twinkies, I don&#39;t need some tiny group of majority stock holders deciding to tax me on that purchase with spending to make the government do things that are against my interest. That&#39;s pretty sick, actually.</p>

<p>Corporations lobby for one reason and one reason only: profits. It&#39;s right there in the business law. The charter is granted to those who want to make profits, to accumulate and control the capital of other people, and to protect themselves from their own wrongdoing. These are not citizens, and should have no rights.</p>

However, I&#39;ll assume the lobbying you&#39;d refer to is a corporation is donating money to a politician to advance their agenda, but an attempt to do that will not  only prevent possibly well-intentioned corporations from getting their agenda to politicians without this process?

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really hard to come up with lobbying reforms that everyone can agree on. For starters, there are good lobbying groups, such as nonprofits that lobby for the rights of veterans, extension of due process, etc. Then there are corporate lobbyists, such as lobbyists for the movie industry. Of course, most people here think the latter is bad, but a lot of people disagree. Even some who hate the movie industry might argue that the movie industry should still have the right to lobby Congress. There are always those who believe that anyone who has money should be able to do whatever they want with it within the bounds of the law. And paying people to lobby Congress is something that you can do with your money.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because direct action is supplanted by indirect action by media and political groups that have vested interest in not changing how things are. Indirect action like protests do nothing to change the system, to use a blunt metaphor, we have to throw a wrench into the system if we want it to stop. That is direct action, not sitting passively on Reddit discussing why the powers that be are the way they are. </p>

<p>Lets look past the people who &quot;arent told by their tv&quot; to promote change because to be honest those people are probably hopeless. It&#39;s us on here who are really the problem. We sit on here in our little echochamber circlejerking the same conspiracies over and over again. These ideas spewed out on here have very limited reach and do not usually go past this website. So, I would say reddit and the internet is why people are not actively lobbying, because we can sit here passively, identify the problem that exists, gain a confirmation bias from others and receive catharsis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because there are good and bad lobbyists. Even the bad ones do good at times and the good ones can do bad. It&#39;s all based on perspective.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say there is a new technology like solar panels that could promise to be an economic boon and save people thousands of dollars on their utility bills over the years. </p>

<p>These manufacturers need someone who has a history of navigating Congressional offices and has a list of contacts who can help them get legislation passed (or even getting it introduced for that matter).</p>

<p>They need a strong legal and econ team that believes in the product and can show how this product could fit in with current regulations, laws, statutes, etc... without spending too much of their own money on research that could cripple a blossoming company.</p>

<p>That said, I work for a lobbying firm who deals with the Agriculture industry. We try to make sure that burdensome environmental regulations and administrative code doesn&#39;t apply to industries like us because that ultimately drives up the cost of food to the consumer and no one wants that. So, it&#39;s a constant struggle of who is good and who is bad. You help one person, you end up hurting another.

    <div class="md"><p>Because not all lobbying is bad. Special interest groups fighting for climate change, fair workers rights, and various other things use the exact same system to lobby politicians as the groups who work for large oil, pharmaceutical companies  the the mil-industrial complex.</p>

<p>So protesting &quot;lobbying&quot; as such isn&#39;t going to help anyone, or at least, will only help in a roundabout way. Specific protests against specific lobbying groups, or to make it more transparent? That makes more sense to me atleast.</p>

I know where I&#39;m at in North Carolina, there&#39;s the <a href="http://ncwethepeople.org/">NC We the People</a> campaign, which is trying to get legislation into congress to limit money as free speech. Also consider what people like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Haddock">Granny D</a> have done, and <a href="https://www.hcpress.com/news/paula-finck-leads-sisters-march-boone-saturday-300-protesters.html">those actively protesting in her footsteps</a>.</p>

<p>Fight the good fight, <a href="/u/55433gladman">/u/55433gladman</a>, and get out there for the cause--campaign finance reform is much needed and long overdue, Citizens United is a bad look and we don&#39;t need to be putting up with it.</p>

<p>And no one seems to have a problem with that.</p>

<p>I disagree... many people have a problem with it.  But there is a difference between the people trying to fix it (by using precise wording in their laws [which I&#39;ve already said is a fallacy] even if it doesn&#39;t solve the problem), and those that bitch about it and state the obvious (we&#39;re all screwed and there is no coming back from it).</p>

<p>There is a reason for the saying &quot;there is a different set of laws for the rich&quot;.  They can hire linguistic academics to word the rules however they see fit.  The normal people can&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thought terminating cliche</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only if you are convinced that you have the one right answer and anyone that disagrees with you is wrong.  Others, like myself, would see it as the introduction to another concern about the fundamental fault on which our laws were built:  we assume that the &quot;spirit&quot; of the law should be respected without ever stating it explicitly.  Fact is, assumptions are the reason that the supreme court is able to &quot;update&quot; (aka rewrite) laws and (given the right people making the changes), this is how we can correct it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a good point about the outside spending, though. 54 million is really bad. But, to my point, still doesn&#39;t put them even in <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?indexType=i&amp;amp;showYear=2017">the top 20 for lobbying money</a></p>

<p>Another interesting detail is that the number of groups in that category dwindles to 170 because 501c&#39;s don&#39;t need to disclose their donors.</p>
