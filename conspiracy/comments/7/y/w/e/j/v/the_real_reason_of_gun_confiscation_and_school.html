        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A big revolution in america is coming and the current american government is about to be overthrown in front of some ad hoc revolutionary tyranny acting as a core of the new world order.</p>

<p>And revolutionaries KILL millions in revolutions. You see this in soviet russia, communist china, revolutionary france and now, nazi ukraine. They kill millions! But because the revolutionaries are feared of resistance like a lion feared of a zebra they want to hunt mule kicking them in the neck, they are feared of your guns. If everyone had a gun, the revolutionaries will be terrified and will just leave right at the door of your town.</p>

<p>If they take your guns, they can basically kill you at free will after the revolution ends. You will not act as any form of resistance and will be taken away to fun camps.</p>

<p>And no, trump will not save you, he&#39;s exactly playing into the plan. Only you can save yourself by rejecting the gun confiscation propaganda and hiding your guns somewhere and deny the gun confiscation orders attention. The orders are no more effective than a piece of paper.</p>

<p>Disarmed states WILL be the first to be purged in the big revolution by ISIS and Mexican gang criminals as well as russian and chinese soldiers. The liberals will be singing in their pro-hillary, revolutionary agenda and will be the tokens to the revolutionary protests. </p>

<p>The &quot;Free-Thinker&quot; students are nothing more than the facade and the aformentioned foreign gangs will be the ones carrying the killing. These &quot;protestors&quot; and &quot;revolutionaries&quot; have no idea that they are not &quot;fighting for freedom&quot; and will be slaughtered like cattle in the protest scenes, and the very people they worship treat them nothing more than pawns. </p>

<p>The other side, the &quot;Alt-Rightists&quot; act as the ready made opposition against the upcoming revolutionaries and will quickly be destroyed and disbanded when the revolutionary government strikes. Just look at the whites versus the soviets and you know what happens. </p>

<p>And THIS is why they confiscate your guns. THIS is why they organize school shooting false flags. So that the revolution strikes, you WILL be selected out for purging. And they kill MILLIONS.</p>

<p>KEEP YOUR GUNS AT ALL COSTS IF YOU HAVE THEM.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, there are differences in technology and social media is divisive but consider what happened when Hurricane Harvey catastrophically flooded downtown Houston and the greater metropolitan area. You had good ole boys from all over the South hooking up there fishing boats and heading down to the city with food and water to rescue the stranded. It didn’t matter who they were, black or white, rich or poor, men and women came together to help their fellow countrymen. Our differences fall to wayside in times of crisis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, most military and law enforcement would. The problem with all of this is the propaganda machine. Many people will side with either cause under false pretenses. Most Americans believe ridiculously false narratives today because of what they’re spoon fed. This “revolution” would be the greatest of all propaganda machines ever created. I believe most people will side with whatever side provides them the least amount of discomfort today (read availability to internet and Starbucks). . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they at least want a bunch of fear mongering to get people to feel they should keep their guns so they can keep whatever political party in the election runnings. Maybe they want the citizens to try a revolution?</p>

<p>The government wouldn&#39;t try any worse than they&#39;re already doing now because they know it would destroy them. You can&#39;t really take away all the guns unless you have some sort of psychic being that knows everything or some sort of gun detector.</p>
