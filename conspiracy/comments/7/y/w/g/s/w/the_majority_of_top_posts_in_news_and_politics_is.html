Lets not fix why mass murders kill, lets just make them use bombs and poison instead of shooting people. Society is broken from cronie capitalism and pharma, not guns. </p>

<p>Edit: when antifa and black lives matter supporters were organizing in armed militias, the conservatives bitched that they shouldn&#39;t be allowed to. Now antifa and BLM supporters are wanting gun control and conservatives are supporting Armed militias... If you&#39;re poor or middle class, you should want guns and equal distribution of wealth. If you&#39;re rich, you should want the 90% unarmed in case they stop killing each other and start killing you. It&#39;s funny mass shootings never happen at wealthy schools and clubs. </p>

<p>People who want us to make policy based off of pain or start your actions from a position of anger don’t give a fuck about us. That’s what being manipulated and used is. </p>

<p>The &quot;enforce the laws&quot; camp got a boost last week from a study by the Americans for Gun Safety Foundation that documents the embarrassing extent to which federal gun laws are not, in fact, enforced. Of the 22 major federal gun statutes, 20 are almost completely ignored. And they happen to be the laws intended to combat the black-market for firearms.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. That was the first search result. There are plenty out there, and that report that&#39;s linked is still relevant. </p>

<p>The Obama administration has failed in gun control because it has failed to enforce existing gun laws.</p>

<p>The administration has overseen a striking drop in prosecutions of gun crimes, winning only about 6,000 convictions in 2015 — down more than 15 percent from five years ago, and giving added weight to claims by gun rights groups that President Obama has failed to enforce the laws already on the books.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/31/obama-gun-control-push-undercut-by-fall-in-prosecu/">https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/31/obama-gun-control-push-undercut-by-fall-in-prosecu/</a></p>

<p>Stopping and reducing illegal gun trafficking is a laudable cause, but this legislation won&#39;t make a difference because the feds already fail to enforce similar laws already on the books. In fact, even possible presidential candidate and Vice President Joe Biden has admitted the Department of Justice &quot;doesn&#39;t have time&quot; to prosecute  people who lie on background check forms or straw purchasers who play a large role in the gun trafficking problem. Also, a reminder of former ATF Director B. Todd Jones&#39; confirmation hearing: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>do you ever make your own points or just copy paragraphs straight from articles? </p>

<p>one article says that a lack of prosecution is occurring because a smaller amount of cases are being brought because overall murder rates are dropping. </p>

<p>joe biden went on to say that they don&#39;t have the time because they don&#39;t have the man power and that the current systems allow for you to just lie and check a box incorrectly and you receive a gun. on top of that townhall is a bullshit excuse of a source funded by the koch bros so forgive me for not giving a shit about it. </p>

<p>so pretty much you&#39;ve made my point that current laws in place are A. ineffective and B. not strictly enforced, which means we as a country need to enact stricter gun control policy&#39;s when it comes to legislation and enforcement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is federal gun laws are not enforced. The first article, which you ignored, into depth as to why. There are countless resources on this. Though your tactic is to attack the source. You want more gun laws when the current laws aren&#39;t even enforced. This is the definition of illogical reasoning that originates from emotion instead of fact. </p>

<p>And the townhall link has a hearing from the former ATF director linked, which you obviously did not listen to either. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why I bother with your type because there&#39;s no reasoning with people who operate on emotion over logic. </p>

<p>it looks like we have the same point, i too want gun laws to be enforced. you read this as me saying i think the only solution is to add more gun laws. while i think more gun laws would be helpful in some instances, it&#39;s equally important that gun laws are enforced, which i said i wanted.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t know why you think you know my &quot;type&quot; and feel that acting as if only people who agree with you use logic and reasoning, and everyone else is doesn&#39;t. it makes you come off like a huge cocksucker and turns people off from taking you or your arguments seriously.</p>

Like I said, criminals will get access to guns no matter the avenue. Gun laws don&#39;t apply to criminals because they don&#39;t OBEY LAWS. </p>

<p>And these guns are sold as &quot;straw purchases&quot; which there are already federal laws against, which are not being enforced.</p>

<p>&quot;Tracing an illegal gun is hard, because once it is sold on the private market in what’s called a straw purchase, the gun often no longer has a paper trail.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Buying guns from licensed dealers for someone else is illegal. &quot;Straw purchasers&quot; break the law by fraudulently filling out a form that says they&#39;re the actual buyer, but they&#39;re actually buying the gun for another person — someone who might be avoiding a background check.&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;s no way to enforce those laws without catching the person in the act of selling guns to criminals. But by cutting off their access to guns, they won&#39;t be able to sell them to criminals at all in the first place.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t enforce it. You have to stop the means by which they guns in the first place, so they can&#39;t sell them at all.</p>

<p>Why should it be legal in 37 states for someone to sell an AR-15 to someone else without even asking their name? Why can&#39;t we have universal background checks? </p>

<p>&quot; The FBI&#39;s background-check system is missing millions of records of criminal convictions, mental illness diagnoses and other flags that would keep guns out of potentially dangerous hands, a gap that contributed to the shooting deaths of 26 people in a Texas church this week.</p>

<p>Experts who study the data say government agencies responsible for maintaining such records have long failed to forward them into federal databases used for gun background checks - systemic breakdowns that have lingered for decades as officials decided they were too costly and time-consuming to fix.&quot;</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s disingenuous, considering you&#39;re linking an article where it&#39;s being acknowledged, and there has been tons of discussion about enforcing current laws better.

    <div class="md"><p>Well they&#39;re not enforced perfectly, nowhere near that. So no one actually has any idea if more are actually needed. In fact, some of the mass shootings could have been prevented if gun laws were actually enforced properly, and the system already in place was fixed,and there&#39;s no new law thats been proposed that could have prevented the others. </p>

<p>&quot;White House spokesman Josh Earnest struggled to answer direct questions Thursday about whether any of President Obama&#39;s proposed gun control measure would have prevented the recent mass shootings seen in the U.S.</p>

<p>Reporter Byron Tau brought up Sen. Marco Rubio&#39;s (R., Fla.) remark that no recent mass shootings would have been prevented by gun legislation, a statement rated &quot;True&quot; by the Washington Post fact-checker.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://freebeacon.com/issues/white-house-cant-name-a-mass-shooting-that-would-have-been-prevented-by-gun-control-legislation/">http://freebeacon.com/issues/white-house-cant-name-a-mass-shooting-that-would-have-been-prevented-by-gun-control-legislation/</a></p>

<p>For years, the federal database that is supposed to stop dangerous people from buying guns has been undermined by missing records. At least three of America’s most high-profile mass shooters were legally barred from buying guns, but were able to purchase them anyway because of the federal system’s failures. Among them was the gunman who murdered 26 people in a Texas church this month.</p>

<p>Early reports from the mass shooting in northern California on Tuesday, which left five dead and included an attack on an elementary school, also suggested the shooter had been barred from owning firearms by a court order.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just not true. Even if all the laws on the books were enforced perfectly, there would still be 37 states where a criminal or crazy person could buy an AR-15 through a private sale with no problem.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to see that revisited, considering how many more mass shootings we&#39;ve had in the 2+ years since that article was published. I would also like to know about shootings that they didn&#39;t consider &quot;recent&quot;.</p>

<p>Also, there are 30,000+ gun deaths in the US every year. How many of those would have been prevented by new legislation? The answer is definitely well into the thousands, considering how many gun deaths in inner cities are due to guns being purchased in states with lax laws.</p>

<p>And no one is saying that shouldn&#39;t be addressed. But even if it were, there are 37 states where they could have bought guns without background checks at all, and that also needs to be addressed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I already said background checks are fine. But once again, you missed the point. So we require background checks for every single gun purchase, private or otherwise. There&#39;s still the massive problem where information isn&#39;t being sent to the proper channels that do the background checks, so thousands will still slide through. Go ahead and pass a universal background check law, it&#39;s not going to work until they fix the system already in place. The NICS is who will do the background checks, and they&#39;re not receiving the proper information to do them effectively. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;ve said repeatedly there&#39;s no new law that will be effective until there&#39;s proper enforcement of the laws already in place. Funding should go to fixing the system, not trying to enforce new laws that will depend on that system. There&#39;s no logic in that.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like the background check system doesn&#39;t work at all. It may have its faults, but it&#39;s denied about 2 million applications over the years, so it does work to a degree. So universal background checks will definitely be an improvement over the current laws, even with an imperfect background check system.</p>

<p>Why not both? The system does work to a degree, so there&#39;s no logic in thinking expanding the system won&#39;t work at all unless the system works perfectly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issues driving the problems are completely unrelated.  One is happening because of lack of opportunity driving crime, the other is happening because of lack of regulation allowing people to get guns without any kind of background check.</p>

<p>A nationalized standard for gun sales needs to be implemented because the patchwork of laws at the state level are a sieve that allow psychos access to guns without any record or background checks.</p>

<p>The one way they are related is how they are able to get the guns.  The gunshow loophole is putting just as many guns in the hands of criminals as it is psychos.  We need to close the loophole and standardize gun licensing and purchasing.  Then we can work on creating more opportunity in low income neighborhoods infested by crime because those people cant buy food or pay rent unless they resort to crime to attack the gun violence problem driven by crime.</p>

If it ever gets to the point of another civil war or open rebellion in the US, it won&#39;t matter what weapons the government has. They can&#39;t just nuke cities or roll tank columns through lines of civilians. That would turn the rest of the world and probably our own military against them. And at this point the American military seems to have made a habit of losing to lightly armed untrained civilians living in caves and rice fields anyway. </p>

<p>I have thought up my gun rule its called the &quot;me plus 3&quot; rule. You have to get 3 people to sign when you get a gun. If that gun is used irresponsibly, you plus the three people signing get in trouble. This way small groups can regulate themselves and be judge of who in their community want guns. The crazy guys will have a hard time. And grouos who knowingly use guns yo do bad will be stripped of legally having weapons. There will always be illegal guns though, but this way communities can easier police themselves.</p>

<p>You think people <em>aren&#39;t</em> anti-obesity? </p>

<p>You realize there are tons of healthy eating campaigns, right? Some areas tax soft drinks. In my area, schools are now banned from selling soft drinks and junk food to kids when only a few years before they were putting in more vending machines filled with the stuff. Michelle Obama spent most of her time in the Whitehouse working on a healthy eating and anti-obesity campaign focused on children. There are campaigns to make school lunches healthier all over the country. There were laws passed by the previous administration that required disclosure of calorie counts in fast food and restaurants. Obesity-related illnesses are some of the top causes of death in the U.S., and there are tons of measures and campaigns seeking to address the issue. </p>

<p>Mass murder... yet one of these issues results in 400,000 deaths and one results in 40,000. Children getting cardiovascular diseases, dying young after costing the US billions in healthcare costs is a thing, too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You think people aren&#39;t anti-obesity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see anyone talking about food companies, agriculture companies, and pharma, and their role in promoting obesity and the hundreds of thousands who die from it. If it happens, it&#39;s not even close to the publicity level of gun control.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You realize there are tons of healthy eating campaigns, right? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where is the public discussion? Show me some posts from this sub and let&#39;s compare them to gun posts. Let me make a prediction to illustrate my point- I bet you&#39;ve made numerous comments about gun control and participated in numerous gun control discussions on reddit- I also bet you&#39;ve never been in a discussion on obesity/nutrition on reddit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Michelle Obama spent most of her time in the Whitehouse working on a healthy eating and anti-obesity campaign focused on children. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And she was criticized and mocked for it. Not only that, many people&#39;s response to the program was to just have their kids <a href="https://www.gao.gov/mobile/products/GAO-15-656">not eat school lunches</a>. Lastly, there have been studies claiming that the healthier lunches <em>improved the behavior and mental functioning</em> of the kids that ate the healthier lunches... <em>where is the discussion on this</em>? Where are the threads of people arguing that if behavior and mental health in children is <em>improved</em> by diet, then fixing nationwide dietary issues would have the side effect of reducing mental health issues <em>and shootings as a result</em>? Where are those discussions? Nowhere- it&#39;s all gun control.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>fast food and restaurants</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Awesome.. where is the discussion about these very companies who both <a href="http://www.supernutritionacademy.com/dangers-of-sugar/#.WoyLDHOIYwA">hid the effects of sugar from consumers</a> while knowingly <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/01/11/health/lustig-western-diet/index.html">adding sugar into their products</a></p>

<p>Where&#39;s the discussion on government subsidy of agriculture corps? Where&#39;s the discussion on consumers being protected from tobacco ads while food companies literally target toddlers for sugar addiction?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obesity-related illnesses are some of the top causes of death in the U.S</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Heart disease is the number on vausee of death, and it is linked to diet and obesity. Cancer is #2, and there is a growing body of data linking diet and nutrition to cancer.</p>

<p>Even shootings are linked to mental health, and there is a growing body of data linking mental health to diet and nutrtion.</p>

<p>Now, show me all this discussion. Show me the heated threads on this sub where people argue the implications of a food industry that knowingly is addicting people to its products, products which result in illness, disease and death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was paraphrasing your own words to demonstrate that you are a hypocrite. I&#39;m not allowed to push the issue that concerns me (which is measurably worse and more pressing than the issue you are concerned with) and you&#39;ve dismissed me bringing it up while pushing the issue that concerns you and telling me im diminishing it.</p>

<p>Bottom line is that nutrition and obesity is the far, far more important of the two issues, and people who choose to not acknowledge that are being willfully blind/ignorant.</p>

<p>Not only that, but there is a growing body of data linking poor mental health outcomes to poor diet. So by adressing the dietary issues, you will in fact reduce shootings (linkednto mental health) as a result. So not only will you address shootings, you&#39;ll also be taking action to prevent the 400k deaths that result from the greater issue.</p>

<p>Considering that, the fact you people are so staunchly opposed to a discussion on diet/nutrition/obesity seems to indicate you aren&#39;t actually concerned with guns or a loss of life. It looks like you just use this issue as a partisan talking point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub has historically leaned more pro-gun IMO because tyrannical governments throughout history have disarmed citizens and then later heavily subjugated and imprisoned a large majority of dissenters. This sub generally views the Second Amendment and the Citizen&#39;s right to readily purchase and use firearms in order to act as a militia in the defense of the public in the case of invasion or corruption Within. I think generally the sub believes that these events are allowed to happen in different ways and institutionalized in the way this country handles Mental Health issues. There are arguments to be made about the culture of schools and the social exclusivity in the way that students with mental health issues are ostracized. Our society is mimicking the way that the State steps in and kills indiscriminately, meddling of Affairs of other countries they have conflict with. We have a culture of terrorism, so a very disenfranchised youth sees such a violent reaction in their own weird view of Justice, just as the State&#39;s reaction to conflict is to also blow away their opponent. That last part is mostly my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Historically the state also didnt have drones that can bomb the shit out of you if you uprise - no matter if you or I got a rifle or not. </p>

<p>So the idea of a threatening armed militia just isnt accurate anymore. The gap in arms is just far too wide. </p>

<p>And if we really have to stand up against tyranny I hope that the other gun owners actually know how to aim and shoot, and also know when not to shoot. All that can only be ensured with reasonable regulations. In the meantime that also helps prevent current crimes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why not? Alternatively it can also go like this: policeman comes to arrest someone, he resist by shooting the policeman, tyrannical regime can use drone to kill that dangerous individual or bomb the house alltogether. </p>

<p>The point is that the gap of modern warfare is huge. Its not rifle vs rifle anymore - let alone the difference in training, skill and money.</p>

<p>So we are atleast on the same page about who would win in a war of militia vs military.</p>

<p>If the military doesnt side with the government then we dont need the guns anyway dont we? Or have you ever felt that the gun you own did shit to keep the government in check? Me neither.</p>

<p>Even under stronger regulations any sane person could still own his gun, like many many other countries or even states do. In return there is less gun violence and less shootings and a lower chance that the one intruding in your house has a gun. Thats a win-win.</p>

<p>The idea of having an armed militia to scare the government into behaving is outdated. However having guns isnt pointless. There are more uses that are actually realistic.</p>

<p>The absolute majority are in favour of owning guns, but see that there is a problem that can be solved by not giving arms to everyone. And thats it.</p>

<p>A gun ban isnt a regulation anymore. Thats a fucking huge step.</p>

<p>That discussion is held all the time, but obviously after such an event there will be way more discussion about it. I mean they also talk way more about school shootings in general - because its relevant u know.</p>

<p>Sigh with the banning guns again. Its regulating, not banning. However even then: Regulation alcohol has worked wonders dealing with its abuse. Obviously not a straight out ban, but no one wants that anyway.</p>

<p>Not true</p>

<p>Also not true</p>

<p>Didnt the parkland school have an armed guard? However see: you also want a competency test. Thats more regulation - <em>but reasonable one</em>. Thats what people advocate. Give guns to people who are sane and can actually handle a gun. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Since you know about gun laws and statistics: No other country has so much problems with school shootings or gun violence in general. Of course its not the only problem, but you gotta deny reality when you dont see that there is a damn high chance of a connection.</p>

<p>Obviously its no solution. But it helps and makes it harder for people who want to harm - whilst not adding any unreasonable restrictions to sane people.</p>

<p>&quot;Common sense&quot; gun control laws exist as a slippery slope. The idea is to pass these laws and then when more gun violence happens, the same group who pushed for the common sense gun control laws throw up their hands and say &quot;Well we did X Y and Z and gun violence is still happening! I guess we didn&#39;t go far enough with gun control and have to pass even tougher restrictions!&quot; and the cycle continues until gun ownership is banned.</p>

<p>An example would be AR15s. Say AR15s were banned. Then someone commits a mass shooting with a glock(like Virginia Tech). The anti-gun types will say &quot;Well we banned AR15s and mass shootings still happened, I guess we have to ban all handguns now too&quot;. </p>

<p>Give an inch and they take a mile. </p>

<p>OK so when the logical fallacy of a straw man fails, you try another oldie but goodie, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope">slippery slope</a>. if any regulation at all was really the end of the world, I got news for you, the cats out of the bag. I agree with conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on this one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There Are Undoubtedly Limits To A Person’s Right To Carry Guns&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at <a href="http://wiki.calgunsfoundation.org/index.php?title=Time_Line_of_California_Firearms_Laws">California</a> and tell me that it&#39;s not a slippery slope. Just because we point out that it is one doesn&#39;t mean you can magic it away. Slippery slopes <em>do</em> exist, people just tend to use that argument without any basis. California is plenty of basis, they just keep on slipping.  </p>

<p>Also, context matters with quotes. Scalia was talking about Assault Rifles, which have a technical description (Select Fire, magazine fed rifle) and are already heavily regulated as well as heavy explosives which the same applies to.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court’s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. Miller’s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those “in common use at the time” finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Semi-Automatic rifles are definitely &quot;in common use at the time&quot; and have been for more than a century, so that quote is pointless in the current topic.</p>

Of course some will still have the drive to go through with it anyways, but those who have less may do so only if there&#39;s an &quot;easy&quot; option which guns provide to a greater degree. As gun-rights advocates keep telling me there will always be evil people, so it&#39;s better to push them toward either less dangerous tools or more complicated tools. It&#39;s all about minimizing damage, not eliminating it. </p>

<p>If people instead resort to knives there&#39;s less potential for harm as they&#39;re unable to kill as many as quickly. For instance, the same day Sandy Hook took place a guy broke into an elementary school in China but rather than having a gun like the sandy hook killer, he only had a knife. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chenpeng_Village_Primary_School_stabbing">Instead of 20 dead kids there were 23 injured kids who all survived.</a></p>

<p>Cars are dangerous as well as accessible but they&#39;re so important for everyday use (unlike guns) that it doesn&#39;t make sense making it harder for people to obtain them. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to take away your gun and I think we should take measures to improve mental health and impede big pharma but it makes sense for there to also be more intensive background checks, gun training requirements, maybe evaluative interviews before you&#39;re allowed to own such a deadly tool. </p>

<p>I bet no one checks ID if they do private porn sales either.  The truth is buying a gun is not as easy as people like you claim, and the fact that you have to quote 1960s obscenity laws to try to prove your point makes it obvious you have no idea how difficult buying a gun can actually be.  Also last I checked gun ownership is a right buying porn isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I can walk into any gun show and purchase a gun without any legal requirement to record that sale.  In fact, 80% of ATF&#39;s budget is used on putting plainclothes officers at gun shows.  The private purchase/gun show loop hole is a very real thing.</p>

<p>It specifically asked for the areas of my concern: mental illness, domestic violence, felony. The problem truly ISN&#39;T more regulation. We obviously need to enforce our current regulation, and do our due diligence in tracing those who buy guns in stores.</p>

I haven&#39;t seen a single post advocating that the government &quot;take away people&#39;s guns.&quot; The most &quot;extreme&quot; proposition I&#39;ve seen floated is a ban on assault weapons, which still wouldn&#39;t take away people&#39;s gun because it would simply stop them from being manufactured. You could still keep your old assault weapons and sell them, just you can currently do with pre-ban fully automatic weapons. But they&#39;re wouldn&#39;t be any new such weapons on the market. </p>

<p>The idea of having an armed militia to scare the government into behaving is outdated. However having guns isnt pointless. There are more uses that are actually realistic.</p>

<p>A seditious media that only entertains the discussion IMMEDIATELY after a shooting?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That discussion is held all the time, but obviously after such an event there will be way more discussion about it. I mean they also talk way more about school shootings in general - because its relevant u know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or do you mean an inept FBI, that somehow knows about all of these shooters, are in contact with them, and still manage to fuck it up?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah thats a problem. What do you suggest? 24/7 surveillance when people seem suspicious?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or my solution to violence in general? It&#39;s not like banning some rifles is going to prevent a shooting. Does anyone think it will? How did prohibition and the war on drugs turn out?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sigh with the banning guns again. Its regulating, not banning. However even then: Regulation alcohol has worked wonders dealing with its abuse. Obviously not a straight out ban, but no one wants that anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe you mean my solution to the broken families that all of these kids have in common?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not true</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No you must mean my solution to the insane amount of anti-depressants and SSRI&#39;s every shooter is inevitably on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also not true</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh no you mean my solution to gun violence in school... Educate kids and teachers about guns, and allow teachers to conceal carry pending a competency test. Ever notice that 99% of these things happen in districts w/o conceal carry?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Didnt the parkland school have an armed guard? However see: you also want a competency test. Thats more regulation - <em>but reasonable one</em>. Thats what people advocate. Give guns to people who are sane and can actually handle a gun. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>My solution is to quit the petty false-dichotomy sqwabling, and take a look at the media that propagandizes and prevents honest discussion. To scrutinize the media that talks about school shootings as if the number of deaths is a video game high score. To talk about the facts around existing gun laws. These debates quickly devolve into two sides: those familiar with gun laws and statistics, and those who want more restrictions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since you know about gun laws and statistics: No other country has so much problems with school shootings or gun violence in general. Of course its not the only problem, but you gotta deny reality when you dont see that there is a damn high chance of a connection.</p>

<p>Obviously its no solution. But it helps and makes it harder for people who want to harm - whilst not adding any unreasonable restrictions to sane people.</p>
