<p>No because it&#39;s ridiculous.  There&#39;s no &quot;tie to MAGA&quot; like you suggest...the guy wore a hat, that&#39;s all.  </p>

<p>And if you try to persuade people that somehow being a MAGApede is bad, most rational and sane people will think you&#39;re a fucking idiot.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s literally a simplistic put down on the level of &quot;Your mother wears combat boots&quot; which doesn&#39;t resonate with most adults.  It&#39;s dismissed as being juvenile, simplistic, stupid and petty.  </p>

<p>Not liking Trump and trying opposing him is one thing but this is just ridiculous.  Learn to make better arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure I would - for the same reasons listed.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s no proof that wearing this hat some how equates to mass shootings or that people associated with that movement are some how more likely to cause mass shootings.  </p>

<p>Maybe - I mean editorial discretion is always a thing and they may have reached the same conclusion I did...and quickly. </p>

<p>Also we&#39;re not watching 100% of the time so saying they&#39;re all ignoring it is just a claim with zero support.  It&#39;s more accurate to saw &quot;I haven&#39;t seen anyone cover it.&quot; </p>
