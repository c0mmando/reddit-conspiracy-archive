        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I hope that this post is allowed and doesn’t come across as me attempting to “gotcha” anyone. It’s just a point that I don’t fully understand when trying to place myself in the worldview of those who think all these mass shootings are an attempt by the deep state, or the left, or whoever it may be to steal the 2nd amendment away from Americans. </p>

<p>So defenders of said amendment claim it is there to protect against the tyranny of government. That it allows them to fight back should the government try to impose authoritarian rules, or take our liberties, yes?</p>

<p>Why then have you not taken up arms already against them? It seems, according to this particular line of thinking, they are already stealing your liberties (surveillance, mind control drugs, take your guns, etc). Are these not the liberties you’re supposed to be able to take up arms against?</p>

<p>Idk, if someone could just explain that to me with a bit more nuanced, I think I would understand the position a bit more. Thanks </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well....I’ll have to disagree there. I’m assuming you’re refering to God when you say our creator? Where did god say we have the untouchable right to weapons? If god is the only one able to make amendments to our constitution why have we made amendments to it before? I’m sure god didn’t tell us to ban alcohol then in-ban it?</p>

<p>I find the other responses to this thread much more reasonable than yours, personally. Sorry if I don’t understand your logic and that you don’t seem to get that god afforded us no “rights” other than the 1 in millions chance to be the lucky sperm that got to the egg first. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No the constitution states the rights come from. You creator not the government. You can believe or not believe in God I do get care but the rights come from your creator. Not the government and they should take have let the government ban alcohol and they shouldnt let the government ban weed. As it isn&#39;t governments place. And neither is it to regulate my rights that ha e been given to me by my creator. You assume God I do think care what you think your creator is, chance luck.

If you took that as an insult I apologize as that was not my intent. If you feel like shutting out conversation and discourse because you don’t wish to respond please just say so, but I can assure you that saying “can you please grammar check....I’m having a difficult time following your sentence structure” is about the nicest way of bringing up misunderstanding you will ever see on the internet, especially reddit </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok look. That was the most polite thing anyone has ever said to me here so I assume I was over the top there. Look to me the constitution is just about as perfect a structure for government man will ever have, if we had followed it more closely we wouldn’t be as screwed as we are right now. But the 2nd amendment and the 1st for that matter are the corner stones of our existence in this country.  Our rights shall not be infringed! I’ve said this for years if all that left is wooden table legs people will beat each other to death with Woden table legs. So the cry for gun control solves very little. </p>

<p>The cities and states with the tightest gun control laws still have more gun deaths than the ones that don’t. Chicago is a prime case in point restrictive gun laws more gun deaths than anywhere. I truly believe that the answer isn’t less guns it’s more as people become much more polite when they might get shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for coming back more reasonably. That takes strength on the internet to say you were wrong, cause we all know damn well that almost never happens. So thanks for that. </p>

<p>I see your perspective. I really understand it honestly. Where we come to a disagreement is the “god said these rights are yours”, your wooden table legs (while I see what you’re saying, I’d be much happier trying to escape someone with a table leg or meat cleaver than a rifle that can hit me with ease 400 yards away), and Chicago. Even Chicago itself admits that the issue isn’t their laws it’s that the laws around the city are so lax and they have no way to restrict the entrance of guns. </p>

<p>But I certainly see your points. Thanks for the response and you’ve given me some points to think about, which was the purpose of my creating this post. </p>

But if I have to I hope I can defend someone that hasn’t chosen to exercise that right. I respect your opinions.  And I want both sides to get where the other is coming from. I have said this to people in the past as well, if your grandmothers as being mugged and I as a responsible gun owner could help her would you want me to? If no then ok. But I can tell you this, I would help her if I could. Or anyone. That is why I have mine. Not because I live in fear but as a force multiplier to help me, my family and anyone in trouble that I encounter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very understandable viewpoint. And I would want you to help her, though I have to saw I would rather you help her without drawing your gun. I’d much rather my grandmother lose her purse and get punched in the face a few times than get unintentionally shot by you, no offense. Police hit (I’ll have to google this to be exact but his number is relatively accurate) their target with 17% of their rounds fired in an actual situation. I trust the police are better trained than you and they already can barely hit shit. No offense to you at all but I wouldn’t trust you and your 1911 to not hit my grandmother. </p>

<p>Listen, you fantastically retarded motherfuckers. I’m going to try to explain this so that you can understand it.</p>

<p>You cannot control an entire country and its people with tanks, jets, battleships and drones or any of these things that you so stupidly believe trumps citizen ownership of firearms. </p>

<p>A fighter jet, tank, drone, battleship or whatever cannot stand on street corners and enforce “no assembly” edicts. A fighter jet cannot kick down your door at 3AM and search your house for contraband. </p>

<p>None of these things can maintain the needed police state to completely subjugate and enslave the people of a nation. Those weapons are for decimating, flattening and glassing large areas and many people at once and fighting other state militaries. The government does not want to kill all of its people and blow up its own infrastructure. These are the very things they need to be tyrannical assholes in the first place. If they decided to turn everything outside of Washington D.C. into glowing green glass they would be the absolute rulers of a big, worthless, radioactive pile of shit. </p>

<p>Police are needed to maintain a police state, boots on the ground. And no matter how many police you have on the ground they will always be vastly outnumbered by civilians which is why in a police state it is vital that your police have automatic weapons while the people have nothing but their limp dicks.</p>

<p>BUT when every random pedestrian could have a Glock in their waistband and every random homeowner an AR-15 all of that goes out the fucking window because now the police are out numbered and face the reality of bullets coming back at them.</p>

<p>If you want living breathing, examples of this look at every single insurgency that the U.S. military has tried to destroy. They’re all still rolling with nothing but AK-47s, pick up trucks and improvised explosives because these big scary military monsters you keep alluding to are all but fucking useless for dealing with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you from the US or from outside the US?</p>

<p>The current state of affairs is in effect because guns are in the hands of the populace.  All the tyranny you see and noted in your OP is happening even with an armed populace.</p>

<p>Imagine the tyranny without the armed populace.</p>

<p>Further, there are swaths of rural America where the armed populace is the de facto power.  The feds and cops lack the manpower (and will) to bring the tyranny to these folk, and these folk live as they see fit.</p>

<p>Urban America is where all/most the tyranny is in effect.  The cameras, the cops, the money centers, etc.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s urban America that questions the 2nd.  Rural America does not.  Further, it&#39;s usually SJWs that question the 2nd, most of the Right do not. </p>

<p>The incremental advance of tyranny is obvious to rural America, but not to urban America.  Until this viewpoint in unified, actual shooting is highly unlikely.</p>

<p>Lastly, the populace doesn&#39;t have to USE guns against the gov&#39;t to fight tyranny.  They merely have to POSSESS guns to act as a balancing force to a standing army, centralized power, etc.  It&#39;s a balance of power, not a display of power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the US. A Texan actually, oft considered a stalwart of 2nd amendment defenders and somehow the most likely to attempt to succeed (hello petition to Gov Perry a while back asking to succeed). Thanks for your response. It’s well thought out and worded, I suppose I simply just can’t wrap my head around it. My family owns plenty of guns. We range from a .22 single action revolver to AR-15 style (they’re bushmasters) hell we even have a .25 caliber pistol with a 2.5 inch barrel (funnest gun I’ve ever shot, unless you’re within about 10 feet of your target you ain’t hitting shit with that thing :) )</p>

<p>That being said I’m no defender of the 2nd. I’m also no opponent of it. I’m firmly middle ground. But I’ve just failed to see any legit encroachment on rights. But as far as your explanation as to why arms haven’t actually been taken up, I find your reasoning very....reasonable. So thanks for the response </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I bounce between the State of Jefferson (NorCal secession) and the Bay Area so I see extremes on both sides.</p>

<p>There are myriad examples in military history of an armed populace beating an occupying force.  There are very, very, few examples of an occupying force beating an armed populace (for any useful length of time).</p>

<p>Assuming tyranny from our own gov&#39;t... A frequent argument is &quot;Hunting rifles can never beat a tank.&quot;  Or jet, or similar.  But that argument is shallow.  Who drives the tank?  Does the driver have family?  Is the family part of the populace?</p>

<p>If we remove the tank driver from the populace, he is an invader, and an armed populace is useful.  Part of the reason Japan didn&#39;t attack the West Coast in WWII is an armed populace.</p>

<p>Again, balance of power.  An armed populace has the power to attract military men into the populace.  A disarmed populace would have no power to attract the military to their side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, you’re free to believe me or not. All I can do is tell you my family owns guns and I am from Texas. I can do nothing to convince you short of revealing my identity. So we’re lost there</p>

<p>Just because I haven’t seen any personal encroachments and ask I’m full of shit or haven’t paid attention? Let’s see what gun laws have been passed recently shall we?</p>

<p>An EO to ban bump stocks.....that’s....that’s it. I don’t own a bump stock, therefore I have seen no effect since that EO was signed.......yesterday......</p>

<p>Please don’t personally insult me simply because I haven’t seen effects of something you claim. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things, while bad, are not at a place of huge discomfort/infringement of rights to the point where they feel the need to rise up. If there is an attempt to either ban and/or limit who can own/carry guns, then you may see people start to lean that way. The fear is once we allow the 2nd amendment to be infringed upon, that is when the ruling class will really start to makes lives uncomfortable and they will take away even more rights. At that point, we may very well be powerless to do anything about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks for responding civilly. As I said I’m worried this topic will be seen as shrill-esque but it’s just something I’ve never understood about the 2A conspiracy.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s pretty much the gist of it. It&#39;s kind of like a domino effect. Once you left one ammendment fall, the others will come tumbling down as well. As bad as things are, there is not enough groundswell for anyone to rise up at this point in time IMO. If they try to destroy the 2nd ammendment, that could easily change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks A TON for the civil discourse sir. So if I can follow up, I can fully understand the view of “if they come for our guns shit will go south fast”. My follow up is, why no outrage at not being able to guy buy a true select fire/automatic? If our right to hear arms is truly uninfringed why can’t I go buy an M1 abrams if I have the millions to pay for it? Are your 2A rights not already heavily limited? Is this more like, you know you won’t win that fight, so you just can’t let it slip any further?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably. I&#39;m not a gun person myself but I understand the hesitation. I would imagine most gun owners would prefer no restrictions if possible but would not win that fight in the court of public opinion. Losing what rights we already have is where they draw the line.</p>

<p>On top of that is the fact that mental health is being paraded as being a reason to ban guns for certain individuals. That is a slippery slope as anyone could be declared mentally unstable for various reasons and then denied the right to bare arms. A better solution is to improve mental health services and outreach programs as well as get rid of dangerous prescription drugs that can have a tendency to make people more mentally unstable. They are attacking the ammendment vs attacking the supposed root of the problem. There are more effective ways to solve this problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the mental health thing I’m truly on the fence. I agree with you that it’s a slippery slope, and a very dangerous one at that IMO, yet I also support it (only somewhat, as I said I’m truly on the fence and I conflict myself thinking about it all the time)</p>

<p>It’s a tough issue. I, in no uncertain terms, do not want all guns banned. </p>

<p>Idk...I suppose I’m in the camp of “I have NO FUCKING CLUE what the answer is but I know whatever we’re doing right now isn’t working”. It’s saddening and frustrating and all around exhausting lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It definitely is an exhausting/frustrating topic. What is interesting to me is all the other countries that have much more lenient gun laws and less homicides/murders than the US.</p>

<p><a href="https://crimeresearch.org/2014/03/comparing-murder-rates-across-countries/">https://crimeresearch.org/2014/03/comparing-murder-rates-across-countries/</a></p>

<p>Then when you factor in mass shootings have risen dramatically once the Smith-Mundt Act was passed in 2012 that made it legal for the US to use weaponized propaganda against its citizens, it makes me believe we have a propaganda problem more so than a gun problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your first link is the most interesting one to me. I see where you’re coming from with the 2nd but quite frankly I don’t quite care as much about it to be brutally honest, but I appreciate you providing it. </p>

<p>What I find interesting about the first link is that there’s equal number of countries that have stricter gun laws with less violence than us. So clearly the answer is not “only” more guns OR less guns. Somehow we need a combination of one of those two things, as well as many other corrections. What those are? No fucking clue that’s well above my pay grade. </p>

<p>I think the one thing everyone can agree on is that no more fucking kids should be dying no matter of if it’s a false flag or crazy person, kids shouldn’t be dying, something needs to change to help this from happening. Yes?</p>
