    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a factor. But I&#39;ve seen a lot of well-researched and well-argued posts get downvoted and trolled because of politics and knee-jerk reactions. </p>

<p>It happens to a lot of posts, but the best example I&#39;ve got off-hand is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6mia1b/a_tale_of_two_chiefs_was_dc_police_chief_cathy/">one I wrote</a> last summer (archived now). I spent a whole weekend painstakingly researching MSM coverage of the Seth Rich investigation and how it basically shut down at the same time the MPD police chief resigned and was replaced. It languished at ~50% upvoted/0 karma for hours and hours before slowly climbing above 60%, never made it anywhere near the front page. </p>

<p>Why? Not because people here authentically hate conspiracy theories about police corruption and murder, surely. </p>

<p>This happens a lot. And it discourages people from putting in that kind of rigorous research and sharing it here. (I think that&#39;s probably the main goal.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll start off by saying that, in general, my views would be considered &quot;left&quot; leaning.  I am strongly against corporate corruption of the political process, deregulation, war, and Trump&#39;s cabinet full of Goldman Sachs bankers.  </p>

<p>But this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  All those same sources you provided were the absolute worst offenders when it came to parroting the &quot;official narrative&quot; of 9/11, and telling us Saddam had WMDs, and failing to inform us that the Syrian rebels we should be supporting were actually ISIS.  So you&#39;re right, I don&#39;t buy that MSM bullshit, and the zeal with which they are collectively attacking this conspiracy makes me even more suspicious.  </p>

<p>It is an unsolved murder, you can&#39;t fucking &quot;debunk&quot; an unsolved murder.  And from what I remember about Seth Rich, he was a <strong>staunch Bernie supporter.</strong>  He witnessed first-hand the DNC conspiring to destroy the campaign of their best candidate.  I also remember that some of his last posts of social media definitely had the &quot;air&quot; that he wanted to do something about it.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s unfortunate that the actions of Julian Assange helped get Trump elected, but I will always support Assange because of his exposure of the horrible crimes the US military has committed in the Middle East. and Hillary is a cunt, and was a terrible candidate, so I&#39;m glad she got exposed, also.  It is impossible to actually tell if Assange is lying, but he heavily implies that the conspiracy angle regarding Rich has some truth to it.  </p>

<p>So no, it isn&#39;t some alt-right theory, and the fact that you keep using that terminology, and the fact that you are sourcing some of the worst MSM rags around, means I&#39;m going to RES-tag you.  </p>

<p>The DNC leaks clearly exposed the DNC&#39;s collusion against Bernie, and Rich was a big-time Bernie supporter, so I would go as far to say that this is an alt-left conspiracy as much as an alt-right, though it&#39;s unfortunate I have to keep using all this inane political terminology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so the alt-either side co-opts talking points to harm the other side all the time. That doesn’t change the fact that this is a theory propagated by 99.9% alt right people with .01 of Bernie crazies jumping in. I’m favt I would love for you to point me to some alt-left sources propogating Seth Rich was murdered by Clinton. Please, do. </p>

<p>And bro, Bronson, barrack brobama, brotato chip, brosef.....I literally said I await your “but that’s the MSM!!” Response and then you come back with “but that’s the msm!!”
Cmon you gotta get more creative. Just cause you feel they’ve lied to you it’s now everything is a lie!!!! We all no there were no WMD!!! What am I supposed to source for you to convince? A random blog post written by me in my basement as my mommy makes me pizza rolls? Since I’m not the MSM will you believe it then??</p>

<p>Like really....your argument boils down to this:</p>

<p>Seth Rich was murdered
Seth Rich worked for the dnc
MSM told me it was a mugging
Seth Rich likes Bernie 
Since the msm liked Clinton, and he liked Bernie, he was flat out murdered</p>

<p>Let me ask you this one, IF he was murdered cause he hacked the dnc (generally approved theory of you guys)</p>

<p>Why the fuck didn’t this massive all controlling deep state make him just disappear of the face of the earth? Why murder him in a way that literally, due to the way it happened, lends itself to conspiracy theories? Did they think they were being smart by murdering him in a way that creates conspiracies, therefore it’s obviously not a conspiracy? This deep state sounds pretty fucking retarded in their logic if that’s their plan...if a bunch of dumbasses on the internet can figure t out then they really need to get some better conspirators in there</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it sucks that the alt-right co-opted this conspiracy for themselves. But in the end, Seth Rich&#39;s murder remains <strong>unsolved,</strong> you cannot logically &quot;debunk&quot; who murdered him when you have no idea who murdered him yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Show me Seth Rich’s suspect, murder weapon, and motive. Otherwise there is no proof. That’s the necessary proof in America.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, perhaps the single most suspicious thing about the case, which I addressed in the linked post (although it isn&#39;t the main point of that one), is how the police have withheld virtually all evidence -- not just from the public but even from third-party investigators offering their services -- despite how long the case has gone without so much as a substantive lead, let alone a suspect. That isn&#39;t normal. Withholding key evidence to protect the integrity of an ongoing investigation is one thing -- totally normal. But given that they&#39;ve said they have no suspects or leads, it makes no sense to withhold information to the extent that they have.</p>

<p>One of the most notable things they&#39;ve withheld: Rich&#39;s own words. He was reportedly &quot;very aware, very talkative&quot; when the police and paramedics arrived. According to the police report, three of the cops there were even wearing body cams that presumably would have recorded this. And yet they&#39;ve never told us even a single word about what he told them before his death some 90 minutes later. If it was a botched robbery, you&#39;d think they could corroborate that with &quot;the victim told officers his attackers tried to rob him&quot; or something.</p>

<p>Like, sure, politically motivated partisan hacks have seized on the case for ignoble reasons. Of course they would. But that doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t anything there. Conversely, I think politics is blinding a lot of people on the left to all the conspicuous red flags.</p>

<p>I&#39;m convinced that if the partisan political angle were removed (let&#39;s say if he was an employee of a chemical plant who was mysteriously murdered days before documents leaked showing that the plant was polluting the groundwater and the publisher of those leaks hinted that he was their anonymous source, but the local government that receives huge donations from the chemical plant insisted it was a botched robbery despite withholding all the evidence), everyone would see just how suspicious the case really is and it would receive the public scrutiny it deserves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay you raise some very good points. And thank you for actually explaining them. My one question is, as I to assume that each LEO and paramedic that interacted with him 1) knew who he was so therefore understood he was working for Clinton 
2) was a Clinton supporter themselves so wouldn’t want to release that Clinton or Soros or whoever had him murdered 
3) a man shot was actually talking coherently (very possible, and even likely) but was saying something so compromising to the Dems that they had to ensure it was never released
4) the attacker’s was a trained assasin, yet we’re unable to find a money trail (follow the money, always)
5) Hannity said it’s true.....anything Hannity says can be disregarded as heavily as anything any globalist or socialist or communist says if you ask me. He’s the same fucking thing on the other side of the isle</p>

<p>Now IF I’m to believe all these things, we can have a conversation starting from there. So am I too?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Re: #5, if Hannity said the sky was blue, that wouldn&#39;t make it false. Hannity&#39;s opinion factors in 0% in my assessment. To me, it&#39;s just as irrational to assume something is false because he says it as to assume something is true because he says it. He just says whatever is politically convenient. That includes both truth and lies, depending on what&#39;s in his interest at the time.</p>

<p>Re: #4, that&#39;s IMO the strongest criticism of the Seth Rich conspiracy theory. If it was a political hit, it&#39;s bizarre they would leave him alive and talking. There are a few plausible explanations for this, however. My preferred interpretation is that perhaps what happened wasn&#39;t a &quot;botched robbery&quot;, but closer to a &quot;botched abduction&quot;, or some other attempt to intimidate or interrogate gone awry. e.g., perhaps he was suspected of leaking and they wanted to know who his accomplices were or what material he leaked so they could prepare for the fallout. But then maybe he struggled, broke free, and ran for it, and they panicked and shot him in the back before bolting. That would explain his injuries as they&#39;ve been described in the media: bruises on his face, knees, and hands/knuckles, but two shots in the back. I always found those injuries difficult to reconcile with a &quot;botched robbery&quot;, since you&#39;d think they would <em>lead</em> with threatening with the gun and maybe accidentally shoot him in the front during a struggle if he fought, not shoot him in the back after a struggle that caused injuries to his front. </p>

<p>Re: 1 through 3, I&#39;m not sure those assumptions are necessary. If their boss didn&#39;t want them talking to the press about the case, and they valued their jobs, they wouldn&#39;t talk. As for the plausibility of their boss shutting them down, I&#39;ll refer you to my long-ass post linked above. That said, a month after I wrote that post, Rod Wheeler did name Detective Joey DellaCamera as his source who told him the police were &quot;told to stand down&quot; on the case, and Ed Butowsky said on CNN that DellaCamera wanted to come forward as a whistleblower about the case. Bizarrely, I&#39;ve never been able to find a single article that ever even said they attempted to get a statement from DellaCamera about that allegation. I don&#39;t find either Wheeler or Butowsky to be particularly credible, but it&#39;s strange to me that their inflammatory claims about an alleged police whistleblower have never been followed up on. Seems like the claim just got memory-holed, along with the secret recording of Seymour Hersh...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so on your responses in order</p>

<p>1) fair enough Hannity is irrelevant. But him pushing this theory that hurts Clinton seems...as you said politically relevant, and it’s strange that ONLY the right wing would push the ONLY narrative that hurts their opponent</p>

<p>2) botched abduction is interesting definitely. To be honest I hadn’t heard that train of thought before. I’d only counter with, one could just as easily be shot in the back with a botched robbery as a botched abduction. Pretty simple 1-2 step for either scenario, man pulls a gun on you, you run, you get shot. Either is equally as likely. But that’s something I hadn’t considered so I’ll try to find some articles that explain that and further educate myself on that possibility. </p>

<p>On your last response to points 1-3.....if the whistleblower wanted to blow their whistle and was suppressed, we’d either have a large paper trail leading somewhere or a dead body, especially considering the oft cited “Clinton body count” and yet we have neither as far as I’m aware?</p>

<p>They&#39;d have to be pretty stupid or pretty desperate to kill him IMO, since that would seriously fan the flames of the conspiracy theory. As for whether there&#39;s a paper trail, how would we know? They&#39;re already withholding every bit of documentation about the murder requested by members of the public on the grounds that it&#39;s an open investigation. And there are probably countless ways he could have been compelled to drop the issue, both carrot and stick, without leaving an explicit paper trail about it. </p>

<p>Or maybe they&#39;re just biding their time. My biggest fear re: the Seth Rich case is that the Trump administration might have the FBI evidence Seymour Hersh described showing that Rich was a WikiLeaks source, but they&#39;re just waiting until right before the midterms to discredit a major aspect of the Mueller investigation and implicate the DNC in covering up a murder in on fell swoop. That would be devastating. I&#39;m all for the truth coming out -- I just hate the fact that it&#39;s been hyperpoliticized both by people trying to bury it and by people looking to exploit it....</p>

<p>You would think. But there are loads of possibilities. Maybe he even had more damning info they prevented from being submitted. Or maybe, like I suggested above, they intended only to interrogate him for info but it went wrong. Or plenty of other possibilities, who knows. The number of unanswered questions is kind of overwhelming.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Also a good question. WikiLeaks did come out and say they suspected (but could not prove) that Aaron Swartz was a WikiLeaks source after his untimely death. But maybe they&#39;re worried about protecting accomplices, or maybe they aren&#39;t sure who the source was but are concerned based on whatever info they have that it could have been Rich. All speculation on my part, though. </p>

<p>I agree, but then we (I assume you too!) aren&#39;t the highly paid political consultants who tend to determine this sort of thing. They&#39;re all about timing out this shit for political advantage. Sigh.</p>

If the priority of the police was actually finding Rich&#39;s killer, though, I don&#39;t see why they wouldn&#39;t accept the free help after so long without a lead. Do politics trump pursuit of justice here? And if the evidence exists to actually <em>debunk</em> the conspiracy theories, let&#39;s see it! Fuck, that would be a huge relief for me.

1) obvious and no one disputes, correct?</p>

<p>2) just as easily fits the mugging gone wrong (he ran, gunner shot, gunner got scared and ran after killing someone) as it does the assasination narrative, right?</p>

<p>3) drunk dude...I take long as fuck to walk home when I’m hammered, I know, hyperbolic. Also if this was some assassination....why would they make that part of the facts? Like that’s irrelevant to an assasination attempt unless you’re now suggesting they kidnapped his drunk ass and interrogated him? Cause that would certainly be plausible under this theory but otherwise it’s just a factoid of a drunk ass being a drunk ass</p>

<p>4) yes.....I see no relevance to that being an assasination in fact if it was one they would not want to leave him alive at all they would shoot him (like they did) then walk up and put one in his skull for good measure</p>

<p>5) yes...also don’t see how that’s relevant to an assasination attempt, in fact that would argue against it cause he would likely say “THEY were trying to murder me!! This damn Clinton’s!! They New I did it! Don’t let them get away with it!”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>see, it&#39;s nice to have some common ground to work from. I&#39;ll try to address some of your points as i walk through some of the weirdness, that may or may not be just coincidence.</p>

<p>1 revolves around him being in a position with access to the kind of information Wikileaks released on July 22, 2016, while heavily hinting at him being the source. Bleeding into #4, Seth&#39;s murder happened 12 days prior to the release.  </p>

<p>The robbery angle is plausible, but he would have had multiple chances to steal his stuff but they didn&#39;t. a robber wants cash, and seth showed bruising consistent with a physical struggle, close enough to where a robber could have potentially gotten what he wanted. </p>

<p>it&#39;s claimed Seth rarely drank, and told a friend he had to go somewhere when he left the bar that night. He talked to his gf for almost 2 hours between two calls, with a break inbetween. the idea is he handed off the leak data somewhere during that walk.</p>

<p>4 does seem counter intuitive if the goal was assassination, but it&#39;s not like they would want to broadcast it like a bullet to the dome would suggest. As long as he was defacto detained by his injuries they could build the story and close the curtain with an alibi. I have no idea how common his post-shot state is, but it feels like he&#39;d been drugged, the scenario that seems the most plausible to me is</p>

<p>He leaves the bar after cryptically having somewhere to go, possibly with very important information, or that he&#39;s expecting a confrontation. He either walks around to make a delivery or just to buy to time and avoid someone waiting around for him. when he&#39;s finally about home, he hangs up on his gf rather suddenly, but not in a way that was alarmed. like he&#39;d seen someone he knows in his path. he was confronted about the leaks, not considering the great lengths they&#39;d go to keep this secret. He was probably taken off guard by multiple agents, but struggled until they drugged him with something, then shooting him as either pretense or when he got free temporarily.  No idea if they actually got any thing out of him but i imagine they did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See now THIS is why I come to this sub, I only believe in one conspiracy (JFK was shady as fuck, still not sure exactly what I believe with it though) but I come here to learn about others with well though out posts with reasonable logic. Not some bullshit meme with arrows photoshopped on it as “proof”. So THANK YOU. I don’t agree always, but this ALLOWS for discussion for each of us to be open to new facts/ideas/LOGIC(theories). And this is a logical theory.</p>

<p>So I must say your train of thought is VERY reasonable, hell even very plausible. Now don’t call me a shill, but I just simply but the “evil MSM” story on this. It just seems MORE plausible to me. But I thank you for giving me things to consider and genuinely forcing me to at least view this from a different angle. </p>

<p>My only follow ups would be:
1) what was this information they were after? If they didn’t get it they must’ve had a slight idea of what they were after at least, yes? If they did get it, it would’ve certainly AT MINIMUM been given to assange to release assuming they wouldn’t release it themselves no?</p>

<p>2) if he was drugged and/or shot after being drugged, this would certainly come out when the autopsy will be undeniably FOIA-d in a few years so we will no definitively then yes? Unless we’re under the impression that the autopsy is faked as well then both believers and non believers are at a crossroads with a light that will never turn green and at that point this entire debate is pointless right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is where i&#39;m having the most trouble, because there&#39;s one more connection that elevates this whole thing as a plot as nebulous as Russialago, but it&#39;s fuckin&#39; all circumstantial at best. So, between let&#39;s say option &quot;A&quot;, that basically connects back to every major conspiracy born in the last few years, option &quot;B&quot; only requires a gungho moron. Seth could&#39;ve called his bluff after being threatened and ended up bust, or the shot was accidental and snowballed somehow. It&#39;s his behavior with the first responders that doesn&#39;t make any fucking sense. if it&#39;s a drug it requires resources and research, both of which require wealth and influence. That one piece makes everything feel like the super nebulous &quot;A&quot;. Another god damn circumstance.</p>

<p>But honestly, you&#39;re right that all this will mostly be pointless. Seeing actual justice for Seth is just plain unrealistic, and it&#39;s far to easy to co-opt these theories so they either push a political agenda or become fuckin wacky beyond the pale.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a damn good critical thinking exercise at the very least, and maybe we all look a little less nutty in the process.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm, so not to get pedantic, but the alt right attempts to frame the Rich murder as organized by the clintons was not a conspiracy. It was using the murder of a DNC staffer to hurt clinton’s Poll numbers. Not a conspiracy but a misinformation or propoganda campaign. Now if you wouldn’t mind, on a slightly separate note and to get pedantic again, is it “peddling” if I’m agreeing to the satanic MSM version? And if you would like proof: please just google Seth Rich murder and read like literally any article. If it’s not from an alt right source or Hannity it’s probably discusses the bullshit they have peddled. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you just described is literally the definition of a conspiracy. a secret plan (blame murder on Clinton) by a group (alt right) to do something unlawful or harmful (hurt Clinton in polls) </p>

<p>I understand that you probably associate the term conspiracy with a negative connotation due to its use to dismiss certain theories as crazy, I am not using it in this way however. </p>

<p>You are not agreeing with the main stream media narrative though, the mainstream is made up of both sides of the fence (Hannity is MSM) you are agreeing with the version of the story that makes the most sense to you based on the information you are being presented, as we all do. </p>

<p>However, I would like to point out that it may be possible that you are viewing the source you choose to get your news from is just as biased and dedicated to pushing an agenda as you claim the alt right are, and in fact you will most likely find that your views are just as ridiculous to those who watch that version of the news as there&#39;s is to you. </p>

<p>As I said, I would be very interested in seeing the proof you have to back up your claims. This is not a challange, I am genuinely interested in seeing it! :)</p>

<p>Now to just skip ahead of me throwing random, what I consider evidence and what you consider MSM bullshit, articles at you, let me ask you this. What would be, in your eyes, irrefutable proof? Because I have a feeling we won’t be able to reach that until the still ongoing investigation is concluded.

    <div class="md"><p>That is exactly how its applied on this sub, i beleive what you are failing to take into account is the &quot;theory&quot; side of things. Of course when you have people coming up with theories its going to be a mixed bag. You claiming that 98% of companies are full on conspirators  (I know you were joking by the way haha) would be seen as a theory. A theory should be judged by the weight of evidence that supports it. </p>

<p>You are claiming that the alt right is responsible for manufacturing the Seth Rich story to further a political agenda. You have yet to provide any evidence to back this up. As I said, I am not trying to argue with you, just asking you to back up the claims you are making. </p>

<p>The Seth Rich case is tricky, it became extremely distorted due to the politics surrounding the case and there is a ton of disinformation and circumstantial evidence that one must pick through. </p>

<p>I am not even that educated on the topic however as far as I know no information exists to definitively support either sides claim, if you can share with me something to change that I would be more than happy to change my view on the subject. However I would appreciate you keep in mind that the pendulum swings both ways and remember that one mans Fox is another mans CNN, and both have extremely poor track records when it comes to telling the truth. </p>

The fact of the matter is that every legitimate sight/source/outlet has said this was a robbery/mugging gone wrong. The only ones claiming it was a hit job are right wings that would love to see Hillary arrested despite the fact that she is no longer relevant. I will not provide evidence in this post as I have previously posted it. Besides, as I say often, the burden of proof for the conspiracy theorist is on them, not the “accepted narrative” so unless you have proof other than he worked for Hillary and died and “that darn podesta” this theory has been fully debunked to the fullest extent possible until the investigation is released, and nothing will change your mind.

<p>What you posted though substantiated to not much, Fox news definitely sensationalized the story and politicized it, as I said the waters are extremely muddy. The articles you provided are written in a way that attempts to generalize and discredit the facts surrounding the case but they do not offer any solid proof to back up their claims. </p>

<p>The Seth Rich murder is a mystery, the Wikipedia article you linked is abhorrent. Its filled with &quot;facts&quot; that have actually been long proven to be nothing of the sort and fails to give an honest summery of the case. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t know what happened, but claiming this was &#39;definitely 100% without a doubt a botched robbery&#39; is still just as much a Seth Rich Conspiracy theory as Hillary Clinton killing seth to appease Satan. </p>

<p>Then I’ll reciprocate by pointing out your bullshit websites and blog posts by saying something along the lines of “they were written in a way that attempts to generalize and discredit the facts surrounding the case” and “not offer any solid proof of their claims”</p>

<p>Idk if you’ve noticed but 99.9% of conspiracies don’t offer “any solid proof”. So we’re down to what a person believes. If you don’t blelieve my sources you’re welcome not too.

<p>Because these pathetic beings are trying everything they can to cover up this fucking mess and they can&#39;t fucking combat it.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a shill, I&#39;m a 49 year old father of two who joined this sub about three weeks ago because I found it was somewhere I could argue the subject of 9/11 (I&#39;m a believer in the demolition theory) without being shot down by a host of idiots who haven&#39;t given it a moment&#39;s thought. Also a UFO enthusiast as a matter of fact, I&#39;ve had a crop circle tattooed on my shoulder since about 1999. But I am not aware, in the time I&#39;ve spent browsing random threads, of any subject that has been successfully shot down by skeptics. So for the last time, if you please, could you give me an example of one that has??? Thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see comments like this all the time. The question I have is why you would think that those sort of conspiracies wouldn&#39;t have an effect on our political system. Most of the theories pre election were extremely cabalistic and against the mainstream system including media, Hollywood, religion, and most popular belief. A big of being a conspiracy theory using critical thinking of see the interconnectedness of all things. If there conspiracies you are talking about were true there would be people who would know about it in our government.</p>

<p>In fact my theory I have shared for a long time is that there has been hidden knowledge passed down through ancient secret societies that exists today in the Vatican. Another place this knowledge exists that people do not realize it exists in a separate secret society in the Eastern Orthodox Church. The sacking of Alexandria and it&#39;s library which contained this information was massive in the Grand scheme of things.</p>

<p>How one can somehow think that this deep State&quot; vs Trump war is something that has nothing todo with these other theories makes 0 sense to me at all. Unless they don&#39;t really believe the theories they are spreading and are just trying to be hipster...</p>

My point is that let&#39;s assume that Aliens exist and have contacted humanity in some form or another. The government or at least people in power would have to be the ones who know about this and covered it up right? And by extension they know whatever the aliens told them which means that they are at a different level of knowledge than the public thus that they do in public may actually be a cover for things below the surface making simple political events that much more important.</p>

<p>100% agree.  The current crisis actor idea is the perfect self-perpetuating meme to discredit conspiracy theorists, anyone can see that.  This sub is part of that industry you describe.  There is still entertaining and interesting stuff here, or I wouldn’t bother at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>first want to echo u/jubway. If claims can&#39;t stand up to scrutiny, then they shouldn&#39;t be propagated. Criticism is good. Calling out people for being skeptical breeds dogmatism, and dogmatism generally breeds stagnation and moral bankruptcy. </p>

<p>Second, look at the state of american politics. Truth is increasingly irrelevant. Things are (especially for the republicans as far as I can tell) increasingly conspiratorial. A bunch of americans believe putin or assange are champions of truth! A bunch believe that american institutions including the media are wings of a shadowy unidentifiable rogue government that hire crisis actors to fake school shootings and rig elections. If you don&#39;t like what someone says, just say its fake. Just call them fake news. Just disagree. Even if their evidence is better. Even if their evidence is playing a tape recording of something you yourself said 2 minutes ago, just call them fake. They are part of the conspiracy. </p>

<p>This sort of disposition is no longer marginal. It is the disposition of a large chunk of mainstream republicans at the moment (turn on hannity and see it). It is the disposition of the POTUS. It is a disposition that contributed to the election of this president, and a disposition that has people trying to discredit mueller and ignore or avoid or even facilitate serious dangers to american democracy, one that promotes anti-intellectualism in general, anti-science, short-term policy decisions... and the eventual ramifications of this rising mainstream conspiratorial disposition is unclear but it is surely, for many, a matter of concern.</p>

<p>Those who aren&#39;t particularly conspiratorial are increasingly exposed to conspiracies. Those who think that the possible ramifications of the mainstream conspiratorial disposition are undesirable may consider it worthwhile to challenge this way of thinking. More people come to r/conspiracy who aren&#39;t conspiratorial because conspiracies are no longer interesting inconsequential puzzles. They have real world consequences, and to many, this way of thinking needs to be reigned in, because look what the result has been. And who knows how bad things could get.</p>

<p>Why are they posting the theory if not to see what people believe?</p>

<p>I thought that was the point of the subreddit. Someone explains why they think the moon landings were faked, and then people discuss why they agree or disagree and provide some evidence. Some conspiracies will have more agreement than others, some will have more disagreement than others.</p>

<p>Too many people seem to be saying &quot;If you think we really landed on the moon then don&#39;t come to this subreddit!&quot; when that isn&#39;t at all what the mods or community wants.</p>

<p>Indeed. A lot of the regulars of this sub can be fairly described as &#39;believers&#39;: people who <em>want</em> their beliefs to be true.</p>

<p>They are <strong>subjective</strong> thinkers, not <strong>objective</strong> thinkers.</p>

Get help.&quot;; then receiving 100 upvotes. <sup>sorry</sup> <sup>for</sup> <sup>the</sup> <sup>run</sup> <sup>on</sup> <sup>I</sup> <sup>dont</sup> <sup>feel</sup> <sup>like</sup> <sup>fixing</sup> <sup>it</sup></p>

<p>The free content he does have just shows that his beliefs are rooted in ignorance and stupidity. He has a very limited science education and isn’t very bright so he seems any science he does not understand as fake. </p>

<p>Check his post history, he does not debate in good faith. He moves goal posts, demands impossible proof and is incredibly smug about it all. He is as far as I can tell a shill for his own paid content, an ass, and a poster boy for the dunning Kruger effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think it&#39;s possible to believe in conspiracies generally but find many specific conspiracies questionable or not believable?</p>

<p>Personally I&#39;m more inclined to believe that there are many small conspiracies, mostly political or economic, and that larger conspiracies are mostly an uncontrolled emergent phenomenon arising from the overlapping interests of people who benefit from small conspiracies.</p>

<p>For example, banking and finance is a conspiracy, but not because a group of Jews/Illuminati/Windsors sit around in an oak paneled room and make deals to control the money supply but because smaller groups of specific bankers conspire in small ways for personal enrichment.  It ends up appearing to be larger conspiracy but only because the small groups have some common interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While they do end up being the theories that have a high chance of being legitimate, it feels like we are now just in the shallow end of the pool, so to speak.  corruption, greed, pedophilia, trafficking (drugs, humans, weapons), plots to overthrow governments, opiates, etc.  Things that we have seen our own governments and other governments do yet we as citizens can see proof of.  Governments get caught all the time, just rarely punished for it (generalized statement).  That is what conspiracy theories should be about, but I feel that the community as a whole is starting to narrow itself too far.  </p>

<p>We don&#39;t get a lot of &quot;out there even for us&quot; posts any more.  Things that you would entertain the idea of, knowing that it is probably outside the realm of reality, but you dig into it to see if there is anything tangible that could lead to something more legitimate.  MKUltra is a good example of that.</p>

<p>The Hogg crises actor story for example; it started on 4chan and moved to T_D and now here. Any new twist on the ongoing theory that the FBI is in the tank for the deep state another.</p>

<p>We were having a good discussion until this. I&#39;m not even saying the theory is untrue, I am just noting when I first saw the story pop up. T_D threads usually link into 4chan /pol/ posts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7xnn6q/david_hogg_on_ingram_angle_is_definitely_a_plant/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7xnn6q/david_hogg_on_ingram_angle_is_definitely_a_plant/</a></p>

<p>Definitely not 15 minutes after the shooting...</p>

<p>So it doesn&#39;t really contradict what I was saying. At that point it is just people asserting their feelings without real evidence.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m not sure why my statement T_D types push this story made you check out; because you buy into it?</p>

<p>Just because you agree doesn&#39;t change the fact this theory, pizzagate, the deepstate narrative, and more is pushed by those on the right harder.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe the school is a false attack. I would be more willing to accept it was allowed to happen, but I don&#39;t believe a school full of people and their families can keep a secret even under threat.</p>

<p>As for him being an actor, I mean he has stated himself he wants to be a newscaster. I won&#39;t deny there is probably some element of him hoping or being offered time and fame for his words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but unlikely.  Especially considering that the tone of the whole sub shifts instantly.  Population will rise and fall more or less continuously if it&#39;s because of content hitting the front page.  </p>

<p>Also, that doesn&#39;t explain why the sub&#39;s baseline population increased by 700 overnight.  I mean, I&#39;d love to believe that 50% more people are waking up, but that seems unlikely too.</p>

I don’t generally agree with nearly every conspiracy I’ve come across on here.

So I am very contrarian to most ideas on here, yet far from a paid shill (never been called a shill until I reached this sub). </p>

<p>It’s possible, IMO, that recent political climates have cause a large and rapid increase in visitors to this sub, and many that don’t really align with much of the thinking that goes on here, such as myself </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Active users is highly dependent on real world conditions. Sure, I can easily believe 1k users coming online within a few minutes over lunch time or on the train/bus home from work/school. And it&#39;s also dependent on if something is rising quickly (reaching <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>), as soon as something reaches <a href="/r/all/top">/r/all/top</a>, a bunch of users come into the thread&#39;s comments. Other subs experience this phenomena (<a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> user bump).</p>

<p>Am I saying there aren&#39;t brigading efforts by red/blue caps? No, I&#39;m simply saying an increase in active users is normal with sub # increases, and active user bumps could be explained either by real world timings or certain posts reaching <a href="/r/all/top">/r/all/top</a>.</p>

<p>They have no real principles.  They are not interested in defending their convictions, only Daddy Donald himself. And Defending Trump is a political, corporate, and government interest. </p>

<p>Moreover, just look at their sub to see they have no intention to debate people in good faith. They call anyone who dissents against  Dear Leader a cuck, retard, autistic, or other nonsense like &quot;virtue signaller&quot;. They have mental mechanisms to always fall back on once they&#39;ve run out of talking points. </p>

Then the &quot;true believers&quot; pick up on it and seem to declare that it just has to be true.

<p>The OP is implying that if you &quot;believe in conspiracies&quot; then you should believe in ALL of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that&#39;s not at all what was implied. Let&#39;s refer again to the analogy. OP is not implying you should like all teams that play soccer, but he is implying if you&#39;re shouting about how soccer sucks, you don&#39;t actually like soccer. It&#39;s literally right there in the title of the post, and you keep trying to redefine what it means to fit your own prejudice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One can believe in real conspiracies like Love Canal, and see things like pizzagate for the garbage they are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. People can also believe in pizzagate because they think it is a valid theory. Good try there, though. Seeing things like pizzagate &quot;as garbage&quot; is different than making sure people don&#39;t discuss it. Intentionally misrepresenting someones post in the very same comment thread is different than pointing out inconsistencies. Calling something garbage is different than pointing out inconsistencies. Read OPs post again, it seems you didn&#39;t fully understand it the first time.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, we all want to discuss the truth and find out the truth. People coming here and spouting the same few phrases that equate to &quot;you&#39;re an idiot for discussing that!&quot; is not discussing and finding the truth.</p>

<p>Maybe I misread the OP, but I thought my analogy was fitting.  The OP seems to be whining that all conspiracies are not immediately accepted as plausible on this forum hence his analogy to someone who hates the entire sport of soccer posting in r/soccer. Hence my analogy that there can be someone there who likes soccer, just not the same you like.</p>

<p>Exactly my point, I don&#39;t think there is anyone who believes there are no conspiracies ever, at all.  Which would be the equivalent to hating all soccer.</p>

<p>Here I agree with you.  All conspiracies should be discussed here, even outlandish ones.  But I would argue that people coming here and spouting the same phrases like &quot;Your a shill for XYZ&quot; or other dismissing of those who don&#39;t agree with their pet theory is also not finding or looking for the truth.</p>

<p>....what. If you like other forms of soccer, again, why go to the r/soccer subreddit. Go to r/football or whatever the hell you&#39;re even implying by that statement. Again, that&#39;s not at all what he implied.</p>

<p>You keep referring to this shit to fit the goalposts. What do you even mean by &quot;all soccer&quot;. What is not &quot;the same&quot; soccer?  He made a clear analogy, and you&#39;re muddying it to fit your own stupid bias. You&#39;re like Cenk Ogre who will completely misrepresent what someone JUST said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I unsubscribed recently. I’m open to consider many theories but recently it’s been shit. Literally 99% of this sub now is just people from the right who think they are “thinking critically”. Not everything against the government, against media, or against cooperation is a valid conspiracy theory that should be considered. You could literally post an anti-hilary link on this sub that isn’t even a conspiracy and still get upvoted. I’m not even liberal on a lot of issues, but I’m also completely conservative. </p>

<p>This sub isn’t like <a href="/r/soccer">/r/soccer</a> where it’s all inclusive no matter what club you support. It’s more like the real madrid subreddit where if you post anything making fun of barca you’ll get upvoted. </p>

<p>80% of supporters of this subreddit at its current state clearly have political biases. You guys really think all your theories are derived from logical deductions, and not from any political biases at all? How does every theory I see basically support your political opinion? Your political leaning just happens to be the side with less bullshit? </p>

I&#39;ve been posting here for a long time, and I&#39;ve always espoused a view that is seen as &quot;left-wing.&quot;  I&#39;m against the corporate overlords, lobbying, deregulation and destroying the environment, I think most libertarian views are silly especially living in a country with amazing public healthcare, and I&#39;m against all war, no matter what.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always felt like my opinions get a good amount of support in this sub.  There was a wave of T_Ders here for a while, but they all look like idiots now, considering Trump stocked the swamp with bankers and neocons.  </p>

<p>The <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community was catalyzed through a resistance to GWB-era policies and perpetual war that became so apparent in the early 2000s, I think that core of people are still here.  Yeah, it sucks that we are still talking about Hillary, and cringey pro-Trump articles get upvoted sometimes, but with the state of the world today and it&#39;s rampant corruption, there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to give up on this community.</p>

<p>Just because we don&#39;t agree with every article/theory posted, doesn&#39;t mean &quot;80% of this sub does not believe in conspiracies&quot;. This is moronic. It isn&#39;t a black and white issue, you don&#39;t &#39;believe&#39; in every theory or none, there&#39;s a <em>HUGE</em> grey middle ground. I think 9/11 was orchestrated by SA and the Bush administration to such an extent to justify war in Afghanistan and Iraq, but that doesn&#39;t mean I believe con-trails are all weather manipulation by the air force. I think Mueller&#39;s investigation is onto something (money laundering) with Trump and Co. but that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t think HRC and the DNC tried to pull a fast one on last election and used dirty (illegal?) tactics in the 2016 election.</p>

<p>Obviously not? Top comments: 170, 126, 82, 51, 44, etc. Didn&#39;t you just say the vote totals were the same? Even the child comments are different counts. JFC it&#39;s like talking to a child.</p>

<p>My point being, conspiracy theories are not all equal. If you find your favorite theory getting downvoted into oblivion, consider the possibility that your theory is not well supported by your evidence.  Don’t just automatically blame it on other users being unfair. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think the point of these multiple daily posts is to get people to believe that the people who disagree with them must be shills. theres literally no reason to whine this fucking much.</p>

<p>Shills come from a place of dishonesty. they are lying. its in the job description. nobody needs to pay anyone to tell the truth as best they know it, it happens naturally. This means that shills can be debated and stfu. when they resort to ad hominem, shill calling, and attempts to inflame youve won and people will see that. im not worried about shills because their arguments have nothing to stand on</p>

<p>Agreed. But you have to admit that Obama was good at supplying the enemies of ISIS with weapons and materials to fight off ISIS. </p>

<p>Plus they lost two strong holds under Obama. Majority of Trumps decrease of their territory came from them retreating trough hundreds of miles of desserts with no place for a stronghold. </p>

<p>Pick a side damning </p>

<p>“Most of ISIS defeat came from ASAD”</p>

<p>Yeah thank god Obama gave them the weapons and supplies to do so </p>

<p>“Yeah that was fucking stupid. What a horrible thing to happen”</p>

<p>Which is it. Is it good ISIS was defeated or is it bad? I’m confused which one you’re arguing. </p>

<p>We are going to be talking in circles now as you give all the credit to Assad and then when I bring up that Obama helped him with supplies you’ll say it was bad that Assad uses those supplies to defeat ISIS. </p>

<p>Then rinse and repeat. Am I right? </p>

<p>My side is do NOT give weapons to rebel groups because we like them more than other groups. Especially when Islam is involved </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we armed Assad, we armed rebels fighting Assad and ISIS. Regardless the statement is not contradictory, it&#39;s good Assad is beating off ISIS but that does not mean we should fund them </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is perfect! I haven’t been frequenting as much bc I feel like there isn’t an honest debate. For example I get it, if you want to debate Sandy Hook that is legitimately something worth debating. It takes some faith on both sides to figure out what happened that day because the truth is there are documents typically released in these tragedies that NO ONE has seen. So I would understand someone being offended by the “Dear Wolfgang” crowd. But if you consistently come here and give nothing other than the official narrative for every event that happened then I am sorry but maybe this sub isn’t for you. There are those that post the most outlandish posts elsewhere and that brings trolls, which is unavoidable and understandable. But to “sincere official narrative” guy, bro there’s news, world news, science lol, you know like places where you tend to not see alien stuff until John Podesta says let’s start talking about it’s ok now guys. 😉</p>

<p>I usually post here to point out obvious bullshit or go against the circlejerk with an alternative explanation. If there&#39;s another theory that&#39;s not as far-fetched as &quot;he killed children to gain youth&quot;, I&#39;d post it. That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t believe in conspiracies - I&#39;m just not convinced everything is one, if there are other, more reasonable explanations (maybe with more evidence, even).</p>

<p>OP formulated this post incorrectly, it should read: &#39;a large share of the people in this sub do not believe in 80% of the conspiracies&#39; </p>

<p>Even the analogy is not really fair. I would compare conspiracies to soccer teams, most people dislike the soccer teams that are fighting their own, just like with conspiracies. People with a marxist  worldview will always have different conspiracy theories than people with a realist liberal/libertarian worldview. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really believe that at all. I think it&#39;s very rare in this sub that an OP presents well sourced material for us all to come to a conclusion, regarding whatever the topic is. Shouldn&#39;t we all be more objective here? Don&#39;t get me wrong, when I first started researching &quot;fringe&quot; topics I&#39;m not going to sit here and say I wasn&#39;t gullible. These days I dig into a subject until I can&#39;t dig anymore. It&#39;s really the only way we&#39;re going to get to the truth.
The way I look at it is if, you can prove one conspiracy as a truth, then the other accusations shouldn&#39;t be taken lightly. That being said, we should all be open to the fact that a ton of conspiracies may not be what you think. That&#39;s just my humble opinion though, I can sympathize with all sides accept for the manipulators. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t believe 99% of conspiracies because 99% of them are easily explained and 94% of those are so poorly presented and argued/supported that anyone with the ability to logically analyse can and will debunk.</p>

<p>It’s the 1% I adore completely. They only come along every few months but it’s worth waiting for. The last one was the presentation on Trudeau. Well put forward, supported by timelines, articles and photographic comparisons. Not taken by other people but provided by the user himself.</p>

<p>The political assassination within this forum is comically entertaining sometimes and is also worth the read - sometimes.</p>

<p>Prime example: I dated to suggest that all citizens should be held to higher standards with gun safety and was shutdown with the classic all or nothing ‘you want all guns confiscated’ retort despite the fact I own guns, served in the army and represented my regiment in shooting competitions. Love it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoy conspiracy theories. They are interesting even though most of them are bullshit. What I don&#39;t enjoy is people trying to say the earth is fucking flat. That&#39;s not a conspiracy theory, it&#39;s fucking insanely stupid considering it&#39;s been proven since the ancient Greeks using math. </p>

<p>Also, this whole school shooting thing has been handled terribly by this sub. Total lack of empathy. Children died at sandy hook. Kids died in Florida. If you think it&#39;s a false flag, you gotta come with more than &quot;look how she doesn&#39;t even show emotion when answering questions!&quot; Or &quot;dudes a crisis actor paid by George Soros or &quot;they said they would have a school shooting drill&quot; none of that is any sort of evidence. We are talking about people here, this isn&#39;t some abstract thought experiment. </p>

<p>Also, everyone here is ignoring a huge fucking conspiracy. Russians are were caught red handed setting up protests and pro trump rallies across the country. Most where pro trump but they also organized rallies and protests to promote democrats with the intent of dividing us. It seems to me a lot of people here are Alex Jones, trump loving people. Whatever, to each his own. But Because of that they ignore anything that doesn&#39;t fit into their partisan beliefs. I don&#39;t care if you are a trump supporter we are talking about a foreign country meddling in our election. It&#39;s not a conspiracy theory anymore, it fucking happened. It&#39;s happening right now, Russian bots are creating pro gun media while also pushing that the school shooting in Florida was a false flag narrative and everyone here is eating it up because it fits their narrative. But, I don&#39;t come here for that kinda stuff. I want to hear about aliens the military is running into. Or if the Nazis secret wonder weapon was been found. I&#39;m just saying, this sub is being controlled by a certain narrative that is frustrating. Leave your political beliefs out of it, a conspiracy theory shouldn&#39;t be partisan. Just because you voted for a guy doesn&#39;t mean you can just ignore what&#39;s happening and shout it down as fake news. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I admit that I don&#39;t believe many conspiracy theories, but I do really enjoy them.  To me it&#39;s kind of like sci-fi. What stories can you think of based on the facts you have what might be true. </p>

<p>I also think that some theories, like the Illuminati, may not be 100% accurate, but does provide a good model for understanding how human greed, corruption, lust for power, etc. works and what the effects could be.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand this perspective and why you would want to be here. I think that in many ways conspiracy theorists are the first to understand how to tell stories on the internet. They create a narrative using existing facts and real-world locations. There&#39;s a video where David Icke travels around the City of London and finds symbols of dragons that he says are signs of reptilians etc. I think of it like Don Quixote and the windmill becoming a giant wielding a sword. It&#39;s like augmented reality and the conspiracy is placed on top of the existing structure, whether that structure is real-world locations, existing media, politics etc. The winner is the person who can construct the most compelling narrative that has the fewest holes.</p>

<p>I also understand the people who want to try and debunk conspiracies as this sub is one of the few left on Reddit where people might actually argue back rather than just ban, ignore or tell you to &quot;research it yourself&quot; and claim that you need to &quot;educate yourself&quot; as it is too much &quot;emotional labour&quot; for them to put forward an argument or rebuttal. </p>

<p>The people I don&#39;t understand are the ones who are solely interested in calling other people here stupid and not basing any of it on actually trying to produce supporting evidence to debunk arguments but just resort to constant personal attacks. Why spend so much time in a place if that&#39;s the limit of a their contribution?</p>

You&#39;re in a remote rural coal mining township in the 1800s.</p>

<p>Town gossip has it that the company&#39;s higher ups are corrupt AF.</p>

<p>Do they:</p>

<p>A) watch the people investigate and bring them to Justice, collapsing the industry that the town survives off of...</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>B) listen in, pay folks off , pay folks to quell dissent, and pay folks to sway public opinion, all for the greater good?</p>

<p>You decide.</p>

<p>The problem with this sub isn&#39;t that people don&#39;t believe in conspiracies, it&#39;s that when people critically analyze the facts and don&#39;t think there is a conspiracy, it turns into a shit show.  I&#39;ve been called a shill simply for asking for proof on things.  I&#39;ve seen great, sell researched comments downvoted and shit on because they weren&#39;t pro-conspiracy.</p>

<p>I like to think of this sub as a place that people come to look for the truth.  Sometimes the truth isn&#39;t going to be a conspiracy, and that&#39;s okay.  The biggest problem with this sub is that so many people want conspiracy theories to become conspiracy fact so badly that they&#39;re willing to block out what got them here in the first place: The truth.</p>
