<p>Of course you are.</p>

<p>No, it bothers me that you use a self post to add nothing of substance to the sub but only to malign it. A good faith post would have listed examples and more than two sentences. But good job attempting to paint me as someone who doesn&#39;t want this &quot;brough attention to&quot;...LOL.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Haven&#39;t kept up with David Hogg or been on r/con as much these last couple days. Still haven&#39;t seen much of him in the /new que which is the only good way to browse this sub.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Now see, if you had added that initially this might be a better self post. All you did was type 2 sentences with no substance in an attempt to slander the sub and its user base. Try harder next time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You believe that it is wrong to investigate him? He has contradicted himself in interviews and appeared to be rehearaing lines. He has been shown reading from a script and has become the face/voice of the victims (instead of the actual victims) and has become a strong proponent of gun control almost immediately follwing the event. He has an FBI father, his own vlog, admires CNN, and has a desire to be a journalist, appeared in a news report from an incident in CA 6 months before this event, etc. There is a ton of suspiciousness around this kid.</p>

<p>On top of all that, he and the other kids all took a smiling selfie right before their interviews. Nothing about the kids being paraded as the face of this event seems remotely real.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the sub jumping to the conclusion that he&#39;s some version of a crisis actor with no tangible evidence, just a suspicion? Yeah that&#39;s what I am referring to. This sub has the opportunity to bring minds together to uncover the truth where it&#39;s hidden. Right now its Achilles heel is the amount of emotional conclusions people jump to based on their politics and confirmation bias. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But there is circumstantial evidence he could be a crisis actor for the very reasons I pointed out above. Trying to stifle investigation/discussion is against what this sub is about. What you deem wiser may not be to others. You are trying to force your own truths onto others to steer the conversation away from a topic you deem unworthy. If you don&#39;t like the discussion about David Hogg, ignore it and join a conversation more to your liking. It does no one any good when you or anyone else attempt to shut conversation down.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the sub jumping to the conclusion that he&#39;s some version of a crisis actor with no tangible evidence, just a suspicion? Yeah that&#39;s what I am referring to. This sub has the opportunity to bring minds together to uncover the truth where it&#39;s hidden. Right now its Achilles heel is the amount of emotional conclusions people jump to based on their politics and confirmation bias. </p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to inspire the sub to be wiser, more clinical and more effective than it has been. </p>
