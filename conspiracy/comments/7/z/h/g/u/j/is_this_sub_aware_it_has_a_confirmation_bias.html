       Thanks for your contribution? Lol what you said adds nothing to the convo. Of course people have confirmation bias...care to link what you think are examples? Or even just state a few? You making a SP like this doesn't do anything but slide the /new que.

       Am I not allowed to ask the question? Does it point out something you don't want to bring attention to? Clearly I've struck a nerve in you by asking.

       It's a legitimate question and one that I think could create insightful dialogue about how this sub reacts and jumps to conclusions based on what they WANT to believe rather than being discerning and questioning information the way more rational people would.

       No, it bothers me that you use a self post to add nothing of substance to the sub but only to malign it. A good faith post would have listed examples and more than two sentences. But good job attempting to paint me as someone who doesn't want this "brough attention to"...LOL.

       Haven't kept up with David Hogg or been on r/con as much these last couple days. Still haven't seen much of him in the /new que which is the only good way to browse this sub.

       Now see, if you had added that initially this might be a better self post. All you did was type 2 sentences with no substance in an attempt to slander the sub and its user base. Try harder next time.

       Of course, but that's inevitable, and insignificant, as this sub isn't pretending to be scientific, nor overtly empirical. This sub is primarily a place for brainstorming, discussion, and discovering the hidden threads that tie everything together.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to be fair, it's not as though subs like politics or science don't exhibit confirmation bias as well. The difference however, is that they're pretending its not the case.

       I'm not sure the sub is aware. If it is we're at levels of AI that are waaaay beyond what we first imagined.

       Some users of the sub display confirmation bias at times, infact i would suggest all have at some point.  No more or less than any other users, of any other subs.

       Don't most people, even those in other subs or those not even on Reddit, have some form of confirmation bias? We interpret things based on our own beliefs/perception of reality. One can do their best to be fair and objective yet there will always be a predisposition to look at things through ones own lens.

       You believe that it is wrong to investigate him? He has contradicted himself in interviews and appeared to be rehearaing lines. He has been shown reading from a script and has become the face/voice of the victims (instead of the actual victims) and has become a strong proponent of gun control almost immediately follwing the event. He has an FBI father, his own vlog, admires CNN, and has a desire to be a journalist, appeared in a news report from an incident in CA 6 months before this event, etc. There is a ton of suspiciousness around this kid.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of all that, he and the other kids all took a smiling selfie right before their interviews. Nothing about the kids being paraded as the face of this event seems remotely real.

       The vast majority of the sub jumping to the conclusion that he's some version of a crisis actor with no tangible evidence, just a suspicion? Yeah that's what I am referring to. This sub has the opportunity to bring minds together to uncover the truth where it's hidden. Right now its Achilles heel is the amount of emotional conclusions people jump to based on their politics and confirmation bias.

       I'm trying to inspire the sub to be wiser, more clinical and more effective than it has been.

       But there is circumstantial evidence he could be a crisis actor for the very reasons I pointed out above. Trying to stifle investigation/discussion is against what this sub is about. What you deem wiser may not be to others. You are trying to force your own truths onto others to steer the conversation away from a topic you deem unworthy. If you don't like the discussion about David Hogg, ignore it and join a conversation more to your liking. It does no one any good when you or anyone else attempt to shut conversation down.

       Not trying to shut down anything other than the premature, emotional, knee jerk declaration that he's a crisis actor. Those off the cuff declarations undermine the credibility of the sub and do more damage than me suggesting that people be more methodical and rational in their conclusions.

       It is not your job to police the conversations on this sub. As I stated earlier, there are valid reasons and plenty of evidence to entertain the possibility he, and others, are crisis actors and that this was a false flag event. No emotional judgements nor off the cuff declarations need to be made when you take everything into account. So please, don't quit your day job as we definitely don't need any conversation policing here.

       The irony and hypocrisy in your response is a tell that you fail to see the bigger picture. But OK - another person who came to this sub to find intelligent conversation is now going to leave due to the childishness and confirmation bias that REEKS here.

       The vast majority of the sub jumping to the conclusion that he's some version of a crisis actor with no tangible evidence, just a suspicion? Yeah that's what I am referring to. This sub has the opportunity to bring minds together to uncover the truth where it's hidden. Right now its Achilles heel is the amount of emotional conclusions people jump to based on their politics and confirmation bias.

       I'm trying to inspire the sub to be wiser, more clinical and more effective than it has been.
