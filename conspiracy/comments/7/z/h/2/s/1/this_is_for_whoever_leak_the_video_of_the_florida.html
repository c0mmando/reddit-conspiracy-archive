<p>That. Already. Exists.</p>

<p>But okay, I don&#39;t really have the time to go into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_interpretation">constitutional interpretation</a> and legal precedent with you, or the historical context (look up the armaments used in the Revolutionary war, the state of the nation and its fledgling &quot;army&quot;, the different ways of life, etc. etc.) or of the Constitution or even the heavy legal debate on what the term &quot;arms&quot; actually refers to, but I&#39;d urge you to look into it.</p>

<p>I mean just think for a second, but your argument and logic, every single person should have nuclear weapons because &quot;tyranny begins when the military can have weapons the citizenry cannot,&quot; and I for one do not think that the founding fathers would want every citizen to possess a weapon that could obliterate huge swaths of the nation.</p>

<p>Anti-gun people like to focus on the &quot;well regulated&quot; portion.</p>

<p>Pro-gun people like to only focus on the &quot;shall not be infringed&quot;</p>

<p>To me, it seems like they are both important. Some regulations are permissable (well regulated) should not be made frivolously/without basis (shall not be infringed).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it is easy to figure out. But anyone that looks at that sentence and says that everyone should be able to own whatever they want, is not reading the sentence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that&#39;s how I read it.  A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state (If we are going to have a well regulated militia...), the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed (then you cannot limit the people&#39;s right to also have arms IOT protect themselves from that militia).  Why is it after every shooting we have to rehash this and reeducate the ignorant masses.  How do i know these things to be true?  Because James Madison told me so.  </p>

<p>Also, the US Constitution does not and cannot limit the rights of the people.  It is a document that structures and limits only the power of the people.  Yes, The Bill of Rights are the first 10 Amendments and those amendments can be changed, but even if you remove the 2nd Amendment, we will still have the right to keep and bear arms granted by the 9th and 10th Amendment.  The federal government is simply too weak and has no authority to limit the will of the people...period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yes, CSN news, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s legit, ah but you can&#39;t even look at the actual study, so I did some more digging and found it, finally.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what the study says about defensive gun use. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Defensive use of guns by crime victims is a common occurrence, although the exact number remains disputed (Cook and Ludwig, 1996; Kleck, 2001a). Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010). On the other hand, some scholars point to a radically lower estimate of only 108,000 annual defensive uses based on the National Crime Victimization Survey (Cook et al., 1997). The variation in these numbers remains a controversy in the field. The estimate of 3 million defensive uses per year is based on an extrapolation from a small number of responses taken from more than 19 national surveys. The former estimate of 108,000 is difficult to interpret because respondents were not asked specifically about defensive gun use.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, looking at that, you could make the argument that having a defensive gun is great, however, if you take 10 seconds to read further...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even when defensive use of guns is effective in averting death or injury for the gun user in cases of crime, it is still possible that keeping a gun in the home or carrying a gun in public—concealed or open carry—may have a different net effect on the rate of injury. <strong>For example, if gun ownership raises the risk of suicide, homicide, or the use of weapons by those who invade the homes of gun owners, this could cancel or outweigh the beneficial effects of defensive gun use (Kellermann et al., 1992, 1993, 1995).</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The study also stated, quote:</p>

<p>&quot;By their sheer magnitude, injuries and deaths involving firearms constitute a pressing public health problem.&quot;</p>

<p>but, here&#39;s the coup de gras, the study ITSELF states that the findings of this study, and past studies are NOT CONCLUSIVE (&quot;so further research is needed both to explore these contingencies and to confirm or discount earlier findings&quot;), which should be more than clear given the absurd variance in defensive gun use (108,000 to 3 million is worthless statistically) and need to be examined further, but they can&#39;t because....</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If only you people would second guess and doubt news you wanted to hear as much as you doubted the MSM, we might actually get somewhere, but you believing whatever ratchet thing you read isn&#39;t any better (in fact it&#39;s worse).</p>
