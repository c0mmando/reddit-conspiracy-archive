<p>You create bitcoin, but before you create it you have computers that can mine 1 bitcoin per second. (Their supercomputers)</p>

<p>They found russian scientists where using a supercomputer that was old and crappy at a nuclear facility to mine bitcoins. Imagine how much $$ those supercomputers the CIA has could mine. We need 20million to pay off this person. Boom You can mine it in 2 hours. We need $300,000 for a new computer. Bam 5 minutes you have untraceable money.

    <div class="md"><p>This completely fails to understand Bitcoin on three levels.<br/>
1) For the love of God, <strong>it&#39;s not anonymous</strong>. It&#39;s trackable with just some simple determination, let alone actual manpower.<br/>
2) That&#39;s not how supercomputers work. You can&#39;t just take any powerful computer and mine Bitcoin with it. (As was demonstrated also by the Russians, they mined <strong>ZERO</strong> bitcoins.) There exist dedicated ASICs for a reason. Additionally, the difficulty is through the fucking roof, so they&#39;d need a hell of a lot of ASICs to get the reward EVERY time, which is also neigh impossible considering you just fucking see who mined it on the chain explorer. On top of this, only around 1,800 bitcoins are mined per day. That means, the current price being roughly 10,000 USD, the CIA is using implausibly large amounts of electricity on an implausibly huge number of ASICs to make 18,000,000 USD. Let&#39;s say the CIA is mining with some Antiminer S9&#39;s. The wattage of one is 1400 watts, and they cost 3,000 USD each. In order to make 18,000,000 USD in one day, the CIA would first need to purchase 10,000,000,000 S9s at 3,000 each, a one-time cost of 30,000,000,000,000 USD - that&#39;s a one-time payment of 30 <em>trillion</em> dollars. Not only that, but those ASICs are going to use 1,400 watts EACH, so 14,000,000,000,000 watts total. Assuming an average electric bill of say $0.15 per kilowatt hour, the electric bill will be simply be a modest 50.4 BILLION DOLLARS - EVERY <strong>DAY.</strong> So, the CIA is spending 50.4 billion dollars daily in order to make 18 million dollars in bitcoin? I doubt that seriously - that&#39;s getting 0.0004 dollars payment for every dollar spent, and that&#39;s <em>excluding</em> the purchase of the miners. And to put the cherry on top, if there was such a massive influx of computing power in the mining network, the difficulty would increase so much they&#39;d get even LESS return.  </p>

<p>3) It takes about 10-30 minutes for THE ENTIRE NETWORK to mine a SINGLE block on average. Not only that, but why would the CIA design a currency in which the amount of Bitcoin given per block DECREASES OVER TIME. In 32 years, the reward will be 0.05 bitcoin per block.  </p>

<p>Additonally, you can&#39;t argue that it&#39;d be different for other cryptos, either, save if the government exclusively owned one (FedCoin). With Monero (actually anonymous) the same hashing power described before would lose the gov&#39;t the same 50.4 billion, in Ethereum, the same 50.4 billion, and in Litecoin, the same, etc etc etc. There exists no profitable way to abuse the crypto network save for scam coins and the like.  </p>

<p>To finish, let&#39;s say that the CIA has some super-secret ASICs that they have hidden from the world. Those 1,800 blocks cost 140,000,000,000 TH/s, and a single hash is roughly 12,700 FLOPS. Take this and you derive a necessary supercomputer speed of 1,778,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 PFLOPS (1.778x10<sup>27</sup> PFLOPS). The average cost of supercomputing hardware in the BEST computers is 0.03 USD per GFLOPS. That makes the computer worth 53.34 quadrillion dollars. Now take that into account. However, for funsies, let&#39;s keep going and look at the wattage. A very good supercomputer begun in 2017 is the <em>Sunway TaihuLight</em>, which uses 15 Megawatts to produce 125 PFLOPS of computational power. That places our total wattage at an <em>oh so reasonable</em> 213.4 petawatts. This is even worse than the ASICs (mostly because I made no prediction of the massive cooling needed to not incinerate them with that many running), and will put the CIA back 1,434,000,000,000,000,000 USD <em>every day</em>. That&#39;s just one and a half quintillion dollars every day, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s <em>totally</em> profitable. Oh, did I mention that&#39;s only if electricity costs one cent per kilowatt? Yeah.  </p>

<p>TL;DR: Read up on a subject before you call the tools of freedom a government trap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy fuck. Bitcoin doesn&#39;t operate that way, that&#39;s why. A bunch of retards congregating around this issue doesn&#39;t make it any less retarded. Why would they make a decentralized software that rewards them less and less over time, while becoming more and more expensive? The only possible answer is that they wanted to drive the price up in the long run and quickly squeeze coins out at the beginning. (Btw, this still contradicts the &quot;poof! money!&quot; idea from OP.) Alright, let&#39;s see how many bitcoins were in the genesis block - 50 coins. The wallet it mined to was 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa. A total of ~67 coins were EVER sent to the wallet, and a total of ~67 coins is STILL in the wallet, so the CIA clearly didn&#39;t mine it, are &quot;biding their time&quot; (3spooky5me) or are too stupid to keep track of their &quot;own invention.&quot; The next block was mined to 12c6DSiU4Rq3P4ZxziKxzrL5LmMBrzjrJX - 50 coins in, still just 50 coins there. Since this is overwhelmingly the case, I&#39;ll just list the addresses that NEVER SPENT ANY COINS that bothered to mine them:  </p>

<p>This block - the 9th block - marks the first time anyone spent their produced coins - and they didn&#39;t spend all of them:<br/>
12cbQLTFMXRnSzktFkuoG3eHoMeFtpTu3S<br/>
All of the coins it spent were sent in January 2009, also. 32 coins in January 2009 - that&#39;s worth a whopping zero dollars! These are surely some technological wizards, those fiendish CIA bitcoiners. This scary plot becomes even more exposed when you realize that all of these transations pan out over a few addresses into 1BBz9Z15YpELQ4QP5sEKb1SwxkcmPb5TMs and 1BDvQZjaAJH4ecZ8aL3fYgTi7rnn3o2thE and 1DUDsfc23Dv9sPMEk5RsrtfzCw5ofi5sVW, all dead addresses. A single one - a transation of 10 bitcoin, is still on the network being moved around. Huzzah! The dastardly CIA clearly lost those 400 bitcoin in exchange for this 10 that was worth a whopping... zero dollars, again...  </p>

<p>More dead mined addresses:<br/>

1Fi7o3BKMcT82NVtnMRNqsj8aE5CWbAo4z  </p>

<p>I could keep doing that, but it&#39;s getting tedious. Unless they mined to all these different addresses, and for some reason want nothing to do with the 10,000,000 USD trapped in those dead wallets, they didn&#39;t fucking bother mining their &quot;own technology&quot; so I very much doubt that they invented it or if they did, cared to use it.  </p>

<p>So, instead of this sort of mental retardation, let&#39;s come up with a different reason that the CIA might invent it. There&#39;s really only one flaw in Bitcoin, and that is the public ledger system called the &quot;blockchain,&quot; a key part of its structure, but unencrypted and totally public. This means that if you&#39;re laundering money in Bitcoin, the IRS can dispatch a team of monkeys to see that. It also relates to the old bitcoin-based drug markets on Tor, so maybe the FBI would like that. If anything of that nature was the case, it&#39;d at least be more plausible than the CIA using a <strong>publicly trackable system</strong> to create <strong>less and less</strong> of a currency over time that (if they mined toward the beginning) they never even <strong>bothered spending.</strong>  </p>

<p>This also totally ignores the fact that <em>if they raped the Bitcoin network with an awesome super computer, they would <strong>raise the difficulty to the fucking roof</strong>.</em> And if someone wants to retardedly shout, &quot;BUT WHAT IF A BACKDOOR-&quot; I&#39;ll ignore them, because the <em>decentralized</em>, <em>open source</em> network determines the rules.  </p>

<p>TL;DR: Same as before. Actually understand an issue before you argue the point, numbnuts.</p>

Google was 100% created by the CIA and there’s evidence to show that Google is connected to many organizations that got money and had ties with the CIA. Stuff like this doesn’t just get so much global attention in the MSM and beyond if it isn’t regulated by powerful people </p>

I do remember when google first came around on the internet and people would say &quot;just google it noob&quot; before people knew what google was.

    <div class="md"><p>This is interesting, any more info about this? I&#39;ve always thought Google is a shady company, no real reason why but I try to use as few of their products as possible. I&#39;d never thought about until this comment how it was created. I&#39;ve heard about how other major tech companies were started but I can&#39;t recall coming across anything about how Google got its start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s a way for authorities to track black market transactions since it&#39;s not anonymous like David Chaum&#39;s DigiCash was in 1990 (which went bankrupt when banks suddenly pulled out of contracts with DigiCash when they realized they would lose the ability to track their customers).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s possible. We don&#39;t know who did it. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they were connected to the government or and specifically intelligence, even though I do ultimately think crypto currency will prove itself to be a good thing for the world. </p>

<p>And another feature of Bitcoin is that the block chain is public. This is good because it&#39;s de-centralized and available to all, but this also means transactions are traceable. Cash can be untraceable and thus have more security, but if the world all used Bitcoin, our transactions maybe wouldn&#39;t be so easily concealed. They could want this too, so that they&#39;d have access to intelligence on transactions that they otherwise would never be able to suss out through traditional surveillance. </p>

<p>Personally I think it&#39;s a double edged sword. We&#39;re gonna get some benefits and we&#39;re gonna have some pitfalls. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CIA is too stupid to be behind creating Bitcoin.</p>

<p>No way could Langley light 2 neurons between any 2 Spooks to be capable of pulling off Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Just look at all the masterplans CIA has botched. CIA has a higher probability of shooting themselves in the foot than succeeding in any of their covert ops.</p>

<p>&quot;let&#39;s arm the Moderate Rebels in Syria, oops, we gave $4 billion in weapons to Nusra who defected back to ISIS.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;we here at the CIA are the world leader in HUMINT and espionage. We just emailed real nuke blueprints to our agent in Iran. Don&#39;t worry, we have altered the blueprints to subtly sabotage anyone who tries to build the flawed The Bomb using them. Oops, our Agent accidentally emailed the real unaltered blueprints to Iran. Double oops, our Agent also accidentally cc&#39;d all of our other covert assets in Iran, which reveals to Iran who are our moles in the email headers. Oops, all of our moles in Iran have mysteriously vanished, leaving us with zero eyes and ears inside Iran.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;yes, we here at the CIA vouch that it is an irrefutable scientific fact that Saddam Hussein is building weapons of mass destruction, so we better invade again. We can&#39;t show you our proof, because we classified it to hide it from you, so you&#39;ll just have to teust us. If you don&#39;t trust us, then you&#39;re probably a terrorist too. Let&#39;s Roll.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;we here at the CIA never, ever kidnap and torture people for decades in our 16 Black Prisons around the world, especialky not innocent civilians who we accuse of terrorism, but who are actually just disabled taxi drivers with no connection to any militias nor the govt.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;don&#39;t worry, we here at CIA can vouch for these Contras who are just selling small amounts of cocaine to raise money for their families because the Commies have wrecked their economy. Under no circumstances does CIA assist these Freedom Fighters with narco trafficking, and we never ever would use our own pilots and our own planes to fly thousands of tons of cocaine into Mena, AK, and also Los Angeles, and you migjt as well believe in Flying Saucers from other galaxies if you believe we here at CIA would even establish business relationship with drug dealers inside America to buy our Contra&#39;s cocaine, so that we can give that money to Iran, our sworn enemy, with whom we are at covert war with, to purchase weapons for our Contras to fight the Soviets.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We here at CIA would never fund and arm a wealthy and charismatic Radical Islamic Terrorist in Afghanistan to fight the Soviets. That would be far too reckless, because what if our Terrorist double crosses us, because he hates America more than the Soviets, and turns his army that we helped him create against us? Good God man, doing something that dumb would be lunacy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We here at the CIA would never surveil members of Congress who are investigating us to discover all of the crimes we have committed. And even if we were spying on Congress, we would never be dumb enough to get caught when our Plumbers bungle a burglary while doing a black bag snatch and grab for the President.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We here at the CIA would never assassinate our own Commander in Chief and then cover it up for over 50 years.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We here at CIA would never employ fleeing Nazi and Japanese war criminals, and cover them to work the same job for us that they worked for the Axis Powers, in order to gain an edge against the Soviets. We have principles here at Langley, we aren&#39;t just a mutinous gang of throat cutting
pirates who are only loyal to ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p>On and on and on.</p>

<p>The only reason CIA isn&#39;t a complete laughing stock is because they waste billions on propaganda that builds up their mystique of being All-Knowing, All-Powerful and everywhere.</p>

<p>The best proof it wasn&#39;t CIA who invented Bitcoin is this:</p>

<p>If CIA had invented Bitcoin, it would have imploded, crashed or been totally hacked into obliterationby now, just like every other operation which Langley flubs. QED</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I know is that there is no way &quot;A single Japanese guy&quot; created it. Bitcoin is complex and would of taken a team of people to create it and advertise it. They&#39;ve hurt the deep webs black market pretty badly, so I don&#39;t see how bitcoin increased in value when the only market it was used for took major hits.</p>
