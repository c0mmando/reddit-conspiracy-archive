<p>What happens if the only people with flamethrowers are ultimately the criminal and irresponsible ones?  Then the non-criminal, law-abiding people will be even more vulnerable than they would ever otherwise be.</p>

<p>The answer is to arm <em>everyone</em>.  That way the responsible people will be protected against the irresponsible ones.  The irresponsible ones will likely always have flamethrowers regardless.  They’ll get them illegally and irresponsibly.  That’s what they are/what they do.  You won’t be able to help that.</p>

<p>You have to protect yourself against them, however, and one of the best ways is to simply have your own flamethrower.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>I</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are many more guns in America than there are Americans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see this point.  I misinterpreted it mentally initially.  I see that I was incorrect in that perspective now that you put it this way.  Thanks for the revisualization.  Appreciated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then why is it the answer in literally every other first world country on Earth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because “every other first world country on Earth” is double speak for “countries where the citizenry has been declawed and tamed by a government who could decimate them with relative ease if the people decided to protest any draconian legislation that the leaders of that country decided to enact”.</p>

<p>That type of “answer” is not the answer of a free and sovereign people.  That type of “answer” is the answer of a slave species - a citizenry of sheep - and while I’m not saying that “Americans are free and powerful!” (hell no.  Far from it in fact), I <em>am</em> saying that the little rights that exist in this country would likely go quickly by the wayside if the citizenry were to be entirely disarmed.</p>

<p>So no.  What you think is “the answer in every other first world country on Earth” is, in fact, very much not the answer that you think it is.</p>

<p>You’re basically advocating for the declawing and defanging of every lion in Africa and justifying it by saying “Look at the lions in this zoo!  See?  They’re totally declawed and defanged and they <em>never</em> have any problems!  They’re treated great!  Therefore declawing and defanging lions is the way to go and every lion should see that as greatly desirable!”</p>

<p>Yeah.  That’s basically taking all ability and choice to protect and defend itself away from the lion and giving it all to the zoo keeper.</p>

<p>Good for the zoo keeper, eh?  Yeah.  Sure.  If that lion decides he or she doesn’t like something that zoo keeper’s doing though?  Well, tough shit, pussy cat.  You’re fucked.  Whatever the zoo keeper demands, the lion is forced to do and is at the absolute mercy of.</p>

<p>So long as all the lions in the zoo are okay with being useless and laying about, doing nothing, and being fed and essentially being “zoo pets” imprisoned in zoo cages, then I guess they won’t have any problems with that arrangement though, eh?</p>

<p>However, there are the defanged, declawed lions in the zoo on one end, and then there are the fanged, clawed lions in the Serengeti jungle.  One set is fat and lazy and useless and unable to help and defend themselves and therefore at the complete mercy of their handlers and zoo keepers…and the other set, even though they have to fend for themselves and life in the Sahara might not be easy at all, at least they can fight and work for their freedom and live their entire life in the vast open Serengeti, and sleep wherever they want, etc, etc.</p>

<p>It’s ultimately the question of the following scenario:  Would you rather have all your basic needs taken care of where you never ever have to starve or want for any basic living requirements under the condition that you have to live the rest of your life confined to a one bedroom apartment that you can never, ever get out of or leave from? Or would you rather have the ability to go walk and run wherever you want with the open air as your backyard under the condition that you actually have to fend for yourself and find your own sustenance?</p>

<p>I think that a lot of people would prefer <em>not</em> to be imprisoned in a small one bedroom sized cell for the rest of their lives even if they get free room and board and a free lunch every day.  I think you would agree with that.</p>

<p>The citizens of these “first world countries” you speak of are essentially zoo animals that get all their basic needs taken care of so long as they are nice, quiescent citizens and pay attention to whatever their government tells them to do.  If their government decides to do something that citizenry doesn’t like, however?  Well, tough shit, pussy cat.  You’re fucked.</p>

<p>Again, I’m not saying that the U.S. citizen hasn’t been largely eviscerated at this point, but TPTB know that <em>these</em> particular animals (the U.S. citizenry) haven’t been <em>entirely</em> and completely declawed and defanged yet...so it wouldn’t be as easy to do just whatever they might want to them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why does it work everywhere else, but it wouldn&#39;t work here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn’t work like you think it does.  It’s not working like you think it is.  I just gave an analogy above illustrating this very point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is empirically false, based on every other country that&#39;s done it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an argumentum ignorantium on your part - an argument out of ignorance; a fallacy.  You are essentially saying that since you don’t know of any cases where citizens have been hurt by gun confiscation/as a result of being disarmed, then it has therefore never happened and there has never been a problem with it.</p>

<p>This is patently, empirically, and demonstrably false on your part, and <a href="http://jpfo.org/pdf02/genocide-chart.pdf">I at least can site facts pointing to this absurdity.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I want is no one to have flamethrowers, so no one gets burned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me too, bro.  That’s exactly what I want.  I don’t want anyone to get burned.  So long as <em>one</em> person has a flame thrower, however, then that individual has power over anyone who <em>doesn’t</em> have a flamethrower - and that person who possesses that flamethrower thereby can exert undue force and influence over anyone who doesn’t have one.</p>

<p>In the case of a disarmed citizenry, then it’s really only the government that has all the flamethrowers…</p>

<p>...so you trust the government being the only ones who can have the flamethrowers?</p>

<p>Really?  You didn’t see the factoid I linked above?</p>

<p>I certainly don’t trust Uncle Sham to be the only one who can have a flamethrower in the U.S., bro.  Hell no.</p>

<p>We’ve seen just how absolutely horrible TPTB can be, have been, and absolutely <em>are</em>.  It’s dangerous and foolhardy for a people to give their sovereignty and protection over to an entity/an organization that has proven itself over and over again to manipulate said citizenry - covertly and otherwise - for the purpose of theft and manipulation.</p>

<p>Not a good thing to continue handing your sovereignty over to such an organization like this over and over again.</p>

<p>So yeah.  If EVERYONE were disarmed, then perhaps I’d be okay with that.  However, so long as ONE individual is armed - regardless of whether that individual is a “citizen”, or a government official, or someone in the military - then EVERYONE should be armed.</p>

<p>A person has the absolute right to protect themselves against anyone regardless of who it is, and so long as there is the possibility that one can be harmed or threatened by another (regardless of whether that other is a citizen, the government, or the military), then you should be able to do what you can to arm and protect yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The last thing we need is more guns out there</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect.  The last thing we need is more defenseless people.  THAT’S the last thing we need.  Therefore, the <em>fist</em> thing we need is for everyone to be able to KEEP themselves from being a victim.  That means that the last thing we need is for less people to be disarmed against those who <em>are</em> armed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so more people will get killed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is exactly what you are risking when you leave weapons only in the hands of a select few.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Giving guns to &quot;the right people&quot; isn&#39;t the answer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I cannot agree with you MORE.  Therefore, and for that very reason, the government and the military and “the authorities” should absolutely NOT be the only entities allowed to be armed.</p>

<p>I’m actually agreeing with your stance, believe it or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>considering even the cops have a less than 20% hit rate in shootouts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s entirely beside the point, however, because accuracy isn’t a factor when it comes to overall and general citizen protection.  Ultimately it’s about statistics, believe it or not.  Accurate marksmanship or not, everyone being armed will in the long run make everyone else <em>very</em> responsible about A) gun ownership in general (since everyone will know just how serious and deadly the weapons are), and B) far less likely to commit any crime (since every would-be criminal would at that point know that everyone else is armed as well and can very well defend themselves - i.e. no easy pickings or victims).</p>

<p>Really?  Please explain them then.  It’s easy to say that.  Far more difficult to actually prove.  There as a matter of fact hasn’t been <em>any</em> first world country that has proven anything of the like.  What’s been proven, as I explained and illustrated above, is that if a disarmed citizenry do what TPTB want, then they won’t get mangled and mowed down en mass.  If they try to dispute anything that said PTB throw on the people, however?  Then tough shit, pussy cat.  You’re fucked.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The answer is to arm everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a terrible answer, that will only lead to more gun deaths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite the contrary.  You are thinking in an extremely short term, superficial manner.  If everyone were armed, what would likely happen is that there would be an initial spike in gun-related deaths, as entire populations would be armed, but then there would be an absolutely <em>immediate</em> realization by the citizenry that guns are not to be played with in the least, as real deaths and real people and real family members will otherwise get killed, and suddenly <em>everyone</em> in the society would realize just how serious and deadly and not-to-be-toyed-with are firearms.</p>

<p>Then what would happen is that the entire society would settle into a “universal gun ownership” mindset where everyone would know and understand that everyone else is armed, dangerous, and deadly, and everyone (and I mean <em>everyone</em>) will suddenly be respected as the potentially deadly and not-to-be-fucked-with person that they in fact are.</p>

<p>Once you have that level of ubiquitous respect across the entire citizenry, then almost NO crime will occur in that society.  You would almost not need cops because no citizen who doesn’t want to get their ass shot dead will even think about attempting any crime - violent or otherwise - in the society.  Why?  Because literally <em>anyone</em> on the street could kill them if they try something criminal.</p>

<p>That kind of society will have almost no crime, and people would eventually get to where they respect (not “fear”, but <em>respect</em>) each other and everyone else.</p>

<p>If we arm teachers and they do not engage the shooter for whatever reason, will they lose their (teaching) jobs and also be shamed by the President?  </p>

<p>More importantly, what about WHEN (not if) an armed teacher accidentally shoots an innocent student or another armed teacher during the heat of the moment?  Or when SWAT enters the building and kills the teacher who is there holding a gun?</p>

<p>How do you keep the students safe if their teacher is out shooting the bad guys?  Kids don’t make rational choices when they are scared and they cry and try to run. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re probably right that arming teachers may work some of the time and, yes, they may save some lives.  Your solution fails to solve the root cause of the problem that cheap, high-powered, assault weapons and high capacity magazines are widely available (either legally or illegally) to people who want to kill as many people as possible. </p>

<p>I believe that school shooters expect to die by cop or self-inflicted shot, therefore, an armed teacher potentially taking them out at some point isn’t really a deterrent.  All it creates is a battlefield in our schools with, in my opinion, too much risk. </p>

Now, teachers will be expected to not only be low-paid slaves with no retirements, they can expect to have classroom sizes that have never been seen before in some areas, and they will also need to become Annie Oakley&#39;s in the minuscule event that a mass murder spree happens.

<p>Its a hard call, to say what&#39;s wrong or right for this situation. My personal thought is to put retired law enforcement(who want to work with less risk) and , mentally capable and responsible vets. Especially vets. Idk. But I get how arming teachers could be hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wtf is this shit? it&#39;s like your or your mom-n-law cannot fathom the situation at hand - IF it were to happen.. imagine how traumatizing it would be to hopelessly cower there while some armed gunman shot up the school. I dunno what idiot would take not being armed, but 100% of everyone would at that moment WANT someone there with a gun! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly for example that football coach that died, I&#39;m sure he would&#39;ve been able to resist if he was armed. It would have been a shoot out until police arrived instead of a massacre. I don&#39;t think every teacher needs a gun, maybe just dominant figures with good morals  like coaches, principals and history teachers! Also I think it&#39;s important that there is good communication with law enforcement if there is an event to prevent friendly fire and confusion. </p>

<p>Edit: Also this security guard that didn&#39;t respond should really be ashamed of himself, it&#39;s your civic duty to protect these people! #shame #coward #noballs</p>

<p>In that same thought, what was the deputy armed with?  How many shots did he have?  Did he have a vest on?  Fuck you and the President for calling him a coward. </p>

<p>Also, this sub is totally becoming r/politics.  Sorry to all for adding to the mess...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people who wouldn&#39;t be qualified to operate a gun would not want a gun in the first place. The only type that would want one are the dangerous type - trigger happy power trippers (that mexican dude who shot that black kid a few years ago comes to mind.. he wanted to be a cop but failed)</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a society I want to be apart of either. But it would damn well stop this school shooting bullshit that&#39;s occurring. Or atleast give them a fighting chance!</p>
