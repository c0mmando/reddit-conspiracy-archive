        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been working on a concept for some time, but it&#39;s not complete. I want to put it out there and see what others think about the current climate and the logical conclusion of the current climate of social and economic situations in the world generally and the United States specifically.</p>

<p>It begins with the basic idea that ownership is being removed from us. We are being gradually denied the ability to own things. Music, movies, soon our own hard drives are being replaced with cloud solutions. Mortgage restrictions leave millions of us renting -  dumping money into something we never own.</p>

<p>As we&#39;re being squeezed out of ownership, we&#39;re being squeezed out of legitimate say. Those who own dictate the laws those of us that borrow must follow.</p>

<p>This situation is untenable. It will reach a dramatic tipping point as it has in other societies. History teaches one sound lesson above all others - we have a great deal in common with snakes. When cornered, we will lash out and cause harm.</p>

<p>At this point, ownership of anything is difficult but ownership of land is still something of a possibility - there are some areas where land is still reasonable. I believe this will not be the case for much longer. I believe people who are not attempting to secure land are volunteering themselves to this inevitable future of perpetual servitude. </p>

<p>Land ownership can be taken away, don&#39;t get me wrong. But to take land requires state, county, local legislation that has not completely eroded. Yes the Supreme Court paved the way for <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/national-news/2015/06/29/the-supreme-court-decision-that-threatened-justices-own-homes">peoples land to be taken from underneath their feet</a>, but they can&#39;t do so easily. Yet.</p>

<p>My solution for the time being is land ownership. I believe it is crucial for more like-minded individuals to be a part of this process. Make no mistake, this is not a guarantee or even a good chance at avoiding the consequences or the tipping point I mentioned previously. But it&#39;s a chance.</p>

<p>When things break, and they are going to break, there will be a great deal of social upheaval. As the bottom of the ladder begins to lose stability the top must come down harder to maintain its own position. This is physics. This is also politics. </p>

<p>The more the &quot;have nots&quot; begin to shake the ladder, the more the &quot;have everythings&quot; will apply force and weight to maintain their position. They can manipulate so much from their position - but as of now, they can&#39;t fully manipulate land ownership.</p>

<p>Again, this is a working theory but one I am personally invested in. I believe others should do the same. It won&#39;t be long before time tells whether or not I&#39;m right. If I&#39;m wrong, the worst case scenario - I own land. If I&#39;m correct, then I have something that will not be possible for future generations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Land ownership was one of the pinnacle ideas of some of the Founding Fathers. They came from a land, where all was King&#39;s land.  The King owned the land, the water, and all animals within (how similar is this to today?). </p>

<p>They tried to change this and return power back to the people (true private ownership - true Sovereigns - only humans can be Sovereign - hence the Queen of England). If you own land, you can completely provide for yourself, and it&#39;s a true asset, in so many ways. The Federalists, completely subverted this Natural Law/Right (ie. self ownership and private property). </p>

<p>Here we are today, where the Federal Government owns all the land, whether directly (national parks, State parks, etc etc) or via Eminent domain (your plot of land, included - including the oversea territories). They&#39;ve stripped us all, yet... so many people asks them to be raped even more.  I really do not understand it, and the only thing I can think of is Stockholm Syndrome. </p>

<p>If you got like ~5k, buy some land. There are true benefits to it (legally and just for your own well being and protection), even if it&#39;s less than an acre, I say do it! I personally have ~150 acres.</p>

<p>Anyways, I&#39;m kind of rambling on now. Good post, OP. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Taxes are - whether we want to address this or not - a necessity. Roads don&#39;t maintain themselves. Fire and police services cost money. Taxes are a collective effort to support the social situation we are in. If there are alternatives worth shit, I haven&#39;t seen any. It&#39;s easy to say &quot;I don&#39;t want  to pay taxes&quot; but it appears much more difficult for the same person to say &quot;I volunteer to pave and maintain roads leading to my property and roads I drive on every day.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Taxation is theft, plain and simple. Government doesn&#39;t provide any of those things (nor does your tax dollars, really). They steal from you (and me) and pay their choice of private contractors, which usually they have ownership/stake in. We can do this all by ourselves (self governance and community). There are millions of people and communities who rely on each other to plow and pave private roads in the US. This may seem like a shock to you, but, the US is vast, and for the most part... rural, where communities actually band together for the &quot;common good&quot;.</p>

<p>I believe the best way to fight the system is to become independent of it. I am saving every penny I can and putting it into a homestead that I hope will be fully self sufficient within the next five years. I pray land ownership and the homestead movement becomes widespread because I see it as our best line of defense against tyranny. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Original Poster, I was thinking along these same lines. In the 1930s Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter predicted that ownership of property would become less and less common as &quot;the capitalist process&quot; transitioned into the socialist state. In this passage, for instance, he talks about how stock ownership and paper contracts of commodities would erode the idea of physical ownership of things. </p>

<p><em>&quot;The capitalist process, by substituting a mere parcel of shares for the walls of and the machines in a factory, takes the life out of the idea of property. It loosens the grip that once was so strong—the grip in the sense of the legal right and the actual ability to do as one pleases with one’s own property; the grip also in the sense that the holder of the title loses the will to fight, economically, physically, politically, for &#39;his&#39; factory and his control over it, to die if necessary on its steps. And this evaporation of what we may term the material substance of property—its visible and touchable reality—affects not only the attitude of holders but also that of the workmen and of the public in general. Dematerialized, defunctionalized and absentee ownership does not impress and call forth moral allegiance as the vital form of property did.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Just as I was reading his prediction (of the decay of the concept of property in the final stages of capitalism), I picked up a recent book called &quot;Cradle to Cradle&quot; by McDonough and Braungart, and these eco-activists were talking about the new &quot;leasing model&quot; which would be good for the environment. Instead of, say, owning your car&#39;s tires, you would &quot;lease&quot; them. Which means that, when they wear out, the company will replace them for free [and recycle the old used tire], but ownership would pass on to the company (not the purchaser). &quot;This same model could work for the very shoes on your feet! When the soles wear out, you give them back to the company and receive a new pair for free! So you&#39;d only be leasing your shoes. You wouldn&#39;t even own them.&quot; I work in economic development, and my city is enthusiastic about driverless cars, in which people will no longer own cars. They will order them up on apps. &quot;The ownership model is obsolete,&quot; they keep saying.</p>

<p>In the future, nothing will be owned by individual citizens!</p>

<p>A 1997 book I just stumbled across is called &quot;The Sovereign Individual&quot;. All the tech barons in Silicon Valley consider it a sort of second Bible. The authors predicted crypto-currencies, the rise of Islam as the new threat to the West (replacing Communism), and a number of other predictions which came true. One of the things they mention is the collapse of the &quot;ownership model&quot;. But here&#39;s the thing: 9/10ths of human rights are based on property rights.</p>

<p>What happens when the concept of &quot;property rights&quot; vanishes?</p>

<p>What we&#39;re basically facing is a Chinese-style Technocracy. In China today, they&#39;re killing political dissidents with &quot;murder vans&quot; that roll up at 3 in the morning, after which they harvest their organs and sell them on the black market. This same technocracy (that doesn&#39;t recognize human rights . . . the right to your own life, the right to your own property) also uses social media to gauge your loyalty level to the state. They have algorithms set up. Based on your remarks, they give you a grade on a sliding scale. If you&#39;re not sufficiently pro-government, you lose privileges to buy airplane tickets, you &quot;don&#39;t qualify&quot; for brand-name products in the supermarket. They even put a separate ringtone on your phone, so that people calling you know that you&#39;re a pariah. This is not something happening in the future. It&#39;s happening RIGHT NOW.</p>

<p>Basically, the tech barons who flew over to China to help them create these algorithms for censorship are bringing that mindset back to the States. Which is why we&#39;re seeing this explosion of censorship here.</p>

<p>The Cultural Marxists in Silicon Valley don&#39;t believe in &quot;property rights,&quot; or &quot;freedom of speech,&quot; or any of the other liberal institutions that made the west so vibrant and unique. </p>

<p>We&#39;re being slowly conditioned to think that &quot;property&quot; is obsolete. That we should own nothing. Why? </p>

<p>Because when we finally accept this mindset, then we will lose the very basis of our privacy rights, our speech rights: our HUMAN rights. </p>

<p>And then the State will own YOU. </p>
