       I am normally the person who completely discards the government, having seen firsthand how stupid and pointless politicians and bureaucrats are.
      </p>
      <p>
       The liberal media and all of these de facto communist/socialist movements have nearly pushed me to the edge of just signing my soul over to the conservative side. Like, the liberal side has completely gone bonkers. The right is riddled with corruption, jerrymandering, and profiteering and

       But you people have completely lost your mind.

       Also, conservative women are way hotter; no one wants a feminist lesbian shorty.

       Not sure this is the right sub but one thing I’m noticing besides the constant putting down of men in society over the last few years is the “we want equality” movement that everyone seems to be wound up in.
      </p>

       But instead of acting as part of the collective, these people holding signs want special treatment and attention.

       Being a classic liberal is more aligned with modern conservatism than it is the radical socialism of the current Democratic Party. I’m assuming that’s what you really mean by Liberal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, the Democratic Party was hijacked a long time ago and now resembles a wasteland of California nut jobs and foreign interests intent on doing our nation harm through fear mongering, institutional infiltration and public paranoia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Democratic Party no longer represents the small government, small farms and small businesses that the Party founder, Thomas Jefferson, believed in.

       You say Democratic Party, but you are also leaving out the so called "progressives". They are just as much as cancer and a part of all this Cultural Marxism. I do agree with you on Classic Liberalism, though. I consider myself more aligned with them, meaning, "mind your business". If I'm not bothering anyone else, don't bother me. But, then... that would be very much the ethos of a Voluntaryist, which I consider myself. Don't fuck with me, and I won't fuck with you.

       workers owning means of production. Socialism: a political and economic theory of social organization that advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.

      <p>
       In what way are the dems "radical socialists"? The same dems that when they had power gave us a right wing health care plan with a super majority and serve wall street and the military industrial complex and big business in general usually? Doesnt sound very socialist to me

       So what you just said is also the meaning, colloquially, of communism. Democrats do want what you just described as socialism; the HC bill you just referenced was made during a locked congress and as such the conservatives had more sway in saying what the bill would be. It it wasn’t for them we would have gotten just that - socialist HC which would have been 100x worse on price and cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       You conflated two things to try and make a point you shouldn’t have tried to make because you’re wrong.  The modern Dem party is run by extreme socialists that want to curtail free markets with regulations that redistribute wealth while implementing new and grossly overbloated institutions and agencies to “help” the plebeian common man through leveraging control over capital.

       lol I didn’t say they were successful socialists. That’s no less their ideology.  It starts with union control of things and slowly works into nationalizing businesses. They just haven’t been able to.

      <p>
       Not quite sure what your deal is with trying to deny the ideology of a Party simply because example of their success don’t exist in pure ideological form.

       there is no evidence that their ideology is socialist, you dodge this by saying they just havent been able to get anything done, bernie is more left leaning but even he isnt socialist, and the dems cheated bernie in favor of their more pro corporate clinton

       Quite the opposite, actually, hence the saying. You never heard it? You must not get out too much. It's a saying about a beautiful women's looks hiding her strength (ie. beautiful and strong - not like the barbie doll "princesses" in Holly Wood). Seriously, get out from the basement more often. Get some fresh air, or something...

       What? Most of those women don't look considerably worse without make-up though? I'd even say Kim K, Katy Perry, Katie Holmes, Jennifer Aniston, Hillary Duff, Eva Longoria, Amanda Seyfried, Tyra Banks, Cameron Diaz, Julianne Hough, and Courtney Cox look exactly like you'd expect them to without makeup and are still really attractive without it. Are you honestly saying that looking at those women you don't find any of them attractive?
      </p>
      <p>
       Kunis, Klum, and Lopez are the only ones that make surprisingly heap leaps and even then it's possible it''s just a bad photo on a bad day rather than they're unattractive without makeup.

       None of them are attractive to me, no. Why? Because it's not just about physical beauty, it's everything... looks, personality, morals, etc etc. None of which, Holly Wood actresses actually have. They are whores, imo... To each their own, though... I wouldn't care too much to put my dick in the same hole, that Harvey Weinstein put his in...

       Literally none of that has anything to do with your claim that without makeup they're not attractive though. You said they're all "butter faces" which suggests you don't find them physically attractive, and physical beauty is what the conversation was about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming they weren't celebrities and you knew absolutely nothing about these women, would you still think they weren't attractive if you just passed them on the street?

       I just want to clarify by attractive I don't mean that you personally have to be attracted to them. Just if you acknowledge that they're good-looking? A person doesn't have to be your preference and you don't have to be attracted to them to acknowledge they're attractive (kind of like how I can say Brad Pitt is attractive without being attracted to him).
      </p>
      <p>
       I just feel like there's a miscommunication here because in your last comment you said being attractive isn't about "physical beauty" ,which seems to imply you think they're good-looking, but now you're saying you don't think they're good looking?

        None of them are attractive to me, no. Why? Because it's not just about physical beauty, it's everything... looks, personality, morals, etc etc. None of which, Holly Wood actresses actually have. They are whores, imo... To each their own, though... I wouldn't care too much to put my dick in the same hole, that Harvey Weinstein put his in...

       That comment just seemed to strongly imply you found them physically beautiful but weren't attracted to them despite of this. Surely you see my confusion there because I didn't understand why you'd say "it's not just about physical beauty" if you didn't even find any of them physically beautiful?

       Put down the bong or Adderall. I don't find any of them physically beautiful nor am I attracted to anyone of them. Have a lovely night.

       I don't do either but okay. I'm not saying you do, all I was saying is your comment seemed to contradict that and was just confused why it changed from "i don't find them attractive because it's not about physical beauty" to "I don't find them attractive because they're not physically beautiful". Like I said, surely you can understand why I misunderstood you. You have a good one too.

       It really doesn't matter but I'm legitimately curious, is there a reason you're calling it "
       <em>
        Holly Wood
       </em>
       " instead of "
       <em>
        Hollywood
