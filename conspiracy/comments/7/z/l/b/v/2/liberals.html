<p>The liberal media and all of these de facto communist/socialist movements have nearly pushed me to the edge of just signing my soul over to the conservative side.

    <div class="md"><p>So what you just said is also the meaning, colloquially, of communism. Democrats do want what you just described as socialism; the HC bill you just referenced was made during a locked congress and as such the conservatives had more sway in saying what the bill would be. It it wasn’t for them we would have gotten just that - socialist HC which would have been 100x worse on price and cost. </p>

<p>You conflated two things to try and make a point you shouldn’t have tried to make because you’re wrong.  The modern Dem party is run by extreme socialists that want to curtail free markets with regulations that redistribute wealth while implementing new and grossly overbloated institutions and agencies to “help” the plebeian common man through leveraging control over capital. </p>

<p>Quite the opposite, actually, hence the saying. You never heard it? You must not get out too much.

    <div class="md"><p>What? Most of those women don&#39;t look considerably worse without make-up though? I&#39;d even say Kim K, Katy Perry, Katie Holmes, Jennifer Aniston, Hillary Duff, Eva Longoria, Amanda Seyfried, Tyra Banks, Cameron Diaz, Julianne Hough, and Courtney Cox look exactly like you&#39;d expect them to without makeup and are still really attractive without it. Are you honestly saying that looking at those women you don&#39;t find any of them attractive? </p>

<p>Kunis, Klum, and Lopez are the only ones that make surprisingly heap leaps and even then it&#39;s possible it&#39;&#39;s just a bad photo on a bad day rather than they&#39;re unattractive without makeup. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Literally none of that has anything to do with your claim that without makeup they&#39;re not attractive though. You said they&#39;re all &quot;butter faces&quot; which suggests you don&#39;t find them physically attractive, and physical beauty is what the conversation was about. </p>

<p>Assuming they weren&#39;t celebrities and you knew absolutely nothing about these women, would you still think they weren&#39;t attractive if you just passed them on the street?</p>

<p>To be perfectly honest? Yes, I most likely would. I already told you, I don&#39;t find any of them attractive. I have a preference for women, and so do you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to clarify by attractive I don&#39;t mean that you personally have to be attracted to them. Just if you acknowledge that they&#39;re good-looking? A person doesn&#39;t have to be your preference and you don&#39;t have to be attracted to them to acknowledge they&#39;re attractive (kind of like how I can say Brad Pitt is attractive without being attracted to him).</p>

<p>I just feel like there&#39;s a miscommunication here because in your last comment you said being attractive isn&#39;t about &quot;physical beauty&quot; ,which seems to imply you think they&#39;re good-looking, but now you&#39;re saying you don&#39;t think they&#39;re good looking? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit, dude. You are way overthinking this, which is bizarre as fuck. No, I do not find any of them attractive, beautiful, or pretty. How many times do I have to say it? Are you that fuckin&#39; bored, or something?</p>

<p>That comment just seemed to strongly imply you found them physically beautiful but weren&#39;t attracted to them despite of this. Surely you see my confusion there because I didn&#39;t understand why you&#39;d say &quot;it&#39;s not just about physical beauty&quot; if you didn&#39;t even find any of them physically beautiful?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t do either but okay. I&#39;m not saying you do, all I was saying is your comment seemed to contradict that and was just confused why it changed from &quot;i don&#39;t find them attractive because it&#39;s not about physical beauty&quot; to &quot;I don&#39;t find them attractive because they&#39;re not physically beautiful&quot;. Like I said, surely you can understand why I misunderstood you. You have a good one too.</p>
