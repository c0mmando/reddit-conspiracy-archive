<p>You believe every conspiracy BUT trump and Russia. </p>

<p>9/11 being an inside job? Yup that’s true for you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does this media invented  Trump and Russia collusion farce exactly get you if Trump was a chosen swamp candidate and the elite endorsed him over HRC? what is the sum game of that? 
in this sub, we look at the bigger picture: There was deepstate tit for tat about who the Elite wanted to hold the presidential seat. HRC was not their pick, the media continued to make it seem like HRC was not discarded like rag in place of Trump. Everything you witnessed was theatre on TV. The elite do not prosecute their own whether Trump or Kushner or HRC or W. Bush. They never will.</p>

<p>Stop being a gullible fool. They will NEVER produce any collusion story warrants or prosecution even if it happened. Instead, enjoy daily  your shooting stories and CNN ratings distraction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A 30 minute delay would be beyond worthless for surveillance and from a technical standpoint it would be considerably more difficult to set a long delay like that instead of a live feed or very short delay for recording purposes.
