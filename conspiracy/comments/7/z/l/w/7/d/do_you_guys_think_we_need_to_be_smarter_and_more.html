<p>That being said: that doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t just tell you &quot;eat a dick&quot; or &quot;those documents don&#39;t exist&quot; or &quot;we lost it&quot;. But a coordinated effort along with a coordinated pressure on social media together would be better at forcing their hand than one person with a clever idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A FOIA portal like this already exists: MuckRock.com</p>

<p>MuckRock is the best site for FOIA, even though most of their writers are
unreliable narrator liberal extremist Hillary voters who&#39;re proud to wear
blinders because they Want To Believe the pee-pee tapes are real because they
hate Trump more than they care about an unbiased lens of truth.</p>

<p>But I still read MuckRock a few times per week to keep up. Occasionally they
really do dislodge some shocking top secret documents from the Deep State&#39;s
mountain of Too Many Secrets. But the secrets they do unearth are mainly
background filler for further research that only gives you a glimpse of the
shadow but not an actual peak at the Monster.</p>

<p>The biggest downside of MuckRock and FOIA in general is that you have to use
your real name and address to request documents from FedGov. So if you
request some particularly juicy and scandalous document, then the MiB&#39;s have
your dox to look up your Patterns of Life in PRISM and &quot;task&quot; you for
Parallel Construction using any of the likely dozens of laws you&#39;ve broken
going about your daily life to shut you down before you can get very far.</p>

<p>Like another commenter said, FOIA is fake as hell, since FedGov can keep
anything it wants classified forever for any reason, so you&#39;ll never get any
smoking gun documents out of it.</p>

<p>But the worst thing about FOIA isn&#39;t even that it&#39;s futile and self-defeating,
it&#39;s that FOIA becomes a weapon against whistleblowers and leakers like Snowden
and Assange. FOIA creates another layer of pointless legal hoops, and captures
many of the few journalists who specialize in exposing the Covert World, by tricking
them into playing along with Kafkaesque rules. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, journalists want the image of legitimacy for their work, so when
FedGov says &quot;no, you can&#39;t have that document, but here&#39;s one redacted page about it&quot;,
it tricks journalists to accept being shut down.</p>

<p>i.e. &quot;Oh, okay, if I pursue this lead anymore, I will be breaking the Law by
exposing Classified information, so I better just shut up and wait a few
decades until FedGov declassifies it.&quot;</p>

<p>This FOIA trap also sabotages journalists by creating a big incentive for them
to NOT report about the content of leaks and to not use those leaks to make
FOIA requests for whatever the leaks revealed.</p>

<p>Because if a well known &quot;FOIA Ninja&quot; journalists pisses off FedGov by requesting
documents named in, oh say the footnotes of certain Snowden leaks, then FedGov will
just reject all of their FOIA requests, ending their niche career by preventing them
from getting scoops.</p>

<p>Jason Leopold calls himself a &quot;FOIA Ninja&quot;, but I once asked him &quot;if someone
gave you the Snowden documents, would you publish them?&quot;</p>

<p>He said &quot;no.&quot;</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that sad?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a journalist who&#39;s entire persona is based on getting access to Top
Secret documents to write about them for general audiences, but he would reject
the biggest scoop in history because he knows if he did, then FedGov would put
him on the shitlist and reject every FOIA request he ever made for the rest of
his life.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I no longer trust anything Jason Leopold writes, because he let
himself become co-opted by Deep State in exchange for chump change and now
effectively serves as Langley&#39;s unwitting propagandist.</p>
