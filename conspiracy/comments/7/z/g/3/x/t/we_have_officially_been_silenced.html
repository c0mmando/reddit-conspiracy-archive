In that time I&#39;ve used trusty Google and Youtube to do the vast majority of my research...there has never been a time in those 11 years that I&#39;ve noticed what I&#39;m noticing now.  Google &quot;Florida school shooting hoax&quot; see what comes up.  Pages upon pages of CNN, MSNBC, TIME, FOX, Snopes, USAToday etc etc...keep hitting next page...same sh@t!  Go to Youtube, search same topic, absolutely nothing.  When did this blatant censorship and banning of any info contrary to official stories really start happening?  Looking back I want to say it really started becoming obvious during the Primaries between Clinton and Trump and Pizzagate.  Is this what we should expect going forward...how does anyone spread ideas with everything locked down like we live in communist China?  America the free my ass...  </p>

Then it doesnt really matter any more if you can find some info or not, because you already know that the new horrible thing that has happened, is fake or just orchestrated and serves a agenda. I dont even pay any attention to the shootings, politics etc, its all show, its all bullshit and it doesnt really matter what are the details, you can get lost in the details. Just my .02c. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Convincing people to stop paying attention is goal #1 of the KGB propaganda playbook, you really need to watch Aleksandr Dugin&#39;s lectures on youtube. (He&#39;s the author of Foundations of Geopolitics). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t trust but a tiny handful of our governing authorities either, but that has always been the case. </p>

<p>And I&#39;ve been into politics since the mid-Reagan era. </p>

<p>Never before had I seen the degree of white-noise media exhaustion that I have witnessed these last 3 years. </p>

<p>And I was <em>glued</em> to CNN for 3 solid months after 9/11. </p>

<p>And it wasn&#39;t until a friend of mine showed me some of Dugin&#39;s lectures that I realized that the overstimulation and semantic satiation present is <em>exactly</em> in line with Cold War Russian propaganda techniques developed initially on their own people, and reaching a point of terrifying competence that helped propel that sociopath Putin into high office. </p>

<p>The parallels between the Russian media during his rise to power, the events and the dissemination of them, exactly mirror the established media patterns that exposed troll farms use. </p>

<p>This is too much to be a coincidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only when we forget they are the minority. </p>

<p>The problem is that we as humanity <em>hunger</em> for a &#39;hated other&#39; that we can heap all of our problems on and cast stones of impotent frustration against. </p>

<p>We <em>want</em> it to be a singular entity responsible for all problems instead of what truly is at the root: a massively complex geopolitical system of power brokers and individual engagers that all have their own intents and goals. </p>

<p>So we call the enemy &#39;the alt-right&#39;, or &#39;the libtards&#39;, or &#39;SJWs&#39; or &#39;Neckbeards&#39;, or &#39;pro-unborn-baby-murderers&#39; or &#39;womb dictators&#39; and we select people with matching ideologies and they become in our mind no longer people, but instead a &#39;hated other&#39; with little distinction between its members. </p>

<p>And since they are no longer human to us, we are free to heap our scorn and violence on them because &#39;they aren&#39;t actually really people&#39;. </p>

<p>This is some of the oldest cultural programming in our monkey minds, before even words or song we banded together to kill the &#39;hated other&#39; and take their territory and food. </p>

<p>Unless we can get beyond this animalistic tribal tendency, we will never have a world free of brutality committed on our fellow man in the name of a ephemeral ideology.  </p>

<p>Fuck if I know, if I did I&#39;d be a world power right now. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can people tell what&#39;s an objective perspective anymore?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, through rigorous diligence, and the most brutal of rational examination. It is painful because this act strips of us our self-delusions. </p>

<p>Which is why so few do it. </p>

<p>Because we see ourselves for what we are, under all of our justifications, all of our excuses, and most people are afraid of what they&#39;d see. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it did, and so have several other experts. </p>

<p>The thing is, there is a texture to actual conspiracies that everyone overlooks. </p>

<p>They usually aren&#39;t sensational. </p>

<p>Check the wikipedia article on confirmed conspiracies, and you will notice several features that 911, pizzagate, and buttery males seem to lack. </p>

<p>Namely ambiguity, diverse motives, and imperfect action engagement. </p>

<p>That&#39;s because human organizations are diverse things filled with people with different motives and prone to human failure. </p>

<p>The sensational conspiracy theories I mentioned above lack <em>all of these things</em>. </p>

<p>The way their proponents present them it&#39;s as if a single overarching consciousness with perfect awareness and perfect execution were controlling all aspects of the conspiracy. </p>

<p>And as long as more than 1 person is involved, this is basically an impossibility. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s one that tinfoil hatters like you keep insisting upon. </p>

<p>I have been deep in the conspiracy community since before the internet was even commercially available, and frankly people like you give us legit conspiracy researchers a very, very bad name. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well according to your very profound and thought provoking reply, most if not all perceived &quot;conspiracies&quot; would be nearly impossible. Oh you were deep into conspiracies before internet was commercially available... So oh wise one, please enlighten me as to what are the true conspiracies that meet your strick criteria listed above? Oh, I can&#39;t wait to hear this.</p>

<p>No, just most. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t really want to know, and even then what I would tell you would be meaningless to you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just wanted your expert opinion on what the true conspiracies are...I mean those that don’t involve more than one person...you know because if it did involve more than one person it would be almost impossible to carry out because human organisms are diverse things filled with different motives and prone to human failure. So if you’re going to say tinfoil hatters like myself give conspiracy researchers like yourself s bad name...by all means shine your light down on us bottom feeders...if you’re not willing to share any examples of “real conspiracies” that fit your guidelines, keep your psychological interpretation/analysis BS and meaningless rhetoric to yourself and STFU! I mean why are you here then...so you can sit on your pedestal and talk down to those that aren’t at your perceived intellectual level?</p>
