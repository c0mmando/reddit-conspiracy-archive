<p>Planned Parenthood (funded by the fucking taxpayers, don&#39;t even get me started on this) $38 million.</p>

<p>No the problem is we no longer live in a democracy, we live in a corporatocracy. The laws are written to placate powerful lobbyists like the NRA, not the will of the people. The majority of Americans want sane gun regulations, so their children can be safe like UK and Australian school kids. But the NRA blocks these laws to protect gun manufacturer&#39;s profits. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All rights have limits. Even the most &#39;extremist&#39; judges in american history have generally ruled that &quot;make no law&quot; doesn&#39;t actually mean make no law. Just as you can&#39;t yell fire in a crowded building, or as you can&#39;t own an M240B, all rights similarly have their limits. </p>

<p>It gets further complicated because amendments use words like &quot;unreasonable&quot; &quot;infamous&quot; &quot;speedy&quot; &quot;excessive&quot; &quot;cruel.&quot; All these words are nebulous, and must be interpreted, which necessarily means that the right they support can not be absolute.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are purposefully conflating a legal term known as brandishing a weapon with a broad description in flashing one that obviously meant something other than training a weapon on someone. I never even said it had to be unholstered. But you took what you wanted to out of it and tried playing the sanctimony card.</p>

<p>If you knew the first thing about gun laws you would know they are different from state to state and even by jurisdiction. But that for something to be considered brandishing generally there has to be unsafe handling of the weapon or a threat to use it. If you had the first iota of knowledge your own idiotic scenario above of training a gun on someone you would be guilty in many places of a crime. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure I think that sounds reasonable. Hunting is different though because some shots are taken at longer distances. I don&#39;t think you&#39;d consider fighting the federal government a result of tyranny like you hear people talk about.

<p>I think it&#39;s good to be allowed to have guns as a civilian if only for the threat, however small, it poses to any hostile takeover of any kind. It&#39;s something that has to be taken into consideration by any group that wanted to try and force the country into any form of tyranny. It&#39;s all about personal defense and to a lesser extent hunting, but if a powerful enough group wants you dead you&#39;ll be dead soon enough regardless of what guns you own. </p>

A longer barrel will throw the weight of the gun towards the front, and eventually, become too hard to hold steady due to the center of mass being so far forward.  In addition, the iron sights are further apart on rifles which allows them to be aimed more accurately.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Knowing full well that I&#39;m about to be downvoted into oblivion, here&#39;s your answer: because people like Alex Jones and all those who buy into his brand of bullshit have been peddling the &quot;crisis actor&quot; and &quot;false flag&quot; conspiracy theories for years.</p>

<p>To me, asking this question on this sub is kind of like going to a gas station and asking why in the world everybody seems to be refueling their cars.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a theory I hope we&#39;ll all take a minute to consider, especially if you&#39;re a proponent of the crisis actor theories. What if the false flag theories and the crisis actor accusations are being manufactured by special interest groups like the NRA and others in order to deliberately shift the conversation away from potentially damaging their profit margins? Is this not, at the very least, just as plausible and logical as the idea that crisis actors are being used in staged attacks to usurp our gun rights? If you&#39;ll humor that, why wouldn&#39;t you also humor the idea that the false flag stuff is also potentially a massive deception? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, but if false flags work (which you&#39;re saying they do), then why can&#39;t you acknowledge that false flag theories themselves could be reverse engineered and used as a clever form of mass manipulation? Let&#39;s coin a new term: &quot;false flag false flags.&quot; </p>

<p>If you believe that 9/11 could be successfully faked/orchestrated to such a massive scale and that thousands upon thousands of collaborators could carry out such an enormous operation, then certainly you must also be willing to accept that false flag theories themselves could be manufactured and used for nefarious purposes. </p>

<p>Why is it so easy to say, &quot;Coincidence? I think not&quot; about something like 9/11, but not about the suggestion that it serves someone&#39;s agenda to have false flag theories springing up within minutes of every single mass casualty event in America?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because there’s no obvious conspiracy there. The kid that everyone joked about being most likely to shoot up a school went and shot up a school. We’re quick to jump down the throats of fbi, leos , but there’s plenty we don’t know and plenty we know they can’t do everything about. </p>

<p>Calls to police: were reports filed for each one? For any of them? Who has access to these? Clearly they had no effect on a criminal record of any kind. </p>

<p>FBI: did they investigate the YouTube comment well enough? Did they just think he was a dumb angsty teen and call it a day? Is there anything they could have done anyway since the comment didn’t give grounds for a warrant? Did they talk to local cops about the kid or get informed about the visits to his house? Is there anything that actually could have been done?</p>

<p>Of course the event is going to be politicized, they happen far too often to have any real shock value anymore. Shit like this is a god-send to gun-control proponents, and playing into baseless crisis actor theories makes it way way easier to cast aside more legitimate criticism because they can make it seem like if you aren’t in favor of gun control, you must believe that this event never happened, when it very very clearly did.  My personal thoughts on the Hogg kid: There really isn’t anything fishy about a kid that wants to be a journalist being eager to do interviews with well known journalists after he gets a second chance to go viral. And shit like that post about the kids “partying like rockstars” because they smiled for a damn photo at a news station?? As if it’s impossible for a high schooler to be desensitized, or smile for a photo, or have any kind of eloquent thought in their head because they survived a school shooting. </p>

<p>I think every now and then some really interesting and thought provoking posts pop up on this sub, but look at what info we have that is 100% known. A 19 year old with violent history, history of trouble with school, history of trouble with police, with evidence of premeditation, used a legally purchased rifle to kill 17 people and injure 13 others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because - The FBI effectively oversees jurisdiction for over 300 million americans, it can be difficult assessing which threats are REAL and which threats are TROLLS, piggy-backing off of the over-reactive social media state. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s ironic that two unrelated, not that significant, things typically happen after a school shooting:</p>

<p>1: Gun, ammo and accessory sales go up. 
2: False Alarms (shootings, bomb threat, hit lists, revenge accusations) made by students also rise.  </p>

<p>In the panhandle of Fl (no where near parkland), over the past week, the local school districts have had several incidents of false reports, including a report from Gulf Breeze suggesting that a (student had his/her &quot;hit list&quot; discovered)[<a href="http://weartv.com/news/local/santa-rosa-county-school-officials-discuss-safety-task-force-after-rumors-of-hit-list">http://weartv.com/news/local/santa-rosa-county-school-officials-discuss-safety-task-force-after-rumors-of-hit-list</a>] - but there was no hit list. False Alarms.  In addition to false threats, there are still real threats, like IDK - a (13-yr old girl bringing a gun and knife to school)[<a href="http://weartv.com/news/local/leavenworth-02-15-2018">http://weartv.com/news/local/leavenworth-02-15-2018</a>] for show and tell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We spent $71 billion for homeland security (which is specifically to keep the country safe from the inside) in 2012 and you can guarantee between inflation and time, we&#39;re spending far more than that now, and that&#39;s just what&#39;s reported, considering 10 years before that, the HS budget was $17b.  If you don&#39;t have enough resources to check into things like people threatening schools with that kind a money, there&#39;s a problem. Between CBP, FBI, NSA, DOD, Customs, DTS, TSA, and CIA, if we can&#39;t look into threats (false or not) of shootings/bombings/whatever in our own schools, that&#39;s a problem. Yet, we still have every single ink made within the U.S. since 1925 and an entire lab/group of people to analyze it down to the area it came from, to track down people who write threats against the president and mail them, but people who go online and threaten entire schools full of children, with easily traceable IP&#39;s, not a single person looks into it. They know easily who makes the threats but don&#39;t do a single thing about it, not even a phone call. I get that resources are limited to an extent but we employ tens of thousands of people specifically to look into these of things. They won&#39;t catch every single person, but if the FBI alone was contacted 29 times about the kid from the Parkland shooting and they didn&#39;t look into it not even once, it&#39;s a problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real issue that everyone keeps overlooking is this should&#39;ve been handled locally before a school shooting and before the FBI&#39;s involvement.  He was troubled, people knew he was troubled, he had been kicked out of school, and sheriff&#39;s had shown up over 30 times to his place. Yet I don&#39;t hear anyone talking about that. All I hear is gun control, David Hogg, FBI.  The community needs to have some responsibility. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before I get into it, I need to say that the FBI absolutely should have looked into Cruz. They should have tried to intervene. </p>

<p>However, what could they have actually done? Much (if not all) of what&#39;s been reported Cruz said online is actually protected speech. If the FBI were knock down his door then that&#39;d (rightly) piss a lot of people off. </p>

<p>So what was the FBI&#39;s course here? As I said, I do believe they have a course.. but what was it? Could the FBI had talked with the parents and tried to get them to convince this kid to get a mental health evaluation? Could the school had done something? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, but I do know that we should try and avoid the FBI knocking down your door because you said things that, while fucked up, were protected under the constitution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While that may be true the uk is no paradise and the knife crime and gangs are as bad as the US when walking the streets.  when you support   gun control it’s only going to be for me and you, the politicians celebrity’s, rich are still going to have guns to protect them selfs ever see a truck used to kill 50 people? Did you know being a cop is not even a top 10 dangerous job. We give up guns and it does nothing but usher in a police state. Why do you think it&#39;s at the local level? The federal government is not scared of guns because they have guns beat with technology. The fight is at the local level. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A Youtube comment that had his name but no other identifying information. Is that supposed to be grounds for an arrest? Search and seizure perhaps? </p>

<p>Should Youtube hand over all the information about their users every time somebody says something that could be construed as illegal? Think of the ramifications. You tell somebody &quot;kys&quot; in a sarcastic manner in some memey thread and then you have police kicking in your door because you threatened somebody&#39;s life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you! That&#39;s exactly why people are clamoring for common sense gun laws. It&#39;s far too easy for very suspicious people to get guns.
