       The history of U.S. labor disputes is
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_worker_deaths_in_United_States_labor_disputes">
        rife with abuse
       </a>
       by companies perpetrated against the working class, and the state does little if anything to prevent it. Hell, they're
       <em>
        responsible
       </em>
       for several of the worst examples (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre">
        Ludlow massacre, anyone?
       </a>
       )!
      </p>
      <p>
       Companies frequently buy legislation, bribe their way into court injunctions, even ones directly abridging your first amendment rights. Watching the documentary
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5TYSXN0aXs">
        Harlan County, U.S.A
       </a>
       , early on they mention an injunction made preventing picketers from even calling strikebreakers "scabs!" Such an obvious first amendment violation, but what does it matter? It'll take years in court, and Duke Power's got a mighty warchest. The workers in the documentary didn't even have running water.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is the constitution
       <em>
        working
       </em>
       . There's no way to prevent dipshit politicians passing illegal laws, so the best case scenario is  that when it does happen it works its way through the court system. Again, this takes time, it takes money, and all the while you're reliant on the hope that the court isn't corrupt too! And you're hoping you can last out against a team of lawyers more expensive than you could ever dream to afford. You've got no power.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ever wonder why you've got such a raw deal, this is why. You've got no leverage, the state breaks up whatever you can do to
       <em>
        gain
       </em>
       leverage, and you take the shit deal you got. The whole goddamn system was written top to bottom and all the way back up to rig it like this. Everything in our whole goddamn society is framed to get you all to look away from this and blame some random symptom of the rotten disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure someone somewhere reading this thinks "Heh, I've got a sweet deal, I've got
       <em>
        valuable skills
       </em>
       ," but learn from history. You're not worth dick on your own, and when it comes to replacing you when you get too expensive it'll always be a cost-benefit analysis. Tick-tock until someone else does it cheaper...

       You have the ultimate power in this - the power to vote.  The masses put this system in place - why?  Because it is easy and because for the vast majority of people, it works.

       Are there exceptions?  You bet.  Are there corrupt judges, congressman, and even school board members?  Yep, just like there are corrupt company executives, police officers, and union officials.

       I'm not nihilistic, buddy, I'm pointing out why things are the way they are. I'm trying to tell people to learn from history. Believe what you want, but don't ignore facts, and the facts are that the deck isn't just

       , but the whole damn game was written so you'd lose. That doesn't mean

       We can't vote - it's rigged, so that's out.

       We can't work for companies - they cheat and steal - so jobs are out.

       We can't have banks - cheaters/theives , so no money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Companies are more powerful, so they own too much - so property rights are out the door.
      </p>

       So we end up with no property, no form of exchange, no one in control, and jobless.  Sounds like a utopia.

       Yes, I am being sarcastic.  My beliefs are based on

       gleaned from
       <strong>
        MY
       </strong>
       considerable reading.  Corporations are made up of PEOPLE.  They are not some unknown machine somewhere, dictating policy.  These are actual people, doing what they think is right.  Yes, sometimes they get corrupted, or they get in a shit situation due to some idiot doing stupid things, and then cover them up (they thought this was the right thing at the time.)
      </p>
      <p>
       These people have faces.  These people have families, dreams, desires.  These people go to work, and they are not gathering around a smoke filled room, rubbing their hands together in glee as they brainstorm new ways to ruin all these poor people's lives.

       I am a skeptic, which is why I come here.  I don't believe anything any one tells me.  And history tells me there is not some kind of faceless cabal out to get us for their own private enjoyment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evil people do not think they are doing evil.  They think they are making the world a better place.  Just because their idea of a better place involves more security and less freedom, or more stability in  pay/jobs/business over variation in sales/production doesn't mean they are "wrong", it means they think differently.

       I can't dictate a feasible solution for all of humanity, but I would suggest we start with a decentralized system of democracy that is truly representative of us all. For example, an idea like
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_politics">
        Participatory Politics
       </a>
       , which seeks to organize democracy into tiers of nested councils, each limited to a small number of people. I.e. you and your fifty closest neighbors discuss issues and elect representation to another tier of fifty such representatives, and so on, until the entire nation is represented. A perfect idea? I'm not saying that, nor that it is incorruptible, but I think it's on the right track and a good place to start.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There are innumerable ideologies where the workers work for themselves, ranging from market-based solutions like
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_market_anarchism">
        Left-Wing Market Anarchism
       </a>
       (which essentially is capitalism with severe restriction on state-based privilege i.e. incorporation, limiting people mostly to capital which they use directly rather than abstract holdings a world away) all the way to anarcho-socialist solutions such as
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism">
        anarcho-syndicalism
       </a>
       where the workers themselves own the workplace, directly or via their unions. Again, perfect? No, certainly, but there are a wealth of ideas to be drawn upon from these ideologies and so many more.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Companies are more powerful, so they own too much - so property rights are out the door.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If you look into the left wing anarchism I mentioned, you'll see that these are the original anarchist philosophers. Perhaps it's worth examining the idea of
       <em>
        limiting
       </em>
       property rights, because unrestricted capitalism inevitably yields distortion of the political and economic system? Their ideas are so incredibly similar to modern libertarianism with the singular exception that its modern strain supports unrestricted capital ownership, which only seems to benefit corporations and oligarchs.
      </p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Did I say there was a faceless cabal? My beliefs are not so childish. I simply believe that the owners of these corporations, their shareholders, their agents, they all share similar class interests which exist in diametric opposition to those of the working class. They do not act or engage in any coordinated manner as if directed by some central force, but rather in a more chaotic way they trend in a particular direction. They benefit when wages are low. They benefit when we are disorganized. They benefit when we are uneducated. That does not mean they conspire, specifically, to achieve that end. And it's certainly not for
       <em>
        enjoyment
       </em>
       but because they trend towards consolidation of power and increased security for their general future.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, that being said, since this
       <em>
        is

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       , let's move past the American labor movement and look at the regime change efforts of the U.S. Government abroad. Guatemala in 1954, overthrown at the behest of the United Fruit Company to prevent land reforms to benefit the peasantry... Chile in 1973, as Allende wished to nationalize the copper industry (which was under the stranglehold of American multinational ITT Corporation...), Iran overthrown to prevent the nationalization of BP... Grenada, Panama, Nicaragua, so many others... I'm not saying that there is a central cabal or cohesive conspiracy, but the CIA has absolutely been a tool of the state utilized to oppress the working class worldwide, whenever they try to use your solution of voting for change.

       Wow.  A lot to digest.  I have saved this to read further - I'm at work today, so can I come back later and ask questions?
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple of questions on the first segment on elections.  This would take roughly 14,500 elections, in series, to elect Congress - obviously undoable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I assume that you would need to eliminate state representation, or would that be OK to have uneven number of peoples per Representative?  If the latter, then the number of elections in a series would necessarily be much higher in large population states.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would that streamline?

      <p>
       I don't see what's so undoable about it, especially with modern technology to assist. That being said, I have no clue how to proceed with implementation, which is why I just want to spread awareness that ideas like this exist. Even if they are unworkable on their own, I think there are still useful elements that can be drawn upon to develop a form of democracy that allows each voter meaningful participation. I find parpolity appealing because you essentially only ever have to speak to and convince a small group of people in order to have an impact, as opposed to now where each representative is beholden to over 750,000 constituents.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Also, I assume that you would need to eliminate state representation, or would that be OK to have uneven number of peoples per Representative? If the latter, then the number of elections in a series would necessarily be much higher in large population states.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm not sure how this point is addressed by advocates of parpolity, but my understanding is that it obviates the need for a state level governmental structure and is intended to replace all levels of government.

        This essay
       </a>
       by Aaron Swartz (the guy who worked on Reddit) was my first exposure to the idea, and he says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        One of the most compelling visions for rebooting democracy adopts this system of abstraction for politics. Parpolity, developed by the political scientist Stephen Shalom, would build a legislature out of a hierarchical series of nested councils. Agreeing with Madison, he says each council should be small enough that everyone can engage in face-to-face discussion but large enough that there is a diversity of opinion and the number of councils is minimized. He estimates the right size is 25 to 50 people.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, to begin with, let us imagine a council of you and your 40 closest neighbors?perhaps the other people in your apartment building or on your block. You get together every so often to discuss the issues that concern you and your neighborhood. And you may vote to set policy for the area which the council covers.
       </p>
       <p>
        But your council has another function: it selects one of its own to send as a representative to the next council up. There the process repeats itself: the representative from your block and its 40 closest neighbors meet every so often to discuss the political issues that concern the area. And, of course, your representative reports back to the group, gets your recommendations on difficult questions, and takes suggestions for issues to raise at the next area council meeting.
       </p>
       <p>
        By the power of exponents, just five levels of councils, each consisting of only fifty people, is enough to cover over three hundred million people. But?and this is the truly clever bit?at the area council the whole process repeats itself. Just as each block council nominates a representative to the area council, each area council nominates a representative to the city council, and each city council to the state council, each state council to the national council, and so on.
       </p>
       <p>
        Shalom discusses a number of further details?provisions for voting, recalls, and delegation?but it?s the idea of nesting that?s key. Under such a system, there are only four representatives who stand between you and the people setting national policy, each of whom is forced to account to their constituents in regular, small face-to-face meetings. Politicians in such a system could not be elected through empty appeals to mass emotions. Instead, they would have to sit down, face-to-face, with a council of their peers and persuade them that they are best suited to represent their interests and positions.

       The more I think about it, the angrier I'm getting. Here's thought experiment as example of how much bullshit your vote is worth. Say corrupt politicians get paid off and pass a law that fucks up your ability to go to the voting booth. Say it restricts it to some odd hour, or somewhere far away, or hell they might as well just arrest you for trying to get in. No matter how fucked up it is, it'll have to go through the courts, and you'll have to slog it out
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       you can afford it. You'll probably win (if, miraculously, the court hasn't been bought). Years later, though, and depending on how fucked up it was they probably won't even null the election. If you think it's not that bad, history says otherwise, and complacency will bring its swift return.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, shit, look at all this gerrymandering shit. Undoubtedly it's swung elections (on both sides, don't take me for partisan- Republicans skin us from the bottom up, Democrats the top down), and it's now getting its treatment in the courts, but it's not like the years of representation based on that went away.
      </p>

       Companies can play the long game, and our system plays to that strength. Workers, for the most part, can't. We tire, we break, sometimes we die before we see justice.

       What if there were a special interest group that REALLY cared about civil rights, and even created a corporation to defend these rights, asking people to become "members", not by buying stock, but by joining and paying dues?   And THAT group would use those dues to fight fire with fire - big lawsuits, lots of $$ to fight the big companies?  Wouldn't that be great?

       As for gerrymandering, it is CONSTITUTIONAL!
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Courts have no right to do anything here.  If the Law passes that the enumeration (Congressional districting) will be X, no court can say that X is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do realize that "gerrymandering" came about during the VERY FIRST Enumeration?  Eldridge Gerry had his district drawnto include a ceertain type of voter whom he tended to agree with(and vice versa), and the resulting shape resembled a salamander, hence a Gerry-mander.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I stated before, "companies" are just people.  "Companies" have never once made a single decision, broke a single law, or performed a single act.  PEOPLE, working or leading those companies did those things.

       Does capitalist society incentivize organizations to perform services without financial gain? Is it even possible for them to do so? No, not really, so they're dependent on donations and thus either beholden to the same problem entities or represent a pooling together of resources of the working class (or whatever social group to be more general).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is naive to maintain that these organizations, in this state, could compete in the same arena as a group like Standard Oil (replace with any of its modern fractions) who could donate their entire annual budget to its own chosen organizations multiple times a month.

       But is not Standard Oil just a collection of people who pooled money for the purposed of profit?  It is not an unknown, faceless organization, but simply a collection of people.  Is it simply due to the ability of Standard Oil to generate profit , and then re-invest that profit that makes the tables turn?

       But "DuPont" didn't do anything.  A person did.  Or a group of people did.  They just happened to be doing it while working for DuPont, or in the service of DuPont, if so hired for that service.

      <p>
       It's just like if a black/white/green person committed a crime.  Did "Black/white/green people" commit that crime?  Or did Joe BlackWhiteGreen commit that crime?  Or if a cop shot someone.  Did the City PD shoot them, or did Joe Cop shoot them?
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason why they go after the PD, or the DuPonts of the world is just like everything else - they have money.  Suing Dupont worker A who makes $20k a year, and just didn't feel like doing their job that day because hungover isn't going to pay for it, but the company he worked for sure can!

       It's disingenuous to say that this is not different from working class individuals pooling their meager wages to support a political action committee versus the use of revenue generated from their ownership of (considerable) capital.

      <p>
       I still maintain that this is a meaningless distinction which also ignores how corporate ownership is used to give plausible deniability and
       <strong>
        limited liability
       </strong>
       to the owners and shareholders. There are numerous examples of corporate leadership putting pressure on middle management (if not outright commands) to commit unethical or illegal actions, but the difficulty in landing criminal charges against the individuals responsible rests in 1) finding out who, specifically, originated any given order and 2) being able to actually prove it in court. This isn't the only reason, but it's one of the big reasons why most instances of corporate malfeasance end in slap-on-the-wrist fines.
      </p>
      <p>
       To you this might be "going after the money," but I promise you, the owners of these companies are okay with this. From their perspective it's a loss that barely even registers against their revenue, and they get to avoid going to jail for behavior that they encouraged.

       Just cause you suck at life doesn't mean the country is failing.  In the simplest, most basic language I can manage, you are just "Mad cuz bad".  You have no appreciation of the opportunity you are afforded by living in a first world country.  Maybe if you were worth anything, you could make some good money.  Why aren't you worth more?

       If wealth equals worth, that's probably the only "worthy" quality you have. This country may not be failing, yet you have to at least see the cracks in this system. I believe it's quite apparent that there are several integral parts of the US that need significant change within the government. Our public education, police forces, and interstate/infrastructure/roads in general just to name a few.

       You're right, public education is trash in this country.  We should have a more strict, authoritarian system like Japan; then we wouldn't have these whining 20 year old children.  Our police forces are nominal, and in fact, are quite good if you are not living in a city that's full of ghetto trash.  Our infrastructure isn't the best, but it's fine; probably better than nominal.

       I think maybe you're letting your own failure of a life reflect on society as a whole; this country is in great shape, honestly.  The thing is that propagandists have taken a microscope to anything that they find "problematic" and they twist information to suit their agenda.  If you remove a few demographics/districts from the crime/educational statistics you'll find that the US is actually top tier in many areas.  The problem is there are some cancerous blights in this country that make the rest of us look bad (because, once again, microscope effect by the media).
