        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don’t really know how to feel when it comes to the talk of gun control. Since hearing about all the shady shit surrounding Sandy Hook, the Orlando shooting and the 2012 Aurora shooting for example, I had always been under the impression that the government seems to be pushing the population towards wanting stricter gun control. Stripping the population of its right to bear arms has always been the first step in government take over and a lot of people have seem to forgotten about that. Some of the worst population exterminations in history happened to disarmed populations. I have defended this position for as long as I can remember and support civilian possession of military grade firearms. I truly believe that the founding fathers had a reason for the second amendment and it was strictly to prevent a tyrannical government from taking over. Law abiding citizens commit some 200 out of 32,000 gun deaths a year (also this may be outdated now) and are clearly not the problem. Hell, we’ve had more issues with fucking cops recently than actual civilians.</p>

<p>It’s become increasingly hard for me to support this position because I know the NRA and it’s Republican backers profit from every mass shooting. The hysteria and panic causes firearms sales to rise (correct me if this is wrong, I read about this back during the Obama administration) and they make more money from every tragedy. These fucking assholes don’t give a shit about the people that die and they pad their pockets from the fear that’s generated. I feel like mass shootings have just turned into profitable propaganda campaigns the two parties BOTH benefit from and use against each other in their childish squabble. </p>

<p>I guess I don’t know where this leads me. This 19 year old should never have been able to purchase an AR-15 and was ignored by the FBI. Was this on purpose? This may have been discussed already on this sub so I apologize if this is redundant. I just feel like there’s something bigger going on here and I can’t put my finger on it. Of course none of us want kids to die or mass shootings to happen, but are these events being used to push the population into wanting their guns taken away? This is especially hard for me because we have a crazy right wing government at the moment who seems to be in support of firearm possession, yet that contradicts what I understand to be the overall goal of the International Banking Cartel and their pawns.  I guess I just wanted to hear some thoughts on this. Thanks everyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion, if the government wanted to impose full martial law and slaughter a civilian population, an assault rifle (or even a full auto, or .50 cal) will have as much use as a water pistol against a house fire. So I don&#39;t see the purpose in civilian assault rifle ownership.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US military would probably lose in open warfare vs the general population of the US. There is simply too much ground to try and control and they would end up fighting a massive guerrilla style war kind of like Vietnam on steroids. Sure any kind of traditional skirmish would between military and civilian forces would favor the military, but it wouldn&#39;t play out that way most of the time. How do you know who your enemy is in that scenario? Its also important to remember the demographics of the US military. It would be a hard sell to convince them to openly fight civilians. You&#39;d have loyalists yes, but its safe to assume significant numbers of service members would jump ship or refuse to fight. Then you have the brass who may or may not follow orders to attack Americans. Get a few rouge officers and the next thing you know the guerrillas just acquired whole divisions worth of military hardware. Not to mention when/if outright fighting breaks out other countries would seize the opportunity to support one side or the other further exacerbating the whole shit show. It would be a fucking mess no matter how you look at it and the US gov does not want to go there.       </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me it started with 9/11. If you have a government that directs/enables a terrorist attack on their own soil in order to start an illegal war to make billions for the military industrial complex, your trust goes rather quickly.

    <div class="md"><p>First, lets learn what an assault rifle is and is not.
<a href="http://www.thefirearms.guide/blog/educational/assault-rifle">http://www.thefirearms.guide/blog/educational/assault-rifle</a>
Assault rifles are already banned from ownership.</p>

<p>Anyone over the age of 18 by law can purchase firearm, including any semi-auto on the market which includes the scary looking (but same fire rate, calibers as any rifle considered a normal hunting rifle) AR15.  </p>

<p>So outside of the fact that he had known mental issues that went ignored, why shoudn&#39;t a 19 year old be able to purchase an AR15?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please stop using the term assualt rifle. It is not a real thing. </p>

<p>The weapons given to soldiers are automatic rifles. They have a selector switch that goes single, three round burst or full auto.</p>

<p>A full auto gun is virtually impossible to get in most states already. And so expensive where it is allowed it is rare.</p>

<p>These weapons are semi automatic rifles. </p>

<p>Sounds like I am being pedantic and maybe I am but it is false information or <strong>newspeak</strong>... I can go buy an average looking sporting rifle and dress it up for a couple hundred bucks and now it&#39;s an assualt rifle. It is the same tool.</p>

<p>Hand guns kill far more people in America than do rifles. By many many times.</p>
