       I find it interesting that people have different moments at which they have an epiphany that something may not be right in the mix of things. I just want to know what made you stop and think for the first time about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, it was the fact that no one actually saw the kid with any weapon. No one saw the kid ever shoot anything. Then, you have the girl who says she was basically walking with him at one point. 
They picked him up on the way to his house? I just wanna know WHY THE HELL people said it was him in the first place.

       Never has it been to such an extent as this. It seems almost everyone is jumping on the bandwagon and there is no voice on the other side. Also, this new thing of “I don’t want a gun and I’m gonna turn in my gun so it never takes a child’s life”. Wtf? Your gun won’t kill anybody if you don’t shoot anybody.

       There was cameras all over the school but the cameras were feeding a stream that was delayed 20 minutes. So when they thought the shooter was in the school he was actually at subway getting a drink. Which to be honest is what made me start questioning. I was skeptical at first but I didn’t want to jump to conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some things I was trying to understand that caused me to start to wonder.

      <p>
       Why isn’t anyone talking about mental health rather than gun bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did he get to the school with the gun without being seen?
      </p>
      <p>
       The girl that was “with him when they heard the first shots fired”
“I’m surprised it wasn’t you.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The kids in the media and the Snapchat videos that were recorded during the incident heavily pushing gun regulations.

      <p>
       Now the media is talking about arming teachers.

       I worked at a electronics store 5 years ago... Back then we were selling pretty legit security systems for local business.. 
For $1000 you could get like 15 cameras, all live streamed to smart phones from the 2010-2013 era. All in 1080p with motion detection, 10x zoom, audio recieving, and live text alerts.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a school filled with rich kids can't afford a descent setup. 
Yet now they plan to tear down the building a build a bigger nicer one, sounds like sandy hoax 2.0

       I sound crazy, but I don't care. 
I first became leery of the whole deal when in a newspaper, I read that the kid was hearing distinct voices in his head- and this right after I read about the weird crap going down in Cuban embassies.
These shooters follow a pattern; behavior problems, non attentive adults around them, pharma,- in fact, they are all starting to look alike, even that old man in Las Vegas. They all have the same eyes.
No one is going to notice them slowly being driven crazy. 
And it's the SAME damned story every time, same bio.
I had a crazy idea that they are using human flotsam to carry out schemes where they are the Sirhan Sirhan on a mass scale.

       But what the hell is "mental health"? I'm worried that using that terminology just plays into more drugging. The drugging of our kids is a big part of the problem. False flag or not, all these shooters have been on psych drugs (if it's a false flag I imagine it's more than just psych drugs). But mental health is a weird term. People on this sub would seen as mentally unhinged to lots of people. I don't think we should go there.

       If it's a false flag, I imagine they're using modern mind control drugs. Have you read Dave McGowan's "Programmed to Kill"? It's a red pill book that everyone should check out.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the psychiatric drugging of our kids is its own problem, in my opinion a *huge problem, that's independent of the mass shooter phenomenon.

       I never referred to drugs once? Talking to a child and having a father figure for example can prevent a lot of mental health issues. Growing up in the wrong environment can cause the same? Why not work on the environment that these children are growing up in.

       That's super vague. I don't think it's accurate to say a mass murderer has "mental health issues." There's something much deeper than that going on.

       Oh, right on. Have you seen Louis Theroux's documentary on the over-drugging. My dad is a retired psychiatrist, so this issue has always been on my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is encouraging it. Good question. I believe the U.S. is the only western country that allows direct advertising from pharmaceutical companies, for one thing. Some of these drugs are extremely sketchy, like Depakote, for instance, and parents have no idea. They just trust the shrinks, but most of the shrinks are taking bribes from the pharmaceutical industry, which is the single biggest lobbying force in the country. And of course, parents are overworked, and imo all the television especially makes kids very "ADD," so parents assume corporate drugs are the answer, but they rarely are. They usually have a deadening effect, the exact opposite of what psychedelics do, and people end up hooked on chemical soups produced by profit-driven entities that have little to no interest in our actual well-being. And in the extreme but not super rare cases, some of these psych drugs contribute to or even cause psychosis. Most people would be better off with medical marijuana.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, what was your experience like as a teenager on anti-depressants and sleep meds? From what I can tell, SSRI's have probably the least negative side effects of the various classes of pharmaceutics, but I still wouldn't recommend them.

       I agree 100%. My experience was not a good one. Over time I became a zombie and had no interests in anything. I showed no emotion and and lost all drive to want to do anything. I’ve failed suicide attempts, talked to about a dozen psychiatrists and even had a weird puberty. My stomach was already a weak stomach and I’m not sure if the medications did it but now I have really bad acid reflux.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway. I turned 18 and was just fed up with going through the motions at that peak and decided that I shouldn’t need the pills to be happy. So I did what any white kid in the suburbs would do and I started smoking a lot of weed. A lot more than I already was doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       (I smoked weed occasionally because yeah)
      </p>
      <p>
       I smoke everyday now. I sleep like a rock and pop up when my alarm goes off. I eat good. My stomach never hurts. My panic attacks stopped 2 years ago. I can talk to people in public. Cartoons are funny again.

       Crisis actors..

      <p>
       Also anytime you hear about a drill, or you see no security footage, or when all the cell phone videos are showing the ground while fun noises play. (every mass shooting in the last 8 yrs)
Or best yet.. And this is the kicker.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the cell phone footage looks like a flip phone from 1997, even tho everyone around has a smart phone..

       Or the fact that all the security footage is grainy dog shit, even tho 1080p high quality cameras go for pennies.
      </p>

       Or when the crisis victims have rich shit daddies..

       Just to add some skepticism:
      </p>
      <p>
       MSM is more likely to be just using kids. People, especially teenagers, always dream about what they'd do during a mass shooting, taking down the shooter or doing some other significant thing. MSM gives them to opportunity to get national attention, they'll obviously take it, even if the lines are scripted. David Hogg appears to be loving the attention particularly, and likely wants his lines scripted so he can act and express himself the way he wants to.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the videos, it's likely they're withheld due to legal reasons. If something is shown that can reduce the sentence or disrupt the process, it fucks things up and sets a precedent for them to get screwey instead of finished quickly and cleanly. For example, a guy breaking into a house falls and breaks his ankle and is then found and quartered at gunpoint by the home owner. Video footage gives the criminal a case to sue since he was injured on their property, as well as emotional trauma due to being at gunpoint afterwards without being openly threatening. Whether he wins or not, it's something the home owner doesn't wanna deal with. Same applies to shootings.

       I wonder if talking about what they did wrong helps them improve in tactics. for Vegas there was not great footage showing injuries so in Florida there is video of a person lying in blood....i don't want to help them get better at lying to us.

       My biggest thing is one of the girls interviewed said she didn't even hear any shots. I was in the army and I can tell you there's no way in a school that you wouldn't hear any shots, guns are so loud in real life.

       Was watching "Today" the day after and they had a girl on who "had been struck by a stray bullet" or something along those lines and she showed no signs of injury and her whole statement was just so obviously scripted and fake. After Vegas, Orlando, and Sandy Hook I question everything that happens, everything, I will not believe anything until I have concrete irrefutable proof.

       Right. I don’t even know why I come here. Probably just to get enraged by the complete and utter morons out there.

      <p>
       The reason they’re pushing gun control so hard is because they’re fed up, this shit continues to happen way too regularly. Are they probably being coached by people to help define a narrative? More than likely. Is that a conspiracy? I don’t fucking think so

       Sandy Hook was not fake, I'm sorry for my incorrect use of fake. Sandy Hook was a hoax. Yes, people died, but it definitely wasn't just Adam lanza. None of these events are fake, they are all carefully planned and executed. Honestly I was skeptical for awhile but Vegas was my tipping point that was a shit show of epic proportion.

       If I can respond to your “no one saw him shoot anyone” comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are injured that survived yes? They can be interviewed once they’ve recovered enough and grieved enough can they not? I think at this point no one has seen that because the injured are still surrounded by family in a hospital, not being bombarded by media right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, if once they start talking they come out and say they never saw the shooter, THEN it gets interesting. But until then we’re at “no one has said YET” that they saw the shooter, no?

       Unless they are literally unconscious, I'm sure authorities have talked to all the victims and got their statements.

       Indeed. Wait and see. This can’t be proven one way or the other until an investigation is concluded, from there people can believe or poke holes to all their might. Just saying that “no one saw the shooter”.....at THIS point that should be “we have yet to HEAR anyone talking about the shooter”

       It was just all of the sudden him....yet the cameras were on a "delay" so there is apparently no evidence to see there. The girl mentioning she walked NEXT TO HIM is also a smoking gun. I say that no one saw him actually shoot anything because, I strongly believe no one did and he is a poor scapegoat being used a sacrifice for gun control. Too easy.

       I think this Cruz kid was the shooter, the FBI dropped the ball and all that. I think the conspiracy is coming after the fact, with all these kids on TV. One thing that gets me, high school kids cant even make a presentation in a class full of their peers that they have known most of their lives and have been in class with all year without stuttering, saying um every 2 seconds, sweating and just generally being nervous. Somehow these kids are coming on national news networks and not making a single mistake when talking to a high profile person in government or giving an interview about a traumatic event. How is that?

       Not every high school student is like that. I teach high school and some kids are very well spoken and put together. Perhaps that is why these specific students have become the unofficial spokespeople of the shooting?

       FBI can't stop some runt yet they stop tons of them, MSM hypes up and glorifies his murder to turn him into a historic shooter bad guy, MSM soon after interviews a bunch of kids who were far away from the shots with scripted anti gun lines so anyone who doesn't believe the authenticity of their convictions can be called a monster. Propaganda 101. Next up, during their divorce, the MSM uses their kids to make the judge think they're the good guy and their partner is the bad guy.

       I find it strange the victims aren't being reported on. There is a special group of students that got picked to rep the school and now they're everywhere? They became pop stars over night because they went to a school that had a shooting? I'm prob gonna get downvoted for this... because I haven't done a lot of research into this, but... there was literally no time for remorse or anything it was just straight to gun control. There hasn't really been any rational thinking especially from the left. I didn't realize how many people I knew that were actually brainwashed by CNN. They don't have any facts to follow up anything they are putting out on Facebook. They are just repeating CNN and pretending its true. HOW!? They're the most easily debunked news source! Something strange is going on in USA. That is for sure. I try not to think about it too much because it really works up my anxiety. I guess this is the best place to vent on something like this because it is r/conspiracy but I'm really worried about this country heading to a civil war or the government just straight up taking over.

       Based on the past history of false flags and fake shooting and bombing events pushed by the MSM in the exact same way, I just assumed it was a bogus from the get go. And subsequent checking into the facts confirmed it.

       What facts confirmed to you that it was a false flag? I'm aware of past false flags, but I'm not seeing the evidence on this one.

       It makes sense that we're at a point we're people are immediately politicizing these things. It doesn't make sense (to me) that these high schoolers are CIA pawns.

       Yeah, you might post about it, but you’re not worried about who knows you have it because you’re not planning anything horrible. A would-be school shooter who’s already been reported might want to stay more lowkey.

       The videos, the camera time lapse, the sketch interviews, no one saw his face except that one girl whos interview seemed off, multiple people said more then one shooter, he was found two miles away after visiting two stores, no holes in the walls, drills prior (code red), everyone's links to FBI and intellegance, out of all the kids 12 mormons were shot (how unlucky), but mostly like always...them trying to censor information.

       First, that annoying kid with the FBI father is just off. Second, the immediate focus and attention on to a small group of “survivors” rather than reporting on the victims.

       Honestly I'm worried I'll get slammed for this- at least I know I would on my other social media because people post "you're evil if you question the Florida shooting" posts pretty regularly. But anyway, I didn't even look much into it yet, I've just watched the videos. And although I know when people are traumatized they act odd (like, I do). But it just seemed really weird that this was a "media circus" in an instant. Also- it is odd to me (and I haven't SEEN anyone point it out)- that all of these people come off as quite visibly gay. I don't mean gay people are idiots- but what I mean is, I feel like it's quite possible they're being groomed for this, and I think being gay can already be traumatic (thus, easy grooming) + liberals love using gay people/black people and such for talking points to make their points seem Valid or whatever. I don't think gay people should be persecuted but with the politics of certain people facing persecution thus their narrative is infallible is one that I'm sure people would be very willing to exploit. Just the way these kids are talking just seems very bizarre- like an older person trying to sound cool and hip almost. Also their social media is weird. But idk. What do I know lol

       I kind of feel like I'm losing my mind though because most liberal people I'm friends with (couldn't say this about the conservative people I'm friends with) have this very aggressive "YOU ARE SO EVIL DIE!!!!!!" if you don't agree with them about this. Tbh, if I cannot touch it, see it with my eyeballs, and know it 100%, I'm not going to defend it so

       I worked at a electronics store 5 years ago... Back then we were selling pretty legit security systems for local business.. 
For $1000 you could get like 15 cameras, all live streamed to smart phones from the 2010-2013 era. All in 1080p with motion detection, 10x zoom, audio recieving, and live text alerts.

       But a school filled with rich kids can't afford a descent setup. 
Yet now they plan to tear down the building a build a bigger nicer one, sounds like sandy hoax 2.0

       I bet all the supposed victims and survivors are getting nice scholarships and political careers.

       Yup. Where's the interviews with the survivors who were actually injured?

       Or phone photos of any part of the interior of the school during or after the shootings.
