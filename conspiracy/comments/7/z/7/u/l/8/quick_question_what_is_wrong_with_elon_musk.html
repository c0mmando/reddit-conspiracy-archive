       I wonder what are the conspiracies about him.
People say he "challenges" NASA. But as far I know about us government, if he really tried to challenge anything his rockets would have never get out of the ground like happened with a lot of other countries space programs

       Who do you think paid for the R &amp; D and development of the technology that created the space program? It was all tax money awarded via contract to various private for profit companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Way back in the earliest days, Bell Labs had a contract for that much hailed technology.

       I mean...if he’s able to use the governments to his own advantage should we be mad at him? In my eyes we should be mad at the government then. I mean would you blame an animal for escaping through a hole in the fence? It’s not the animals fault it’s the fact that there’s a hole to be used....

       How dare he be rewarded for bringing innovation to commercial space that lowers the cost per launch and employs a bunch of American citizens.

       We were getting such a good deal before buying Russian boosters with US tax dollars and allowing US companies to mark up the price 150%.

       He should be rewarded, just not with tax dollars.

       Dude, have you looked at Wall Street?
      </p>
      <p>
       The most valuable companies in the Fortune 100 are all government contractors.  Are you saying defense companies shouldnt be rewarded with tax dollars for building the planes and tanks for the US military?  Why shouldnt SpaceX be compensated for providing services to the government?  They are fulfilling a need to get supplies to the ISS at a cost lower than what we paid for NASA to do it themselves.  We are saving taxpayer dollars using SpaceX rather than having NASA farm it out to the same defense companies that provide the tanks and planes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you dont think we should spend money on space exploration, that's a whole separate issue.  The fact is it took the government and its resources to contract with all the major companies in order to put man on the Moon.  No single company could have done it.

       If the government wants something I much prefer they buy it rather than take it, sure. That's quite a bit different than subsidizing a company, any company.

       Dragon was independently developed for $500M.  Which was the cost of a single shuttle launch.
      </p>

       The government is the best innovator on the planet.  This thing we call the internet was a DARPA project that got transferred to the public sector.  SIRI was a DARPA project at Stanford.  Do you have any idea how many of these technologies that have changed the course of our lives started as government funded research projects?

       I didnt say it say it requires the government, I'm simply pointing out that the pure research done through government funding that gets transferred to the public sector is what has made us a superpower and allowed us to deploy the worlds most technologically advanced military in the world.

       Musk developed Dragon on his own dime.  Then he got a government contract to provide re-supply missions to ISS.  That money he used to develop heavy lift rockets.  That provides another need to the government we have been fulfilling through taxpayer dollars to Russia.

       I'm saying you're downplaying their role in the process.  That you're not fully understanding how these parts interconnect and drive American progress.  It was the government that deployed the transcontinental railroad, the power grid, the phone network, the wireless spectrum, the moon mission, the internet, digital broadcasting and so many more huge technologies that had a high cost of entry and needed scale in order to make them affordable.
      </p>
      <p>
       What else are we talking about?  Subsidies for EV cars via Tesla?  The subsidies that go to consumers and ultimately lower the cost for embracing new technologies in order to drive their price down through scale?  Elon Musk doesnt get those subsidies.  They just make the cars or panels more affordable for consumers.  He already paid back the federal grants to create Tesla, which employs thousands of Americans now.  I'd say that's a better tradeoff than building a bomb with taxpayer dollars that explodes in some third world country and does ultimately nothing.

       He's really not very nice to his employees. He's probably using technology that was previously made secret
By the 1951 inventions secrets act. What other inventions are secret? Who's gunna be the next government stooge that gets to make millions pretending to be an inventor?

       That interview was stomach churning for me.  It's like he's in on the new world order to usher in more technology and the integration of computers with biology...I am not ok with his view of the future, it's totally in favor of the mega rich who won't need a job when the bots take over and we will have nothing and be slaves to the robots.

       Same here. IMO, he looked a bit uncomfortable saying that bs.  I didn't get the sense that he was saying so with any confidence in his own words.  He's a puzzling dude.  Not sure why he went for Johnny Depps ex either.  Whatever.

       I just feel like he was put in this position as a middle man to get us all to accept the AI future they want to see happen.  We're spars to feel comfortable with This guy ushering is into a new and frightening age. But don't worry, good old Elon is here to help guide you.

       Of course it's inevitable. What makes you think it's not? Anyone who ignores this will be the one losing out and be a lower form of human in terms of evolution, and will be good for being slaves to the uber rich.

       Yup exactly, gather up enough money so that when the time comes to advance to this new stage of human evolution you are ready.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the reason there's so much income inequality with the rich getting super greedy and just accumulating wealth, because they want to be the first ones to advance. You might think elon is evil or trying to do the same thing, but he is just being smart and letting others know what's coming. The first company to figure out singularity is going to rule the world. All the useful idiots are getting distracted by this petty politics, nwo and all that shit, no one's even thinking about this stuff.

       I'm reminded that everyone thought J.P. Morgan was the richest man in America until his death revealed that he was actually only an agent for the Rothschild's simply playing a part.
      </p>
      <p>
       My own intuition tells me that creatures like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are the same kind of cardboard cut-out creations. Simply puppets for government agencies with the kind of unlimited and unaccounted for billions to give them all the appearances of being the real thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows how many other so-called "billionaire" owners of the media etc. are simply more of the same while those government agencies are the real owners and controllers of what everyone merely thinks that they happen to own?

       He's a glorified frat boy lying for TPTB.  Everyone believes him to be some kind of genius due to media programming but he's just an actor selling a lie.  He's lying for the same people NASA lies for.
