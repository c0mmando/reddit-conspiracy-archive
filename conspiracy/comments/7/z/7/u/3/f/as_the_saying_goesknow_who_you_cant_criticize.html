<p>The truth of the matter is this:</p>

<p><strong>We should be mad at Russia for interfering in our election if they did - but we CAN and SHOULD also be be outraged at Israel interfering in EVERY ONE of our elections - as well as OUR government interfering in other country&#39;s elections.</strong></p>

<p>All these states can exist at the same time.</p>

<p>&quot;These rich men were called capitalists. They were fat, ugly men with wicked faces, like the one in the picture on the opposite page. You can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called a frock coat, and a queer, shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe, which was called a top hat. This was the uniform of the capitalists, and no one else was allowed to wear it. <strong>The capitalists owned everything in the world, and everyone else was their slave.</strong> They owned all the land, all the houses, all the factories, and all the money. If anyone disobeyed them they could throw him in prison, or they could take his job away and starve him to death.&quot;</p>
