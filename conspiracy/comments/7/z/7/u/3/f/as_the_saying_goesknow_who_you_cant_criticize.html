       With EVERYTHING going on in the world and sub today, from blaming everything on Russians to revising history - all of it is to conveniently leave out Israel and the JIDF - which only extrapolated as an idea over time - it grew more heads to its hydra.

      <p>
       The truth of the matter is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        We should be mad at Russia for interfering in our election if they did - but we CAN and SHOULD also be be outraged at Israel interfering in EVERY ONE of our elections - as well as OUR government interfering in other country's elections.

       All these states can exist at the same time.

       They operate only in darkness and with surnames.  Light is the best disinfectant and they know that. You sound downtrodden buddy. The ones who tried to work with the jews in the past were betrayed. Don't be a sheep, you have teeth too. The more we talk about it the less powerful it becomes. That is why Hollywood is their crowning achievement and the internet their worst fear.

       How do you know the circle exists? If I, a Jew, don't know or don't believe it exists, how would a non-Jew? It stands to reason that I'd know about an underground Jewish conspiracy before you would.

       You say it's underground. For most conspiracy theorists who go in this direction see it out in the open. You just don't think about it, so you're not seeing it.
