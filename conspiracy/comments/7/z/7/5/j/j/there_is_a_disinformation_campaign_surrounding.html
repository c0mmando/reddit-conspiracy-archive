       Copy and pasted most of this from a text comment I made earlier today. I've seen a lot of nonsense spreading like wildfire.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the "Hogg went to Redondo Beach High School" angle is a targeted disinformation campaign. Most of the people spreading it are likely just useful idiots that fell for it.
       <a href="https://imgur.com/785x3lM">
        Here is a tailormade compilation image of most of the bad info (I didn't create this).
       </a>
       People created fake "classmates.com" pages for Hogg @ Redondo, as well as a couple other similar sites; sites which can be edited by anyone. Screenshots/archives of these pages were spammed aggressively.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Laguna Beach Antifa twitter account (some kind of troll account) - @lagunabeachantifa9  tweeted the picture of the yearbook claiming it was Redondo Beach. The twitter account's location is openly set as Krasnoyansk, Russia - looks like an obvious attempt at trolling to me. Too out in the open.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/_joey_wong/status/966181529885036549?ref_src=twcamp%5Eshare%7Ctwsrc%5Eios%7Ctwgr%5Eother%7Ctwcon%5E7100%7Ctwterm%5E2">
        This was later proven to be false by a twitter video of the actual yearbook.
       </a>
       . Not to mention the kid in the middle of the top row is wearing an Eagles shirt - the mascot of MSDHS.
       <a href="http://eagleeye.news/feature/msd-senior-david-hogg-goes-viral-youtube/">
        As if we needed any more proof, theres also an article from the MSD HS newspaper talking about how Hogg went on vacation and had a viral youtube video.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://imgur.com/ZXKki3Y">
        This same twitter account posted the incorrect photo of "Nicholas Cruz" in an Antifa shirt. This was then retweeted by the fake Julian Assange twitter account. More disinfo.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://imgur.com/qiH7WEX">
        The strangest one I came across was a copy of that picture of all the MSD Students at the news station with "Bitconnect" photoshopped in the background and onto Hogg's shirt.
       </a>
       <a href="https://imgur.com/TbaSKiD">
        A seperate poster told everyone "Has anyone dug into Hogg and Bitconnect? Its the logo on his shirt."
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Alltogether very odd stuff. IMO they're trying to muddy the waters, its pretty classic. Someone stated that it was a 4chan raid doing typically trolly 4chan shit. This lines up with the Bitconnect connection; bitconnect memes are big nowadays.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I tend to think that there is something more sinister going on. Seems a little too coordinated to just be 4chan. The pictures are spread like wildfire on twitter, voat, and the chans. So like I said, I think there is a disinfo campaign going on. The logic follows as such:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Start spreading easily disproved bullshit about Hogg. Useful idiots bite and spread the disinfo like crazy.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Information is easily disproved by people who do their due diligence for sources.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Label it all "Crazy conspiracy theories" [this is already being done by our good friends at CNN]
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         People asking reasonable questions about Hogg (i.e. FBI father, viral video, interviewing during shooting, practicing lines) are labeled as conspiracy theorists and discredited by association
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Hogg is immune from any criticism or questions about motives. Discussion is ended.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The whole thing is a mess and this just added to it. I'm really not sure what to think of the whole situation. Just my 2 cents on whats going on behind the scenes.
      </p>

       This post brought to you by far too much coffee.

       Yep...I saw a lot of discussion yesterday calling out how the kid was speaking in videos, appearing to be fed lines, pushing an agenda, loved the spotlight, son of FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now today all I see are people debunking the theory that he wasn't involved at all and didn't go to school there. I don't recall that being part of the legitimate discussion that was going on. Maybe that shit was being posted in fringe comments of bigger discussions, but that wasn't the crux of the issue.

       The number four trending video on YouTube yesterday was the kid's news segment in California because conspiracy people here and elsewhere accepted that as ironclad evidence that he was a paid actor who never went to the school.

       There was a ton of discussion about his other TV appearance and his documentary in California. In those discussions I didn't see anything proposing he went to school in California and was not involved at all in the Florida shooting.

       I'm calling bullshit that you read discussions about this topic on this subreddit and didn't see anyone propose that he was a crisis actor paid by the media and/or the government to pretend to be a student at the school to spread an anti-gun campaign. It was all over the place here.

       I saw plenty saying he could be an actor, he could be paid, and he could be pushing an agenda. I did not see anything claiming he went to school in California or wasn't involved in any way. The two premises aren't mutually exclusive.

       A crisis actor is someone who pretends to have been a part of a crisis in order to push an agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are the legitimate victim of a crisis, you aren't
       <em>
        acting
       </em>
       like you were anymore. You actually were.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone being paid by the news to pretend to have been a Hurricane Katrina victim in order to bash the Bush administration would be a crisis actor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone who actually lost their house in the hurricane, and later went on the news to talk shit about Bush, is not a crisis actor. Even if they got offered money to do it, that doesn't somehow make the fact that they are the victim of the crisis illegitimate. They're not "acting". They were actually in the crisis.

       So a person who was involved but is using it as a means to push the agenda of others isn't acting in the midst of a crisis? Sounds like a crisis actor to me

       That's right. You can also act like you're more outraged than you really are. Or you can act like it's solely a gun issue when you know it's a myriad of things.

       They sure would. So would the scenario described above.

      <p>
       Nope, not necessarily. Doesn't mean they absolutely couldn't be though. If CNN paid this hypothetical person enough money to rebuild their life if they talked shit on Bush, would you consider that acting or no? To me, it's someone telling you what to do. "Agent" might be a better word than "actor"...they are being used for political means, so to me they are viewed in the same manner. Acting would be involved though, so I don't consider it disingenuous to use the word.

Nobody said it would be illegitimate. Maybe their avenue for outrage would be illegitimate, as they are being paid and influenced to point the blame at someone for political means.
       </p>

      <p>
       You can be in a crisis and still act. The show just starts a little later when the crisis is done and the narrative begins to take form.

       I think arguing whether he is a "crisis actor" or not is pedantic and has little value. He clearly went to the school, and he is clearly being used for an agenda. Whether to call him a "crisis actor" not is irrelevant.

       If he genuinely believes everything he's saying and genuinely believes that the cause he is speaking for is right, is it fair to say that he's merely being used? If he actively sought out and wants the pulpit so he can deliver his message, is it using him merely to give him what he wants?

       What is happening is people that are not familiar with the conspiracy theorist term "crisis actor", which definitely has a specific meaning very close to:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A crisis actor is someone who pretends to have been a part of a crisis in order to push an agenda.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       are using the term in a different context with a different meaning and then arguing that the original definition is invalid or never existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't know if these people are unintentionally using the term incorrectly or are intentionally using the term incorrectly in order to slander conspiracy and conservative leaning subs. When we see the mainstream news reports, which should happen any moment now, about how right wingers on the internet are calling all the students on TV pushing gun control "crisis actors" and they go on to tell their viewers it means right wingers think the shooting didn't happen and these students are actors in a false flag meant to disarm the public, then we will know the true intentions of these commenters.

       Why do you think he's being used for an agenda? If you're fine with saying he was a student there then you should be fine with accepting that he was there when the school was shot up.  Why would it be crazy to assume that, since he was apart of the shooting and was hoping not to die,  also alive and probably aware of recent mass murders, he would want gun laws stricter? I suppose there are two ways you walk out of a mass shooting.  Either calls to arm yourself or calls to disarm others...so what agenda, assuming he was there,  do you think he truly believes in?

       You definitely belong on conspiracy.  He's a teen.  He was a part of a school shooting.  It's not someone else using him to push an agenda. It's his agenda. He was there.  Just like all the other kids there calling for gun control laws.  He wants to change gun laws because some psycho could have killed him.  Just like the rest of the vocal ones. I don't understand American ideology of,  I was born in America,  I'm entitled to a gun.  You're not special. You don't deserve anything.

       Wait, this is beautiful. We might be witnessing a key moment here where the term "crisis actor" starts being applied to people even if they were present for a real crisis, so long as what that person says goes against a certain viewpoint. Sort of like how pizzagate now encompasses every instance of pedophilia.

       I’ve already had this discussion elsewhere in the thread. Crisis “agent” might be more applicable than crisis “actor”. Crisis actor is being used because it’s a more common term that people can resonate with.

       I’m sorry so just to clarify - you’re saying a crisis actor does NOT have to be an unrelated third party paid to be on TV? You can be legitimately involved - let’s say the brother of a murder victim - and if the media is using you to push an agenda you are still a crisis actor? That’s a pretty broad definition. By that logic anyone can be a crisis actor.

       they could have recruited kids from that school.

       one girl had said they were told there would be an active shooter drill and that they would be firing blanks, and that people would be screaming and being dragged away etc.

       Yes, it makes perfect sense for a news organization to risk losing all credibility with literally everyone, forever, by offering high schoolers money to pretend to have been in a mass shooting, and praying that not a single one of them tells a soul about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this goes without mentioning how CNN must have gotten a lot of kids to pretend to die, gotten a lot of paramedics to pretend to treat wounded, gotten a lot of hospital staff to pretend to treat children with bullet wounds, gotten a lot of police to pretend to arrest a guy, and gotten a guy to willfully spend the rest of his life in prison for the fake shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is much more likely than these students really being victims of a mass shooting.

       I'm sorry, I guess I am. Apparently the shooting is real. The kids really did go to the school. The kids really did survive a mass shooting.

       We're all on the same page here, except for a significant portion of this community who can't even agree on that.

       But the kids are also actors pretending to care about what happened or about laws that directly affected them, hired by CNN who risked literally everything on high schoolers keeping their mouths shut??

       By your logic, if he was a crisis actor it would mean that he was planted at an earlier time. Do we have any indication of when he moved to said school? or was he listed there the entire time?

        The number four trending video on YouTube yesterday was the kid's news segment in California because conspiracy people here and elsewhere accepted that as ironclad evidence that he was a paid actor who never went to the school.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I find it very doubtful that this conspiracy sub could trend a video on YouTube. I know you said "and elsewhere", but I think the "elsewhere" did most of the work on making that video trend.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, I don't think he's a crisis actor or anything like that. I think he's an opportunist getting propped up by vultures in the media, but that's another story... and saying that the media takes advantage of victims during emotional times isn't much of a conspiracy theory. ;-)

       I don't want to speak for the OP but it seems like certain elements of the left wing have figured out that the right wing in the US has started to emulate the lefts disinformation campaigns in order to win political arguments.

       It appears that in response there is an element of the left creating a counter disinformation campaign to discredit the right on a national scale.

       The idea was floated on this sub, but was quickly debunked and drowned. I think later it was deleted, because I just tried to find the post for source and couldn't find it. But here's the thing, searching 'california' 'hogg' returns only 3 results, so not a

       What's clear as day is that this sub is now a congregation for "safe" conspiracies. Up until recently, there was rarely a political bias to posts and most were historically based. Ever since that memo drop came out, this place has gone from "The Russia story is obvious bullshit" to "All these news agencies we previously shat on for years must really be on to something".

       I'm also a regular at t_d and have been a regular here far longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       In t_d there was speculation about different theories when the video in California surfaced, but it was never widely refuted that he was a student or witnessed the shooting. The culture in t_d is very fact-based and the community is very, very proud of that. Claims are challenged and researched by other pedes all the time. Honestly you would know that if you actually browsed the sub for a few days.
      </p>
      <p>
       I first heard of this "evidence" today from a friend because I didn't see it on t_d (granted I wasn't browsing much today), and I was really skeptical of the whole thing because CNN wouldn't be so stupid as to make that mistake. And it looks like I was right, and other people felt the same way, which is why we are both here.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the "crisis actor" accusations never circled around whether or not he was a student, or if the shooting happened. It was about how he was caught fumbling his script on camera, and also caught rehearsing it
       <em>
        during
       </em>
       the shooting, and before his interviews.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the kid comes off as a pure psychopath. And all his pals follow the same script and have numerous ties to CNN and activist groups before the shooting. And FBI father is part of some super shady business deals during the 2008 financial crisis with all banks and all sorts of other swamp creatures.

       I have TD as one of my default pages on chrome. When I go on reddit, I start there. It amuses me seeing the hypocrisy. Just like with your comment here, where you claim the sub is fact based and that no one questioned if he was actually a student but then proceed to speculate and quote outrageous fake news claims to pretend he has no right to speak all because he practiced his words before going on camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       I once saw a TD post saying that CNN is fake news because a reporter had a round table with random citizens during the Hillary / Trump debate and repeated one of Hilary's quotes for the citizen she was talking to. The TD fools would rather believe it was lies and scripted and that the guy was coached than accept that she simply repeated Hillary's words so that the dude would have proper context. So much for fact based i guess.

       So the plausible theories are that other forces are behind David Hogg pushing for the gun control agenda? I don’t think it would be a conspiracy for a guy who has a connected father to share the same political views as his father and use his connections to do interviews and help spread their cause.

       It could be him being used as the "spokesman" of this tragedy because his viewpoint is in-line with the normal MSM narrative. Putting him on a pedestal over other survivors because of his views would be a conspiracy. Especially when you begin to talk about teenagers/children who are more easily influenced and less likely to be demeaned for their views.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody said it wasn't normal for a teenager to dislike guns, or to share the views of those who raised him. That being said, very little that we've seen of this kid in the wake of the tragedy has seemed organic or natural.

       It seems that he and the other girl Emma Gonzalez are just very outspoken kids. I was interested and looked into it and a lot of the things that come up say they were both active in the school newspaper and were either a part or the heads of a bunch of clubs. When I think back to high school and the kids that were the heads of the model UN, LGBT group etc. those are exactly the kids who would be outspoken and capitalizing on the chance to be a part of the solution to the issue.  What would be weird is if they weren’t those type of kids and just kinda kept to themselves and didn’t really say much then all of a sudden became this outspoken piece.  Weird, ambitious kids being weird on camera while opposing guns after their classmates were shot sounds par for the course.

       It's less about the kids and more about who is putting them on a pedestal and why. If they were in the news to talk about the victims and their memories...fuck yea I'm all for it.

       Instead it's teenagers espousing divisive rhetoric, essentially calling half the country retarded, and demanding we change our laws. I'm sorry for what he went through, but that doesn't mean he is right or free from criticism. Now Twitter has already given him his blue check and he is debating NRA reps live on gun control this evening? What the fuck...why?

       Well if his takes and info on the matter aren’t sound, even if they are supplied by someone else, wouldn’t he lose the debate? Wouldn’t you prefer to have an emotional kid try and make a plea then the experts themselves? The gun control debate is not a brand new thing, these debates happen all the time.  Even if he was pushed into this position by other forces, he still has to follow through and makes the points. Taylor Swift was basically pushed into the spot light by her rich dad buying a label but she still had to sing and perform when she got there.

       No, I'd rather hear well thought-out viewpoints from knowledgeable and experienced individuals. I like to learn new things and am not afraid to have certain viewpoints changed in light of new information. Everyone should be open to that.

       I know, how does this help move the ball though? It seems like more of an emotional appeal than one to logic...which is not helpful.

       The debate itself is not the problem, it's a symptom. A kid involved in a school shooting doesn't have the credentials to debate gun control on a national stage. I've shot an AR15 a few times now...why am I not being called to this debate? (Joking, but not really)

       Even those that don't appreciate her music would say she is talented, and her looks certainly aren't hurting her. I don't view this as analogous to David Hogg and gun control.

       The point is that we will find out during the debate if David Hogg is a talented debater or not. If Taylor Swift wasn’t talented then she wouldn’t have stayed in the spot light or made an impact. In fact, the person Hogg is debating might be able to point out that maybe he is too inexperienced and emotional regarding the topic to debate it with a level head and he could even hurt the cause. Either way, both sides of the gun debate try to capitalize on opportunities like this so I’m having trouble seeing why it would be a conspiracy.

       I don't know why you are stuck on the debate portion, it's a symptom and just one of many, as I pointed out.

       Imagine having to look a kid in the face, whose school was shot up and friends died a week ago, and tell him he is incredibly wrong and misinformed. You could be 100% right but you're still going to look like an asshole. It's a disingenuous premise to begin with.

       Well then it’s a good strategic move by the anti-gun side of the debate then no? It’s pretty obvious this kid isn’t doing this stuff on his own - he’s obviously getting help from the left-wing supporting that agenda. But if he’s not a plant and he believes in the message then that’s just politics, it’s not a conspiracy.

       Pushing the gun control debate in America has, every single time, only benefited one team. The NRA and the gun manufacturers that prop them up. They use the hysteria because people get scared and buy more guns. Always, always, always follow the money.

       For people who believe he’s a crisis actor or believe in crisis actors, help me understand your understanding of the scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Hogg is a crisis actor, does that mean he didn’t attend the school, are you saying there wasn’t a shooting.  Is he the only one or is the whole school itself just made up for the conspiracy.

       Here's some critical thinking via puberty and science; rebecca brodrick, the nice lil old white lady in his 2014 graduation pics, posted them june 20, 2014. Now tell me; who have you ever known, who went through the majority of puberty without ANY change in facial structure? I also believe that's why he always looks diagonal; as you mature your shoulders naturally raise. I think he's diagonal, unintentionally, by trying to hide the raised shoulders

       If anything, I'd just say Hogg is being groomed by his dad and career interests.  He wants to be a journalist and he just so happens to be at a place where there is going to be people looking for interviews so him jumping at that opportunity to speak any and everywhere is not unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sad/scary part of all this is that this experience is going to look amazing on his resume when he goes to try and get into an agency like CNN.  They'll have a "school shooting survivor" so his opinion on guns will "mean more" than anyone else talking about the subject on the network.

       I agree.  He's just a young kid who is very into being a journalist and he's also an opportunist.  I see him interviewing during the shooting as just what he thought a good journalist would do.

      <p>
       I imagine he admired those who went to dangerous places and documented during the event.

       I think that happens a lot, to many people. Everyone has a different scale for how deep a certain conspiracy goes. Each one has a spectrum of people who leverage potential real facts that were left out vs the narrative pushed.  Then an attempt to connect other dots once a potential lead of info stops. In this case with "crisis actors ",( which people know do exist, just don't have company info on the events that are legitimate or not) its complicated of course. Some may think that the entire thing was a staged drill  (highly unlikely) far too many children have big mouths and would definitely spill the beans if one of their friends "died".
      </p>
      <p>
       Others think the attack is real, but the news uses actors who can get the shots they want for narrative purposes.  ( could they have convinced one of those kids to go on a political rant about issues they think they know all about? [IE. Gun bans] Sure, they are emotional kids. And easily manipulated). Then exalt the shit out of a poor child to emotionally change opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there are the ones that are more nuanced. In Florida's case, is there a potential motive from the FBI to ALLOW this to happen? Knowing they have the ability to change perspective and completely control a crime scene. Does that connect to more info of corruption if someone outside of school but involved with Cruz' life  could have MKultra'd him , knowing his past, into committing the crime? Then with FBI's connection to Hogg's dad, had him coach his son on how to act and what to say to get himself the most attention? Or did the news already know that Hogg went there and specifically sought him out to tell a version of the events that would fit what they are trying to push. Are these crisis actors actually all just disinformation? Used as distractions from other things. Knowing people want to call out bad actors instead of looking elsewhere?
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on but I think you get what I'm trying to say. Some people take every conspiracy all the way down to complete "Zionist control" saying that almost every aspect of knowledge and control are at the hands of them. Manipulating everything behind the scenes. Others stay at the surface and only blame the government for usually having prior knowledge yet never doing anything, leading to the assumption that they aren't actually doing their job but purposefully just keeping people docile with fake evidence or lack there of any at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your right, its all convoluted. But that is usually  why some are so believable. There are so many ties in a conspiracy that it mirrors real life. To many coincidences piled up do not look like accidents. And with the advancement in technology coupled with the knowledge of human corruption make skeptics wonder. Some more than others haha.

       Case by case. Some things it appears the entire event was a sham such as the Boston bombing or Sandy Hook and there were no casualties.

       One user above stated that he Hogg did attend the school, did witness a real shooting, but is still a "crisis actor" because he's pushing a certain viewpoint. I feel like we're witnessing an important moment here.

       FalseFlag meaning they are hiding the truth to push a political narritive,but an event happened
Hoax means it didn't happen 
Capstone event is when a whole city does a dramatic playoff of a mass shooting,bombing or other situations and even being fake it can be used as propaganda thanks to obama.

       Of course there are. I was a crisis actor back in high school for a fire department drill. I pretended to be a burn victim, had a list of symptoms that I needed to present, and got a six inch sub and a can of coke for my trouble.

       I don't doubt he is going to the school. If you know this sub the question has to be asked. The answer was easy, (his video said "vacation in cali"..  The term 'crisis actor' can mean several things. In this case , I would say more well rehearsed. Than a crisis actor but you do see him acting.

       I think there were multiple shooters and that an organization sent in a professional shooter and made Nicolas Cruz as a pasty for there anti gun agenda. Also I think Hogg did go there but he went therw for the intention of the shooting.

       If, (which is a great word to start a sentence with, I recommend it highly here), there is a conspiracy around Hogg, Israel, and the Secret Service, you can certainly tell they are pissed at the reddit users making reference to it.  Unanimous crushing derision, and eloquent at that.

       I'm with you but I really do think it's just 4chan stuff. They put deliberate effort into these propaganda pushes even if they act like it's all just fun and games trolling once they're caught in the act. They're no stranger to faking stuff just to shift the narrative, such as the fake fake Steel dossier they made to "prove" how fake the real one was. The goal with this stuff was simply to try to associate the shooter with the far left. Even if the propaganda itself is shoddy, it still has a big effect, because it almost always takes more time and effort to disprove a lie than to come up with one and spread it.

       Its really tough to tell. A good portion of 4chan does seem to be conspiracy minded, and they can be quite good at researching this sort of thing. Theres also another large portion who are trolls through and through, some men just want to watch the world burn.

       I think it would also be relatively easy to use the autism of the former to your advantage by creating this stuff and using useful idiots as a signal booster. Wouldn't take a large group of people to start the fire, it spreads itself for you.  Mainly I'm saying that 90%+ of the people spreading this aren't "in on it". It would take maybe 5-10 people working together to get this thing rolling.

       There's also a large sect of politically active white nationalists, fascists, and just vague right-authoritarians who have very clear political agendas which they actively spread through both honest and dishonest means.

       Maybe. My feeling is that there are maybe 20-30 content-creator and influence-maker types on 4chan who start stuff, then several hundred enthusiastic but uncreative types who take it out into the world, then thousands of useful idiots who have little comprehension of the politics proper, but pass it along out of the group/tribal identity.

       I can't make sense of this. Fascists and white-nationalists would not be promulgating the same things, and then they both would never be classifiable as "right-authoritarians", mostly since that is a fake news, made-up term. If a person is right-leaning, then they can't also be authoritarian. The left is authority-driven so right-authoritarians is a non-real thing.

       Authoritarianism is not a right or left ideological specific trait, it is a means to an end. The end can be different. You may be conflating it with Totalitarianism.

       Got it, debunked. Degenerates don't deserve the same rights as morally upstanding god fearing warriors. Business matters more than personal liberty, and so does money. Be a cog and don't live the way you want or risk your livelihood. Business has the power to deny you basic goods and services. Really educating me on who exactly wants to control my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if cohering to societies "norms and morals" only applies to the scary homos? Once we've identified who can and can't work or exist when does it move onto other minorities, or women, or how you dress, or men with long hair, or people of other faiths? Fit in or be expelled sounds pretty authoritarian to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going to answer any other of my points? Or is being disappointed society doesn't want you to openly lynch queers your only argument? You going to keep misconstruing the definition of "society"?
      </p>
      <p>
       You have no idea what the left is, and if you think the Clinton's are leftist you're delusional. I wonder who has a history of imperialistic world domination, if only we could open a book and find out... it couldn't be right wing Christians annexing and colonizing every single piece of land available, it couldn't be authoritarian governments interfering in other peoples government and society, no no no. It's the dirty queers who want basic rights and access to services that want to dominate the world.

       There's no distinction.

       The left is a political side that values central authority, be it voted in, hereditary, or totalitarian. The right eschews the notion that a central system needs to exist to foment the values and norms of a sane civil society.

       Authoritarianism is unrelated to ideology.

      <p>
       From the link I posted:
 "the authoritarian state still maintains a certain distinction between state and society. It is only concerned with political power and as long as that is not contested it gives society a certain degree of liberty."

       In reality, ofc, neither left-wing nor right-wing can fully be implemented.

       Authority needs to exist, and totalitarian systems are just some guy(s) who aren't managing a society in any capacity, at all.

       I believe I have shown that I am indeed correct. Authoritarianism is unrelated to political ideology. This was evident by reading the wiki page on it. If you refuse to accept that then we shall go no further.

       The burden therefore is borne by you to prove your side - which you have not done. Wikipedia isn't accurate, not by a long shot. If you have an opinion, go find facts that help you determine what you should think.

       That wiki page has been verified and vetted as the page is now locked to editing. What is on that page can be accepted as fact. What you are claiming is incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this time, I would like to see a bit of evidence for some of the claims that you have made:
      </p>
      <p>
       You claimed that there is no distinction between authoritarianism and totalitarianism. Please provide evidence that this is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       You claimed "totalitarian systems are just some guy(s) who aren't managing a society in any capacity, at all." Please provide evidence that this is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       and finally you claimed that the definition of authoritarianism was established "hundreds of years ago". Please provide evidence for this claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks.

       Banning abortion? Abortion isn't legal. There's no statute allowing abortion. If you read any of the many scholarly treatises on
       <em>
        Roe v Wade
       </em>
       one thing becomes very very clear, the lack of citation, the lack of case law. Courts don't make law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banning porn? Like from minors and not allowing minors to participate? The function of a sane civil society is to protect those who be can be abused. But aside from that, I personally am unaware of where porn is banned, sorry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Canada doesn't let in people with misdemeanors and mexico has a policy of shoot-to-kill suspected criminals coming over the border from Guatemala. Do you have issues with those countries' policies?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no, and I repeat no, country on earth that allows in people based on the fact that they want it. It simply doesn't occur. Political boundaries exist because the people therein want a homogeneous society. I'm sure that for every country you can name that the USA doesn't allow immigration from, there's dozens more that also do not allow those guys in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nations can make whatever laws they want, that includes the USA.

       I mean that is one way to look at it..Another way is that without the more incriminating false information all that remains is
      </p>
      <p>
       "He filmed a weird video during the shooting, which seemd odd"
      </p>
      <p>
       "he stutterd at what he was saying in an interview"

       "His father is a retired federal agent"

       "He seems to be trying to become a youtube personality or such like"

       While all of this is suspicious, is doesn't point towards DH being a crisis actor or the florida shooting being a FF. It just points towards him being a bit weird.

       The fact he is focused so much on gun control as an issue makes Occam razor sense to me because THAT'S THE THING THAT WAS USED TO KILL 17 PEOPLE HE KNEW.

       Is it unfathomable that kids that were in danger of getting shot to death at school, and just watched 17 of their friends die, might be for a little gun control?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the main left-leaning channels are going to emphasise it. That's not even a fucking conspiracy, that's common sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       But treating this kids like they don't have an opinion of their own is just worrysome to me.

       Oh I believe people and kids are for gun control.

       I just believe they were brainwashed into thinking that way.

       The right to self defense is a natural right. If the Chinese invaded tomorrow, I shouldn't have to call the military or police in order to defend myself, if that is what I choose to do. Same goes for any other scenario.  I know right now it seems like an easy solution to a scary problem, but absolving yourself legally of your right to bear arms should never be a considered solution for the reasons mentioned above.

       Well I could make a whole host of arguments about why your guns wouldn't be that effective against an invading army that probably would've been met by the military when they arrived, but I'll refrain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm Australian, but I would never advocate a complete ban on all guns in America. But do you need more than a pistol to defend your home? Anything else seems like overkill and makes these events more tragic than they have to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the answer is "guns are fun for responsible gun owners", well the minority are ruining it for you. Push for gun restrictions that allow you the freedom to defend yourself and also make the tragic death of school kids less likely. Completely refusing all measures of gun control just make it more likely it'll be taken away when the right is abused again and again.

       In usa: If felons aren't supposed to have guns, and they do, do you really think we're going to stop 18+ year olds that want guns? Of course not.  It's another useless law that only make criminals out of those that wouldn't be criminals anyways.  Literally making criminals out of law abiding citizens.

       What if teen pregnancy rates rise to ridiculous highs? Will the solution be to advocate celibacy? Should we solve the opiate epidemic by incarcerating addicts and the mentally ill? Banning anything outright or heavy regulation never had a good track record here in the states if you hadn't noticed.

       they arent brainwashed, at least no more than the people who are NRA supporters. Broward is a democrat leaning county, and these are middle class kids who got to public school. Their teachers are also likely democrats. It is the nature of the beast.  Same thing happen in Rural Texas, there would have been a different response, with a different solution proposed.

       And it's more then him stuttering, there are videos of him being told what to say and repeating it...and during the shooting talking about gun control while still in the closet.

       But fuck this "its too soon to talk about it" bullshit. The appropriate "narrative" after any sort of attack is a reasonable discussion about the materials used to perform the attack.

       Kids died, and that is WHY the conversation needs to happen. Because it doesn't happen any other time! Or atleast when it does, it gets so little attention the NRA can quietly lobby it away.

       Thank you. I thought it was really important, because I believe there IS a discussion to be had about Hogg and I'd like to see it head in the right direction. Also I've had an entire french press of coffee which might have a little something to do with it.

       I'd like to add that this is a quality conspiracy theory post too. There is an active disinformation campaign going on to push a political narrative, and trying to figure out who's started and promulgated it is a very valid concern. That we're seeing the definition of a crisis actor morph right here in this thread in light of the truth to continue that narrative is just as concerning.

       Yea, this is undoubtedly the case.  I think the Hogg kid and his weird behavior is best explained by him being an aspiring journalist and jumping on the opportunity to make a name for himself.  The fact that freshly indoctrinated teens would push for gun control in such an emotional environment should be no surprise either.

       I don't even think it's as nefarious as trying to make a name for himself.  He's an aspiring journalist, has probably wondered how he would fare as a journalist in a situation like this and he finally got the chance to do a little "reporting on the scene" and an on-camera "report" and he wanted to put his best foot forward to see if he has the ability to fulfill his aspirations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if some kid who always wanted to be a major league pitcher somehow getting the chance to throw out the first pitch at a game.  Is he just gonna toss it in there to the catcher, or is he going to wind up and see if he can throw a strike from 60' 6" away?  Sure, that kid's going to come off a little goofy and look like a try-hard, just like Hogg did.  But that's normal when you get confronted with a chance to fulfill you dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
       And people saying that the kids aren't acting they way someone would act after such a traumatic event, bullshit.  Everyone responds differently to crisis.

       This must be some American thing, where current politics are so immensely interesting that every source of media ought be about them.
Personally I don't think current events are meant to be the content here, this isn't conspiracy this is news, and it isn't new news for you Americans. Go form r/superpacs and take this discussion there 
Finally, and I'll admit this is just my personal opinion, but don't call strangers "bud". The Venn diagram of decent people and people who think it's decent to call others "bud" never once overlaps.

       You're on a primarily American website where Americans post about conspiracies affecting them. The most recent and fresh possible conspiracy is surrounding Parkland. I wanted to make the disinformation clear. I don't know what more you want. If you want to talk about other shit then make a worthwhile post about other shit instead of just being butthurt. Oh, and I'll call anyone whatever I please,

       It's like when Pizzagate debunkers use false arguments that never made any sense to discredit the movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, Alefantis is a Rothschild.
      </p>
      <p>
       THe very first day, we established his ancestry fairly well. So, when they push the wrong narrative, it discredits everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just the other day, I had a post removed by a mod from this sub that showed Alefantis interview where he admits there is a basement that he stores the tomato jars in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was removed for revealing personal info.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a person goes on the news or does an interview for a magazine THAT IS NOT PERSONAL DETAILS.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that is our fate in a containment board. They push the wrong narratives and bury the right ones.

       Personally, I think there are a lot of compelling to reasons to believe in some of the darker stuff, but I know for 100% fact, through FEC records and other financial information that has been made public, that Comet Ping Pong is a money laundering node for the DNC, Alefantis has other money laundering nodes and they are taking foreign money and cycling it through in ways that are attempting to conceal how much foreign collusion is really happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also know Alefantis' boyfriend, David Brock has multiple media outlets he owns and controls and they were both being blackmailed together, at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, there is enough reason for them to go to jail, already.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their lawyer is convicted trafficker, Laura Silsby's cohort. Along with a couple of proven ,well established connections through the mining industry, it is a fact that the Clintons are tied to human trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody is investigating the investigators, so even an investigation into this doesn't yield much for the public.

       What are the average yearly sales of Comet Ping Pong? Just want to get an idea of how much they could be laundering through there. The blackmail stuff has been public for a while though

       They use fundraisers and whatnot for Media Matters events and Podesta's CfAP events and you can see the paperwork for some of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But CPP is one of many Alefantis businesses. Bucks. Transformer. Pegasus. So, one node isn't going to paint the right picture for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's revenue, alone, is not much, at all. Last I check it was around $250k. My anecdotal experience is that, on paper, that is squeaking by, as most retail should average about 1k per day.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, at first glance, he is a humble restarauntuer.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, then, what is the Pagasus Museum? What is Transformer selling and why is Kamala Harris' sister, Maya involved?
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah... to answer your question, it is somewhere between 200k and 300k per year.

       YOu said that everyone knows about the blackmail, they do not. The MSM has never drawn attention to it and Alefantis was on TV and never addressed it.

       You pretend like Pegasus Museum was not a business, and just a name, but I pointed out that the business records do exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       You suggested that Transformer was just an art gallery, but the implications of who works there is of much greater significance and art is a known vehicle for money laundering.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that you misrepresented a lot of facts, minimized the seriousness of the situation and I feel that there is serious cause for concern and that it should be investigated.

       I think everyone should be sending this information to the FBI so that they finally do something.

        You see, you can't be taken seriously if you have to make shit up to try and convince people of stuff. My exact words were "the blackmail stuff has been public for a while", nothing close to what you said. I guess my favorite is when

       For the sake of moving this along, I will skip over my last question to you. Lol. And not really sure what you are trying to prove here but here we go. The fact that he was blackmailed was made public over 5 years ago by Fox News. The blackmail was over supposedly damning evidence his ex-lover had. My problem with that is Brock A. went to the police with the blackmail emails and texts and B. then went to court. If the guy really had dirt on him, would he really want the police or court system involved?

       Or he was a professional black mailer in the intelligence community pity and they needed fixer Maccoby to set in, just like Laura Silsby when she was caught trafficking little kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why didn't the ex lover get questioned by police and why isn't THAT the issue Fox News reported on?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, the actually I Portland details are not public and Fox News got all of its info from the pleading BUT STIL LEFT OUT WHAT WAS IMPORTANT. Even the important information that was already public.

       The only reason Fox News covered this was because it was something to make Media Matters and their lib media look bad. And since their goal was to make them look as bad as possible, I am more than sure that they sent reporters to talk to the blackmailer. And since they didn't report on anything, he must not have been reliable or actually have anything whatsoever. They probably realized this was some lovers quarrel and the guy was probably some scrub that lost his golden goose. So he started threatening to get money. As an example, I had an employee that kept showing up at my house texting me and trying to date me. I knew she was crazy and kept telling her no. One night, she showed up and told me that she was going to ruin my life. While I knew I had not done anything wrong, I was still freaked out. Welp, the next Monday, she went to my boss and told them I promised her a promotion if she fucked me. Luckily for me, I had text messages from her showing she was a stalker and crazy af. Without those texts, I would have been fired. It is more than likely the same type scenario

      <p>
       It is to distract from a false narrative. He has a basement, where he stores food supplies FOR COMET PING PONG. He is a liar and the shills focus on this argument as if it has anything to do with anything.

       Stoneman Douglas Eagles are red. That eagles shirt looks green like the Philadelphia eagles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: probably more grey or black. I really don't care about this kids background. I just don't think a gun ban is going to make the United States safer. The United States is far too big and her citizens too stubborn for a ban to ever be effective.

       That photo of the group of kids together, and the black woman (news anchor?) in the foreground: does anyone have any more details about this? Context? An explanation how that group of people would all be together for a group photo smiling and happy (which wouldn't make much sense if the photo was taken after the shooting, I presume it was taken before)... and then later after the shooting, 3 or 4 of them just happen to be the main figureheads all over news and social media talking about the event, and gun control?
      </p>
      <p>
       That seems like a huge coincidence to me. Which it very well could be just that, nothing is impossible. But in light of all the other conspiracy controversy being discussed, it just seems especially curious.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are the chances they'd all be in a photo op like that, and then 3 or 4 of them constantly getting the media spotlight after the shooting?
      </p>
      <p>
       A thought that comes to mind, is if the group photo was from some kind of media/press outreach type event at school for kids interested in joining the workforce of media/press, that the reporter used that established connection with the kids to quickly contact them and line up press events after the shooting occurred, to get a "quick scoop". That's the first plausible, rational, explanation I can think of.

       Didn't you have those kids at your high school? In my experience there were always kids (usually friends) that were pretty outspoken. I don't see how that would invalidate the things they are discussing though. They were there when the shooting happened. Do you need to see someone that was shot in order to believe that they want some regulations around firearms?
      </p>
      <p>
       Other kids that are pro freedom of access to firearms could speak out too, but that's like asking a student whose classmate just was killed by a drunk driver what they think about DUI laws. It just isn't gonna happen. That's why you are only seeing one side.

       I think you missed my point and my puzzlement.  I have since found more info on what I was referring to, so I'll do a brief write up and clarification:
      </p>
      <p>
       A photo was floating around of Hogg and other kids, and adults, all in a group smiling and laughing, as if 17 of their classmates had not just been recently murdered.  It looked so unnatural, that I just assumed the photo was taken before the shooting.  Hogg and at least 2 or 3 others in the photo have been the most visible, outspoken kids from the school rabidly calling for gun control.  Therefore, my question in my previous comment, was "how does this make sense, that these kids would all be in the photo together, then later turn out to be the most outspoken figures after the shooting?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Turns out, I was misunderstanding, because I had no original source. The photo was from a CBS news anchor planning to do interviews and give the kids a speaking platform. The photo was taken 3 or 4 days after the shooting... which leads me back to my comment, my disbelief
       <em>
        at how utterly weird it appears that they're all super happy, all smiles, not a trace of grief, and ready to launch into this whole gun control media campaign.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The CBS news anchor has since deleted her tweet with the photo, stating that some people thought it was in "poor taste" so she removed it.  So, more I'm just back to my original puzzled thought as to how yet bizarre it looks that these kids are not good stricken in that photo, taken just days after the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not even insinuating any kind of deep conspiracy angle here. It is near impossible for me to imagine any semi-realistic scenario involving "crisis actors" the way some people so eagerly clutch to the idea.  I am insinuating that it is really, really bizarre how unfazed and not grief-stricken these kids appear to be, in fact the opposite,
       <em>
        and that they're immediately being paraded around as political tools, gun control advocates, and they are even EAGER for it!
       </em>
       It's a really bizarre appearance.  I'm not the only one to think that -- the CBS news anchor tried to work that photo off the face of Twitter.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that,
       <em>
        plus
       </em>
       in the site I'm linking below, one of the kids tweets that (paraphrasing), "they won't be taken advantage of by anyone in the Trump administration, because they know their slimy tactics
       <strong>
        and have been training
       </strong>
       (??) for it" -- which is odd in itself,
       <strong>
        but is further bizarrely ironic
       </strong>
       that
       <em>
        the media
       </em>
       is currently and actively taking advantage of them....

       Not a fan of your source, because it seems way too focused on creating a narrative, but I did go to the twitter feed. I agree it does seem a bit odd. I still don't buy that these kids are part of some conspiracy or actors. I think they may just live in a political household and so they feel very strongly about their views.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was younger I didn't really pay that much attention to politics, but as I reached the end of high school and adulthood I took more of an interest. For these kids that happened while this current media circus has been going on. Both sides are so over the top it's hard to just get facts. I think that is what you are seeing, the new normal for trying to take the moral high ground. That is why these kids seem so outspoken and involved.

       Also, the school has a student body of 3,300.  That's got to be a fairly large campus.  Most students probably barely knew what was going on, if at all, so they all wouldn't be as traumatized as the kids who were immediately involved and in harm's way.

       I don't see your point. Suppose that the kids giving these interviews weren't shot at and didn't have a friend die. Do you think that prevents them from having an opinion about what happened? Classmates and teachers were still murdered. This still happened at their school, to their community. Are we going to implement a requirement that you can't speak out about a tragedy unless you were wounded?

       I'm adding to your point.  The reason they could be smiling and posing for pictures is that perhaps they were far removed from the actual attack and were never really in any harm. I'm just coming up with another possible explanation as to why some of the people weren't visible traumatized.  I was more keying into the person you were responding to when they said they couldn't understand how people could be smiling and happy after such and incident.

       Ahh, I see. That makes much more sense. I agree, that may be why these kids don't see it as a personal tragedy that they don't want to talk about and instead something that happened in their community that they are upset about.

       I like how it's a conspiracy to have actual victims of a mass shooting believe stricter gun laws need to happen. As if a victim of something like this could not possibly want gun control without payment or coercion.
      </p>
      <p>
       As if a teenager who's going to be paid attention to by media because of the situation wouldn't want to rehearse explaining their point of view so they don't come off as bumbling, traumatized, and inarticulate. You know, like most adults do who aren't used to being in front of a camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when a politician pushes an agenda for stricter gun control if that's what their constituents want, then they're automatically accused of taking advantage of the situation. But uhh yeah, it's possible that they're taking "advantage" of the situation to push the change that their constituents are screaming at them to push.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess if a person lives in a fantasy world where nobody could possibly believe in gun control, then anyone who wants gun control must be the product of malicious intent by TPTB to take something of yours away. The conspiracy comes down to those who would dare disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know someone will just accuse me of being a shill because that's how it goes, but whatever. I tried to have a vested interest in improving my country, but when any attempt at doing something good to change the status quo is met with accusations of shilling or conspiracies to undermine the American way of life, it's exhausting to continue caring if not impossible for some.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we as a country are so unable to accept that people might have points of view to attempt to make society better, and instead we're just going to make up conspiracy narratives about the people with whom we disagree while continuing to live in a society where it's common for broken human beings to want to mass murder those around them, then we're fundamentally broken.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually like shooting since I grew up with guns and learned how to fire rifles at a young age. That's beside the point though. Frankly I don't know what the real solution is because the problem is probably a combination of mental illness and lax gun laws in my opinion. Even more troubling is that it's hard not to come to the conclusion that we simply don't care about each other enough to stop a child from growing up and wanting to do this to people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes me want to move to a country where, while it might not replace everything I would miss about this country, at least people seem to care about each other more.

       We have to be very careful, because the powers that be are playing chess and we're playing checkers.

       It was actually a false flag, set up as a drill, and then actually happened.  They run crisis actors so they can control the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, they know that we're watching, so their tactic is to throw out weak evidence (which they have a ready made response for) so that when conspiracy theorists run with their bait, they expose it for being weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been falling for it myself, sharing the things which are extremely suspicious, yet aren't solid.  For example, the classmates(dot)com screenshot.  Anyone can enter him in there and say he was at a different high school.  Another example is the photo claiming he went to a different school, when a video comes out (much stronger than a random photo) of someone with the stoneman yearbook and him in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to examine everything, and not just focus on what could be baits.  We have to verify what we can also before posting.  The burden of proof is on us, and a single inaccuracy destroys any credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS, interesting coincidence, "Stoneman" high school.  (Freemason lingo?)

       I have the Russian investigation on my mind so.. couldn’t this easily be the Russians spreading misinformation, separating our country.  During the election they pumped out memes and misinformation so dumb people on Facebook could share them. Why couldn’t they do this in this situation? Just some thoughts

       Definitely. They definitely run the "play both sides and confuse everyone" playbook. In the case of the LagunaBeachAntifa account, however, I think the location being "Russia" is too obvious to be real, just attempted trolling. Hiding in plain sight is definitely a possibility though.

       After Florida School Shooting, Russian 'Bot' Army Pounced

       I'm sure someone will come to defend the honor of Russia or whatever, so, before you do:
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump said "I don't believe they interfered" about Russia. He now concedes they did. He still hasn't enacted the bipartisan sanctions against them that he signed. Legit reason why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Kushner's emails discuss meeting Russians as part of "the Russian government's support for Mr. Trump." Instead of calling the FBI, Kushner said, "I love it!" and went to the meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yeah....I don't buy that Trump/Russia is a manufactured hoax by the MSM and Dems. Moreover, I don't believe you buy that either, unless you can explain the two items above.

       Honestly, watching all of this come out yesterday and the media reaction to it, I think you’ve hit the nail square on the head with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was designed to draw out shitty conspiracy theorists and create a large, loud wave before anything was proven.  Then the media just needed to prove the things that you have here and, all of a sudden, now conservatives are ALL the embodiment of absolute monsters made of pure evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s incredible how easily people got played by this shit.  Everyone is on edge, looking for conspiracies. They knew the atmosphere was right. People fell right into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: one other thing I’ve noticed is the scope of how many people this reached. The people on my FB feed who are NEVER political spoke out about the evil people picking on David Hoagg.  I know these people...the kind of media effort it takes to get them to show interest in a political story is no small feat.  In other words, this campaign was MASSIVE.

       Well, didn't the same thing basically happen with the whole "Cruz is part of a white supremacist group" thing?  A head of a small white supremacist group told a bunch of MSM outlets Cruz was a part of their group, then after it was reported, the white supremacist leader recanted and the right hit the MSM for not verifying that Cruz was in the white supremacist group and just taking the leader of the white supremacist group's word for it.

       Exactly..... David Hogg is key to nothing. He is useful as a distraction only.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignore him..... the keys are with the alleged shooter and his adoptive and foster parents, the differing stories about the event, the proximity of the military, the fact that this is yet another shooting that happened when a drill was planned, the victim with the RICO concerns, and possibly one other "POI"

       I get a good laugh trying to imagine the person typing this, just trying to keep you going. Whats next? How many confirmed kills do you have? Are you trained in gorilla warfare? Should I just kill myself now to save myself from your wrath?

       What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

       I think this happens as you describe .. It reminds me of the clinton body count .. many of the alleged killings may be bogus -- &amp; a convenient way to discredit people trying to shed light on real murders -- like vince foster, &amp; the two teens in Arkansas who "got stoned, fell asleep on railroad trax, &amp; well you can guess the rest ..

       Great post!
      </p>
      <p>
       Your point hit the nail on the head for me. Now we need to look at the bigger picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's quite clear if you look at social media, news &amp; reddit that there is another campaign going on. there are fountains of posts attempting to encourage civilians to support gun control or subtlety scare civilians to  support it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example look at that walk out of school trend. Setup so professionally and spread on social meda (which is used by nieve kids and teenagers) to encourage them to rebel for tighter gun control. All this propaganda is being thrown in our faces and with this society everyone wanting to fit in this is perfect to control people. This is only the tip of the ice berg with all of the bots recently and the media manipulation controlled by the government. This world is mad.

       Or its a reaction to the lack of change after MANY previous school shootings, and an attempt to show the country that something has to be done.
      </p>

       Most people are involved simply because they don't want to hear about another shooting of children.

       Talking about chapters of antifa is like talking about chapters of Anonymous. It's just a name that independent people and groups of people use to describe themselves and their intentions. The only unifying factor of all the different groups and people is that they are using the same 'meme' so to speak.

       Arguing he is a crisis actor

       And people weren't saying he went to school in California, they were saying that the California video is somehow proof that he's a paid actor to push stories for the media all across the country, and not a legitimate student

       I'm sorry, I guess I am. Apparently the shooting is real. The kids really did go to the school. The kids really did survive a mass shooting.

       We're all on the same page here, except for a significant portion of this community who can't even agree on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the kids are also actors pretending to care about what happened or about laws that directly affected them, hired by CNN who risked literally everything on high schoolers keeping their mouths shut??

       Is it so hard to understand? Who do think it benefits that the pro-trump base think the massacre was a hoax? Not only it create more division, If they think this whole thing isn't real then they don't have to change their views on gun control.

       What if teen pregnancy rates rise to ridiculous highs? Will the solution be to advocate celibacy? Should we solve the opiate epidemic by incarcerating addicts and the mentally ill? Banning anything outright or heavy regulation never had a good track record here in the states if you hadn't noticed.

       To be clear, what I am about to say it not an attack against you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But fuck this "its too soon to talk about it" bullshit. The appropriate "narrative" after any sort of attack is a reasonable discussion about the materials used to perform the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kids died, and that is WHY the conversation needs to happen. Because it doesn't happen any other time! Or atleast when it does, it gets so little attention the NRA can quietly lobby it away.

       I'm also a regular at t_d and have been a regular here far longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       In t_d there was speculation about different theories when the video in California surfaced, but it was never widely refuted that he was a student or witnessed the shooting. The culture in t_d is very fact-based and the community is very, very proud of that. Claims are challenged and researched by other pedes all the time. Honestly you would know that if you actually browsed the sub for a few days.
      </p>
      <p>
       I first heard of this "evidence" today from a friend because I didn't see it on t_d (granted I wasn't browsing much today), and I was really skeptical of the whole thing because CNN wouldn't be so stupid as to make that mistake. And it looks like I was right, and other people felt the same way, which is why we are both here.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the "crisis actor" accusations never circled around whether or not he was a student, or if the shooting happened. It was about how he was caught fumbling his script on camera, and also caught rehearsing it
       <em>
        during
       </em>
       the shooting, and before his interviews.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the kid comes off as a pure psychopath. And all his pals follow the same script and have numerous ties to CNN and activist groups before the shooting. And FBI father is part of some super shady business deals during the 2008 financial crisis with all banks and all sorts of other swamp creatures.
