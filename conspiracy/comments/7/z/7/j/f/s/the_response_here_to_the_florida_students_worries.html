        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Below are my opinions, and I&#39;d appreciate it if we could have a community discussion on the issue rather than down/up vote brigades. </p>

<p>Nothing seems to rile this community up more than a shooting in the news. I think we mostly agree that the recent one in Florida happened, but there&#39;s clear factions regarding the false flag issue. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t personally have a problem with bump-stock or assault weapons bans or restrictions. I also don&#39;t have a problem with people owning guns and enjoying them safely. You do you, don&#39;t do me in while you&#39;re doing it. </p>

<p>The news today is flooded with mainstream voices actually discussing things like crisis actors, false flags and the like. I&#39;ll just say that this is interesting and probably not as organic as it is made to seem. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll get this in the open: I personally think it&#39;s likely incorrect and in bad taste to pile onto this David Hogg kid and his friends, who are actually trying to something about gun violence in schools. Meanwhile lobbying groups like the NRA sit and hope that the can gets kicked down the road so their cut of sales and donations doesn&#39;t diminish. Maybe they&#39;re funding shills to be extra vocal on twitter, youtube, even here perhaps. Maybe Soros is funding shills to be extra vocal on the other side too. I don&#39;t honestly care.</p>

<p>What bothers me, what worries me about this all, is that by piling on the students we lose sight of the kids who were killed and the broader problem of violence in the US.</p>

<p>The agenda of the media push in the last 48 hours seems clear to me: keep people focused on their hatred for those they disagree with; keep the tribal politics going; keep people distrustful of their neighbors and any voice that speaks too loudly; keep conversation limited to 280 characters; keep &#39;meme-ing&#39; this shit like it actually approximates a reasoned argument.</p>

<p>There are real people out there. People with loves and lives spent searching for the same peace we all hopefully want. We don&#39;t have to agree on what that means, but we should try to stop being so damn vitriolic. Remember the person and don&#39;t let yourselves be made less of one by your phone, your computer, or your television.</p>

<p>My problem here is that I don&#39;t believe these kids are doing this of their own accord.  It seems to me like they are being coached every step of the way and i find it disgusting that the media is using these children to promote their agenda. I dont have kids and havent been around high schoolers since high school so i might just be out of touch here, but this shit just doesnt seem organic to me.  also, theyve organized this shit waaaayyy to quickly for it to be organic. sorry if you dont agree, just my view from where i sit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally feel the gun debate is tired, but I don’t know why it’s so hard to believe these kids have developed this opinion on their own. I’m an 11th grade U.S. History and AP U.S. History teacher that frequently holds debates in my classroom. As you can imagine, most of my students argue their point in a way you can imagine a 16 year old would. I also have many students that are eloquent speakers (Mostly my AP class) A handful of my students started a letter writing campaign the day after the shooting. My point is, it’s not that far fetched to think 16 and 17 year olds have not only come to this conclusion on their own, but developed intelligent arguments on the subject. We’re not giving these kids enough credit. How these kids decided they were on the side of gun control is arguable. Maybe their parents openly discuss the issue at home or maybe the events of last week drove this way of thinking. My guess is there are just as many students that hold the opposite opinion. I’m holding a debate tomorrow regarding the events of last week, so I’ll report back.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s hard to believe they developed in on their own, because we have watched your entire generation be subjected to an endless stream of anti-firearm propaganda without any of the counterbalancing argument. There’s a reason the US government and our corporate overlords at CNN and Google want to take the guns away, and that’s because they are planning a totalitarian future for this country that they know that we will want to resist, once average people see the writing on the wall. It is VERY important to them that they have the guns off the table before that day comes. Also, that video where you literally hear Hogg being coached and told what to say, and taking multiple takes at it, also makes it hard to believe those are his own words. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My generation? I’m 31 years old. My generation is not that of these students.  I think it’s safe to say the anti firearm propaganda may have had an impact on these teens, but there are plenty of teens on the other side of the coin too. There are plenty of adults that have held these same ideas for decades as well. I think there are a lot of outside factors that influence every opinion we hold. It can be experience, parents, friends, school, media, etc. I’m definitely not saying I’m for taking guns away, or that even the majority of people feel that way. I’m saying it’s not absurd to think teens have formed this idea without direct coaching from their parents or other adults.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, watch the uncut footage of Hogg&#39;s interview. He isn&#39;t fed anything, he just has to start and stop multiple times throughout. It&#39;s not uncommon at all for someone being interviewed in front of a camera after a traumatic experience.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also curious where your assertion that there is no counterbalance in the gun debate is coming from. There is a massive right wing media machine operating every day that churns out pro-2A talking points nonstop, and the NRA is one of the most politically influential organizations in the country through both contributions and their rating scale for politicians. Are you not at all skeptical of them? I graduated high school just under 10 years ago, and when I debated these topics then I was met with very healthy pro-gun opposition. The notion that all high schoolers are incapable of thinking for themselves is not based in reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever heard of AM Radio? Fox News? AM radio is a silent giant of right wing propaganda. They&#39;re almost never mentioned in the discussion, but they have a massive base of listeners who eat up everything they say. The viewership for Fox News dwarfs CNN. They&#39;re reaching a much wider audience, yet no one in the conspiracy community wants to talk about the fact that they&#39;re hand puppets for Trump and GOP donors. I really have to wonder why that is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think you&#39;re being told the truth by Fox News and AM radio even half of the time, I have oceanfront property in Colorado that I think might interest you. The sheer magnitude of lies, mental gymnastics, and unabashed right wing propaganda coming out of these news outlets is mind-boggling. You might as well just put Trump in front of the camera himself, it&#39;s not like any of these spineless fucks are gonna say no when he shits his lies straight into their mouths so they can spit it out into yours.</p>

<p>Do you know how much money the weapons manufacturing industry makes off of the mass hysteria that Fox News whips up over literally fucking nothing? How about the amount of money the corporate robber barons like the Koch brothers made off of the GOP&#39;s tax cut? The tax cut that Fox News and AM radio shoved down their audience&#39;s throats? Or how about the number of free votes the GOP secures every year when Fox News convinces Catholics and old folks that the left wants to sodomize Jesus with crushed up infants as lube?</p>

<p>Are you really that fucking naive to think that these news outlets give even the slightest shred of a fuck about the truth? Or maybe you just like Fox News better because (((they))) don&#39;t have control over it?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing. If people take home more of their own money, you don&#39;t have to &#39;shove&#39; anything anywhere.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even support corporate media but the fact that you think they support Trump in general is pathetic. 90+% of new media contributions went to Hillary. You have been brainwashed, bud. Turn it off, even the Fox.</p>

You seem to want imagine that you will be able to fight the government with guns. Good luck.

I know that may be hard for you to comprehend due to your potential love affair with Ruppert Murdoch and Fox News they might have you believe that democrats are evil and the spawn of Satan but I really urge you to try and see the light of reason and not paranoid delusions of granduer when it comes to this image of malitias attempting to defend themselves with guns against the most armed nation on the globe.  The Oregon standoff was execute by radical RIGHT wingers, in my mind, domestic terrorists.  That standoff was over before it even began, and nobody was killed. </p>

<p>Edit: They&#39;ve been busy since the shooting. You know. Grieving. Not going to class. Going to funerals. Being surrounded by this in their reality and everyday life.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not surprised that some students have taken an active role in trying to prevent this sort of thing from happening. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also not surprised that there is a willing media out there that is salivating at the prospect of parading them around for ratings.</p>

<p>But. I think these kids are just happy to have a platform for their message.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This captures my feelings about it pretty well. </p>

<p>I was most prone to getting politically active when I was young like them. The older I get the more jaded and overwhelmed with the endlessness of this kind of stuff I get. So I&#39;m not surprised that kids are speaking out.</p>

<p>I also think kids today are far more savvy with media today. Youtube stars are all younger than me, the demographic on Reddit skews younger than me too. I&#39;m still confused by the idea of social media influencers and all that crap, but these kids get it almost intuitively.</p>

<p>Yes, they&#39;re being exploited by media and political groups. But they&#39;re probably trying to exploit them right back in order to have a platform for their pain and their desire for change. </p>

Just like this rifle, most handguns these days are semiautomatic, and can hold well over 10 rounds, especially with extended magazines. Just over 10 years ago the Virginia tech shooter killed twice as many people using handguns. Are those “assault” weapons also? </p>

<p>Emotional arguments like this have one purpose on a sub like this. To shut down conversation. Period. Saying it’s in “bad taste” to question ANYTHING on a conspiracy sub is a major, major no-no. You may not be a shill, you may be a normal guy. But if so, you are the wrong type of mind for these types of investigations. Anyone with a soft, moralizing heart shouldn’t even consider conspiracies. There is no room for emotional, moral arguments for these issues.

    <div class="md"><p>I respectfully disagree. Wasn&#39;t trying to shut down conversation but start one. Really it seems to me that if the suddenness and scope of the students&#39; response seems inorganic to some, then perhaps the way the narrative about them being crisis actors got pushed was equally inorganic. </p>

<p>I&#39;m more than fine with the community looking at the data, even when it&#39;s in bad taste. But this community isn&#39;t necessarily all that good at having discussions about the data. We devolve into shouting oppositions quite a lot. My post was meant as a reminder not only that these kids deserve some due consideration, but also that we in the community should remember the fact that a real person exists on the other end of these comments, not just a talking point to react to.</p>

<p>And I also think that if we lose all our softness, all our emotion, and all our morality, then the whole effort of uncovering conspiracies is a useless exercise meant to maintain our identity as opposers of power. Is the point not to expose the evil in the world? To &#39;drain the real swamp?&#39; Or are we just collecting specimens and giving up on the idea of a better world, of better uses of power. Maybe that&#39;s disqualifying to you, but I hope others would agree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the deep state media truly cared about preventing these mass shooting incidents and not just promoting their agenda of disarming law abiding citizens, then they would be focusing on the preconditioning affects of all these violent first hand shooter video games that are literally centered around virtual mass murdering other people online while teaching para-military tactics and very realistic &quot;assault&quot; weapons training to teenagers who are taking an ever growing list of barely regulated or tested psychotropic pharmaceutical drugs for mental health and emotional disorders usually caused by fucked up traumatic family and life experiences. The combination of these influences has been the case in almost every single one of these incidents and are much much more to blame than a commonly available model of firearm - illegally acquired in most cases - used when they go act out their mass murder fantasies in real life.</p>

<p>The fact that the anti-gun narratives consistently ignore the actual influential causes of every single one of these incidents while focusing only on demonizing the weapon used to commit the crime is a disgusting and absurd display of politicizing these tragedies to promote an agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll admit that I had designs on thinking I&#39;d be a badass with a gun since I had played so many video games.  I didn&#39;t shoot one until I was in my thirties.  Not saying that I&#39;d want to ever hurt someone with a gun, but I figured I would be pretty accurate at shooting targets...that are shaped like people.</p>

<p>Anyways, first time I fired a handgun I started out a little disappointed in myself.  I was semi-accurate at like 5 yards to start with, but I started getting worse the more I shot.  Wasn&#39;t until later that I started looking into how to improve my aim and what I was doing wrong.  There are so many little details that go into your accuracy.  How stiff the trigger is can affect it, meaning how hard do you have to pull your finger to get the gun to fire.  If you are unprepared for a stiff trigger you might move the tip of the gun off target.  Are you closing your eyes in anticipation of the gun going off?
  Everything down to even how you hold the gun and your stance can affect your accuracy.  </p>

<p>All video games taught me was to point the gun in the direction I was firing it and that was about it.  I can almost see the argument that games might teach you how to breach a room or something, but you could learn that from a book too.  You could learn that from anywhere, and again it doesn&#39;t teach you how to actually fire the gun or how to handle it when you actually do fire the gun.  </p>

<p>Point being I agree.  It is a serious stretch to suggest that games teach anyone how to do things like this.  </p>

This isn&#39;t Inside The Actor&#39;s Studio. The shooting happened a week ago, it&#39;s not insane to think these kids can rally behind this cause and build a swell of support in a week. As for them &quot;not being affected as much as they should&quot; or &quot;jumping on using this moment as a catalyst, when they just lost friends&quot; ... Did you ever think, this is the best way to honor a friend you just lost to a senseless shooting? Instead of silently grieving and allowing the nation to yet again move on and forget about another tragedy, use the moment as a podium and ACTUALLY TRY TO ACCOMPLISH CHANGE to honor the lives of your fallen friends? Christ. I&#39;m losing faith in the mental stability of this sub I&#39;ve loved for so long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We cannot; I repeat - <em>cannot</em> - allow emotional appeals and outrage determine policy. Once we start conceding our rights to emotional vomit, it&#39;s over for America, because those who cater to those ruled by their emotions will have tasted the blood they&#39;ve longed for, and once they have it, they&#39;ll go for the jugular.</p>

<p>This is part of the reason government moves so slowly. Policy must be set through logic and reason and well-placed, heavily debated arguments, not knee-jerk emotionally charged reactions. There isn&#39;t enough blood in the world that can equate to the freedoms that are guaranteed to US citizens and we <em>must</em> remain vigilant in order to preserve those rights.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t surprise me that you have so many kids that are anti-2nd amendment in front of the camera. There are several reasons, but I&#39;ll spotlight two. One is that you&#39;ve got a generation growing up that has never been safer or more sheltered than the ones involved in this tragedy, so it makes sense that they wouldn&#39;t identify with the usefulness and value of guns and would only see them as tools of death; that they&#39;d feel threatened just knowing that they weren&#39;t already banned. The other reason is that elements of the government - and by proxy, the media - want Americans to enter a state where they rely entirely on Big Government for their self-defense.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even own a gun and I say fuck that. I also say that for the first time in my life I am considering donating to the NRA. I see encroachment on our rights on a daily basis and at least the NRA is dedicated to preserving the 2nd. I just wish there was an equally influential group dedicated to the 1st and the 4th.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CRISIS = Traumatic event involving PEOPLE.</p>

<p>ACTOR = person paid to read of script.</p>

<p>NOTE: one can act, or crisis-act, but not be a &#39;crisis-actor&#39;, if one is not being directly paid.</p>

<p>Acting is a skill, and a job.</p>

<p>Crisis is an event or time proceeding it. </p>

<p>Now, do crisis actors exist?</p>

<p>Im asking you, if vocal human vultures exist.</p>

<p>I&#39;m asking if records sales and black swans drive emotive behavior over rational behavior.</p>

<p>Im asking if trump had anything to do with the shooting and if not, why is he being associated by this kid so hard</p>

<p>Im asking, did anyone else have formal actor training, prior to being a smiling face who goes serious when it&#39;s time to act.</p>

<p>Im asking, are they reading from scripts given to them?</p>

<p>Im asking, whose paying for this, or them?</p>

<p>I dont care about his dad and mom, as those are just variables to probability weight, and not facts about the case. The case is, the words crisis and actor mean stuff, and when combined, they perfectly describe the self-motivated and enriching vulture-like behavior of these pick-and-choose emotional-mode propagandists. </p>

<p>What do you call a person that reads from a script and is paid?</p>

<p>What do you can  a traumatic event and it&#39;s after math?</p>

<p>Put them together. Does any of that imply the events - the crisis - itself was not real?</p>

<p>Or, does the term by words alone, then added in the most basic way to form a meaning, meaning a crisis in which there is or is now actors involved.</p>

<p>You&#39;re speaking OUR language. So, assume you dont know what is being said until you ask, what do YOU mean by CRISIS ACTOR, and not &quot;how does the MSM definition match you guys&quot;.</p>

<p>As, you already assume they have the moral high-ground, because they primed the conversation to assume &#39;alt-right&#39; trolls are doing such and such. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The regulations, and policies we already  have in place are not enforced correctly, and if they were would have prevented at least this florida shooting and the church shooting in texas.  Even if more laws are passed, it won&#39;t matter if we still don&#39;t follow procedure.</p></li>
<li><p>The old argument that laws only govern law abiding citizens. Criminals will still have guns. Heroin is illegal, meth is illegal... wait how do so many people die each year from heroin and meth if they are illegal? How the fuck are people aquiring illegal things?</p></li>
<li><p>The 1994 assult weapon ban did not work, some even arguing it had the opposite effect as intended. Research into this please.</p></li>
<li><p>Mass shootings make up for less than 1% of all gun deaths.  As tragic as mass shootings are, they are a fringe case scenario and guns are not the root of the problem.

<p>Nah, never heard of it. Lol Hell, you don&#39;t have to go back that far. It was an unwinnable war just like all the shit we have going on in the desert right now. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, including all of the reserves there is about 2 million. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Only like 30% of the population owns all of the guns (and there are actually more than 300 million guns) so your number is really inflated. Still doesn&#39;t answer what small arms can do against drones and bombs. Plus, I just don&#39;t see a scenario where the government would have anything to gain by attacking us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not to mention how many soldiers would refuse orders to kill their own citizens. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are exactly right about that, and it&#39;s the reason why I know confescating all of the guns is logistically impossible. When Obama was elected everyone told me they were coming for all the guns. After 8 years and my safe is still brimming. </p>

<p>Look, I&#39;m a &quot;gun guy&quot;. I always have been, and always will be. I understand both sides of the gun control argument, but this shit is getting pretty silly. This country has a serious mental health problem coupled with easy access to firearms. I&#39;ll just say it. Maybe owning certain types of firearms should be more of a privilege than a right. I have to jump through hoops to obtain my suppressors and SBR&#39;s. Maybe an 18 year old kid should have to jump through some of those same hoops to get a semi-auto rifle with high capacity magazines. Not willing to give an inch (and I do understand that line of thinking) is just some redneck shit in my eyes. I know I&#39;m going to be on the right side of history on this one. Laughable background checks, unregulated private sales, and no kind of registry whatsoever is just silly IMO. When we regulate automobiles way more than firearms there might be a problem. It&#39;s really a complex issue and I don&#39;t pretend to have the answers. I just know that business as usual isn&#39;t going to cut it. I can&#39;t even keep up with which mass shooting is which anymore. As a firearm enthusiast I know we are going to have to give a little at some point. It&#39;s going to inconvenience us and I&#39;m ok with that. </p>

<p>The mere fact so many Americans are armed is what keeps our government from encroaching on our liberties faster than they do. It would be a lot easier to do so if the people were not armed. </p>

<p>I know where you are going with this - &quot;But your guns stand no chance against tanks and missles and drones and the military!&quot; You are assuming the military would gladly follow orders to attack its own citizens. I bet most military would refuse as it would violate their oath to protect the country from domestic threats and unconstitutional orders.

The sheer magnitude of lies, mental gymnastics, and unabashed right wing propaganda coming out of these news outlets is mind-boggling. You might as well just put Trump in front of the camera himself, it&#39;s not like any of these spineless fucks are gonna say no when he shits his lies straight into their mouths so they can spit it out into yours.</p>

<p>Do you know how much money the weapons manufacturing industry makes off of the mass hysteria that Fox News whips up over literally fucking nothing? How about the amount of money the corporate robber barons like the Koch brothers made off of the GOP&#39;s tax cut? The tax cut that Fox News and AM radio shoved down their audience&#39;s throats? Or how about the number of free votes the GOP secures every year when Fox News convinces Catholics and old folks that the left wants to sodomize Jesus with crushed up infants as lube?</p>

<p>Are you really that fucking naive to think that these news outlets give even the slightest shred of a fuck about the truth? Or maybe you just like Fox News better because (((they))) don&#39;t have control over it?</p>
