        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This could very well be nothing, but I found a line that stood out to me a little.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Police officers arriving on the scene from the adjacent city of Coral Springs thought the gunman was still inside as they searched the building, based on a security camera video feed that they mistakenly believed was showing them real-time images but was actually footage from 20 minutes earlier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is this: why would the security cameras in the school be delayed by 20 minutes? That seems like it would do no good, and even cause several disruptions throughout the day, not being able to see live video.</p>

<p>I could just be missing something. Maybe they rewound the tape to see it before the police got there (but what good would that do? Why wouldn&#39;t they tell the police that they had done this? Wouldn&#39;t they be able to tell by listening for gunshots and coordinating with other officers?).</p>

<p>Too many things in this story are too coincidental for it to just be &quot;another fucked up kid with a gun&quot;. </p>

<p>Remember: the guns aren&#39;t the issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This argument will never convince the other side since they don&#39;t believe guns are sentient and go out and kill people on their own.  They argue that if people don&#39;t have access to guns, then gun deaths will occur less often. It&#39;s that argument that needs to be won if someone wants to convince the other side, not one that guns kill people on their own which isn&#39;t being debated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The argument can easily be won.  Outlaw alcohol and we would see a drastic decline in DUI related deaths. Then, if we outlaw cars we would completely eliminate car related deaths. Since that worked so well if we outlaw fast food we would see a drastic decline in obesity, heart disease and diabetes.  This cycle continues until everything has been taken away. Stripping rights away from an entire population because a single person can’t make sound decisions is illogical and doesn’t even warrant discussion.  </p>
