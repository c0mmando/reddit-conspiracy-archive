        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Anyone notice how if you say something against vaccines theyre demonized.</p>

<p>I live in Australia and the Governement is pushing its vaccine agenda on children hard. If parents dont get the prescribed vaccines to theier children, they are denied Government payments and they cant enrol their children in childcare places.</p>

<p>Ive heard its just as bad in America. Notice how big pharma go after the children becuase they know most adults arent stupid enough to put all this chemical garbeage into ther bodies.</p>

<p>And when major epidemics do break out, the media make out that its the end of the word when in reality only a handful of people die.</p>

<p>The studies that link vaccines to autism always get ignored, and the studies that are pro vaccine are always funded by big pharma. </p>

<p>Some vaccines have ingredients that have major side affcts and yet thier given to babies whose immune systems are far from developed??</p>

<p>I refuse to take any vaccines ever. Whenever the Government pushes something im always skeptical. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got vaccinated and I&#39;m not messed up.</p>

<p>The entire country of Brazil gets vaccinated, it&#39;s a legal requirement, they don&#39;t have half of the autism rates as the U.S..</p>

<p>And the spectrum for autism has been shifting for the last 10 years. I have both adhd and I&#39;m mildy dyslexic. Now a days I would be considered autistic since both of those are on the autism spectrum.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t &quot;more cases of autism&quot;, it&#39;s the defination of autism has been changed to include literally everything under the sun.</p>

<p>Your link states:</p>

<p>But, the few epidemiological studies that looked for a direct link between SV40 and human cancer provided inconsistent conclusions. Some reports found that there was an increased risk of cancer from SV40 exposure[63] and others found that there was no risk.</p>

<p>However what we do know is that when polio was still present in this hemisphere it was potentially fatal, particular to children (and this isn&#39;t addressing the possible debilitating after effects of an infection).</p>

<p>In any event, those years of polio vaccine contamination neither supports any autism/vaccine link nor does it back the general in any way this poster&#39;s vague and ominous concerns about governments pushing vaccines or lines like this:</p>

<p>Plus you&#39;d think the most vaccinated country would be the healthiest if they actually did as advertised but that&#39;s not the case at all. I&#39;d even argue it&#39;s the exact opposite. Vaxxers are some sickly people, seems like most I know are sick every other week. </p>

<p>Ya man fuck dem immunologists and their science n&#39; sheet. </p>

<p>But seriously though, as someone studying immunology, no. Vaccines do not overstimulate the immune system. A couple of inert viral particles or attenuated viruses are in no way going to overload anything. Your immune system deals with an insane amount of shit. Have you seen the intestinal tract? There is basically a 24/7 immune response down there. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Is this really still a thing? I thought with all this talk about the human biome and even human virome we had moved past this?</p>

<p>So I&#39;m an anti vaccer anyways. I attended a talk by a guy who was a PHd student of virology arranged by my local skeptics in the pub group specifically for me I suppose. It was interesting but rather reinforced my suspicion about the compartmentalization that exists in science. I played nice and mostly listened and the guy gave his talk and he didn&#39;t really seem able to address my questions. We ended up talking past one another I guess and this was a couple of years ago now so I was very new to the subject.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to give you a hard time or anything and I hope you do awesome with your studies.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if this seems like I don&#39;t have a point but I just wanted to chat. Best of luck with your studies.</p>

<p>You can ask me anything if you like and I promise I will be nice and not chew a strip off you.</p>

<p>Would you mind if I asked you some questions?</p>

<p>The &quot;everything is trying to kill you&quot; was more of a joke, but it&#39;s all VERY much a question of balance. A lot of interactions can be boiled down to &quot;your immune system keeps them under control&quot;. Normally harmless bacteria can become major issues in the case where you suddenly become immunocompromised. </p>

<p>Sure go ahead. I&#39;ll answer what I can. In the case where I don&#39;t know the specifics of a certain topic (please understand that immunology is a vast field, you could spend a lifetime on just one cell type), I could toss the question to one of my profs if you want. </p>

<p>This right here is the prime example of how to <em>not</em> confirm whether something is true. It&#39;s personal anecdote mixed with appealing to common sense and a sprinkle of argument from ignorance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, and you &quot;hate&quot; this approach?</p>

<p>I mean the guy answered the question honestly. Also their is a lot of latitude for interpretation when a person says they arrived at a conclusion through common sense. I guess I just don&#39;t understand why this seems to be a red flag for you but honestly it doesn&#39;t matter too much as I said I don&#39;t want to get bogged down on this.</p>

<p>I was wondering if you cover vaccines in your course? You said it was about immunology and it seemed to cover the human and the bacterial side of things so presumably as vaccines are a common thing the course also cover them yes?</p>

<p>We know that vaccines can cause problems and antivaxxers say this is a real issue and pro vaxxers say it is a slight issue only.</p>

<p>Does your course cover the ways vaccines can and have caused issues?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want this to appear as a &quot;gotchyou&quot; question but it is something I am curious about.</p>

<p>So a few examples. A recent event happened a few years ago where a bad batch of vaccines caused paralysis in kids in Western Australia and I watched a vid a few weeks ago where A Wakefield said of the three versions of the MMR sold in England two were recalled due to causing an unacceptable level of meningitis.</p>

<p>So the principle is that vaccines can have problems and the dispute is over whether this is managed well or not.</p>

<p>My question is if your course covers general principles of the design choices or factors that would make a vaccine safer or more dangerous and what the various trade offs and decisions that have to be made are?</p>

<p>Hey and thanks for taking the time so far. I do appreciate it.</p>

<p>&quot;the marginal advantages of the vaccine in children over one year of age have to be offset against adverse effects of the vaccine itself, which are very common indeed and may be followed occasionally by irreversible brain damage, paralysis and mental deficiency. Because of this danger, or for fear of it, many parents and doctors are reluctant to vaccinate their children.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Furthermore, while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated. The principle of primum-non-nocere was violated.&quot;</p>

<p>Follow the money!! (see below)</p>

<p>How Much US Pediatricians Make From Vaccines</p>

<p>&quot;So how much money do doctors really make from vaccines? The average American pediatrician has 1546 patients, though some pediatricians see many more. The vast majority of those patients are very young, perhaps because children transition to a family physician or stop visiting the doctor at all as they grow up. As they table above explains, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays pediatricians $400 per fully vaccinated child. If your pediatrician has just 100 fully-vaccinated patients turning 2 this year, that’s $40,000. Yes, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays your doctor a $40,000 bonus for fully vaccinating 100 patients under the age of 2. If your doctor manages to fully vaccinate 200 patients, that bonus jumps to $80,000. V But here’s the catch: Under Blue Cross Blue Shield’s rules, pediatricians lose the whole bonus unless at least 63% of patients are fully vaccinated, and that includes the flu vaccine. So it’s not just $400 on your child’s head–it could be the whole bonus. To your doctor, your decision to vaccinate your child might be worth $40,000, or much more, depending on the size of his or her practice.</p>

<p>If your pediatrician recommends that your child under the age of 2 receive the flu vaccine–even though the flu vaccine has never been studied in very young children and evidence suggests that the flu vaccine actually weakens a person’s immune system over the long term–ask yourself: Is my doctor more concerned with selling me vaccines to keep my child healthy or to send his child to private school?&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Weil, pg. 24: &quot;There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we’ve got a serious problem.&quot; .... &quot;the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data. To think there isn’t some possible problem here is unreal.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 31: &quot;we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 44: &quot;Now for speech delays, which is the largest single disorder in this category of neurologic delays. The results are a suggestion of a trend with a small dip. The overall test for trend is highly statistically significant above one.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Bernier, pg. 113: &quot;So we are asking people who have a great job protecting this information up until now, to continue to do that until the time of the ACIP meeting. So to basically consider this embargoed information.&quot;</strong></p>
