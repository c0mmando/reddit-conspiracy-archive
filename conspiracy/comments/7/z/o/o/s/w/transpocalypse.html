       It has been my observation over the last 45 odd years that sex in general, and all of the sub sets of it, have been bubbling to the surface slowly but surely. As an example of this just look at movies and TV. The first year that the word "fuck" appeared in a major motion picture was 1968. The 1970s "sexual revolution" has had its intended effect. Being gay isn't nearly as problematic as it once was. Transsexual folks are merely on off shoot of the gay crowd. But as far as a "Transpocalypse" goes, I doubt that. Yes, Trans folks want to be heard and noticed like everyone else. Are they being too aggressive? That's debatable. But even if they are, its not the big issue that it is made out to be. Yes, sexually, it does blur the old fashioned lines. But then so does guys wearing very long hair and/or and earring. Tans folks are just the next step in the
       <em>
        evolution
       </em>
       .

       yeah that part I have no problem with. im perfectly ok with trans/ gay/ what ever, I was just surprised to see the theory that everyone in Hollywood has been trans for years and years and years. I wanted to find more info on the topic because its very intriguing, especially with all the social advancement of transgenders in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       its more of a "hmm, I wonder if this is true?" than a rejection of the idea of being trans lol

       Hollywood has had more than its share of gays since the beginning. Clark Gable, Rock Hudson, John Travolta, Greta Garbo, James Dean just to name but a very few. That said, its not surprising then that there would be a lot of trans folks in Hollywood. Now to the question of why. First, gays are
       <em>
        born that way
       </em>
       . So are Trans folks. Second, I have seen evidence (no I can't lay hands on it at present) being gay and having a above average IQ (or talent ability) is a strong correlation. Does one tie into the other? Possibly.

       Dave Chappell makes a reference to something similar in his recent Netflix specials. Says something along the lines of “The only reason everybody is talking about transgenders is because white men want to do it. If black dudes wanted to do it, they would just say go away nobody cares." I paraphrased that, but it is an interesting point that stuck with me a little. Might want to go watch it yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, the entire idea does sound crazy. But I've learned to not dismiss something right away just because it immediately appears to me to be "crazy".

       yeah i had watched his new specials, they were revealing to say the least. his whole "wear the dress dave" bit got me curious too. then i started seeing some of these videos and was like " huh, well now im definitely gonna need to dig more"

       He talks about that in his "Inside the Actors Studio" interview with James Lipton. Talks about how all famous black men in Hollywood are asked to put on a dress at some point in their career, and how he refused.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Although I just recently remembered he wears a dress in Robin Hood Men in Tights, so there's that)

       yeah that was definitely interesting. along with the whole idea of the rampant homosexuality in upper tiers of the hip hop game, there are serious red flags popping up. then tie all this into the "do what thou will" mindset and the whole agenda starts feeling really ominous

       yeah hes a known transgender though, this is more talking about the idea that most hollywood actors are transgendered at birth and presented as the opposite sex in the name of satan/the androgyn.

       It is entirely possible, but difficult to prove, that RuPaul is a FTM in drag.

       Either way, Jazz Jennings story is certainly one that concerns me.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you watch an interview of Jazz Jennings on the Meredith show she says that she ““
       <strong>
        realized she was transgender
       </strong>
       ”” at
       <strong>
        two years old
       </strong>
       :
       <em>
        “[At two] I said that I was a girl...I knew who I was on the inside and made sure I defined it. And I asked ‘when is the good fairy gonna take me along and
       </em>
       <strong>
        change my body parts’
       </strong>
       .
       <em>
        ..that was a turning moment when they [my parents] realized I was different and had to help me become the girl I knew I was inside.
       </em>
       ” At
       <strong>
        3 years old
       </strong>
       she was diagnosed with gender dysphoria.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve seen clips of “I am Jazz” and transgender or not, there is clear sexualizing of a
       <strong>

       whether directly (asking her thoughts on an orgasm) or indirectly...very disturbing but not new territory for TLC.
That said, there’s more to consider about Jazz: look up the anatomical differences between males and females. Now take a close look at Jazz. As far as I can tell she has the markers of a biological female: feminine skull-no prominent brow ridge, no sloping back forehead, rounded jawline, small chin, no Adam’s apple, soft features, feminine wrists, clearly feminine digit ratio (pointer longer than ring) even how she puts on weight and it looks like hips about as wide as shoulders. in this photo female proportion arms and shoulders (last picture: man on the left, woman on the right)

       influential people in the spotlight, especially ones who are idolized by children, are very different than people in the general public (because of their influence) and should be held to a different standard. I believe we have an obligation to question the people and the messages which are shifting our perspectives and re-shaping our society as a whole.

       <strong>
        TLDR
       </strong>
       ; Jazz Jennings’ story doesn’t add up.../...her show “I am Jazz” has significant sexual discussion/focus (i.e. orgasm talk) despite her being a minor.../...and she appears to have natural female anatomy, indicating she may not be transgender. These things should at least be considered since she is praised as a role model for kids with gender dysphoria.

       That’s the theory.  But if that’s true, how does that affect RuPauls followers on a subconscious level?  It would be yet another example of deceptive, clandestine transgenderism.  I
       <em>
        strongly
       </em>
       believe based on my own personal experience that this kind of distortion of realistic, natural sexuality can have a significant effect on a developing child’s mind.   That is the concern, why are so many children identifying as “transgender”?  You cannot deny the influence of the media and when transgenderism is pushed explicitly or subconsciously it will have an effect. And transgenderism
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a disconnect between the mind and body and there is research that shows that this disconnect can be addressed and cured through effective therapy.  Video:

       It's part of the Baphomet (Satanic false god with traits from both sexes) worship from Babylon.  They worship androgyny.  Many of them are probably blasted with hormones in utero which can produce the opposite sex's organs much like Freemartins.

       These cultists have been ruling us for a long time.   Want to know what "Victoria's Secret" actually is?  Go google image search pics of Queen Victoria.  Try not to laugh.  That's the secret and it's he same secret every one of Victoria's secret "supermodels" also has.  They are all inverts and they get off on deceiving us.   This is also why the "trans agenda" seems to have popped out of nowhere.

      <p>
       They are all over entertainment, fashion, and politics worldwide.  There are probably a lot f Freemartins walking around that have no idea they are inverted.  Who knows?  This guy covers much more of it than gatekeepers like MrE:

       If the theory is that Trans people were blasted with hormones in utero, why is there such a stigma against them? In that line of thinking, they are victims and it’s not an intentional choice. Shouldn’t we fight to help them or work to prevent this hormone-blasting instead of stigmatizing these people?

       Yes they are all victims.  Also, who knows how many everyday Transgenders are actually victims of this as well.  If you were a female in utero then blasted and came out with male parts.  You may have no idea and yet in your head there is this nag that you are actually a female.  So eventually you become a "transgender" when in fact you are just reverting back to what your gender originally was meant to be.  In this way they are creating the entire transgender issue.  That could be the case depending on how prevalent this actually is.  Are we in a "they live" scenario?  Perhaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope people that get to this level start to realize that the Devil is real which means God is real.  Everyone, yes even transgenders need to come to the realization that they need Jesus Christ as their savior.  All sin comes with the same eternal punishment.  To be saved all one needs to do is realize they are sinners headed for the lake of fire and repent of their current state and belief system and believe this:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
      </p>
      <p>
       He did it all for you personally already.  There is nothing for you to do but repent and believe it in your heart.

       Whatever your personal religious beliefs are, I think we could all make sure we treat people with compassion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a lot of the trans happening these days is a result of our lack of chemical and hormonal regulation in our environment today and these people are a victim of that. I volunteered in a crisis center, and met quite a few - they weren’t actively pushing an agenda and didn’t feel that it was any choice. I don’t believe that if they prescribed to your faith, they would consider themselves sinners. They could use compassion, say what you will about MSM portrayal or agenda but the average day to day person is up against a lot and could use any compassion or kindness.

       I agree with you.  They don't deserve hate.  I'm a born again King James Bible believing Christian and according to my faith every single one of us are sinners and all sin carries the same penalty (death).  There is no reason to take one thing and hold it up above the rest.  I'm just as much of a sinner as any transgender person.  The only difference is I've believed in Jesus Christ's blood sacrifice to wash my sin away from my eternal soul.  He will do that for any sinner no matter what the sin.  So Christians that constantly bash gay and transgender individuals are not following what the Bible teaches.  Even the members of the most satanic cults in the world can and need to be saved.

       I am skeptical of the “freemartin” theory, here is a video explaining the [fraud of transgender medicine] showing incredible success in the past of people with gender identity discorder being effectively
       <strong>
        <em>
         cured
        </em>
       </strong>
       through therapy, as it
       <strong>
        should be treated
       </strong>
       . Now if you look it up the consensus of the medical field is that
       <strong>
        <em>
         hormone replacement and surgery is the standard treatment
        </em>
       </strong>
       for this disorder.  It’s not necessary, there is scientific proof that therapy works and surgery is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       the answer.  But “special interests” have hijaked this area of medicine with their own agenda, and it is
       <em>
        not supported by the research
       </em>
       .  It’s truly disturbs me to my core when I read that. It’s frightening to think that fraudulent medicine has become standardized.  There is no other condition that is treated this way.  Mental disorders are psychological and should be by psychologists, not surgeons.

       as I said in a few posts I am doing my own independent research too, but i wanted information from multiple source, hence why I asked for information, not opinions. My own google search biases could be hiding information I would otherwise find, so its never a bad idea to ask the community too.

       plus with all the school shooting stuff flooding everywhere I figured this could be a good alternate topic to discuss a little

       for the trans agenda yes, for this specific topic of secret trans in hollywood, not as much was available. hence the post about me asking for more information on the topic. plus like I said, with all the gun stuff, this seemed like a interesting topic to discuss

       Have you considered how sexist this theory is? That women couldn't possibly be as successful and talented as they are, but were seemingly put into the public sphere to fit a theory that only seems to have arisen as diversity expands? Men and women of color are making milestones in Hollywood. Female directors, writer, actors and producers. Child actors able to produce their own content by the time they hit majority. Small foreign films getting wide audiences. It's only as rich white males are losing their total  influence on box offices that this has become a thing that's even uttered outside of conservative religious communities?

       It’s both men and women that the theory talks about, don’t worry it’s pretty inclusive and blames men women and children equally. Now it’s apparent you really have nothing of value to add.

       yeah hes a known transgender though, this is more talking about the idea that most hollywood actors are transgendered at birth and presented as the opposite sex in the name of satan/the androgyn.

       I'm more interested in the legitimacy of those claims
