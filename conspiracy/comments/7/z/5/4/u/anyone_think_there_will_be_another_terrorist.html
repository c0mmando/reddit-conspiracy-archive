    <div class="md"><p>Well it all depends I think on how well the NWO plans are going. Too much resistence = another terrorist attack by our leaders to take over the media and convince you of this fake outside threat. The NWO is coming and nothing will stop it. So do we fight and be branded terrorists or do we leave it and be branded with bar codes? Quite a dilema they have shoe-horned us into.. almost as if that was the plan all along. The intimidation is now their primary weapon it seems. It hurts that countless people gave their lives fighting 2 world wars to preserve our freedom and we (now high on fluoride and apathy) just flick it off as nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There will be one within the first year of a Republican president.  I would suspect it to involve the use of ports, as during the entire &quot;homeland security&quot; circle jerk, no one ever cared about the ports.  Side-stream media as well as main stream media even covered how easy it would be, yet nothing was done.  </p>

<p>No one would leave such a gaping hole in security like that unless it was intentionally left blank.</p>

<p>I do not know what, I would expect demolition and explosions.  It would have to be grander than 9/11 to really scare the people the way the NWO wants.  </p>

<p>The next attack will not happen with democrats in control.  NWO has spent way too long trying to convince the public that the dems are weak on terror.  NWO will let democrats loosen security and pull out troops.  Then, when the American people lower their guard and ease up on security, they will stage another attack.  This will provide them with the opportunity to say that their &quot;security&quot; is necessary to protect us. I understand that there are democrats involved in the NWO, but you guys should know that the whole rep/dem thing and democracy in this country is a puppet government designed to make us think we are in control.  People who think they are in control are the easiest to control.</p>

<p>The people will be scared and think that the attack happened because we grew lax with security.  After that, it will take a few generations for people to question the whole police state, because they will think they have &quot;proof&quot; relaxed security will lead to terror.  They will be the government&#39;s bitches.</p>

<p>Someone made a comment about what we should do, either be branded terrorists or be branded with a barcode.</p>

<p>What we should be doing is attacking what we think will happen.  We need to put them on the defense.  Even if we lose, there will be those in the future who will see that we fought them and we were right all along.  And to top it off, we could put them in an awkward situation if they are trying to defend their future plans they wish to keep secret.  They will more than likely fall back to a &quot;that&#39;s absurd&quot; argument, but I&#39;m sure with the power of the internet and things like wikileaks we could find enough evidence to prove that they are lying about their ignorance about the future.</p>

<p>Get people to ask questions.  Tell them you think there&#39;s going to be another terrorist attack.  Tell them the reasons why.  Then, when another one does happen, they will refer back to you and realize you were right.  This would put the NWO in a stalemate because their next move &quot;terrorist attack&quot; would only prove that they are fucking with us.</p>
