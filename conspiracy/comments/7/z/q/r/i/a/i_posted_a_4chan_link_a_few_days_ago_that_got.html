<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/XFHUH">https://imgur.com/a/XFHUH</a></p>

<p>TL:DR: A &quot;supposed&quot; YouTube Dev makes a Post on 4Chan that YouTube and others are planning to purge alternative channels, right wing speakers/vids, anything on the right that gets too big, anything questioning the MSM narratives. </p>

<p>I posted this 3 days ago and it go deleted, and now since yesterday, Alex Jones just got a another strike on YT for showing Hogg being fed lines being considered as threatening the kids from the shooting.</p>

<p>Vegas Shooting Investigation channels on YouTube are being purged since last night</p>

<p>The Richie Allen Show YouTube Channel Has Now Been Deleted after an interview with Jim Fetzer about the anomalies with the media reporting of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida:</p>

<p>Twitter banning several large conservatives:</p>

<p>The purge is starting, scary times. Reddit owners will eventually come for us here too</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The U.S. Democratic party is far from left wing (hasn&#39;t even been centrist for decades). To say &quot;the left&quot; (as many people carelessly do) would imply the entire left half of the spectrum which is huge.</p>

<p>There are real left wingers and centrists and there are the faux &quot;leftists&quot; who are actually far right NEOliberals economically and just use LGBT stuff, etc. to market themselves as left wing when they&#39;re not, they kiss wallstreet ass, they&#39;re warmongers, super deregulation of banks and markets, crony capitalist profiteering, etc. stuff that left wingers and centrists would be horrified at.</p>

<p>In the two party system, there&#39;s no such thing as &quot;moderate&quot;, the MSM claims being in between
Democrat and Republican is moderate but being in between these two extremes is still extreme:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/1peIWYG.png">https://i.imgur.com/1peIWYG.png</a></p>

<p>The DNC rigged the primaries against Bernie, who was only slightly left of center (social democracy not even center left libertarian democratic socialism) so just European style mixed economics/FDR&#39;s New Deal (a fair level of market/bank regulation + welfare state social programs without major corporate privatization interference I think).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They sure act like it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to become convinced that Twitter and YouTube offer <em>just enough</em> anti-establishment content to make it seem like they aren&#39;t horribly compromised.  </p>

<p>I signed up for Twitter at it&#39;s beginning, used it for a while then ignored it for, literally, years until late last year when I started using it to follow some people who really should have blogs instead.  :D</p>

<p>Regarding the #twitterlockout the night of the 21st, what they did was lock people out who followed a number of popular &quot;right wing&quot; accounts like the Hagmanns, Dan Bongino, Kurt Schlichter, Jack Posobiec, and demanded those people give a phone number to get back on and prove they weren&#39;t bots.  Because they <em>weren&#39;t</em> actually bots, most have gotten their followers back and a few report gaining new followers.</p>

<p>Did they do the same on the &quot;left&quot;?  I don&#39;t know - I can&#39;t stand that part of Twitter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Should happen organically, as advertisers seek platforms that aren&#39;t restricted by leftist censorship. There&#39;s a huge conservative target audience that&#39;s not only going begging, but is actually getting angry at the obvious interference of Google. We&#39;ll see I guess. As with any of these type of platform, content is king. People sometimes forget that platforms like Youtube or even Reddit are just empty pages without user added content. The users aren&#39;t pissed off enough to leave en-mass.... yet. They&#39;re slowly following their favorite channels off Youtube though. This will become a flood. Watch what happens with CRTV. I reckon that one will take off. </p>

<p>Did you read the article? It&#39;s about real life people losing thousands of followers because of the bot purge. Only two people came forward and said they got caught up in the purge too.</p>

<p>Edit: Read the article people, he&#39;s lying to you. </p>

<p>And still, out of the thousands of accounts that were purged, only 2 people come forward and said their accounts were caught up as well.</p>

<p>Do you have any other sources for the &quot;lots&quot; you said it was? Or are you extrapolating from only those 2?</p>
