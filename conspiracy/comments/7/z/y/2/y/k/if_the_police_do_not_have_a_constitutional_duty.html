    <div class="md"><p>This is destruction of the conversation.  Few are advocating for the abolition of the second amendment.  Most are simply asking for sensible rules backed up by unbias studies.  Since the CDC can&#39;t study it, then it shouldn&#39;t be too much to ask to restrict high power automatics.</p>

<p>Personally I believe that the removal of all guns would not stop me from protecting my family.  Those that need guns are just I&#39;ll perpaired.... but that&#39;s just my opinion.  I don&#39;t expect others to hold it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to address that last point. How do you think you will defend your family without a gun? I mean I guess I could see boobytraps and pipe bombs as a valid way of defending them but if you are talking about martial arts then all you are doing is proving that you will fail in defending your family.</p>

<p>I’ve done martial arts for over 14 years and I absolutely would not trust it to defend my family against someone with a gun. If anybody thinks that martial arts, knife throwing, or any other primitive defense method is going to keep them safe they are sadly mistaken.</p>

There will never come a time in which our citizens will rise up as one and try to take on the government.  The propoganda engine is too strong.  I bet my life on that.  As for local threats, most are not intent on hurting you.  Most of the others will flee if resistance of any type is given.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But a group of 3 young adults with guns breaks into your house and you think that a crossbow and dog are going to be enough? I mean yeah, it’s possible. It’s also possible that one sneezes and has a nd that kills the other two. Do you really want to place your family’s lives on the hands of a dog and a crossbow?</p>

<p>I’m not a crazy guy with a huge arsenal, and I love my dog to death (half German Shepherd, half herding breeds) but when it comes down to it I’m grabbing my handgun and hiding my family in the back of the house. I want the best chance that none of them will be hurt, a crossbow bolt may not kill immediately, the dog can only attack one intruder at a time and so that third guy can still shoot while you reload, or they could panic shoot and kill the dog before you even fire once, now it’s you vs 3 guys with a crossbow.</p>

<p>Be realistic please. Crossbows may not kill immediately, and woken up from a dead sleep, in low light with adrenaline going you may not pull the strong all of the way back, you might load it wrong, he’ll you might even miss. A decent handgun gives 12+ shots. That and a dog would be better in every situation.</p>

<p>When you have a family you have to do what is best for them, and in this case the gun is best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say that experience trumps all theoretical conversation, has anyone in your family ever been hurt by a gun at home? If not then you are cherry picking how that ideal applies to the situation. </p>

<p>I mean it’s your family, so it’s your choice. I’m not advocating an ar-15 with a 39 round magazine, I’m advocating a handgun like a glock 19, kept in a safe unloaded.</p>

<p>The reality of gun deaths in the USA is that most of the 30000 deaths a year (around 25000 of them) come from suicides. I can understand why someone wouldn’t want a gun for fear that a family member would harm themselves, that is something you have to figure out for yourself. Outside of that more deaths are from “justified” police shootings and self defense shootings. </p>

<p>We talk about experience. My dad was a contractor, a guy tried to steal from his van and pulled a knife, my dad pulled his gun and the guy ran. If he didn’t have that gun we have no idea what would have happened. The guy could have just taken his tools, or the guy could have stabbed him just because he felt like it.</p>

<p>I was 21 hiking with a buddy when two feral dogs came running at us. I waited until The last second because sometimes dogs just wanna play, but a rough looking dog, no collar, nobody else in sight, teeth bared and growling coming at you is a scary sight. I drew my gun and fired. I killed one and hit the other before it ran off. I called the parks service and as it turns out they were in the process of posting a flier at the front of the park detailing a case of two dogs attacking a family.</p>

<p>Last one: went hunting with a buddy of mine, we were in our tree stands for about 35 minutes when a deer walked right out. It had been facing away but just as the sun peeked up over the tree line the does went broadside and we saw not one, but two arrows in the deer. One was low and left of the kill zone, I have no idea how it didn’t puncture the intestines. The other was high and in the shoulders. I know shot placement is critical but two arrows didn’t down the deer, and my fear (yes I’m using fear, but only to explain why I don’t like crossbows for self defense) is that if I were to rely on a crossbow and my dog that I would fail to keep my family safe. A follow up shot takes seconds, and the first shot doesn’t guarantee success.</p>

<p>The whole idea of self defense comes from fear. I know some people talk about overthrowing the government or taking on an organized group of looters, but my fear is more realistic. I plan for 1-3 guys coming into my home with guns to rob me. They probably aren’t organized and probably haven’t practiced shooting much, but one stray bullet could mean my wife is a widow or that I am burying a child. I hope it never happens and that I just wasted money on a handgun and ammo to make sure I am a good shot. </p>

<p>In all events I wish you the best of luck man. I hope all goes well for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You pretty much spelled it out.  The situations in which a gun is the practical solution is so small (in my perspective) that it causes more suffering then protection.  If the US decided that guns were no longer needed, then my guess is the following things would happen:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There would be a period of time when criminals and gun advocates would passionately object.</p></li>
<li><p>After time had gone by the criminals (that use guns) would be severely punished while &quot;collectors&quot; would be left alone (not a high enough return on investment to go after them).</p></li>
<li><p>Guns would stop being used or carried... gun violence would go down... people would start defending themselves with knives and pepper spray and that would be enough.</p></li>
<li><p>If an uprising was ever needed there would be enough &quot;collectors&quot; would have enough protection to perform gorilla warfare (which even today would be the only way it would work).</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I may be wrong, but your argument seems to be that you don&#39;t trust a &quot;well trained&quot; civilian with a gun, which you backed up with statistics showing how inaccurate NYPD cops are with guns, as if that&#39;s representative of gun owners.  </p>

<p>I would say that the majority of legal American gun owners are better trained with firearms than the average NYPD cop.  Also, the average gun owner doesn&#39;t have a very highly weighted trigger which drastically reduces accuracy, so your reference to NYPD cops being bad shots is not an indictment on civilian gun owners.  If anything, it proves the point that we can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t be forced to rely on poorly trained police officers to protect us.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>While I fully support an uninfringed 2nd amendment, what made you think that the police <em>should</em> have a Constitutional obligation to protect anybody?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The issue is pretty simple to lay out.</p>

<p>First, the police should not be obligated to be everywhere at once. That&#39;s unreasonable. As much as we are/coming close to being a police state, its simply beyond physical numbers for a police officer to be responsible and respond to every concern a person might have.</p>

<p>That said, consider this scenario:</p>

<p>You&#39;re out at night, walking along somewhere and you are attacked. A police officer happens to drive by and witnesses you being assaulted and you screaming for help. Now, without some measure of constitutional obligation, that police officer need do <em>nothing</em> until its all over and you might be dead.</p>

<p>The police should be constitutionally bound by amendment and law to intercede on the behalf of those in need; if only for the public good at the very least. Without that, a police officer could easily see a racially motivated attack happening and ignore it, his own racial bias toward the victim playing a role in his choice to not help.</p>

<p>Secondly, you&#39;ve not stated your own opinion directly on whether or not they should be obligated by amendment and law to intercede. What&#39;s your position and reasoning?</p>

<p>The US is the one of the only first world country that does not have protection for individual citizens. THIS NOT OKAY!! <strong>You can keep the 2nd admendment</strong> but for fuck sakes you need to fix the whole police thing. </p>

<p><strong>According to your logic: It is the  4, 5, 8  year old kids fault for getting rape or beaten  for not being able to defend themselves. The police can LEGALLY allow those children to be rape and then arrest them after. They do not LEGALLY have to protect that child. There is something seriously fucked up about that.</strong></p>

<p>What about all those who cant defend themselves? Fuck them, right? They arent worth defending if they cant defend themselves! /s

    <div class="md"><p><strong>I would like to indicate that this is not a &quot;Fuck the Police Rant or discussion&quot;. I am by no means saying that all cops in US are bad or cowards. I would like to discuss how this ruling has impacted the US police culture, how US society sees police as a whole, why it has not been put in to the constitution. I would also like to discuss how this ruling contects to the current problems of US society. And what can Americans do to change this ruling.</strong></p>

<p>I would like state that I am from Canada and in Canada &amp; almost every other 1st world country the police are obligated by law to protect and help their citizens, to uphold the law, and society as a whole, even if it means sacrificing your own life. When I first heard about this I was fucking angry, and frustrated that US government does not care about its own citizens enough to protect them. I am still speechless at the stupidity of this ruling, how much pain a suffering could be avoided, how many lives could be saved etc. </p>

<p><strong>TDLR; The US government has decided that those who cannot protect themselves, do not deserve protection. They decided that the police do not have to constitutionally protect and help the individual citizens of the United States. They are obiligated to uphold the law, and society as a whole.  The US has no constitutional laws that make it mandatory, regardless of personal bias to protect you. For those who think that the police of the right to choose who to protect etc... hopefully when it becomes apart of the constitution they can include the ability for current Cops who are not willing to fucking protect their citizens,regardless of personal beliefs and opions to resign with a severence package.</strong></p>

<p><strong>My thoughts and Questions</strong></p>

<p>🔷️Is current state of the US, due to one protecting its citizens?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>🔷️** There seems to be primitive, and unrealistic cultural notion in the US, that citizens should defend themselves. That is why they shouldn&#39;t police. This ignorant belief seems to be unqiue to the US. Everyone should have the right to be protected and to protect themselves.  Those who can protect themselves should continue to do so, but that shouldn&#39;t mean that those who are defenseless should not be protected. Children, and those who are  severely disable, the elderly, and many others cannot protect themselves, so do we just allow crimes to happen to them, to be abused, and taken advantage of?**</p>

A second police officer knocked on the door, and then left when he recieved no reply. The 2 woman crawled back inside, and called again at 6:42 am.

<p><strong>Believing the police might be in the house, Warren and Taliaferro called down to Douglas, thereby alerting Kent to their presence.

<p>They sued and lost. The Distric Court of Columbia Appeals that the police do not owe a specific duty to provide police services to citizens based on the public duty doctrine. 
(I am open to better tdlr; if you got one.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warren, Taliaferro, and Douglas</strong></p>

<p>In the early morning hours of Sunday, March 16, 1975, Carolyn Warren and Joan Taliaferro, who shared a room on the third floor of their rooming house at 1112 Lamont Street Northwest in the District of Columbia, and Miriam Douglas, who shared a room on the second floor with her four-year-old daughter, were asleep. The women were awakened by the sound of the back door being broken down by two men later identified as Marvin Kent and James Morse. The men entered Douglas&#39; second floor room, where Kent forced Douglas to perform oral sex on him and Morse raped her.</p>

<p>Warren and Taliaferro heard Douglas&#39; screams from the floor below. Warren called 9-1-1 and told the dispatcher that the house was being burglarized, and requested immediate assistance. The department employee told her to remain quiet and assured her that police assistance would be dispatched promptly.</p>

<p>Warren&#39;s call was received at Metropolitan Police Department Headquarters at 0623 hours, and was recorded as a burglary-in-progress. At 0626, a call was dispatched to officers on the street as a &quot;Code 2&quot; assignment, although calls of a crime in progress should be given priority and designated as &quot;Code 1.&quot; Four police cruisers responded to the broadcast; three to the Lamont Street address and one to another address to investigate a possible suspect.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Warren and Taliaferro crawled from their window onto an adjoining roof and waited for the police to arrive. While there, they observed one policeman drive through the alley behind their house and proceed to the front of the residence without stopping, leaning out the window, or getting out of the car to check the back entrance of the house. A second officer apparently knocked on the door in front of the residence, but left when he received no answer. The three officers departed the scene at 0633, five minutes after they arrived.</p>

<p>Warren and Taliaferro crawled back inside their room. They again heard Douglas&#39; continuing screams; again called the police; told the officer that the intruders had entered the home, and requested immediate assistance. Once again, a police officer assured them that help was on the way. This second call was received at 0642 and recorded merely as &quot;investigate the trouble;&quot; it was never dispatched to any police officers.</p>

<p>Believing the police might be in the house, Warren and Taliaferro called down to Douglas, thereby alerting Kent to their presence. At knife point, Kent and Morse then forced all three women to accompany them to Kent&#39;s apartment. For the next fourteen hours the captive women were raped, robbed, beaten, forced to commit sexual acts upon one another, and made to submit to the sexual demands of Kent and Morse.</p>

<p>Warren, Taliaferro, and Douglas brought the following claims of negligence against the District of Columbia and the Metropolitan Police Department: (1) the dispatcher&#39;s failure to forward the 6:23 a. m. call with the proper degree of urgency; (2) the responding officers&#39; failure to follow standard police investigative procedures, specifically their failure to check the rear entrance and position themselves properly near the doors and windows to ascertain whether there was any activity inside; and (3) the dispatcher&#39;s failure to dispatch the 6:42 a. m. call.</p>

<p><strong>Nichol</strong></p>

<p>On April 30, 1978, at approximately 11:30 p. m., appellant Nichol stopped his car for a red light at the intersection of Missouri Avenue and Sixteenth Street, N.W. Unknown occupants in a vehicle directly behind appellant struck his car in the rear several times, and then proceeded to beat appellant about the face and head, breaking his jaw.</p>

<p>A Metropolitan Police Department officer arrived at the scene. In response to the officer&#39;s direction, appellant&#39;s companion ceased any further efforts to obtain identification information of the assailants. When the officer then failed to get the information, leaving Nichol unable to institute legal action against his assailants, Nichol brought a negligence action against the officer, the Metropolitan Police Department and the District of Columbia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>THE VERDICT</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a 4-3 decision, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed the trial courts&#39; dismissal of the complaints against the District of Columbia and individual members of the Metropolitan Police Department based on the public duty doctrine ruling that *<em>&quot;[t]he duty to provide public services is owed to the public at large, and, absent a special relationship between the police and an individual, no specific legal duty exists&quot;. *</em> The Court thus adopted the trial court&#39;s determination that no special relationship existed between the police and appellants, and therefore no specific legal duty existed between the police and the appellants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about statistics because we all know crime has gone down, gun-related deaths in this country have gone down and are at an all-time low. But, the mass shootings are being done with AR-15&#39;s and there is an illegal means of converting them into automatic weapons that is fairly easy to do. But these guns are a great way to make money in places like Mexico and so forth, so the creation of them is something the American government doesn&#39;t want to ban.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they talk about AR-15&#39;s in that video. And they say nothing of substance, any argument against AR-15&#39;s could be made against almost every other semi-auto rifle. I also immediately discount the opinion of anyone who says &quot;I support the 2nd Amendment&quot; and then go on to say it&#39;s for hunting and sports shooting. The purpose of the 2nd Amendment is as a final bulwark against government tyranny. And that&#39;s why gun grabbing politicians fear it and want to limit it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but most people that own guns do so for self defense, and the AR-15 style of rifle is the most affordable, reliable, and accessible weapon that exists for home defense. I don&#39;t think people would trade them in because there is no weapon that replaces their effectiveness and versatility. What style of hunting rifle do you propose to keep legal then? Weapons of higher caliber? AR-15s are extremely low caliber.</p>

<p>Who needs a semi-automatic for home defense? lol</p>

<p>Those guns are supposed to mainly be used for hunting.</p>

<p>The gat cranks and bump stocks that make these kinds of rifles automatic are most common for the Ar-15s. That&#39;s why this gun is used in mass murders. It&#39;s cheap, easy to turn into an auto weapon, and the parts to do so are also cheap.</p>

<p>If you want hunting rifles, legit there are at least 10 different kinds you can buy. That&#39;s not an excuse to keep the Ar-15.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re proposing a single shot weapon for home defense?? And how often are modified AR-15s used in mass killing with modifications? Vegas? And those modifications don&#39;t make a weapon fully automatic, they just allow for a high rate of semi automatic fire. And ok I&#39;ll concede, let&#39;s ban the modification tools and allow people to own semi automatic rifles. Problem solved? What about semi automatic handguns? Or semi automatic shotguns?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, there are tons of options as you just pointed out. Banning the Ar-15&#39;s is just banning that gun, not other semi automatic weapons.There are people here trying to keep the Ar-15 in the market because of one reason and one reason only. </p>

<p>Ar-15&#39;s with Ak-47&#39;s allow Mexican drug cartels to over power Mexican police. The drug war you know fuels the American government, and so that&#39;s why these guns aren&#39;t outlawed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Typically, the purchaser turns the guns over to a broker who takes them across the border to Mexico, where such weapons cannot be bought legally. The weapons are sold to the cartels, often for three or four times the original price. Top ATF officials have said in congressional testimony that 90 percent of the guns submitted for tracing by Mexican authorities are from the United States. Gun-rights advocates doubt the accuracy of that claim.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why all those people crying and screaming on TV about gun control will never get what they want. Without the AR-15, the Mexican drug cartel can&#39;t be as powerful as it is now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait so what are you suggesting? Are you suggesting only banning the brand ArmaLite which manufactured the original AR-15? Or banning all AR style rifles which are functionally identical? Or any semi automatic rifles? Because functionally there is no difference between a Colt M4 or a Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P Sport, but both are semi automatic rifles chambered in .223/5.56.

    <div class="md"><p>Well that seems like a terribly ineffectual method to cut back on gun violence. And you&#39;ve offered no definition of what is the model you want to ban, besides for the name. So manufacturing an AR-like weapon with minor variations and a different name is not a difficult task, and seems like a logical step for a weapons manufacturer were your proposed ban to be implemented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The models produced by those two manufacturers are the most common with parts available for modification. It would take quite a while and it will be costlier for people to modify other semi-automatic rifles like the ak-47.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a reason they don&#39;t switch to their pistol when they&#39;re clearing buildings in any combat situation. It&#39;s cuz handguns aren&#39;t accurate or controllable at all. </p>

<p>Combine that with a 145 bpm heart rate and you aren&#39;t gonna hit a guy if he was the size of refrigerator. </p>

<p>The AR-15 is the best home defense tool. Not long enough to get caught on anything like a shottie would. Recoil is minimal compared to a handgun or a shotgun. Plus 30 rounds. </p>

<p>I&#39;m all for gun control, especially in this day and age. But you should do some research on this kinda stuff. Imo the big killer is handguns. Hi-points run for $100-$120. 9mm or 45. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what is causing killings in America, in terms of homicide. Cheap handguns. The need to be regulated more. </p>

<p>AR-15s are crucified because they are big black and scary. If you ban them you have to band any sporting semi automatic. Because Ranch rifles and M14 knock offs can circumvent assault weapons bans and do the same amount of damage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone who is opposed to these weapons dodges this question. If you believe &quot;no one&quot; should have these guns then you must support some kind of mandatory relinquishment. </p>

<p>Probably people would get killed, law enforcement and civilians, but in the long run it may be mean fewer dead by guns. Frankly I think there would be minimal violent resistance for the most part. There would be shocking outbursts of violence but these would alienate moderates and eventually the resistance would diminish.</p>

<p>I am not saying this is a great idea I am just saying that IF you support gun control you have to confront these issues. You would actually need to take people&#39;s guns away. Otherwise even if you stop the sale of them, the existing guns will just be recirculate and the gun violence will not go down to levels seen in other countries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The U.S. hasn&#39;t been able to defeat the Taliban in 17 years. If a civil war breaks out in America it&#39;s not going to be little militias trying to stand toe to toe with the military. It&#39;s going to be various groups conducting fourth generation warfare - which will include using their AR-15&#39;s to secure more powerful weaponry. Not to mention based on the circumstances there will probably be a significant portion of the military who defect or refuse to kill their own people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That will not happen. The Taliban has faced hardships and desolate lives that led to desperation. American citizens have lives cush lives for generations.
Most would fold like a napkin and die quickly. And any little groups looking to wage &quot;fourth generation warfare&quot; will be unfortunately surprised that they are severely outmatched.</p>

<p>Theres a bug difference in fighting an organized rebellion in a different country where you are bound by red tape and politics.
On our own soil, the US government would do whatever it wants and those holding the guns against them would die first.
There is no comprising to the reach of our government on foreign soil and our own soil</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live near Philadelphia and it&#39;s not rare for four or five motherfuckers to invade a house.   And that&#39;s when all the lights are on, the supermarkets are full, and the cops still answer the phone... I don&#39;t even want to think what it would be like if there was a blackout for a week and/or the food distribution network  gets disrupted. </p>

<p>Even if you hit your target, one bullet is not usually enough to stop a man.  Usually it takes several.  Multiply 4 motherfuckers times several bullets each to stop them, and that&#39;s why for some people a high capacity rifle is a good choice.   Better too much firepower than too little.</p>

<p>Me, I&#39;m happy with a snub nosed revolver to carry when I&#39;m out, and a 12 gauge shotgun for home defense.  But then again, I live in a relatively civilized area... I do not presume to tell other people what they need to protect themselves and those they care about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well without seeing the numbers of the study you are quoting me I can&#39;t say how rare it is.  </p>

<p>I did see an article touting the AR-15 as one of the best 5 for home defense, but it looks like a pretty pro gun website.  To be expected for that kind of article i guess.</p>

<p>One thing I wonder on the gun use statistic being VERY rare, does pointing a gun and holding him at gunpoint until the cops come count as a gun use.</p>

<p>And how many in the study are on homes that didn&#39;t have a gun, so no chance to use it.</p>

<p>I would imagine if your home were being invaded you would 100% try and get your shotgun if possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh i love this argument. The reason those of us who support gun bans are ok with cars is for the following reasons:</p>

<p>-you have to be a certain age to drive a car</p>

<p>-you have to take safety training before driving a car</p>

<p>-you have to register a car to your name and renew that registration on a regular basis</p>

<p>-you have to renew your licence on a regular basis to make sure you are still qualified to drive</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How? Please explain.</p>

<p>Do you think it is lack of safety training, licensing and registration that allows for school shootings? And you can be 16 and operate a vehicle. I may be wrong but I believe most shooters have been 16 or older.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>-Registration immediately allows tracking of the weapon along with regular re-registration</p>

<p>-license would obviously be higher than 16 and would have prevented this most recent shooting</p>

<p>-there is also a law that states you cant buy over a certain amount of cars without having a dealers licence. The same should apply for guns and ammo</p>

<p>-regular renewal of licence should require mental health exams and medication history</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The easy answer for that is a shotgun has limited ammunition and doesnt commonly allow for clips. Right off the bat it limits the number of casualties.</p>

<p>Secondly, shotguns become less lethal as distance increases, so someone running has a better chance at surviving a shotgun blast than with other high powered weapons.</p>

<p>I see this as a fair compromise that should leave both sides &quot;wanting&quot;, which is usually a fair place to land</p>

And i think anyone that stock piles weapons in the off chance they may have to kill some american soldiers one day is sick.
On the other hand I am aware that small liberties can be eroded on the state level, but I believe in democracy and that certain small liberties could be voted down for the safety and greater good of the masses.</p>

<p>2) as former active duty military, if the troops and government did decide the take over, i can assure you that your ownership of these kinds of weapons would only quicken your own death.
There is no civilian weapon singely or as a group that is more powerful that the united states military</p>

<p>Lots of troubled people are buying guns, but they&#39;ve always bought guns and the country was fine. Yet you advocate for overturning this fundamental right and giving guns only to the low self-esteem manchildren that occupy law enforcment. The same people that were too cowardly to defend real children from a real manchild with guns in Florida.</p>

<p>As soon as you solve the problem of detecting bad apples in the government maybe you can apply that technology to weeding out unfit private gun owners too 👌</p>

<p>Like me? lmfao What danger am I to you? Are you admitting you own guns so you can use them on people that hurt your feelings?</p>

<p>Thinking of them as merely toys is looking past the main reason people own firearms, which is for safety and self defense. I sleep much much better at night knowing I can defend myself, my gf, and our home, from anyone trying to harm us. Seems like people that don&#39;t own firearms don&#39;t understand this feeling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It also levels the playing field.  Many times the biggest advantage is for women with conceal carry.  Not being sexist but generally women are in no shape to truly defend themselves from a male attacker.  Mace and tasers many times will only piss off the attacker.  A gun many times will deter and won&#39;t even have to be used but if it does it has a chance of actually thwarting the attack.</p>
