       David Hogg, who has been featured front and center for the unconstitutional gun control teenage advocacy movement rhetoricized by select victims of the Florida school shooting and heavily promoted by the mainstream media, has a father, Kevin Hogg, who is a former FBI agent of 14 years and now works for a global defense contracting company called Cubic.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As you can see from the link, Cubic specializes in a number of disciplines, the most interesting being "unconventional warfare" and "special operations" training.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those that don't know what unconventional warfare is, Wikipedia, a publication heavily edited by the United States Military, defines it's general objective this way:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The general objective of unconventional warfare is to instill a belief that peace and security are not possible without compromise or concession."
      </p>
      <p>
       (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconventional_warfare">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconventional_warfare
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       The article goes on to explain:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Unconventional warfare targets civilian populations psychologically to win hearts and minds ... seeking to render the military proficiency of the enemy irrelevant ... Special Forces ... are used unconventionally to train, equip, and advise locals who oppose their government. They can also spread subversion and propaganda, while they aid native resistance fighters, to ultimately cause a hostile government to capitulate ... The Department of Defense defines unconventional warfare as activities conducted to enable a resistance movement or insurgency to coerce, disrupt, or overthrow a government or occupying power by operating through or with an underground, auxiliary, and guerrilla force ... "

       SS: I am not here to promote the idea that David Hogg is a crisis actor. I do not believe the Florida shooting to be a hoax. I am here to point out extremely suspicious information surrounding his father, which can reasonably be correlated to his behavior, and others, since the shooting took place. Please don't believe me at face value. In fact, you shouldn't believe anything I have shared until you do your own investigation and come to your OWN conclusions. The fact is, I hope this is nothing. Because if it is not, we should be extremely frightened.

       I don't care if Hogg is a paid Crisis Actor or unpaid Attention Whore. I want to hear from the other 1,000 plus kids at that schoool, but for some reason CNN and other are stuck on this one attention whoring kid as if he represents everyone at that school

       To be fair though, LinkedIn is user edited. It's hardly as if they couldn't have created it to lead away from the Hogg in question. It 'proves' nothing either way.

       Not to mention that Nikolas Cruz was institutionalized for a period of time and then put under the guardianship of a doctor who specialized in neuron control systems for a US intelligence agency. If that doesn't scream MKUltra, I don't know what does.

       "The Manchurian Candidate ... is a political thriller about the son of a prominent U.S. political family who is brainwashed into being an unwitting assassin for a Communist conspiracy ... [In the novel] it is revealed that the Communists have been using Shaw [the main character] as a sleeper agent, a guiltless assassin subconsciously activated by a trigger, in Shaw's case seeing the "Queen of Diamonds" playing card while playing solitaire. Provoked by the appearance of the card, he obeys orders which he then forgets. Shawâ€™s KGB handler is his domineering mother, Eleanor, a ruthless power broker working with the Communists to execute a "palace coup dâ€™Ã©tat" to quietly overthrow the U.S. government ... "
