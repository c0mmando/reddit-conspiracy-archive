        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a thread I made few months back on -- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ng5nk/in_eyes_wide_shut_kubrick_has_hinted_about_secret/">In Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick has hinted about secret sex slave societies and neo-paganism culture that breeds among the elite. Kubrick&#39;s Eyes Wide Shut maybe of more relevance today because of astonishing rape-allegations that came out in 2017 from concerning Hollywood top brass.</a>  </p>

<p>++++++ </p>

<p>A recent thread : <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7zsmvx/stanley_told_me_the_world_is_run_by_pedophiles/">“Stanley told me the world is run by pedophiles,” Nicole Kidman said. “He studied secret societies his whole life, he was fascinated by them, and he said the elite, the top secret societies, they are full of men with a certain predilection. They are tied together, sort of bonded, by pedophilia.</a>  </p>

<hr/>

<p>“Stanley told me the world is run by pedophiles,” Nicole Kidman said while promoting HBO’s Big Little Lies, in Los Angeles. “He studied secret societies his whole life, he was fascinated by them, and he said the elite, the top secret societies, they are full of men with a certain predilection. They are tied together, sort of bonded, by pedophilia.</p>

<p>“They all know each other’s dark secrets. There is no way out for any of them. It’s a lifetime bond. Even if one of them wanted to go straight, repent, so to speak, he can’t. His peers will bring him down. They are in it until death, driving the world to ruin. That’s kind of how Stanley explained it but it was all very complex. I’m probably not doing it justice.”</p>

<p>The 1999 film, starring Kidman and her then husband Tom Cruise, was Stanley Kubrick’s last outing as director before his death the same year. Many people believe Kubrick gave away too many secrets in the film about secret societies and the global elite, and it may have cost him his life.</p>

<p>Asked if Kubrick’s knowledge of secret societies and their darkest secrets had anything to do with his death, Kidman raised an eyebrow and said “That’s not a question I can answer here.”</p>

<p>“Though maybe I could. None of you in the media would be allowed to print it, would you? The men who own your companies wouldn’t allow it to get out,” Kidman said.   </p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;On March 7, 1999, six days after screening a final cut of Eyes Wide Shut for his family and the stars, Kubrick died in his sleep at the age of 70, after suffering a massive heart attack&quot;</p>

<p>which happens to be 666 days before the start of 2001, coincidentally Kubrick&#39;s most famous movie. And have a look for any significant events occurring 666 days before Kubrick&#39;s death ? </p>

<p>Yes - <a href="http://debezoeker.tumblr.com/post/124994464036/deep-blue-dreams-666-days-of-stanley-kubrick">http://debezoeker.tumblr.com/post/124994464036/deep-blue-dreams-666-days-of-stanley-kubrick</a></p>

<p>&quot;During the 1970s he considered hiring Woody Allen to play out one of the main characters in the story. Then, in the 1980s, he even thought of adapting the story into a sex comedy “with a wild and somber streak running through it,” and have Steve Martin as the main role. The project was brought to life finally during the 1990s.</p>
