       Odd that the number one talking point from the DOJ in response to criticism for their crackdown on legal weed, and their contracting with private prisons in hopes of locking up more people, is that if you don't like the laws regarding marijuana change them.  It would seem as though this committee, headed by Pete Sessions, has decided that there will be no change.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would almost be funny if not for Sessions comments about addiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Marijuana is an addictive product, and the merchants of addiction make it that way. They make it for addiction. They make it to where our people, our young people, become addicted to marijuana and keep going
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       What the fuck is he talking about?  The merchants of addiction aren't start up cannabis grow and sell operations, the merchants of addiction are Purdue and Insys.  Both of these death merchants marketed and sold the drugs that caused the opiate epidemic, and both are working on drugs to combat addiction while at the same time focusing their efforts on banning kratom.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know of no legal grow or licensed sales operation in a legal state that also has invested in cure for marijuana addiction (maybe this is obvious because it isn't addictive but stick with me) and they certainly aren't funding lobbyists to block the sale of a plant that helps cure marijuana addiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The blatant disregard of the facts in favor of raising cash from unethical lobbyists is going completely ignored.  Nothing will get better until campaign spending, not campaign donation, reforms are in place.  PAC's have the same rights as citizens?  Fine, PAC all you want, the total amount of money you can spend on a house race is $100,000, the total amount on a senate race is $250,000, same with governor or any other state wide office, and the total amount you can spend on a presidential race is $12.5 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we can't change the system we can change the way it fucks us over.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Changed a misspelling. Had Purdue Pharmaceuticals, a company focused on marketing drugs they knew to be highly addictive to doctors for prescription to patients with injures that absolutely do not require this level of pain management for profit, spelled as Perdue, a chicken mill that force feeds growth hormones and antibiotics to raise mutant chickens that are freakishly large and also help increase antibiotic resistance.  I wouldn't want to ruin the reputation of a stellar company due to a spelling error.

       Despite continued efforts from a large group of bipartisan representatives, Sessions’s panel has consistently blocked all cannabis proposals from advancing over the course of nearly two years.
