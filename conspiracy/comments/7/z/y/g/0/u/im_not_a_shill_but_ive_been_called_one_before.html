       If we’re going to spam “wow the shills in force” all day then it’s only fair that those of us who have been wrongfully being called shills are allowed to present our side of the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not a shill but you keep calling me one because I think many of the “conspiracies” here are bullshit. I used to like reading about real conspiracies here, but now things have gotten to the point where the conspiracies presented are so outrageous and with such an obvious ulterior motive that I find myself constantly being labeled a shill simply for going against the herd.
      </p>

       I’m not a shill. I downvoted you because your comment was disingenuous and absurd and your bias was obvious.

       JFK for sure. Lots of shit the CIA and FBI have done that has been proven via their own documentation. I believe Edward VIII was part of a conspiracy with Hitler and the Germans to become King of Britain again and usher in a pro-Nazi regime there. I always thought what Snowden proved was real existed. I believe stuff that has what I consider to be legit evidence of it being a real conspiracy.

       It seems to me that if you are referred to as “shill” often, but are in-fact NOT one, then perhaps you are simply a “Statist”?

       I disagree.  There are conspiracy theories that have nothing to do with government so it be hard to say someone is a statist because they have an opinion on those.  Also, statist would mean they support the government.  Just because they don't believe certain conspiracy theories does not mean they support the government.   There are probably many antigovernment people who do not believe any conspiracy theories but still disagree with government.

       Really? I think it rather depends on the mod's side in the argument. I believe in some conspiracies but not in others. When I debunk something I have to be ultra careful to not to make the slightest personal comment or I get an instant warning. I kept this though.... the sort of allowed comment (didn't even get removed) that I get as a debunker of so-called chemtrails:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "You're a disgrace to humanity. You really disgust me. It's psychos like you that cause so much pain and suffering in this world. You should really look deep inside your own heart and ask if your behavior is the kind of behavior your parents or children or loved ones would be proud of. Whether you're just really ignorant or being paid by someone to spread lies is irrelevant. You're the worst kind of person there is".

       I’ve been called a shill plenty, but this post wasn’t referring to someone in particular and I’m not sure why it would seem like it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I made this post after reading... sec let me find it I’m on mobile atm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit ok I can’t find the specific comments I was referring to, but here’s a suitable example:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7zwnp4/the_shills_are_here_in_droves/?st=JE1V4H01&amp;amp;sh=fe109457">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So I figured hey I get called shill often. Maybe if I make a post and explain that I’m not a shill and I just disagree then others who fee as I do will also speak up and it will become clear that what many are calling a shill problem is simply a leak in the echo chamber.

       I do worry though, not about being called a shill myself but about the way these constant accusations shape the narrative and serve to shut down any attempt at real discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       People disagreeing with the narrative looks bad, since they tend to point out the holes in the narrative. It’s quite difficult to actually address these concerns since many of them are valid, but a blanket shill accusation is effective in causing a certain percentage of readers to outright dismiss this criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       People want us to stop thinking about situations and to simply agree with the leaders of whichever side we’re on. Both political parties are doing it and have been for a long time now, and at this point the problem isn’t even limited to politics.

       That’s very fair, and I understand that, but there are occasions when individuals show themselves to be unable and/or unwilling to understand your point no matter how hard you try to be clear.  On those occasions, perhaps it might not be a bad idea to simply cut your losses and move on from that situation.

       But looks bad to who?  Looks bad to either A) the ignorant masses or B) the establishment.  Either one of those options is not anyone whose side you want to be on anyway.  If you can educate some of the members of A, then great.  Many/most will fight you and troll you and hate on you for trying to change them of their views.  Some will see your perspective.  Some won’t.  It seems that such is the way things are.

       You will not be able to convince everyone of your point of view.  Sometimes our points of view are mistaken and
       <em>
        we
       </em>
       are the ones that are wrong - so it’s good if/when no one is convinced by what we say.  On other occasions when we’re correct, some may still not side with our perspective.  State your case as well as you can, and then just say “meh” and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can’t convince everyone - and this is a good thing because no one on this planet is omniscient, so everyone brings a certain something to the table that can be learned from.

       This is our ego showing itself.  We often want to be the right ones - regardless of whether we actually are or are not.  We have to educate ourselves, learn as much as possible, and realize that there’s a lot we do not know.

       Oh yeah.  This is certainly the case.

       That’s why, again, we simply have to continue educating ourselves.

       From what I can tell you’re a shill if you don’t believe what is considered the “norm” by those in this sub. Which is strange to me because I thought this sub was the place to question what we are told is the norm.

       That does seem to be the situation, and mostly it’s just a way to discredit anyone who disagrees and maintain the echo chamber.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s almost like someone is intentionally spreading awareness of conspiracy theory to a more mainstream audience in order to drive them here and to similar communities. If they are able to maintain the narrative here then it works as an effective indoctrination zone, but disagreement and critical thinking weakens the narrative and then that normie you almost won over to your side is halted by a skeptical comment they can relate to.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to prevent that from happening and to make sure that most of the normies ending up here are properly indoctrinated, the idea has been pushed that anyone who disagrees with the herd is actually a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here’s an example:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7zvy6t/no_link_between_trump_russia_no_link_between/?st=JE1WK1DO&amp;amp;sh=7611cee9">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7zvy6t/no_link_between_trump_russia_no_link_between/?st=JE1WK1DO&amp;amp;sh=7611cee9
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So this post is exactly the kind of thing people are supposed to see here, but note the comments. You’ll se one calling the post out for what it is, and big surprise that commenter is accused of being a shill.

       I disagree.  There are conspiracy theories that have nothing to do with government so it be hard to say someone is a statist because they have an opinion on those.  Also, statist would mean they support the government.  Just because they don't believe certain conspiracy theories does not mean they support the government.   There are probably many antigovernment people who do not believe any conspiracy theories but still disagree with government.
