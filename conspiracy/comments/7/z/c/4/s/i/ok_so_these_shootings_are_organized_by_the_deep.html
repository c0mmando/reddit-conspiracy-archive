       Despite what anyone says to the contrary, that's likely a good thing.  Don't go swallowing pills unless you are fully aware of what you're swallowing.

       Um, you should probably look at the gun laws and regulations on the books. They've been slowly chipping away at them since at least the 1930's. Which is bullshit, because we have the 2nd amendment to solidify to the government, that the people have a Natural right to bear arms, and that right shall not be infringed.

       First of all, it's a "boiling the frog" attack, which they have been doing since the 30's. Slowly turning the water up, until the frog is finally dead. You cannot just throw a frog into boiling water, just like how you just cannot outright ban guns. You don't remove them from existence, you regulate them out of existence. Which is pure evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, to your specific question, here:

       . It's a massive game of tug-of-war, between government and we the people.

       Agreed it’s a tug of war and if TPTB are relying on Congress - it’s going to be a long time coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in regards to your first point, since stricter regulations since the 30s - if that’s the case, it would seem to me that we now have more guns per capital now versus then. I’ll try to dig for any data that would exist to prove or disprove it. How do you think those regulations have curbed your rights?

       Via laws, regulations, restrictions, permits, and licenses. It is federally illegal to manufacture my own full auto.

       It's hard for me to swallow the false flag narrative, so I really couldn't even hazard a guess.  But for those that do, it seems strange to me that the gun manufacturers are never the ones accused of being behind it.

       I don't doubt that the shootings happened and that precious lives were lost either.  It makes me wonder how far a deep-rooted corrupt element of a superpower's government would go.  Would they condition a person to kill innocent children?  I don't know but I hope not

       Gun manufacturers already know from past history, that school shootings aren't necessarily good for business considering it sparks a massive debate on repealing the 2nd amendment and the left predominantly wants them banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that ban was to be implemented. it was cause a run on guns which would cause a massive sell out of inventory, inability to keep up with the short time frame of legal demand, and then the gravy boat would end once the law was changed. Businesses such as these, prefer to have legality and long term multi-generational life span.
      </p>
      <p>
       A false flag, if the Fla Shooting is one, by a gun manufacturer is actually counter intuitive. They also know from past history the majority MSM bias to the left, just as it is now, is 24/7 anti-gun

       I think its the Feds, again if it really is a psy op. The biggest threat to the Feds with checks and balances, is an armed citizenship. If they took all guns away, they can expand and create a future dictatorship, tyrant, communism, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you have to do, is look at history in the past, at all countries where the guns where taken away. Good read here:

       Don’t gun sales go up after shootings? That spike is great for gun manufacturers. I think it’s just as valid a theory that they would be behind them to spike sales, knowing that talk of guns being banned in America is good for sales and won’t actually happen here (this theory assumes they are confident in their lobbying abilities to prevent guns from being banned).

       A temporary spike of sales is never worth it if it lead to an actual ban. Businesses like these seek longevity, not some temporary higher sales

      <p>
       The better route for Gun Manufacturers is lobbying so guns stay legal and they enjoy long term sales, and thats exactly what we have. A false flag for temp sales is completely illogical from a business point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       However a false flag to bring back the discussion to ban guns, is much more likely.

       Why can’t they have it both ways. Guns aren’t getting banned in America, ever. The idea of a gun ban is a bogey man propped up by the NRA. Most of even the hardest hardcore of liberals just want more gun regulation, not a ban on guns (I know there are outliers that do actually want guns banned). So you get your long term sales, plus your spikes, because every time there’s a shooting like Parkland you whip up a ‘ban scare’ by telling people liberals are coming for your guns. Realistically looking at the gun culture here in America, much less how much the NRA puts into politics, I would feel pretty confident as a gun manufacturer that guns aren’t going to be banned here.

       And yet Biden made Schools "Gun Free Zones" which does nothing to stop school shooting. Democratic cities like Chicago, had gun bans city wide for decades, which also did nothing to prevent city shootings. You can actually historically see a slow systematic gun ban in some areas that has been attempted

       Exactly. I work with a guy who is also a gun smith. His business is booked for months in advanced and he has no issues with lack of business and he is also against the school shooting as are all the folks who I know are pro-gun.

       Bill Cooper had some great predictions, I’m not going to go against a conspiracy god, but that doesn’t mean the NRA couldn’t have found a way into that ame system and now the goals have changed, and it’s no longer about disarming the populace but rather dividing us. Makes the liberal gun taking boogeyman stereotype work even better and they can play up the gun nut stereotype on the other side because the NRA have pushed them into such a defensive posture that they won’t have any gun regulation conversation which makes them easier to vilify. Now you have it both ways, the people are divided, guns aren’t going anywhere, and whenever stocks are low or you need a good dividing distraction you roll out your CIA stuff Coop was talking about.
      </p>

       Here's the thing, I'm an ex-democrat, been one my whole life and just 2 years ago noped the fuck out. To be honest, I have never seen more division than amongst the left just recently. I have reached out to the right in debates and have been mostly welcomed and met with fair debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the ultimate question is, if that would be good for business for gun manufacturers to produce division/war. I mean, there's a ton of evidence that George Soros already does this and he profits from a crash/civil war, and this guy is entirely on the left and funding the left in the U.S. Most Gun Mfr's are on the right

       Let's consider that the cops were called on this kid 29 times, and the FBI was notified about him as well, at the very least once, which we know to be true. Now, if the Feds have MK Ultra (voices in the head) tech, then this kid would have been the ultimate mark for said Tech. I dont really think the Mfr's have these sort of capabilities, the Feds are mostly left leaning, the media is in their pockets and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, we would have to find a Gun Mfr which is deeply linked to the Feds and go from there

       Alright one more theory, not doubting your personal experience with the left, but what if the division you see on the left is being artificially amplified by things like Fox News, Breitbart, etc. There is division for sure, but I think it’s constantly being made to look worse than it is, it’s easy to go to Berkeley and rile up some kids and get good video, twitter bots have been accused of amplifying the Hillary Bernie divide (DNC actions Not excused, there is still real division there, but it can still be artificially amplified), etc. We have a very effective right wing GOP communication apparatus in America right now that is good at messaging and branding liberals as Berkeley kids not families, that’s the same branding used to ramp up gun ban talks, done by the same people paid a ton by the NRA.

       Of course it is. Things is, I wasn't aware of Breitbart ever, until I started seeing the division within the left, racial division, trans/gender division, communism all of a sudden is popular as is Islam and its principles, etc so I noped the fuck out. I still stay in touch with some of my leftist friends/family/co-workers, and they are the ones that put me on to Breitbart and what Fox is saying. Thing is, I never cared or tuned in what they were saying cause there really wasn't the sort of division within the left itself that happened in the last 2 years

But I am also for human rights and helping change the bad neighborhoods and other humanitarian issues that the left claims is for

       ‘That the left claims is for’ is the kind of inherent negativity about the left I’m talking about. Also I’m not really sure what communism is a popular as Islam and it’s principals is trying to say, based on my experience I’ve never met a communist (past the age of 15, there were a couple of ‘communists’ in high school but they grew out of that and into a goth phase) but I’ve met plenty of Muslims. 
I do think we agree on a lot of things, and I’m not trying to reignite a debate here but some of the things you just are really good examples of the soft language Fox and Breitbart use to vilify liberals and I don’t think it was intentional, but rather it has just kind of invaded the way we talk about things.

       Oh come on get real, after 30 years of privatization of military operations and intelligence, it is not necessary to be the "government." to carry off any kind of operation, anywhere, like that ISIS stuff, (correct when identified as U.S. in support, incorrect when identified as U.S. government supported).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you own 80% of the nation's wealth, have a bought and paid for government and h ave spent the last 40  years telling the people to hate their government all while making it a government to hate,

       like calling the mass killings a government plot when it is so obvious it is the anti-democratic republic crowd who will benefit from the chaos and dismay.

       you must not have a kid, or think fondly of the innocence of going to school. I believe that having armed employees at schools has a severely negative affect on children. Practice drills should involve something positive, not mayhem.

       No guns in schools is my point. Kids don't need to live in a police state, as many are smarter than the thugs profiting. Zero guns and military Stasi narks at schools. No backpack searches, no armed guards, no canine searches, and no oppression of innocents. NO

       You know, when I was in high school, and this was in the late 90's, we
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       had an armed cop on campus. We also had other non-armed security. There was also only one way in/out that was guarded during school hours. They didn't know you/ you weren't supposed to be there, you were escorted to the office.
      </p>
      <p>
       No fights and no crime on campus, suburbs of LA. Things are definitely wrong at schools these days.

       I think this was just a misstep by police and FBI. I mean this won't be the last shooting that's a fact! If anything this shooting has taken away from the DACA discussion, and that may be extended after it expires March 5th since that effects over a million people. But yeah these shootings won't disarm anyone even if a bunch of kids yell at lawmakers to do it. People are worked up due to the amount of mass shootings that have happened and how frequently they are occurring. 3 of the deadliest mass shootings with over 15 dead in less than a year has to get millions angry that this will still continue since nothing is being done. And nothing substantial will be done unfortunately except more background checks, and minor bans on magazines or one type of attachment. Interesting question though!

       The kids got themselves to do it, with a lot of support, but these kids vary in age from 15-18 so of course they are vocal and energized. They wanted to talk to lawmakers and did it in person at a townhall meeting broadcasted live thanks to the media.  Of course the media will cover it, and that's important because it gives them a voice and platform. Donald Trump even had his meeting with kids and adults in a circle session for over an hour where he had that broadcasted for the world to see as well using the media to his full advantage. The media is an interesting tool for information. It's the way though how you use that and consider what information is credible  and true to what you want to believe. Rather than using one source for all your information. There's many sources to cross reference.

       Think about it in a different way.. It's not trying to tale guns away with each event. It's desensitizing and chipping away at people with each event. Real, fake, doesn't matter. What does matter is that every time something horrible happens, it makes the average person loosen up on their rights and opinions. It fixes a narrative over time that guns are bad, and the government is trying to protect you, but can't yet, because gun laws.. No intelligent overseeing power would expect to change a country's opinion in a day. It's cumulative and about long term goals. It's about manipulating the peole who have absolutely no idea what's an "assault" rifle vs a 22. It's about directing the herd through fear instead of knowledge.

       Disarm the population prevent a civil war. How else are the 1% going to automate their empires to compete against the rising economies or russia and china and the market of the entire eurasian continent planned through the silk road? The situation in US isnt going to change if the russia hate narrative going to continue. Russia hacked this and that, when the reality of the systemic problems of corporate run gov is that people are consumers, not citizens. Thats why in such a gov the tax money is all going to the military and not the services for the peoppe. Infrastructure, education, medicare(health) social services. They dont exist, and any conversation on such matters, is met with 'comunist talk' or as is now a trend:'russia lover, troll etc'. Medness.

       Yes.  But why?  I thought of three possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       One is just for control, obviously to disarm and squash out probability / prospect of citizens forming effective civilian militias.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next reason is that a big economic crash is coming, and if the situation gets desperate enough, an angry mob may be looking for somebody to blame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last reason of course is because guns are bad and scary, so only the state and criminals (not mutually exclusive) should have access to such power.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest, meh.  I don't feel too strongly about gun rights but I believe in the intent of the constitution - keep power to the people.

        That makes more sense to me. If anyone stands to gain from this, it's the gun manufacturers.

       If that's the case, then they would also have CNN and all the other fake propaganda outlets spewing 24/7 that everyone needs more guns.

       Via laws, regulations, restrictions, permits, and licenses. It is federally illegal to manufacture my own full auto.

       Bill Cooper had some great predictions, I’m not going to go against a conspiracy god, but that doesn’t mean the NRA couldn’t have found a way into that ame system and now the goals have changed, and it’s no longer about disarming the populace but rather dividing us. Makes the liberal gun taking boogeyman stereotype work even better and they can play up the gun nut stereotype on the other side because the NRA have pushed them into such a defensive posture that they won’t have any gun regulation conversation which makes them easier to vilify. Now you have it both ways, the people are divided, guns aren’t going anywhere, and whenever stocks are low or you need a good dividing distraction you roll out your CIA stuff Coop was talking about.

       Note: I’m using NRA to sub for a lack of a better term, maybe gun manufacturers would be a better term.
