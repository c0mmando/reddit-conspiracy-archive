        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Pretty simple. The coroporations held the government to ransom and the government paid up (bank bail outs) </p>

<p>then look at the paradigm shift that happened in technology; games consoles became spy-networks for the alphabet agencies. The internet was taken over while we worried about making ends meet, propaganda seeped into the news, blaming immigrants to keep our minds off of the bullshit going down.</p>

<p>I know this is a lazy post, but trust me, look into 2008 and ignore the financial side of it and you will see a very scarey rabbit hole.</p>

<p>remember the sinking of the lucitania to kick start ww1? or pearl harbour to get america into ww2? or the gulf of tonkein (sp?) incident to get america into vietnam? or WMDS and 9/11 to get america into the middle east?</p>

<p>Yeah? Well, we were warned over a decade ago that the internet would be the next battleground for nations around the world. Well, who owns the internet? America. How did they own it? they made the move during the 2008 financial crash.</p>

<p>Your whole virtual reality experience is just one very large, very long advertisement.</p>

<p>Enjoy the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>EDIT!!! : Thank you all for the well researched posts and for the wealth of information into this topic and subject. Your hard work and efforts have been greatly appreciated. Even more so as none of these replies have been political or shilly. </p>

<p>Let me clarify what i mean by &#39;take over&#39;</p>

<p>We all knwo the governments have been bribed by corporations for decades. The fatcats ask our politicians to look the other way on certain issues or just buy their own laws and rules. But that was a set process and procedure. The fatcats had to give money to governments, they  had to lobby for changes etc etc. Now, the process of getting a law signed through (whatever the American system is, i&#39;m English) is still there, but it is a shell of its&#39; former self.</p>

<p>We all know that the FED had plants in government in the early 1900&#39;s and all the way through to 2008. The reason i say there was a &#39;takeover&#39; is because the CORPORATE interests outweighed the interests of the people and government. </p>

<p>Lets say we split the power divide of corporations and elected officials. In 1910 we could say it was 10% corporations, and over the next few decades it rose close to 50/50 on the power struggle. I Believe that 2008 saw the complete shift of power in the favour of big corporations to the point where they no longer had to lobby officials or buy votes, they simply own the officials. What was once a no-no is now signed off by the most power and affluent in society to keep things ticking over.</p>

<p>The illusion of the elections and of voting in a party became a full illusion after 2008. The ramp up of spying, lieing and forcing Americans to submit to propaganda peaked after 2008. I believe that a large international consortium of elite businessmen and women &#39;bought&#39; America. I don&#39;t think the financial crash was staged to make the working class suffer, i believe it was made to hold the elite to ransom. &quot;We own you now, slave. If you don&#39;t like it, we will send you to the dungeon&quot; (in this case the dungeon is normal life)</p>

<p>Remember, the rothschilds/TPBP/illuminati want EVERYBODY as slaves. Do you think they want the 0.01% hanging around to threaten their dynasty? No. They were also enslaved, just like the rest of us.</p>

<p>From here, the only way is down and the only way to fix the financial system is...mass depopulation. Remove the elderly (pension moochers) and the young (relying on the working class and middle class to support them) and you have enough &#39;spare cash&#39; in the system that you can ramp up taxes. Imagine a virus being released where the big corps knew it would wipe out 90% of young and old people, but they said &quot;HEY, save your family for just $200 a month&quot;. People would do it. In a crisis, with no hope, people will do anything.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SS : the internet was taken over during the financial crash of 2008. Governments handed over power (for the first time) to coroporations (what i mean is that the balance of power tipped in the favour of corporations. Now they own the majority of power). Tech stopped increasing in power (look at the advancements of tech between 1995 and 200 or 200 and 2005 then look at tech between 2005 and 2010 or 2010 to 2015. There was also a huge push in connectivity for gaming, using kinect as a spy device and pushing online gaming like never before. </p>

<p>Do your own research and tell me if i&#39;m talking shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was the fact that the government demanded mortgage companies to deal out sup-prime loans via Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. People with inadequate ability to afford housing (funds, credit, etc) were now granted loans with zero down payments. Simply put, this whole operation lead to lenders not being repaid which lead to the housing crisis and in effect, banks were shorted severely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no problem believing Wall Street blackmailed DC into the bailout. For a variety of reasons, I was keeping an extremely close eye on all things financial in the year leading up to the crisis.</p>

<p>I remember reading about high frequency trading and a claim that Goldman Sachs <em>alone</em> controlled 40% of the market.</p>

<p>So when Congress got record breaking numbers of calls, letters, faxes, etc. <em>against</em> the bailout, I knew it wasn&#39;t going to be pretty. Congress voted against it initially. Then Goldman and friends whip their dicks out and crash the market 700 points just because they can and just because they want Congress to know they can.</p>

<p>Boom. Congress bails them out.</p>

<p>The Fed has been giving them cheap money ever since to re-inflate the market. Except retail investors got burned so badly, they don&#39;t want to go back in. So now, the Fed will start pushing the rates up, the funny money will come out of the market. The business boys are going to want another economic boom, Trump&#39;s tax buy-off will only satisfy them for so long.</p>

<p>Any guesses what the next market maker will be?</p>

<p>Looting in 4 Simple Steps</p>

<p>Step 1: The bankster Cabal primes and pumps unsustainable economic bubbles conjured from lies and garbage. Then, as planned, it pawns the garbage off onto unsuspecting pasties using exotic financial instruments, thereby creating a monster wealth transfer.</p>

<p>Step 2: The Cabal shorts the garbage, thereby facilitating a rout or crash of a debt bubble.</p>

<p>Step 3: During the crisis/collapse stage, the Parasite Guild and Cabal swoop in like vultures to pick up economic gems for a song.</p>

<p>Step 4: Anybody still solvent is robbed to pay off debts in full. This may include pension funds or even taxpayers. A key mechanism this cycle is bank-deposit bail ins.</p>

Additionally they will dissolve pensions and loot bank depositors, also known as the Washington Consensus. They didn&#39;t have bank deposit bail ins and privitization mechanisms set up in 2008-2009.

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting concept. One notable aspect of the 2008 financial crisis to Mr is how it gave Obama an out. He talked big throughout 2007/2008, and then the recession right before his win have him a powerful excuse to fail to deliver on most of his populist promises. How can you possibly expect &quot;hope&quot; and &quot;change&quot; when he has to pull out all the stops just to keep the economy from collapsing?? And we know thanks to Wikileaks that his cabinet was basically hand-picked by Citigroup. </p>

<p>I think a lot of stuff like this isn&#39;t so much planned in advance as clever opportunism, though. &quot;Never let a good crisis go to waste.&quot;</p>

The problem is there were not sufficient laws and people willing to prosecute those that were to blame. Instead we all paid for their debts . Banks could have survived even without the bail out by simply liquidating their assets. The global economy could have taken the hit and would have emerged victorious, but the False News propaganda made it look like it would be the end of the world and that everything would collapse.
 They played on our need for financial security and forced us to pay for their sins. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The government, namely the political side of it, was taken over long before the crash of 2008. But IMO, 2008 was a watershed moment insofar as corporations and elected officials stopped caring that their collusion was in the open. Obama&#39;s bank &quot;rescue&quot; is penultimate example. And now, thanks to Wikileaks, we know that Obama&#39;s entire administration was hand-picked by Citigroup before he was even elected. </p>

<p>Trump is no better. His appointees are unashamedly working against public welfare, in favor of corporate interests - Ajit Pai (FCC) with net neutrality, Scott Gottlieb (FDA) with kratom, etc. And the GOP tax bill is little more than a corporate giveaway.</p>

<p>george mason would likely say that it goes even earlier to when the constitution itself was adopted. the convention was only supposed to have tweaked the articles of confederation.</p>

<p>the trusts already controlled many state and federal legislatures by the civil war.</p>
