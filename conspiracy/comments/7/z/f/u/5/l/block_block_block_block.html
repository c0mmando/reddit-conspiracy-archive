       This subreddit is under severe duress. Many commenters I see are consistently supporting the "official story" and attempting to mock and shame conspiracy theorists. It increases every time there is a major "event."
      </p>
      <p>
       I am blocking these people left and right and suggest you do the same, and make mention of it when you do. Anyone who replies to a comment you make can be blocked; just click on the "block" indicator upon first reading their response (but reply to it first, noting that you're blocking them).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't recommend doing this in a knee-jerk fashion. Read the history of someone's comments before taking action. Healthy disagreement is good. But much of what's going on here isn't healthy or organic or natural. It's anti-r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In some sense, this is actually a good thing. It indicates the success of this subreddit. But every day is a battle and battles can turn. Blocking the enemies of this subreddit is one way to battle back.

       I think the argument could be made that by blocking those who don't subscribe to your own personal belief system, you're actually engaging in unhealthy and inorganic/unnatural practices. Debate is healthy. If you're so confident in your opinion, no amount of debate should threaten that.

       I agree, but Ian's post was in response to an argument with a user with a 5 year old account with little to no history who in a separate comment claimed to be a member of the deep state, operating an old account. The guy is either a liar or is telling the truth and is foolish. Either way, that's a guy I could stand to block, though I don't block anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all, debate is healthy and it's fun to have a genuine exchange of ideas, but the particular guy who sparked this post wasn't bringing anything constructive to the table, and I do understand Ian's reasoning.

       Can't speak to the account claiming to be a member of the deep state - I just know, not even an hour ago, this same guy blocked me in another thread because I asked for clarification and further evidence as to why he believed the CNN Townhall was "bullshit".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it looks like he's just using this particular post to literally block anyone that criticizes the viewpoint. It's demented and hilarious, all at the same time. You can see the trail - someone replies with a dissenting belief, and, like clockwork, he responds with "BLOCK!". Is this just his own personal circlejerk post?

       That's different than what I'd expect given interaction with Ian in the past on here. He's really informed when it comes to terrorism, and always has a helpful link when it comes to discussing individuals. The post is reactionary, and of course people are going to antagonize when someone behaves that way.

      <p>
       That's the comment where the guy claims to be deep state. His other comments are equally unhelpful. I understand blocking this guy at least, but I like to see the mess for what it is personally.

       Honestly, thank you for the contextualization. It helps to try and see it from a different perspective, even if it is one that I disagree with. I try not to review other people's post histories because, in my opinion, it's not relevant. But I get that some people use post history as a way of ferreting out who they do and do not want to communicate with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try as I might, though, I just can't stomach the idea of gleefully blocking anyone that has a different opinion/perspective. If someone is replying with abusive or threatening language, or flooding your inbox with threats, then a block is MORE than justified. But that's not what this guy is doing - he literally created a non-conspiracy related post in a conspiracy forum that details his own personal issues with other members and their disagreements and then proceeds to use it almost as a roll-call for people to block.

       No one is picking apart the conspiracy angle in light of good evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are picking it apart because the “evidence” is a joke. Everyone may now feel free to downvote and tell me how closed minded I am.

       I didn't name any one specific conspiracy. It's for all of them. The assault is relentless and does not discriminate. It's all a matter of promoting the official story through mockery and denigration.

       You shit over narratives because you don't like who covers them? Like it or not, the ones who broke Watergate and the Pentagon Papers should be given credence. The NYTimes broke Clinton's email scandal, and Weinstein, and those got quite a bit of traction both in the news and on here.

       Watergate and Pentagon papers? LOL. Go back a half century whydoncha. NYTimes did not break Clinton's email scandal, and the Weinstein stuff only came a decade after they spiked a story when Matt Damon and Russell Crowe leaned on the paper (and who knows who else?).
      </p>

       WaPo has had so many stories that have had to be corrected, it's ridiculous. Remember the Russians hacking the nuclear reactor in New England? Terrible reporting. Plus the paper's owned by CIA flunky Jeff Bezos.

       AH yes, defense for the mockingbird-infiltrated outlets that reliably spout pro-war, pro-CFR, and pro-Intelligence propaganda. Sure, there is good reporting scattered in between all of the garbage, but they deserve no credence whatsoever. Just suggesting this shows your ignorance in this subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example, Sibel Edmonds exposed Dennis Hastert and his pay-for-play pedophilia and bribery back in ~2003 - 2005. The only outlet which actually reported on this was fucking
       <em>
        Vanity Fair
       </em>
       . The "prestigius" NYT and WaPo refused to talk to her and look at the available evidence until
       <strong>
        10 years later
       </strong>
       , when Hastert was far past his prime and therefore expendable. Even then the story they conveyed was incomplete and a softball.

       She testified under oath in 2009.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the course of her duties, according to Edmonds, with her Top Secret clearance, she learned of treason, blackmail of Members of Congress, bribery, and other criminal activities, including pedophilia.  The information that Edmonds gleaned from the wiretaps that she was translating provides context for the White House scandal that became known as the “Valerie Plame Affair.”  When Edmonds reported the content of this intelligence to her superiors, she eventually was slapped with a “State Secrets” gag order and prohibited from talking about what she learned.  She skirted that gag order by placing photographs online of the targeted individuals whose conversations she had translated, thereby discovering their criminal activities. Finally, in 2009, as a result of another lawsuit on an entirely different subject, Edmonds was able to air her information publicly under oath.  That deposition is here. Edmonds has written two books about her experiences, a memoir, Classified Woman, and a novel, The Lone Gladio.

It featured a former high-ranking politician, blackmail and intrigue, and just enough details about Hastert’s former life as a teacher and wrestling coach to suggest that the “past misconduct” referred to a salacious scandal of sexual abuse of a minor. But for some reason the story faded from the headlines almost as quickly as it appeared. And now that Hastert’s legal team has announced that they are seeking a plea deal with prosecutors in order to avoid a trial, it seems the story is likely to disappear completely.
       </p>
       <p>
        But a series of revelations from FBI whistleblowers reveal that this story is just the tip of a very seedy iceberg, one that implicates Hastert, his top aide, other Congress members and government officials in a criminal network involved in sexual intrigue, foreign espionage, blackmail, and drug money.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2002 Gilbert Graham, a Special Agent in the Washington Field Office of the FBI, blew the whistle on an illegal surveillance program being conducted out of the Bureau’s Washington headquarters. According to the unclassified version of his complaint, obtained by the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition in 2007, Graham alleged violations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillence Act “in conducting electronic surveillance as a subterfuge to acquire evidence of criminal activity.”
       </p>
       <p>
        These allegations were backed up by a former FBI Counterintelligence Specialist in the Washington Field Office, who told the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition: “…you are looking at covering up massive public corruption and espionage cases; to top that off you have major violations of FISA by the FBI Washington Field Office and HQ targeting these cases. Everyone involved has motive to cover up these reports and prevent investigation and public disclosure.”

        Hastert’s “nefarious and illegal sexual activities” have been broached in media reports going back at least a decade, since the time that Hastert, as Speaker of the House, helped cover up the Mark Foley scandal involving the sexual abuse of male House pages. Not only has Hastert’s sexual relationship with his live-in chief of staff, Scott Palmer, been repeatedly hinted at in articles by the likes of former US Senate Staffer Laurence O’Donnell, but as far back as 2006 investigative reporter Wayne Madsen was tying the Foley scandal and Hastert into Tom DeLay, Jack Abramoff, Southeast Asia, and child sex prostitution.
       </p>
       <p>
        “State Department sources have also reported that the visits of Hastert and other congressional leaders and staff members to certain Southeast Asian nations and the Northern Marianas should come under the scrutiny of the House Ethics Committee, now officially investigating ‘Pagegate.’ The Northern Marianas became infamous in the scandals involving Tom DeLay and Jack Abramoff because of the presence in the US slave labor territory of Asian children being used as prostitutes. Conveniently, Foley co-chaired the House Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children, which would have had authority to investigate charges of child prostitution in the Northern Marianas,” Madsen reported, adding: “Hastert visited Vietnam, along with Palmer, in April of this year and spent three days in the country. Hastert, along with Illinois GOP Rep. Ray LaHood, canceled a visit to Thailand and Vietnam in January 2006. Hastert was also in Thailand in January 2002.”
       </p>
       <p>
        This lines up with the information that FBI insiders have been trying to blow the whistle on for years.

       So you referenced pedophilia in a 2005 article in Vanity Fair that the NYTimes didn't cover (no pedophilia in the article), to a 2009 deposition that involved pedophilia that the NYTimes didn't cover (no pedophilia in the deposition), to an article in 2015.

       I had my timelines on what was first exposed mixed up on the 2005 date. She exposed Hastert for money laundering, financial fraud, and the likes. This, of course, does not make this lack of reporting by the likes of the NYT any better, but thanks for the slight adjustment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to also address your very blatant cherry-picking of the Vanity Fair article. Can't believe I just noticed that, my god what a sleezy thing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the
       <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2005/09/edmonds200509">
        actual article for readers,
       </a>
       and here is the entire context for your cherry picked quote:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Some of the calls reportedly contained what sounded like references to large-scale drug shipments and other crimes. To a person who knew nothing about their context, the details were confusing, and it wasn’t always clear what might be significant. One name, however, apparently stood out—a man the Turkish callers often referred to by the nickname “Denny boy.” It was the Republican congressman from Illinois and Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert. According to some of the wiretaps, the F.B.I.’s targets had arranged for tens of thousands of dollars to be paid to Hastert’s campaign funds in small checks. Under Federal Election Commission rules, donations of less than $200 are not required to be itemized in public filings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hastert himself was never heard in the recordings, Edmonds told investigators, and it is possible that the claims of covert payments were hollow boasts. Nevertheless, an examination of Hastert’s federal filings shows that the level of un-itemized payments his campaigns received over many years was relatively high. Between April 1996 and December 2002, un-itemized personal donations to the Hastert for Congress Committee amounted to $483,000. In contrast, un-itemized contributions in the same period to the committee run on behalf of the House majority leader, Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas, were only $99,000. An analysis of the filings of four other senior Republicans shows that only one, Clay Shaw, of Florida, declared a higher total in un-itemized donations than Hastert over the same period: $552,000. The other three declared far less. Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Joe Barton, of Texas, claimed $265,000; Armed Services Committee chairman Duncan Hunter, of California, got $212,000; and Ways and Means Committee chairman Bill Thomas, of California, recorded $110,000.
       </p>
       <p>
        Edmonds reportedly added that the recordings also contained repeated references to Hastert’s flip-flop, in the fall of 2000, over an issue which remains of intense concern to the Turkish government—the continuing campaign to have Congress designate the killings of Armenians in Turkey between 1915 and 1923 a genocide. For many years, attempts had been made to get the House to pass a genocide resolution, but they never got anywhere until August 2000, when Hastert, as Speaker, announced that he would give it his backing and see that it received a full House vote. He had a clear political reason, as analysts noted at the time: a California Republican incumbent, locked in a tight congressional race, was looking to win over his district’s large Armenian community. Thanks to Hastert, the resolution, vehemently opposed by the Turks, passed the International Relations Committee by a large majority. Then, on October 19, minutes before the full House vote, Hastert withdrew it.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the time, he explained his decision by saying that he had received a letter from President Clinton arguing that the genocide resolution, if passed, would harm U.S. interests. Again, the reported content of the Chicago wiretaps may well have been sheer bravado, and there is no evidence that any payment was ever made to Hastert or his campaign. Nevertheless, a senior official at the Turkish Consulate is said to have claimed in one recording that the price for Hastert to withdraw the resolution would have been at least $500,000.

       Actually, they had hard evidence on his sexual activities back in 1996, so I was wrong. From the Corbett Report article that you apparently didn't read:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Since 1996 the FBI has had tons of information on Hastert which was gathered in Chicago by the FBI’s Chicago Field Office. The incriminating criminal evidence in those files range from bribery, extortion, fraud, money laundering and embezzlement, to sexual crimes against minors and participation in foreign-operated drug operations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 1997 the FBI has had much hard evidence on Hastert gathered by the FBI’s Washington Field Office. The documented deeds range from espionage to foreign bribery.
       </p>
       <p>
        But that’s not all. The FBI also has had hard data on Hastert’s sexual violations outside the United States. The involved countries include Vietnam, Thailand, Turkey and Morocco, among others. This also included sexual favors as means of foreign bribery. Interestingly, the CIA had been documenting those sexual activities for many years, and not only on Hastert but on many others; elected and appointed.

       So let's just say
       <em>
        hypothetically
       </em>
       , your post is objectively wrong. But the context of the posts also states, "anyone who says im wrong is wrong". Therefore anyone who disagrees with
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       statement is actually agreeing with you... soooo you just find it easier to block people and count a number to find out how "correct" you are, rather than reading each comment to find they disagree individually...?

       People are free to disagree with you or the recent flooding of irrational, ignorant folks coming here. If you watch InfoWars and read unsourced blogs, but haven't read anything linked on the sidebar or searched this sub for infothreads, you're going to get people who insult or dismiss low-energy posts/comments.

       I don't believe Florida or Las Vegas were false flags. I think there's angry people in our toxic society. The claim that every gun event is a false flag or hoax isn't rational. That's giving a level of control to the government that it doesn't deserve.

       Damn right - this is a user who's not promoting a constructive way to have a dialogue. I see complaints about this sub every day, and this is one of the least effective ways of making it any better.

       Call out shills, provide evidence, make strong counter-points, back up your shit with evidence. Blocking users that don't agree with you, no - I can't get behind that. That's ridiculous.

       Being exposed to hatefulness and it's effect on your wellbeing and health is a conspiracy topic in itself. It is the other side of the coin of the dopamine boost you get with upvotes.

       And like I said in my original post to the OP, he has every right to do that. I just questions why he is here if he will block people that don't agree with him. It doesn't seem like this is the place for him. I'm all for people believing whatever they want to believe in, but if someone makes a point against the user, I don't think this is the place for him to preach "BLOCK". you know?

       I don't block anyone because it really is just a "mute" feature, imo. I've blocked in the past when an account was seriously harassing me, but found the threads they were in lost context when they could see me but I couldn't see them.

       On the other hand, the comments hating on your suggestion are similar to those that throw a fit when contest mode is brought up, so maybe you are on to something.

       I'm totally on to something. All the "real" r/conspiracy people should block these frauds. My concern would be that newcomers wouldn't know what's going on and still see all the frauds, but hopefully they'd pick up the pattern after a while. We could also remind them through occasional posts what's up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking great pleasure in all the comments I don't see. Totally endorses my blocking decisions. So many people I've blocked earlier are obviously triggered by my suggestion. Deeply satisfying.

       I’m interested in who’s currently on your block list. Maybe you could make up a new sub and sticky a post at the top with an ongoing list of who’s been blocked and why. Maybe name it
       <a href="/r/shillwatch">
        /r/shillwatch
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Conversely, a list for the actual truth seekers should be maintained and their actions promoted. Maybe create a bot like the reddit silver bot, where users would be able to give points to other users they find to be promoting open discourse and thoughtful investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I myself agree with your tactics. If we waste our time arguing with obvious shills, then it detracts from the conversation. Having to constantly defend against an obvious shill army can be exhausting, but blocking them totally nullifies their ability to deride and derail.

       Thank you for this comment and I'm grateful to hear you agree.

       I'm not sure how the mods would take to a shared block list, but I like the idea. Basically I have two pillars for blocking somebody:
      </p>
      <p>
       1- A direct personal attack
      </p>
      <p>
       2- Their comment history
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really want to go through all my blocks--there are probably a couple hundred by this point--and explain why. If I provide a list, I would merely suggest people check the comments of the accounts I've listed and if they disagree with my block, then don't do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's ponder this further though. If any mods see this thread, I'd like to know their take.

       Enemies? I wouldn't consider anyone an enemy just because of their opinion being different to mine.

       Life is lived by constantly reassessing and updating our views. If someone's opinion makes you uncomfortable, it's teaching you a lesson about yourself.

       OP, this post has, itself, been targeted by a vicious hate subreddit attempting to manipulate comment sorting and vote totals in this thread. As this is being done to manipulate perception, this thread has now been placed in contest mode.
      </p>
      <p>
       Users participating in this thread as a result of a direct link from other subreddits (in particular hate subreddits) are at risk of having their accounts suspended from reddit for TOS violations, and the mods here will report all instances of that behavior to the reddit administrators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheers and sorry your thread was attacked in that way OP.

       The silver lining to such brigading is that it shows the chinks in their armor. They ignore posts of little to no threat. Ergo, blocking shills must be quite a threatening tactic.

       <p>
        The story seemed perfect fodder for the tabloid corporate press. It featured a former high-ranking politician, blackmail and intrigue, and just enough details about Hastert’s former life as a teacher and wrestling coach to suggest that the “past misconduct” referred to a salacious scandal of sexual abuse of a minor. But for some reason the story faded from the headlines almost as quickly as it appeared. And now that Hastert’s legal team has announced that they are seeking a plea deal with prosecutors in order to avoid a trial, it seems the story is likely to disappear completely.

        But a series of revelations from FBI whistleblowers reveal that this story is just the tip of a very seedy iceberg, one that implicates Hastert, his top aide, other Congress members and government officials in a criminal network involved in sexual intrigue, foreign espionage, blackmail, and drug money.

        In 2002 Gilbert Graham, a Special Agent in the Washington Field Office of the FBI, blew the whistle on an illegal surveillance program being conducted out of the Bureau’s Washington headquarters. According to the unclassified version of his complaint, obtained by the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition in 2007, Graham alleged violations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillence Act “in conducting electronic surveillance as a subterfuge to acquire evidence of criminal activity.”

        These allegations were backed up by a former FBI Counterintelligence Specialist in the Washington Field Office, who told the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition: “…you are looking at covering up massive public corruption and espionage cases; to top that off you have major violations of FISA by the FBI Washington Field Office and HQ targeting these cases. Everyone involved has motive to cover up these reports and prevent investigation and public disclosure.”

        Hastert’s “nefarious and illegal sexual activities” have been broached in media reports going back at least a decade, since the time that Hastert, as Speaker of the House, helped cover up the Mark Foley scandal involving the sexual abuse of male House pages. Not only has Hastert’s sexual relationship with his live-in chief of staff, Scott Palmer, been repeatedly hinted at in articles by the likes of former US Senate Staffer Laurence O’Donnell, but as far back as 2006 investigative reporter Wayne Madsen was tying the Foley scandal and Hastert into Tom DeLay, Jack Abramoff, Southeast Asia, and child sex prostitution.

        “State Department sources have also reported that the visits of Hastert and other congressional leaders and staff members to certain Southeast Asian nations and the Northern Marianas should come under the scrutiny of the House Ethics Committee, now officially investigating ‘Pagegate.’ The Northern Marianas became infamous in the scandals involving Tom DeLay and Jack Abramoff because of the presence in the US slave labor territory of Asian children being used as prostitutes. Conveniently, Foley co-chaired the House Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children, which would have had authority to investigate charges of child prostitution in the Northern Marianas,” Madsen reported, adding: “Hastert visited Vietnam, along with Palmer, in April of this year and spent three days in the country. Hastert, along with Illinois GOP Rep. Ray LaHood, canceled a visit to Thailand and Vietnam in January 2006. Hastert was also in Thailand in January 2002.”

        This lines up with the information that FBI insiders have been trying to blow the whistle on for years.
