       Okay so ill start by saying I have no intentions of using this information for anything other than my own amusement because I'll probably go onto a list after this...
      </p>
      <p>
       Right, we all know if you get within X radius of the area 51 base that people have said SUV's appear from over the hills and monitor your every move until you do a 180 and get out of there but what would happen if I rallied 1,000,000 people who haf no disregard for their lives and planned to approach the facility from varying angles in various sized groups?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would the American government kill civilians in extreme numbers for trespassing? I could have groups of 100,000 approaching from 10 different angles, 50,000 from 20, 10,000 from 100 or any different strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine the security as you got closer would ramp up significantly e.g snipers, land mines maybe even mounted machine guns triggered by heat or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I must stress this is totally 100% hypothetical so what do you think Reddit, could it be breached? How many casualties would the Government be willing to concede?

       I have another mass idea -- let's have all of us band together and default en masse on our student loans.  Want to saddle us with debt to make us live out your putrid kingly fantasies?  What happens when no one pays and the carousel stops spinning?

       Yes.  As the current debt already does affect us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you mean with regard to credit score and the health of the economy?  As for credit scores, if everyone has a bad credit score, then no one does.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think credit scores, along with the health of the economy, are difficult to predict with this situation, however.  I believe the shock could lead to the regulations and market situations that should've resulted from the housing bubble.  Sometimes you've gotta re-break a bone to get it to heal properly

       Dumb idea. No one pays student loans since they cam get $0 payments on IDR. Defaulting your student loans will fucking ruin your life and the government will still keep working.

       Heres an idea, pay back the money you borrowed! I know its crazy but hear me out. You borrowed money and you should pay it back. Insane!

       Yeah, imagine if you could get 100,000 to 1 million "woke" people protesting outside D.C.
with alternative media, social media broadcasting it live....shitty corporate media would have to start recording then.

      <p>
       Not bullshit wedge issues and social issues that don't affect the elites, I mean chanting real shit like get money out of politics, nationalize the FED, NO secret societies and CIA/other corrupt groups, give us back FDR's New Deal social programs without corporate privatization, end mass state surveillance, etc.

       The security force is likely small and very heavily armed. The workers would retreat with all the cool stuff behind 20 ton blast doors in bunkers that can withstand high explosives. After the gunships mowed down every living thing in the area they would come back out, sweep away the bodies, and get back to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this was in some sort rebellion where reinforcements were not happening the facilities would probably be abandoned after the cool shit was destroyed. They could also just lock themselves away until everyone ran out of water and went home.

       How about send 1,000 drones instead? Then u can get aerial pics. So I guess the answer is however many people needed to operate that many drones.  I would imagine around 100 people at most.

       Oh ya I’m sure they do! But wouldn’t an emp be counterproductive to the alien stuff or whatever else they’re hiding? There would need to be some major strategic tactics but again all hypothetical lol. I’m sure it’s just a matter of time before someone tries..

       I was out there many years ago training with my unit.  They gave us radiation badges when we entered the grounds and we were driven by bus to where we were training.  As we were driven in our squad leaders were telling us it was Groom Lake,etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were tons of outbuildings all over the place.  There was an area with these large round reactor looking buildings, water towers, and a couple buildings that were full of computer equipment.  Some still in boxes and desks with chairs everywhere.  It appeared that someone exited the area in great haste.  There were danger high radiation signs everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only saw a few security personnel as we entered, none in the area we were in.  I only saw into the area from the ridge as we were going in.  I saw hardly anyone else besides our unit the entire time we were there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The radiation badges were handed back when we left the facility.

       It was this badge that attached to our bdu which detected radiation levels.  There was nothing on it that indicated if you exposed, pretty sure that they wouldn't tell us anyways.

      <p>
       There were high radiation signs everywhere, some within the unit had bleeding gums and noses.  I never experienced anything and have been fine so far.
