       I firmly believe columbine was real. And to this day, gives me nightmares. If in 1999  they had clear footage of the shooters from when they enter the school and when they take their lives. Why don’t we see footage of the Florida one? It’s 2018. Every school has cameras. I heard about the lag, but still where’s the footage?

       There was flack over glorifying these guys back when Columbine happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few times afterwards they wouldn't count the shooter in the number of dead, but that is just stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since 911 shutting off all video evidence is all par for the course. For the greatest good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Between traffic cams and the Pentagon surveillance and private security cameras there must be more than a few bad frames to show the public. But no one cared. They get away with saying "trust us" for there is no need for the sensitive housewife to have to see a horrific act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why people were not in the streets en masse after the 911 commission was released is proof that we are beat. Between apathy, poverty/debt and ignorance we are in the best human cage ever designed.

       I agree Columbine was real. The cover up there was most likely (unless someone sees this and has an update) was that there was another student who happened to also have a gun, and started firing back at them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They couldn't have a kid with a gun in school being a good thing, so they swept it under the rug that there was a vigilante hero on campus.

       Couldn't find what I was looking for, to what I originally read, but there's a few references to a
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9905/05/school.shooting.01/">
        third shooter.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a book called
       <em>
        Everything you know is wrong
       </em>
       , and it has the theory that the reason the other kid got covered up is that he possibly killed one or both of the shooters, or at least shot back, and kept them at bay.

       Tbh this is pretty basic level shit. They only go after people that have shit on an individual that needs to disappear or you're some crazy level researcher that is about to let the cat out of the bag. Us common folk aren't much of a threat as there are specific measures in place to keep us divided amongst ourselves. Besides, never let fear control you. Die on your feet before you live on your knees.

       I know all too well what you mean. The best thing to do is teach your children not to be afaird and that no one has the power to control you or anyone else. It is only perceived control. The story of Jesus is a great example of dying on your feet. He was humiliated, tortured, and ultimately killed but still chose to stand up to the religious institution of that time, knowing it would result in his death. I personally am not religious, and regardless if it is fact or fiction, there is still a beautiful underlying message about not living in fear and how the choice to stand rather than fold is incredibly powerful long after you are gone. A realisticly scaled verison of this would be Rosa Parks, MLK, etc. The underlying message is the same but in a child friendly format lol.

       Lol totally ! I myself aren’t as religious as my parents would like me to be, it’s hard when I have 10000x questions on that topic alone ya know? Right now my babies, are that, still babies. But you’re right, I absolutely must instill the knowledge in them that it’s important to not live in fear and to live for yourself.
