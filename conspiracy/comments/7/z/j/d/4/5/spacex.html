    <div class="md"><p>The same way it applies to everything, since everything is made up of atoms*</p>

<p>Or maybe not, but atoms are a convention we’ve used that has worked to consistently describe and predict the behavior of matter. So even if they aren’t what we think they are, our rules about them still work since 
they are derived from observation of behavior.</p>

<p>The Rutherford-Bohr model is a good example of this type of thing. It says electrons orbit at specific energy levels and describes the way different atoms interact as a result of their electron configuration. We now know that electrons don’t really orbit and exist as more of a probability cloud, but the rules still work and we can still use them to describe or predict behavior.</p>

<p>This applies to most science, it is accepted because it works, and because anyone can verify it themselves if they are willing to put the effort in, and that’s why “science deniers” have never really gained a foothold. If anyone was able to actually disprove something scientifically, they would be congratulated. They haven’t been able to disprove anything though, let alone to propose a new model that offers more accurate predictions.</p>

<p>You can buy a telescope and a prism and test this yourself, and if your experiment results in an anomaly, then you can explain it and people will listen.</p>

<p>But trolling around here asking dumb gotcha questions in the hopes of making yourself feel “woke” won’t do shit. You just look like an idiot who hasn’t had much of an education.</p>

<p>Or maybe I’m mistaken and you’ve published the results of your experiments? If so I’d be interested in seeing that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SpaceX is a fraud just like NASA.  They are supposed to be the &quot;Independent private sector&quot; space agency but they get $ billions  from the tax payers and are closer to a Hollywood agency than a space agency.  </p>

<p>So long story short, to me Elon is just the spokesperson pawn playing the role of the &quot;Iron Man&quot; type character.        </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The same way it applies to everything, since everything is made up of atoms*</p>

<p>Or maybe not, but atoms are a convention we’ve used that has worked to consistently describe and predict the behavior of matter. So even if they aren’t what we think they are, our rules about them still work since 
they are derived from observation of behavior.</p>

<p>The Rutherford-Bohr model is a good example of this type of thing. It says electrons orbit at specific energy levels and describes the way different atoms interact as a result of their electron configuration. We now know that electrons don’t really orbit and exist as more of a probability cloud, but the rules still work and we can still use them to describe or predict behavior.</p>

<p>This applies to most science, it is accepted because it works, and because anyone can verify it themselves if they are willing to put the effort in, and that’s why “science deniers” have never really gained a foothold. If anyone was able to actually disprove something scientifically, they would be congratulated. They haven’t been able to disprove anything though, let alone to propose a new model that offers more accurate predictions.</p>

<p>You can buy a telescope and a prism and test this yourself, and if your experiment results in an anomaly, then you can explain it and people will listen.</p>

<p>But trolling around here asking dumb gotcha questions in the hopes of making yourself feel “woke” won’t do shit. You just look like an idiot who hasn’t had much of an education.</p>

<p>Or maybe I’m mistaken and you’ve published the results of your experiments? If so I’d be interested in seeing that.</p>
