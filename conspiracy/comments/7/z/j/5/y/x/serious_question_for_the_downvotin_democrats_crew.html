       If we ban them the same thing that happened with marijuana prohibition will happen with guns — &amp; it's not like people will forget how to make them by banning them.  So why are democrats yelling about this?  You actually think banning guns will prevent bad people from doing bad things?  Help us understand your point of view here.

       Yes.  Let's ban guns &amp; place more sanctions on Russia.  This will ensure they never envade us.  CNN has said daily for over a year they are our biggest threat &amp; now we should ban firearms while tensions between US democrats &amp; Russia continue to escalate.

       I have to watch CNN at work every day in a red state in a red county.  The right deals with it because when they tried to put Fox News on the TV's the liberals we work with lose their shit.  This is reality.  Its not some made up shit.  I can prove this with a pic tomorrow if you want.

       In case you havent noticed throughout human history we continue to come up with more creative ways to kill each other &amp; the result of that is that the world is now much safer than its ever been.  Life expectancy has increased significantly.  When you figure out a full proof way of preventing bad people from doing bad things share it with the rest of us because it would truly be a significant development in our evolution - if it requires that a mandatory computer chip be fused with my brain stem then i'm gonna have to go with a HARD no on that option.

       Arm the teachers that are comfortable with firearms.  Arm every entrance &amp; make it so nobody can just walk in.  We can use part of the Pentagon's budget to do that at every fucking school.  But banning shit really is not that effective.  End of conversation.  What we got yesterday is a bunch of liberals trying to blaim republicans for something that is almost impossible to stop.  I dont see europe trying to make every car slower so muslims cant run them the fuck over...

       Wait so are we fearing government overreach or empowering everybody in self defense in fear of ill-intentioned citizens? Well whatever reason, it's based on fear, right? Fear is a powerful motivator and can fuel narratives well. If you think owning guns would protect you from a "government overreach" I think you are being naive about the strength of our military.

       I'm British, so It's not my monkey etc.... But the only people I see who ever talk about banning all guns are gun advocates. I have yet to see any liberal call for all guns to be banned. I see them calling for military assault rifles to be banned, but how does that become 'All' guns in your mind. Genuinely curious.

       So your problem is that Obama didn't enact resolutions to ban bumpstocks during his term? Because I totally agree with that. I don't know if he would have had the support necessary, but not at least trying was cowardly and immoral to not at least try while he had the chance to.

       Check out this semi-automatic 12 gauge shotgun! Under these proposed “assault weapons” bans, this would still be legal. As it is, you don’t need to file any additional paperwork for this gun.

       AR-15’s fire a .223 round which is smaller and lighter and does less damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       If these school shooters were going for substance over style, they would carry one of these.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, most handguns over 9mm (the most popular) have a much bigger caliber than the AR-15 and they’re easier to conceal. The Glock 9 has a 17 round capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don’t see how banning AR-15’s is going to do a damn bit of good. They’re are plenty of deadlier guns on the market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stating that “we don’t care if hunters have guns” is disingenuous. First they take the “assault weapons” and then they come for the rest.

       Not really. An ar-15 with 100 round drum (yes illegal, easy to modify smaller ones tho) modified to shoot fully auto.

       The ATF is under control of the Executive Branch &amp; if Trump is working with the same agencies to get them banned then Obama could have done the same but didnt.  Terrible logic to in some way say Trump &amp; Obama held the same position &amp; Trump is doing something about it but Obama didnt have the ability to do the same thing.

       The all guns part comes from the actual bills they try to pass banning assault rifles. Theres been quite a few different ones, but the ones that get weight and get close usually start off by redefining "assault gun" as any gun(pistol or not) that discharges the shell of the bullet fired and loads the next round. Which pretty much excludes only musket rifles, and manual load shotguns. Hell that definition includes bb guns.

       You want to talk about this? I could actually care less if a Russian has an opinion or if he shares it with you. I don't think bad of Russians, but their government is now accused of gaining access to private emails owned by DWS.

       Now you're just creating arguments for yourself to defeat ore something. What do we do if we take away all the guns and Russia attacks us? Uh... we let our fucking military destroy them and the entire world to try to protect this land, duh! No one wants or needs you to pick up a rifle ever. We need you to crank some gears and get this machine rolling.

       Have you even seen our president get all chipper and happy to talk about Putin? "He called me a genius". It's a "conspiracy theory" that Donald Trump is a Russian stooge, which is easily not true if there is no kompromat from his visits to Russia. One thing we don't want is a liberal conspiracy theorizing, amirite? Or else they might put an innocent man into prison for treason. They only doing it for revenge because the right literally calls everything treason like McCarthy were all of their last names.

       What a strawman. I'm not a 'downvotin democrat' , but be real with your argument. The majority of the argument wants restrictions on certain weapons and how they are obtained, not an outright ban on all guns. Claiming the argument is 'ban all guns' is the same as the 'downvoting democrats' claiming the other side wants AR-15s and handguns in the hands of every schoolchild. Both are strawmen arguments that only represent a very small (if any) fraction of the debate on either side.

       The entire post is about an anti-gun kid that has been on TV for the last week says "guns are bad" &amp; accusing people questioning that kid of being a Russian(the lefts biggest enemy) peddling pro-gun far right propaganda.  If you think thats a strawman or moving the goal post that is quite simply just bad logic.

       No, you're moving the goal posts from your original argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Originally you said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        if we ban all the guns in the US
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And implied the 'downvoting democrats' held that belief. That's a strawman argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       You moved the goal posts from 'ban all the guns in the US' to 'Russia threat &amp; gun control'. Those two are not equivalent. I.e. moving the goalposts.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, your original argument was against a strawman, and the link you posted was moving the goalposts from your original argument.

MY wife and I shoot trap and skeet my son is a good rifle marksman... but we do not own an AR-15, there is no reason to own such a weapon.   I did have a Mini 14 which I recently sold (to a gun shop).  Useless for hunting, not very accurate - there was really no point in owning it either.

       Yes.  Let's ban guns &amp; place more sanctions on Russia.  This will ensure they never envade us.  CNN has said daily for over a year they are our biggest threat &amp; now we should ban firearms while tensions between US democrats &amp; Russia continue to escalate.

       Nobody has a problem with you having a hunting rifle or a shotgun. They're driven by fear and fueled by decades of insane right wing rhetoric.

       US Liberals CLAIM they want to ban assault rifles but they had 8 years of their savior Obama &amp; all he did is make them more powerful.  Their alleged support of banning assault rifles is nothing more than pandering to their uneducated supporters -

       Stop? The Russians? Who thinks worse of Russians? Me or you? Do you really think the Russians are just geared up any moment to invade us?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you even seen our president get all chipper and happy to talk about Putin? "He called me a genius". It's a "conspiracy theory" that Donald Trump is a Russian stooge, which is easily not true if there is no kompromat from his visits to Russia. One thing we don't want is a liberal conspiracy theorizing, amirite? Or else they might put an innocent man into prison for treason. They only doing it for revenge because the right literally calls everything treason like McCarthy were all of their last names.

       The all guns part comes from the actual bills they try to pass banning assault rifles. Theres been quite a few different ones, but the ones that get weight and get close usually start off by redefining "assault gun" as any gun(pistol or not) that discharges the shell of the bullet fired and loads the next round. Which pretty much excludes only musket rifles, and manual load shotguns. Hell that definition includes bb guns.
