       Every single time, it is announced that there will be a drill that day. What are the theories surrounding why this happens? I think this is a huge red flag
      </p>
      <p>
       Also does anyone have a compiled list of all shootings/crises that coincided with a drill? It would be really interesting to see that

       By having the drill prevents questions of certain prep work.  It also allows for authorities and media to be ready.  If you orchestrate something it takes multiple agencies involved.  The sheriff has been involved in 2 mass shooting events and he has deep state ties

       The drill itself gives an excuse to have all those people there ready to go for camera action.

       Was just about to say this, you beat me to the punch. Same deal with the Twin Towers, they turned the power and security off the weekend before 9/11.

       People also forget in all these events the FBI had tips.  I mean shit, the Ft Lauderdale shooter walked into the FBI and told them he was going to kill people and they still did nothing.  Not to mention this event alone at 32 tips.  Time to hold them accountable and stop blaming guns.

       Or, the Feds get tips, find their patsies, post up nearby, and aim their MK Ultra "Voices in Your Head" tech, and let em rip. By now they got the tech mastered, so you figure they now how long it takes for the voices to do their work:

       I worked right up the street from the twin towers.  They didn't turn the power off over the weekend there.  They couldn't and wouldn't.  It's not like the place was just open from 9 to 5 or something.
      </p>

       Many of the businesses there were open late, on off hours, and especially on weekends - including a restaurant at the top one of the towers.  They would lose incalculable amounts of money by shutting down the power to the twin towers for 36 hours!  This assertion is completely ridiculous to anyone who has lived in the area.

        I worked right up the street from the twin towers. They didn't turn the power off over the weekend there. They couldn't and wouldn't. It's not like the place was just open from 9 to 5 or something.
       </p>

      <p>
       That's not proof. You worked down the street from there so you know for sure? What the heck is this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where you actually in the building that weekend or not? Because there are witnesses who were and they state the power was turned off. I'll take witnesses over someone who was down the street, any day of the week

       <p>
        Police swarmed St. Rose of Lima School on Church Hill Road in Newtown Friday afternoon, hours after the shooting at nearby Sandy Hook Elementary School.
       </p>
       <p>
        Neil Curry, whose 11-year-old son Kevin is in fifth grade at the school, said the school was put in lock down three times during the day. Curry said a person was found “lurking” outside a kindergarten class room. Later, an “agitated” person was reported inside the St. Rose of Lima Church near the school.
       </p>
       <p>
        At 3 p.m., a police officer in charge of the scene said everything was under control.

       Canadian airspace I believe? But there were drills in the States as well. Heck, FEMA was in NYC the day before the event for guess what? A scheduled drill.

       You  won't convince him their willing to lie themselves for people to believe their theories their was a fire drill, and the red drill was planned for a later date they would never drop something that important on teachers hours after but of course no, 
 it's not kids with opinions I don't agree with its shills, and liberals controlling the media now I'm going to keep saying we want to have a discussion while disagreeing with people with points that aren't attacking children or spreading fake news, and claiming their shills.

       If they do in fact get busted on their fakery the drill allows and excuse for faking the shooting.  They can say “oh well we needed to make it as real as possible for training purposes”.  I think one of the students interviewed actually said they thought it was a drill.  The drill is scheduled on same day for backup purposes in the event that they get caught trying to pull off false flag.

       The purpose of the drills timed to go along with the false flag event is that if bystanders, especially law enforcement bystanders witness something, they can be told, don't worry it's just a drill. So the teachers
       <em>
        being told that day
       </em>
       to expect a drill would serve this same function as officially having a drill go on during the shooting.

       Can you cite a single source where a school, for the sake of “[making] it as real as possible for training purposes,” had a drill that brought in someone with an armed weapon? It’s such a far-fetched idea that the “training” would have ever been approved to the point of coming to fruition. Do have any idea of how school administration functions as a collective?

      <p>
       He didn't say anything about bringing a real weapon to a drill to make it as real as possible. What he said may not totally add up, but not in the way you dug at it. The rest of you questions are pretty far off base and seem like you are trying to out words in his mouth and missing the point he tried to make at the same time.

       Because a majority of the "drills" aren't actually at the event, but rather within 200+ miles surrounding the event. Given how important preparedness is, it's not all that uncommon. I can guantee there's a scheduled drill within 200 miles of your location.

       Ted Gunderson, a man who served as the head of the FBI in Los Angeles, Memphis, and Dallas, consecutively over a period of thirty years, eventually turned whistleblower and was quoted as saying that most terrorist attacks in the USA are perpetrated by the CIA.

       I personally think that agencies have ran thier course. They were nessisary at one time but now it looks like a way to circumnavigation the people and our alleged representative.

       From a leftist perspective, they are actually doing what they are designed to do- protect private property and profits of the elite minority. FDA doesn't protect you from Bit Pharma, they protect big pharma from you. NSA doesn't protect you from the government, it protects the government from you. That's what government is supposed to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't own capital- the government and its agencies were never supposed to represent you. These conversations are very well documented at the constitutional convention. Just a little insight for ya

       I hear you but I don't believe in the liberal vs conservative or left vs right paradigms. Those labels only serve as ways for the unaware to circumnavigation actually discussing the issues. That is divide and conquer and you are falling for it.

       It is really those that have power vs the rest of us.

       It would be easier and make a far shorter list to name any mass shootings/terrorist events where there wasn't some kind of a drill simultaneously taking place, either right on the scene or very close to it nearby and practising for the very same kind of event that actually happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       That bizarre little narrative is so damned consistent we could really say that it sets all those crimes apart from just about any and all others.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like first responders aren't schooled or don't know how to co-operate or don't do practice runs and training drills when they aren't dealing with the real thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is different is that since 9/11 tons of money and national plans have been steadily rolled-out hiring tons of people and even disrupting all kinds of normal activities to stage these all these fake events.

       I'd like to see a list of all attacks that coincide with drills on the same day and location. On further investigation, the list is limitted to boston bombing and 9/11.

       There was no drill on the day of this Florida shooting. It was scheduled for later that month. Same with Sandy hook, the drill wasn't even at the same school, it was at a nearby school

       There was a drill ongoing not 5 minutes away from the Aurora Theatre shooting which is why Holmes was so quickly arrested and a series of active shooter drills that overlapped the South Carolina church shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 7/7 London subway/bus bombings took place right at the very same time a drill practicing for that very event was in progress on the transit system.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a drill on the same day as the Paris attack, and again on the same day in the Barcelona train station when that one took place. Also one in progress during the Oslo terrorist shoot-up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The kids at the Florida school had a fire drill only a few hours before the alarm went off again and you clearly haven't looked into anything at all or else you'd know all that just for openers.

        Cruz quite literally knew the drill when it came to active shooters and understood that the lockdown procedure would go into effect the moment gunshots were heard. He certainly did not want to find himself wandering suddenly deserted hallways, trying to force his way through locked doors.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So Cruz seems to have hatched a two-part scheme to thwart the well-rehearsed lockdown plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       He began by waiting until just five minutes before the 2:35 p.m. dismissal time.
      </p>
      <p>
       He then pulled a fire alarm.
      </p>
      <p>
       The timing likely made it more difficult for the school to order and maintain a complete lockdown. He was able to kill 12 inside the school, along with another two just outside and one on the street. Three more died in the hospital.

       Yeah the fire alarm exploit needs to be worked on. There was another shooting a decade or so ago where kids pulled the fire alarm and then fired on kids as they came outside from a treeline.

      <p>
       Lockdown? Okay lets pull this fire alarm and the herd comes out. That is fail.

       Broward County, a democrat hotbed, kids seemed ready to meet the media hours after the shooting, pushing an agenda.

       We have a coward security deputy that doesn't do anything. There just happened to be a drill that day.

       Live Drills were also run on 9/11. Air Traffic Control didnt know at first if what they were hearing was real or part of the drill. The drill was for, wait for it, hijacked airplanes. Shit, that's one helluva coincidence.

       It's in the Draco handbook to complete a simulation you must have tested the simulation in a similar setting before carrying out an action as commanded by THərˈtēn. It's easy to see how recent news translates into the reptilian plan of human hybridization between the attack in florida, Nikki Haley going to the middle east and even the olympic games, which at this point is just a full out competition between variations on human-extraterrestrial hybrids.

       In the context of the mass shooting, bullets are used to collect large samples of dna. The surface is coated with a nano-fiber membrane capable of analysis and transmission of nucleic information but it can only do so by turning kinetic energy into electrical impulses after being fired from a weapon. (You can see why a portion of the population wants more guns = more DNA samples) This data is then stored locally on the planet between trips from emissaries from Draco.

       Not all emergency responders are involved or in the 'knowing', so they have to confuse many of the emergency responders to avoid a mess up in their plans. This is what happened with NORAD on 9/11

        By having the drill prevents questions of certain prep work. It also allows for authorities and media to be ready. If you orchestrate something like this it takes multiple agencies to be involved.

       Was just about to say this, you beat me to the punch. Same deal with the Twin Towers, they turned the power and security off the weekend before 9/11.

       The was an active shooter drill at a school right down the street from Sandyhook called St. Rosa Lima. MSM actually used aerial footage from that drill running it as Sandyhook.

       The drill wasn't actually going on that day. Teachers were told that there might be a drill at some point that month, but the day hadn't been announced. I'm not sure your logic actually applies here
