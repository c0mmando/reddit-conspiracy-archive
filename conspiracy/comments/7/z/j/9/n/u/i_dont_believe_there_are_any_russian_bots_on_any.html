    <div class="md"><p>Why is the story about what the “Russians” apparently did, not what they uncovered? It wasn’t the Russians to begin with, it was Wikileaks, who got their information from Seth Rich, who was murdered for it. Instead of this being the story, and the story being about what the emails actually uncovered, the story became that the Russians interfered in our election.....when the media starts actually reporting about what actually happened, that’s when I will believe the cia and fbi. The emails release by wikileaks(not Russia) uncovered that Hillary collided with the DNC, is bought and paid for. It also uncovered Obama was bought and paid for. The story is, our country is so corrupt that our votes don’t count. We don’t decide the final runners. But to distract us, they created a narrative where Russia is somehow responsible for trump being elected. The fact that everyone on Reddit somehow forgot all the events leading up to the election, and forgot who actually release the emails, tells me that this narrative is definitely false. They haven’t shown us Russia’s “troll factory” or any actually posts from Russian accounts with evidence that the post was somehow orchestrated by the Russians. There is far more evidence to the contrary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you think that this is all targeted harassment towards the Donald Trump team. That&#39;s fair to say, right? That there are far greater crimes committed by Hillary and Obama and the DNC .... the real story is the e-mails, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I’m not sure. It’s probably just going to stop being reported after a while and everyone will move into the next distraction. Some people will be blamed but it won’t be any actual Russian government organizations. Trump will keep his presidency until the next election, where we will vote in a woman, probably African American. But the presidency doesn’t even matter because that’s just a distraction as well. President don’t actually make any choices, everything they do is thought out in advance by actual global leaders who have been in power for centuries. </p>

<p>So what would you consider evidence towards identity fraud and bank fraud?</p>

<p>Cause they presented:</p>

<ul>
<li>leaked communications with conspirators</li>
<li>stolen bank accounts</li>
<li>exact advertisements purchased</li>

<li>indentities stolen that were used to purchase online advertisements</li>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<p>But the Russian troll farms were composed of a lot more than just &#39;Twitter bots&#39;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Internet Research Agency operated what&#39;s become known as &quot;troll farm&quot; in Russian President Vladimir Putin&#39;s hometown that employed hundreds of English speakers to pose as Americans and gin up controversy and discord on Twitter, Facebook and other social media websites during the months leading up to the election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah, of course. But that doesn&#39;t really get right at what I&#39;m saying. There&#39;s still news that the news stations reports. The CIA still does legitimate, well intended, moral intelligence work. That doesn&#39;t preclude the news from getting notes from Washington on what they want to say and how to say it (this actually happened to a former broadcaster on msnbc) or the CIA from selling drugs, or anything. But when you <em>always</em> take the opposite side from the mass message - the &quot;mainstream&quot; take, you&#39;re being just as close-minded as the people you claim are sheep. </p>

<p>Conservative writer Mark Pantano also tweeted that his account had been affected. “Twitter&#39;s attack was not just a purge of bot accounts. Proof: My account was locked. No reasonable person can say my account is a bot account. All original content. I hardly even retweet. This was an attack on Conservatives under the guise of a bot purge.”</p>

I have a number of different personal websites and others that I run/host for friends.

<p>If my completely uninteresting websites are being hit they are definitely targetting larger websites like Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, etc.</p>

<p>But there are definitely foreign actors posting astroturf on the Internet too. For the same reason bad actors in the USA do it. To influence public opinion, to push your agenda. I wouldn&#39;t say the insanity the media is attempting to foment is appropriate, but it&#39;d be foolish to think that there aren&#39;t shills pushing foreign agendas too.

    <div class="md"><p>Why is the story about what the “Russians” apparently did, not what they uncovered? It wasn’t the Russians to begin with, it was Wikileaks, who got their information from Seth Rich, who was murdered for it. Instead of this being the story, and the story being about what the emails actually uncovered, the story became that the Russians interfered in our election.....when the media starts actually reporting about what actually happened, that’s when I will believe the cia and fbi. The emails release by wikileaks(not Russia) uncovered that Hillary collided with the DNC, is bought and paid for. It also uncovered Obama was bought and paid for. The story is, our country is so corrupt that our votes don’t count. We don’t decide the final runners. But to distract us, they created a narrative where Russia is somehow responsible for trump being elected. The fact that everyone on Reddit somehow forgot all the events leading up to the election, and forgot who actually release the emails, tells me that this narrative is definitely false. They haven’t shown us Russia’s “troll factory” or any actually posts from Russian accounts with evidence that the post was somehow orchestrated by the Russians. There is far more evidence to the contrary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I’m not sure. It’s probably just going to stop being reported after a while and everyone will move into the next distraction. Some people will be blamed but it won’t be any actual Russian government organizations. Trump will keep his presidency until the next election, where we will vote in a woman, probably African American. But the presidency doesn’t even matter because that’s just a distraction as well. President don’t actually make any choices, everything they do is thought out in advance by actual global leaders who have been in power for centuries. </p>
