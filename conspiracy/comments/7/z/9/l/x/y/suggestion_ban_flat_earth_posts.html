       I never advocate censorship, but there has been a consistent and obvious trend in the rise of FE posts when anything substantial is happening in the news which might draw "normies" to this sub to see what conspiracy users are discussing and what information is being posted on the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems clear that the correlated increase in FE posts is an effort to discredit the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am happy with the reduction in shitposting that the submission statement rule has resulted in, and i think if the goal is to actually attract the attention of more "normies" to redpill, then shutting down the FE posts is the next logical step.
      </p>
      <p>
       I take no issue with hollow earth posts or anything similar. They are not my personal beliefs, but thats not what this sub is about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing instantly destroys this sub's credibility like a bunch of posts about the earth being flat, which is quite easily disproven with some very simple science.
      </p>
      <p>
       The earth is obviously not flat. I think we can safely call this one debunked.

       Flat earth is a psy-op to discredit, by proximity, anyone questioning the official narratives.

       However, we should not ban it, because it's a slippery slope.

       Who benefits from flat earth? It's those who wish to discredit "conspiracy theorists". It also distracts people and wastes their energy.

       <em>
        Why would you visit THAT website? They have daily posts about that flat earth nonsense, therefore they're obviously just a bunch of crackpots who can safely be dismissed.

       Also, the fingerprint of shill movements and psy-ops are much different from organic movements. For one, organic movements generally don't spring up virtually overnight, with a huge amount of content.

       Who benefits from telling people that the planet that they live on is round when it is really flat? The elite who don't want you to know the truth about who we are. If earth was flat and everything revolved around us, we would start to view ourselves and our planet as being a lot more special than viewing ourselves as an accident. It is a way to prevent people from becoming spiritual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your idea to ban flat Earth discussion is completely ignorant and it is clear you have not put in any effort or research into the topic before coming to this idiotic conclusion.

       This is exactly my point. There are not regular posts about FE. They surge when there is a wikileaks dump, or PG or any of the other big stories that break and then there are none for weeks. Its obvious what the reason is.

       I understand your point. I just think it's dangerous to go down the censorship road, because not all psy-ops are as obvious as flat earth, and it's also a good opportunity to educate people about this issue instead of sweeping it under the rug.

       I find it hilarious that you can not just state the "very simple science" that leads you to believe this topics is "debunked" and should be banned?  Can you just admit that you have never researched the subject and you got called out on your bs?

       The only argument you made is discussion on the subject should be banned because "very simple science" says so.  I predicted that the flawed 2000 year old Eratosthenes experiment would be your only "proof" and I was correct.  If you have thoroughly researched the subject why do you still believe in a spinning ball earth?  What was the main evidence that made you decide that the subject should be banned because it was so obvious we live on a ball?

       Its really not the only proof. How does an eclipse work in your opinion? Why are there extended periods of day and night opposing at each of the poles? Why are some stars visible in australia right now that arent visible in the north? Why is it summer im australia and winter in the north? What causes the corealis effect?
      </p>

       You're proving my point. You are ignoring anything you cant explain with a flat earth model, and barking that i havent looked into or that i am ignorant and i have no evidence.

       No you are proving my point.  If you are bringing up the Coriolis effect then you haven't researched the subject for yourself.  Why can't you just admit that?  You want to ban the discussion on a subject that you have not studied.  There is no reason for me to spend a bunch of time going back and forth with someone that close  minded.

       OMG..  If you had researched it you would know that the direction the water spins down a drain has to do with the angle it is poured and not from the "Coriolis effect" Also storms do not always spin in the same direction from northern and southern "hemispheres".  How would that be possible if the effect was from a spinning earth?

       What about the part of the comment where I told you why the Coriolis Effect can not be caused by the earth spinning and even linked to a video explaining it to you.  I guess I'll repost it since you thought your spelling error was the best argument I made.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        OMG.. If you had researched it you would know that the direction the water spins down a drain has to do with the angle it is poured and not from the "Coriolis effect" Also storms do not always spin in the same direction from northern and southern "hemispheres". How would that be possible if the effect was from a spinning earth?

      <p>
       I didn't even mention the spelling until you kept spelling it wrong all while trying to pretend that you've actually researched if the earth spinning really causes the effect.  So funny/sad that someone can be so brainwashed they actually want to ban a topic from discussion that they have never even personally researched for themselves.

      <p>
       If you had researched this topic for years like many of us then you would realize how infested the movement is with shills trying to suppress organic dialogue.  There are literally multiple subreddits set up to do nothing but combat and stalk people that try to have an open discussion about the subject.  They do this every single day and have been for several years now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science should be observable, measurable, and repeatable.  How can FE be a psy-op if you stick to scientific discussion?  If we really live on a spinning ball earth people shouldn't be afraid to provide evidence if that believe is put to question
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S.  Don't get me wrong there are tons of psy-op flat earthers to discredit the actual movement but the real psy-op is NASA and blindly trusting them to give us our belief system.

       Have you ever considered the possibility that it could be both? A psy-op to condition people away from the truth? Hear me out because I agree with what you are saying, it really did blow up out of nowhere. But the media is what enforces psy-ops and there is strategy behind what they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you recall Obama's speech over the subject? Of all important things for our nation to be addressing, the most iconic leader in the world suddenly argues "We don't have time for a meeting with the flat earth society." This in my opinion is the real psy-op, for a few reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Why is our leader wasting his time talking about this?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) This tells everyone we have zero priority to even reconsider what we believe about the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Automatically categorizes those who don't believe in a globe model into the "Flat Earth Society." A controlled opposition that throws absurd claims out there with zero proof, like the ground is accelerating upwards. No real flat earth believer believes this. Real flat earth people simply point out the lack of proof from anyone that isn't nasa.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Those who don't believe in the globe automatically think the earth is flat. A belief from medieval times, where it is taught people used to believe you could sail off the earth and die. A laughable belief. Who wants to be laughed at? No real flat earth person believes you'll fall off the edge.
      </p>
      <p>
       What led me back to flat earth was my conclusion that we didn't go to the moon, satellites are only weather balloons, and we have no real photo of our entire planet. Perhaps its just literally impossible to get high enough to capture the entire surface at such a wide angle. They have more to gain from preaching the globe model, and building rockets. 5 trillion dollars. People assume a company with that much money would never use CGI. Its all business and for money and control. We are a nation with no perception of the heavens that trusts its own people.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, the psy-op is real, but the more I look at it, it looks like a psy-op goes both ways. You believe the globe psy-op, or you believe the flat earth psy-op. Where real flat earth believers stand is neither, because we just simply believe we are not on a ball in nothing.

       There is clear evidence of concerted efforts by various 3 letter organizations to try to discredit conspiracy research, most notably by the CIA, who tried to make the very term "conspiracy theorist" synonymous with being crazy.

       As more and more conspiracies are proven true, it is easier to discredit us with Ad hominem attacks because FE gets lumped in as a conspiracy theory, than to actually refute our evidence of real and provable conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The beliefs of those i have seen seriously arguing the validity of flat earth are usually rooted in religion, so they will mention various bible verse, or the existence of the firmament as evidence of the earth's flatness.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all good and fine, but unless they are referring to the van allen radiation belt as the firmament, its safe to say there is not a dome enclosing us on a flat earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       A verse from a book which has been edited, translated, edited, and translated again over a thousand years is not evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have yet to see any convincing information to explain FE's opinions on tides, the corealis effect, time zones, foucault's pendulum, line of sight, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact i can conjure not a single bit of evidence from FE that has posed a serious problem for scientific explanation.

       It means after something is hypothesized, tested, and the results are tested and repeated, we can call it a theory.

       Your arrogance is hysterical. Ready to get schooled?

       We have the LAW of density and the LAW of buoyancy which you are confusing with the THEORY of gravity. The LAWS of density and buoyancy are tests that are repeated and proven.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gravity remains a THEORY because there is no test that has proven that the mass of an object can attract a smaller object. Gravity is just a theory that attempts to explain why the LAWS of buoyancy and density exist.

       Gravity is a theory because we havent discovered the mechanism. No one is stopping alt scientists from creating their own model, hell its encouraged. The problem is no other theory comes even close to explaining the observations we see. Nothing, not EM, sure as hell not buoyancy and even acceleration has issues.

       Actually, the theory for gravity has not held up, the theory is full of holes. That's why "science is constantly evolving" (unlike humanity) to come up with better anwsers for the "naysayers".

       Gravity doesn't scale up and doesn't scale down. Quantum mechanics and gravity is no bueno, they have to invent quantum gravity to make it work.

       I have looked into it, and i have read the arguments on both sides, not just those debunking it. My research is not reflected by what i post; there are a number of people on this thread arguing for FE who have never actually made any posts of any kind on this sub, and yet here they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest issue with FE is that if you don't agree, everyone says you haven't looked into it, or that you don't understand. So there is no real discussion anyway.

       He won't respond to anyone who points out his flawed logic. He doesn't even understand the difference between the LAWS of buoyancy and density, and the THEORY of gravity. The fact that he does not even understand these basic principles is a crystal clear sign that he is nowhere near educated enough to make the bold "flat Earth is obviously a psy op" comments that only dumbass shills default to

       Except it had held up. The Cavendish experiment has been repeated multiple times with controlled variables, showing consistent results every time. We've used gravity to predict the movement of planets and to use gravity to slingshot satellites around.

       We've known the precise movement of the planets way before the concept of gravity was even around. Plenty of ancient cultures figured out the cycles of the planets and stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Supertankers can't get too close to one another because they're supertankers lol. They're massive boats with massive amounts of intertia (aka immovable object/unstoppable force). Them colliding, even at slight speed and favorable angle, would involve massive forces, and thus massive damage. It simply makes sense to keep these boats away from eachother. Nothing to do with gravity lol.
       <em>
        Gravity
       </em>
       requires alot more mass than just a "tiny" tanker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gravity did not hold up. When Hubble was launched (somewhere in the 90's i think) deep space data (the first of it's kind) showed that galaxies were moving at vastle different speeds than previous predicted. Hence why dark matter was invented, because gravity alone "couldn't cut it".
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure if you assume dark matter (something we can't detect by any means within the electromagnetic spectrum) is real
       <em>
        -which is pseuo-science by definition
       </em>
       , then gravity held up. There's plenty of mainstream science which says dark matter is bullshit, google it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So since we're in conspiracy land, we can assume it
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       bullshit, so we can also say the theory of gravity has no held up for things on the largest of scales.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similar, within quantum mechanics, there is no room for gravity. All of Cavendish and Newton's experiments fall flat and become useless. That's why quantum mechanics is a "seperate package" within physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Einstein knew all of this, he tried to unify them mathematically but never succeeded, yada yada all that.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for:

        "Just because there are some things we don't know of yet"
       </em>

      <p>
       A flat Earther can't even dream of this being a viable anwser.

       <em>
        What about satellites?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's be honest: if a Flat Earther doesn't have every single anwser to every single question, the theory gets called out for being bullshit.

       And we used those observations to form our theory of gravity. We've used it to extremely accurately predict the motions of comets and satellites.

       And they can't get too close because...gravity.
       <br/>
       Not because of "inertia". If they're travelling PARALLEL to eachother the lower friction of water + combined gravitational pull means they're pulled together.
       <br/>
       That is gravity. I think you've misunderstood what I  said.

      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What exactly does that have to do with gravity?
       <br/>
       It has nothing at all tondo with gravity. Galaxies can move independent of each other. They can move away or toward each other, gravity is irrelevant to the equation. Gravity simply has nothing to do with the movement of galaxies - do you have any idea how far apart they are?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, Dark Matter is a proposed method to explain the expansion of the universe. It doesn't suddenly make gravity irrelevant. Gravity is still here and works exactly the way we predicted it should.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure if you just misunderstand what gravity is or are just being intellectually dishonest, which most flat earthers seem to be.

      <p>
       How exactly has it not?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is absolutely no evidence behind that at all. The motion of the planets, the movement of comets and satellites, the repeatable and consistent Cavendish experiment proves that gravity has indeed held up. I think you should do more reading, the expansion of the universe has nothing to do with gravity.

       Who mentioned eclipses? But yes, if flat earthers can't explain basic concepts that the globe already perfectly explains, the "theory" is bullshit, not like it didn't already have a million reasons for being bullshit anyway.

       It really came out of nowhere with very professional quality content. Usually at first you see some guy in a basement slamming footage together with shitty edits. A lot of the flat earth stuff just looks too good. Plus the content seems to get a lot of up votes quicker than other content.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at pizzagate videos and memes you can tell it is just regular folks putting information out there. The thing the psy-ops fail at over and over is the guts of content. You can manipulate the votes, you can have professionals producing, you can do everything but make it "ring true".
      </p>
      <p>
       I like the flat earth posts and other obvious bullshit here because the top comments usually show great thinkers picking the theories apart. The only way to combat that is to heavily downvote the rebuttals, which is telling in itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best way to combat schills and psy-ops here is to keep doing our thing. Don't compromise on principle, stay calm, and refute with logic and facts. That way if you see someone with emotional reactions trying to sow discord they stick out as an outsider.

       Electorate. The fact that both parties are hopelessly implicated means the electorate is broken. I think we the people have to take it where it should go in any supposedly democratic polity. There needs to be a conspiracy party (with some better name than that) effectively challenging these issues at the voting place. 50% of the people don't accept 9/11 and are willing to say so.

       i did.  who gives a fuck about the "credibility" of this sub.  your entire argument spits in the face of what we do here. so, again, it doesnt matter what you think is "debunked" and it doesnt matter if other people think conspiracy theorists are nutty, crazy, or un-credible.  thats kind of the nature of these things.

       I understand the frustration with the content over the past year, but the story is a conspiracy to undermine a democratic election in the supposed "most free nation ever." So its big news.

       The submission statement on this sub has been effective at lowering shitposting. All posts without one are deleted. This is censorship, and in this example it worked. The word shill has effectively been banned when used in an accusatory manner on this sub. This and the removal of any blatant insults was done to prevent useless bickering and fighting that clogs up the comments section. This is censorship.

       There is not a single good argument that revolves around flat earth (pun intended), nor is there a single good explanation of who the fuck would benefit by lying about the earth being round if it were indeed flat.

       "No its not. What group of people is being silenced by requiring a submission statement? What idea or belief is destroyed when we require submission statements?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Weak ideas and intellectually dishonest beliefs are being silenced by submission statements. Shitposters who dont care enough to argue their point is the group that is being silenced. They shitpost, they refuse to respond constructively to comments and they degrade the content of the sub. Just like flat earthers. Any attempt at actual debate is met with "prove to me without nasa science..." or they ignore the multitudes of questions you present them with and they tell you "you havent looked into it."
      </p>
      <p>
       Read through the comments on this posts and you'll see what i mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nasa is not without its controversies, but i assure you that the science they use is the same science everyone else in the scientific community is using.
      </p>
      <p>
       So demanding i not use "mainstream nasa science" in my arguments is like saying "tell me without using language why you're right"

       How is that censorship? Why does a submission statement invalidate a weak idea? Or even an intellectually dishonest one? Does the mods even remove weak posts with a statement?

       So what you are in effect saying is that there is no evidence outside of govt funded groups that show the earth is round. Perfect. All I was looking for you to say. I also don't believe the earth is flat, but I don't go around saying "oh it's debunked" because of something NASA says. Open your eyes a little more.

       I can prove this if you go outside, put a stick in the ground and take a picture. Upload the picture. I will do the same thing at the same time, and if the earth is flat our stick shadows will be in the same position (or if we are very close to each other)
      </p>
      <p>
       If not, the earth is at very least round-ish.

       It is kind of infuriating how ignorant you are. Take two pens or pencils, stand them both up on a completely flat surface but have them separated. Now take your cell phone flashlight and position your flashlight above one of the pencils. Does the second pencil have the same shadow?

       By your logic I just proved the earth is flat.

       Do the experiment. Youre referring to Eratosthenes of Cyrene which attempts to measure the circumference of the earth by comparing the shadow of a stick in Cyrene and Alexandria. Carl Sagan is famous for demonstrating the experiment on a piece of paper that he rolls up. He shows how when flat, both sticks have no shadow, but when he curls the paper, one stick has a shadow while the other does not, therefore "proving" the earth is round.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there is a MASSIVE flaw in the experiment and that is assuming that the sun is 90 million plus miles away. In the flat Earth theory, the sun is estimated to be much closer to the earth. If you take the flat Earth model (the experiment I just told you to recreate with objects which are readily available) you can see that two sticks can cast dramatically different shadows at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carl Sagan could have just as easily demonstrated my experiment and boldly proclaim that the Earth is definitively flat and the sun is not 90 million miles away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do yourself a favor and do some actual research before trying to discredit a topic that you know NOTHING about.

       If you have traveled east or west in your car to a different state, you will see that the sun rises at different times. If the earth were flat, it would rise at the same time unless we, at a bare minimum, live on a convex earth. If you travel from the US to england, guess what, 5hrs+ difference to the sun rise. Coincidentally, this aligns with the information provided on your globe. So now you have an extremely convex earth. It stands to reason, if you can continue your travels, you will eventually come back to your starting place. That is, if you don't die from stupidity along the way.

       It starts with FE, then we ban hollow earth, then whatever else people deem too fringe. Its a slippery slope. If anything for this sub I would say ban politics and create a sub dedicated to it.

       There is debatable evidence for hollow earth, i suppose that's the difference.

       And i agree that perhaps the remedy is to create a separate sub for political conspiracy and ban politics, but either way there is still a ban... classic sophies choice.

       I've tried going to the other conspiracy subs ore often to change it up, and its also nice seeing users who have been here for a while try to keep the sub true to its form with fringe stuff but it seems to get buried.

       I agree. It gets downvoted or there is almost nothing worth reading. What's frustrating is the majority of people posting "what happened to this sub?" have never actually contributed any posts of their own, they just bitch about content being all political.

       Please. I miss the real shit. This is where I learned about the 432hz theory, a lot about the truth of religion (I came to my own personal conclusions on beliefs based on content here). The real shit that affects us as humans. Talking about politics is like talking about tv shows here. We all know it’s just a show to distract us and keep us in fear so we don’t do anything to change. I loved entertaining the humor of some topics like lizard people and flat earth. I lean more towards certain beliefs about them but I’m open to being proven otherwise. This sub with that old good content made me change focus in my life to better myself. We need that back

       Yes, i did. And I repeat, what’s the harm of flat earth posts? Who the fuck cares about ‘discrediting the sub’? I think most people are capable of taking each post on its own merit, and saying, Oh no that seems like plausible post but it’s right next to a flat earth post so I’m not so sure.

       It is pretty obvious that you have never even studied or researched the topic at all.  Did I miss the part were you "easily disproved it with very simple science"?  What evidence outside of faith in NASA CGI proved the spinning ball theory to you after you researched the subject with an open mind?

       Okay so now i have to hide before fucking myself? Why cant i fuck myself inside? Its winter. While we're on the subject, how (if the earth is flat) is it winter in the northern hemis-flat and in Australia its summer?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look into that whilst i fuck myself, indoors.

       The flat earth meme is a distraction for the normies.. There is zero upside to anyone in lying to the population about the earth being flat or round.. NOBODY benefits from this conspiracy, which completely goes against what makes a conspiracy worth while..

       Explain to me why I can't see the edge with my telescope on a clear day.. Tell me why I can't see the same stars as the cunts down under? Tell me why the sun doesn't rise and set at the same time for everyone every day?
      </p>

       The earth is not flat, and anyone that can answer those questions will convince me otherwise, until then, this just getting stale..

       Exactly. FE has the same handful of talking points and ignores the glaring discrepancies. All that aside, zero benefit to anyone, as you said.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get the people disagreeing with me on the grounds that we shouldn't have censorship, but the handful of morons actually trying to argue the earth is flat is disconcerting.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then they say "you haven't researched it" when you try to present a valid arguement. Complete waste of time, as they are uninterested in an actual discussion that ends with anything but you saying "oh i guess the earth is flat, afterall."

       The worst part is when someone you love mentions that the earth is flat, and that the ones that shall not be named, are lying to us about flat earth because they

       Seriously. I found out from this post that a couple of users i generally enjoy, and whose opinions i trust, believe in FE. Im actually glad this revealed itself. I cant trust the logical process of someone who believes the earth is flat.

       4chan does a good job of focusing on something like a laser. A lot of their finds get repeated in here. Overall this sub does a good job of having that content. I still see JFK and 9-11 brought up. Ufos not so much.

       Yes, i did. And I repeat, what’s the harm of flat earth posts? Who the fuck cares about ‘discrediting the sub’? I think most people are capable of taking each post on its own merit, and saying, Oh no that seems like plausible post but it’s right next to a flat earth post so I’m not so sure.
