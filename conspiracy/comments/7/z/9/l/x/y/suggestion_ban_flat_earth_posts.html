<p>It seems clear that the correlated increase in FE posts is an effort to discredit the sub.</p>

<p>I am happy with the reduction in shitposting that the submission statement rule has resulted in, and i think if the goal is to actually attract the attention of more &quot;normies&quot; to redpill, then shutting down the FE posts is the next logical step.</p>

<p>I take no issue with hollow earth posts or anything similar. They are not my personal beliefs, but thats not what this sub is about. </p>

<p>Nothing instantly destroys this sub&#39;s credibility like a bunch of posts about the earth being flat, which is quite easily disproven with some very simple science.</p>

<p>The earth is obviously not flat. I think we can safely call this one debunked. </p>

<p>I find it hilarious that you can not just state the &quot;very simple science&quot; that leads you to believe this topics is &quot;debunked&quot; and should be banned?  Can you just admit that you have never researched the subject and you got called out on your bs?</p>

<p>The only argument you made is discussion on the subject should be banned because &quot;very simple science&quot; says so.  I predicted that the flawed 2000 year old Eratosthenes experiment would be your only &quot;proof&quot; and I was correct.  If you have thoroughly researched the subject why do you still believe in a spinning ball earth?  What was the main evidence that made you decide that the subject should be banned because it was so obvious we live on a ball?</p>

<p>No you are proving my point.  If you are bringing up the Coriolis effect then you haven&#39;t researched the subject for yourself.  Why can&#39;t you just admit that?

<p>I didn&#39;t even mention the spelling until you kept spelling it wrong all while trying to pretend that you&#39;ve actually researched if the earth spinning really causes the effect.

<p>Honestly that just sounds like the opinion of someone who has never seriously look into or studied the subject.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If you had researched this topic for years like many of us then you would realize how infested the movement is with shills trying to suppress organic dialogue.  There are literally multiple subreddits set up to do nothing but combat and stalk people that try to have an open discussion about the subject.  They do this every single day and have been for several years now.  </p>

<p>Science should be observable, measurable, and repeatable.  How can FE be a psy-op if you stick to scientific discussion?  If we really live on a spinning ball earth people shouldn&#39;t be afraid to provide evidence if that believe is put to question</p>

<p>P.S.  Don&#39;t get me wrong there are tons of psy-op flat earthers to discredit the actual movement but the real psy-op is NASA and blindly trusting them to give us our belief system.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever considered the possibility that it could be both? A psy-op to condition people away from the truth? Hear me out because I agree with what you are saying, it really did blow up out of nowhere. But the media is what enforces psy-ops and there is strategy behind what they do. </p>

<p>Do you recall Obama&#39;s speech over the subject? Of all important things for our nation to be addressing, the most iconic leader in the world suddenly argues &quot;We don&#39;t have time for a meeting with the flat earth society.&quot; This in my opinion is the real psy-op, for a few reasons. </p>

<p>1) Why is our leader wasting his time talking about this?</p>

<p>2) This tells everyone we have zero priority to even reconsider what we believe about the world. </p>

<p>3) Automatically categorizes those who don&#39;t believe in a globe model into the &quot;Flat Earth Society.&quot; A controlled opposition that throws absurd claims out there with zero proof, like the ground is accelerating upwards. No real flat earth believer believes this. Real flat earth people simply point out the lack of proof from anyone that isn&#39;t nasa.  </p>

<p>4) Those who don&#39;t believe in the globe automatically think the earth is flat. A belief from medieval times, where it is taught people used to believe you could sail off the earth and die. A laughable belief. Who wants to be laughed at? No real flat earth person believes you&#39;ll fall off the edge. </p>

<p>What led me back to flat earth was my conclusion that we didn&#39;t go to the moon, satellites are only weather balloons, and we have no real photo of our entire planet. Perhaps its just literally impossible to get high enough to capture the entire surface at such a wide angle. They have more to gain from preaching the globe model, and building rockets. 5 trillion dollars. People assume a company with that much money would never use CGI. Its all business and for money and control. We are a nation with no perception of the heavens that trusts its own people.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the psy-op is real, but the more I look at it, it looks like a psy-op goes both ways. You believe the globe psy-op, or you believe the flat earth psy-op. Where real flat earth believers stand is neither, because we just simply believe we are not on a ball in nothing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is clear evidence of concerted efforts by various 3 letter organizations to try to discredit conspiracy research, most notably by the CIA, who tried to make the very term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; synonymous with being crazy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-02-23/1967-he-cia-created-phrase-conspiracy-theorists-and-ways-attack-anyone-who-challenge">article on the subject</a> </p>

<p>As more and more conspiracies are proven true, it is easier to discredit us with Ad hominem attacks because FE gets lumped in as a conspiracy theory, than to actually refute our evidence of real and provable conspiracies.</p>

<p>The beliefs of those i have seen seriously arguing the validity of flat earth are usually rooted in religion, so they will mention various bible verse, or the existence of the firmament as evidence of the earth&#39;s flatness.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all good and fine, but unless they are referring to the van allen radiation belt as the firmament, its safe to say there is not a dome enclosing us on a flat earth.</p>

<p>A verse from a book which has been edited, translated, edited, and translated again over a thousand years is not evidence.</p>

<p>I have yet to see any convincing information to explain FE&#39;s opinions on tides, the corealis effect, time zones, foucault&#39;s pendulum, line of sight, etc.</p>

<p>In fact i can conjure not a single bit of evidence from FE that has posed a serious problem for scientific explanation.</p>

<p>It means after something is hypothesized, tested, and the results are tested and repeated, we can call it a theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your arrogance is hysterical. Ready to get schooled? </p>

<p>We have the LAW of density and the LAW of buoyancy which you are confusing with the THEORY of gravity. The LAWS of density and buoyancy are tests that are repeated and proven. </p>

<p>Gravity remains a THEORY because there is no test that has proven that the mass of an object can attract a smaller object. Gravity is just a theory that attempts to explain why the LAWS of buoyancy and density exist. </p>

<p>Simply put, you are completely uneducated about this entire topic. Smfh advocating that we remove an entire school of thought from one of the only acceptable places to discuss it and yet you know NOTHING!</p>

<p>We know that things with mass have a direct and measurable affect on objects. </p>

<p>Gravity is a theory because we havent discovered the mechanism. No one is stopping alt scientists from creating their own model, hell its encouraged.

<p>You&#39;re saying this topic is a psy-op because it couldn&#39;t possibly be flat, without having actually looked into it.</p>

<p>From your other posts, I can tell you haven&#39;t. Maybe you&#39;ve seen some mainstream hitpieces (like the Vsauce piece of garbage), but that&#39;s only 1 side of the coin. What the other side has to say is pretty interesting, and important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve known the precise movement of the planets way before the concept of gravity was even around. Plenty of ancient cultures figured out the cycles of the planets and stuff.</p>

<p>Supertankers can&#39;t get too close to one another because they&#39;re supertankers lol. They&#39;re massive boats with massive amounts of intertia (aka immovable object/unstoppable force). Them colliding, even at slight speed and favorable angle, would involve massive forces, and thus massive damage. It simply makes sense to keep these boats away from eachother. Nothing to do with gravity lol. <em>Gravity</em> requires alot more mass than just a &quot;tiny&quot; tanker.</p>

<p>Gravity did not hold up. When Hubble was launched (somewhere in the 90&#39;s i think) deep space data (the first of it&#39;s kind) showed that galaxies were moving at vastle different speeds than previous predicted. Hence why dark matter was invented, because gravity alone &quot;couldn&#39;t cut it&quot;.</p>

<p>Sure if you assume dark matter (something we can&#39;t detect by any means within the electromagnetic spectrum) is real <em>-which is pseuo-science by definition</em>, then gravity held up. There&#39;s plenty of mainstream science which says dark matter is bullshit, google it.</p>

<p>So since we&#39;re in conspiracy land, we can assume it <strong>is</strong> bullshit, so we can also say the theory of gravity has no held up for things on the largest of scales.</p>

<p>Similar, within quantum mechanics, there is no room for gravity. All of Cavendish and Newton&#39;s experiments fall flat and become useless. That&#39;s why quantum mechanics is a &quot;seperate package&quot; within physics.</p>

<p>Einstein knew all of this, he tried to unify them mathematically but never succeeded, yada yada all that.</p>

<p>As for: 
<em>&quot;Just because there are some things we don&#39;t know of yet&quot;</em></p>

<p>A flat Earther can&#39;t even dream of this being a viable anwser.</p>

<p><em>How are there eclipses on the flat earth?</em>
<em>How do seasons work on a flat earth?</em>
<em>What about satellites?</em></p>

<p>Let&#39;s be honest: if a Flat Earther doesn&#39;t have every single anwser to every single question, the theory gets called out for being bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And we used those observations to form our theory of gravity. We&#39;ve used it to extremely accurately predict the motions of comets and satellites.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>And they can&#39;t get too close because...gravity.<br/>
Not because of &quot;inertia&quot;. If they&#39;re travelling PARALLEL to eachother the lower friction of water + combined gravitational pull means they&#39;re pulled together.<br/>
That is gravity. I think you&#39;ve misunderstood what I  said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>showed that galaxies were moving at vastle different speeds than previous predicted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What exactly does that have to do with gravity?<br/>
It has nothing at all tondo with gravity. Galaxies can move independent of each other. They can move away or toward each other, gravity is irrelevant to the equation. Gravity simply has nothing to do with the movement of galaxies - do you have any idea how far apart they are?</p>

<p>Again, Dark Matter is a proposed method to explain the expansion of the universe. It doesn&#39;t suddenly make gravity irrelevant. Gravity is still here and works exactly the way we predicted it should.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if you just misunderstand what gravity is or are just being intellectually dishonest, which most flat earthers seem to be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>also say the theory of gravity has no held up for things on the largest of scales</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How exactly has it not?</p>

<p>There is absolutely no evidence behind that at all. The motion of the planets, the movement of comets and satellites, the repeatable and consistent Cavendish experiment proves that gravity has indeed held up. I think you should do more reading, the expansion of the universe has nothing to do with gravity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of Cavendish and Newton&#39;s experiments fall flat and become useless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who mentioned eclipses? But yes, if flat earthers can&#39;t explain basic concepts that the globe already perfectly explains, the &quot;theory&quot; is bullshit, not like it didn&#39;t already have a million reasons for being bullshit anyway.</p>

<p>There is not a single good argument that revolves around flat earth (pun intended), nor is there a single good explanation of who the fuck would benefit by lying about the earth being round if it were indeed flat. </p>

<p>&quot;No its not. What group of people is being silenced by requiring a submission statement? What idea or belief is destroyed when we require submission statements?&quot;</p>

<p>Weak ideas and intellectually dishonest beliefs are being silenced by submission statements. Shitposters who dont care enough to argue their point is the group that is being silenced. They shitpost, they refuse to respond constructively to comments and they degrade the content of the sub. Just like flat earthers. Any attempt at actual debate is met with &quot;prove to me without nasa science...&quot; or they ignore the multitudes of questions you present them with and they tell you &quot;you havent looked into it.&quot; </p>

<p>Read through the comments on this posts and you&#39;ll see what i mean.</p>

<p>Nasa is not without its controversies, but i assure you that the science they use is the same science everyone else in the scientific community is using. </p>

<p>So demanding i not use &quot;mainstream nasa science&quot; in my arguments is like saying &quot;tell me without using language why you&#39;re right&quot;</p>

<p>How is that censorship? Why does a submission statement invalidate a weak idea? Or even an intellectually dishonest one? Does the mods even remove weak posts with a statement? </p>

<p>At least you were humble (wise) enough to admit you had been sucked into the &#39;us vs them&#39; mentality. Few people have that ability.</p>

<p>I personally think that Flat Earth is comically fallacious, but I don&#39;t mind it if other people want to discuss it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do the experiment. Youre referring to Eratosthenes of Cyrene which attempts to measure the circumference of the earth by comparing the shadow of a stick in Cyrene and Alexandria. Carl Sagan is famous for demonstrating the experiment on a piece of paper that he rolls up. He shows how when flat, both sticks have no shadow, but when he curls the paper, one stick has a shadow while the other does not, therefore &quot;proving&quot; the earth is round. </p>

<p>However, there is a MASSIVE flaw in the experiment and that is assuming that the sun is 90 million plus miles away. In the flat Earth theory, the sun is estimated to be much closer to the earth. If you take the flat Earth model (the experiment I just told you to recreate with objects which are readily available) you can see that two sticks can cast dramatically different shadows at the same time. </p>

<p>Carl Sagan could have just as easily demonstrated my experiment and boldly proclaim that the Earth is definitively flat and the sun is not 90 million miles away. </p>

If the earth were flat, it would rise at the same time unless we, at a bare minimum, live on a convex earth. If you travel from the US to england, guess what, 5hrs+ difference to the sun rise. Coincidentally, this aligns with the information provided on your globe. So now you have an extremely convex earth.

<p>People are not that hard to fool. None of us have a basic understanding of this world.</p>

<p>4chan does a good job of focusing on something like a laser. A lot of their finds get repeated in here. Overall this sub does a good job of having that content. I still see JFK and 9-11 brought up. Ufos not so much.</p>

I think most people are capable of taking each post on its own merit, and saying, Oh no that seems like plausible post but it’s right next to a flat earth post so I’m not so sure.</p>

<p>Just skip the shit posts. </p>
