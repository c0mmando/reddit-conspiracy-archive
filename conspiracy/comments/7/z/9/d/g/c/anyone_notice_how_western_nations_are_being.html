    <div class="md"><p>Buying real estate is not buying missiles, and many Indian and Chinese come here to escape the terrible environmental conditions od their home countries. The government is not selling these people weapons...and the sale of missiles to the ME to be used on &quot;poor people&quot; is a game the U.S has pioneered for years. Immigration has its problems, but it is not with the Chinese or Indians who end up picking up the slack when it comes to math and science. Go visit Lockheed or Boeing, Asians play a huge role developing tech to MAGA. It is the middle east that needs vetting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea you&#39;re mixing cohorts.  </p>

<p>The foreigners pouring into the West are educated temp workers (or the children of uber-wealthy) on H1B1 visas, or equivalent student visa, work visa, etc.  They might be young, but they are sure not disenfranchised.</p>

<p>For that, you&#39;d have to troll the warehouse parties and communes to hear the native-born (and I mean born in the Bay) folk talk about being forced outta the Bay (or live in warehouse communes).</p>

<p>The Sharia Law disenfranchised types are settling in other parts of the US.  Dearborn, MI has FAR more to worry about than Hongcouver or SF Bay when it comes to Sharia Law and disenfranchised young men.</p>

What future do americans have? No wonder theres school shootings happening regularly. How many americans have died to this big pharma caused Opiod epidemic? Im sure the chinese played a role in that too, they&#39;re always smuggling drugs and weapons into the country.</p>
