       Unless the Chinese and Indian men coming here take all of the resources and prevent the citizens here from being able to exist. Look at Hongkouver, major housing crisis happening right now because rich Chinese people buy property and dont pay taxes. Canadian citizens are forced to live in shitty apartments and pay ridiculous amounts of money. Canadian Prime Minister cares more about India than he does his own people.

       So a bunch or rich chinese come and legally buy property from people trying to make a buck. What is wrong with that? You are allowed to buy property in Asia if you can afford it, no one is stopping you. Why cry gentrification when the West has been gentifrying other nations for ages, raising living costs for locals abroad. America is the third largest tax haven in the world for criminals looking to launder money through real estate. Miami is well known for this. Our own country is guilty of selling out, and worse, they will sell to the most corrupt people on earth. Delaware, where everyone goes to incorporate companies, is a good place to go if you need to setup a shell company. Complaining about asian elites buying property in NA is pure hypocrisy.

       So if some rich people buy some missiles and decide to fire them at some poor people in the middle east, what's wrong with that? It's just business, they earned their money fair and square right? They have every right to kill those poor people right? OMG the hypocrisy of non North Americans!

       Buying real estate is not buying missiles, and many Indian and Chinese come here to escape the terrible environmental conditions od their home countries. The government is not selling these people weapons...and the sale of missiles to the ME to be used on "poor people" is a game the U.S has pioneered for years. Immigration has its problems, but it is not with the Chinese or Indians who end up picking up the slack when it comes to math and science. Go visit Lockheed or Boeing, Asians play a huge role developing tech to MAGA. It is the middle east that needs vetting.

       The SF Bay Area is just like Vancouver.  Hot Chinese money floods the housing market, H1B1 visas are all over the place, and entire communities are now Indian (or Chinese, but that happened a while ago).  We have something called 5 Cities, centered on Fremont, CA, that is basically a bedroom community for H1B1 visa holders.  The turn-over is high, the rental market is affected, and folks who wanna rent longer-term can't hang.

       That said, these are not Sharia Law installing folk.  They are Make Money kinda folk.

       The flip side is a bunch of young men who are disenfranchised, are easily radicalized by the media. They might not buy into Sharia Law, but they can buy into the equivalent form of wahhabism for America! Honestly though, at this point becoming a muslim might be more beneficial for me than being a white christian.

       Yea you're mixing cohorts.

       The foreigners pouring into the West are educated temp workers (or the children of uber-wealthy) on H1B1 visas, or equivalent student visa, work visa, etc.  They might be young, but they are sure not disenfranchised.
      </p>
      <p>
       For that, you'd have to troll the warehouse parties and communes to hear the native-born (and I mean born in the Bay) folk talk about being forced outta the Bay (or live in warehouse communes).

       The Sharia Law disenfranchised types are settling in other parts of the US.  Dearborn, MI has FAR more to worry about than Hongcouver or SF Bay when it comes to Sharia Law and disenfranchised young men.

       I was saying that the american young men who are disenfranchised are the ones who can become radicalized not the wealthy rich chinese/indian kids getting a proper education cause their parents paid for it. What future do americans have? No wonder theres school shootings happening regularly. How many americans have died to this big pharma caused Opiod epidemic? Im sure the chinese played a role in that too, they're always smuggling drugs and weapons into the country.

       They come here(USA) for college education once they've mastered English with the plan of returning home with their skills. I studied mathematics/science at a very diverse school(Ohio State) and the critical mass of my classmates in my major courses(actuarial science) were Indian/Asian. They end up staying for various reasons.

       Yes New Zealand is getting a lot of both cultures. I'm an executive chef and apart from the obvious language barrier they are mostly fantastic workers. And great people. They're just like you and me. They were just not as lucky where they were born. And they fucken

       So a bunch or rich chinese come and legally buy property from people trying to make a buck. What is wrong with that? You are allowed to buy property in Asia if you can afford it, no one is stopping you. Why cry gentrification when the West has been gentifrying other nations for ages, raising living costs for locals abroad. America is the third largest tax haven in the world for criminals looking to launder money through real estate. Miami is well known for this. Our own country is guilty of selling out, and worse, they will sell to the most corrupt people on earth. Delaware, where everyone goes to incorporate companies, is a good place to go if you need to setup a shell company. Complaining about asian elites buying property in NA is pure hypocrisy.
