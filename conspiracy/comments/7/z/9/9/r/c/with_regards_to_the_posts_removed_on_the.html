        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><del>Hello all,</del></p>

<p><del>In the interest of full disclosure, the admins of reddit <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5XFbSdE.png">contacted us today via modmail</a> to let us know that there is to be zero tolerance for any attempt to link reddit usernames to an IRL identity, even in the context of a public figure such as David Hogg.</del></p>

<p><del>To be clear, attempting to connect a username to an IRL identity in the context of the above individual, or any attempt to engage in witch hunting of said individual, will result in an immediate ban from the subreddit.</del></p>

<p><del>For further clarification on this matter, please direct any questions to the reddit admins via the modmail of <a href="/r/reddit.com">/r/reddit.com</a>. The moderators of this subreddit will enforce the site wide TOS as directed on this matter, and will provide updates to the community should this situation change.</del></p>

<p><del>As a matter of general clarification; the moderators of this subreddit have made inquiries to the admins as to this incident, based specifically on the standing of the individual involved here as a potential public figure. Those who have been on the subreddit for some time may remember <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5zraqw/an_update_with_regards_to_posts_related_to_the/">an incident involving an individual by the name of Andrew Boeckman/Andrew Picard which has some parallels to the current ongoing discussion</a>.</del> </p>

<p><del>Others may also recall the situation involving <a href="/u/stonetear">/u/stonetear</a>, who was identified as an individual by the name of Paul Combetta in the context of a congressional investigation- <a href="https://democrats-oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/documents/(75)%20Chaffetz%20Smith%20to%20Tidwell%20re%20Federal%2009-21-2016.pdf">https://democrats-oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/documents/(75)%20Chaffetz%20Smith%20to%20Tidwell%20re%20Federal%2009-21-2016.pdf</a></del></p>

<p><del>While there are no doubt differences between the situation at hand and the situation involving Mr. Picard/Mr. Boeckman or the situation involving Mr. Combetta, the mod team feels that the nature of an individual&#39;s standing as a public figure is an issue relevant to the free exchange of ideas.</del></p>

<p><del>To that end, although there may be an update forthcoming, for the time being the ruling of the admins will be enforced by the mod team sans qualification.</del> </p>

<p><del>Thanks for your understanding,</del></p>

<p><del>The <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod team</del></p>

<p><del><strong>TL:DR: Users are welcome to discuss the individual above in the context of news reports or other media, but users are not permitted to link a reddit username to the individual under any circumstances. This is by direct order of the admins, and any violations will result in an immediate ban. Updates to this situation will be provided if possible.</strong></del></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Very sorry for having to provide an update so soon after our earlier post, but this situation has been evolving rapidly.</p>

<p>For context; based on our initial contact with the admins, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5XFbSdE.png">we were told that users were not allowed to link David Hogg to a reddit account under any circumstances.</a> </p>

<p>Following further discussion, admins have clarified that users are indeed allowed to discuss a potential connection between a reddit account and Mr. Hogg, so long as that &quot;discussion does not escalate into attempts belittle, expose, or harass potential real world account owner(s).&quot; </p>

<p>The moderators of this subreddit will enforce this standard in strict fashion and there will be zero tolerance for those who attempt to walk the line out of bad faith.</p>

<p>To be clear, discussion is allowed but any of the actions outlined above in the context of that discussion will result in the user being banned and reported to the site administrators. </p>

<p>The moderators of this subreddit are appreciative of the admins for their patience and willingness to engage in discussion of this sensitive issue.</p>

<p>In the interest of full disclosure, the follow up conversation with the admins can be found <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ttPeimc.png">here</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you all for your patience and our apologies for any confusion. </p>

<p><strong>TL:DR: Users may discuss the username of the individual in question to the extent that said &quot;discussion does not escalate into attempts belittle, expose, or harass potential real world account owner(s).&quot; We ask all users to respect this standard and to report all violations to modmail.</strong></p>

<p>Now that I finally have a mods attention, can you respond to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7uz43s/conspiracy_of_all_conspiracies_court_docs_show/dtq5eod/?context=1">this</a> question.

    <div class="md"><p>Its hard to say that you&#39;re wrong, but for better or for worse reddit has changed over the past decade (or half decade); I don&#39;t know how to salvage what was once the vision of a beautiful boy from<a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/?q=antique+jetpack&amp;amp;mfrom=&amp;amp;mto=&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;notitle=&amp;amp;date=&amp;amp;nofrom=&amp;amp;noto=&amp;amp;count=50&amp;amp;sort=0&amp;amp;file=&amp;amp;docid=&amp;amp;relid=0#searchresult"> the clutches of subtle corporate subversion</a>, but I do know that eternal vigilance is the price of democracy (in all its forms). </p>

<p>Neutered and ostracized by external forces as it may be, someone has to watch (even if its painful to see this place as a shell of its former self), least even here should fall victim to the unending tide of corporate/ideological bullshit on this platform :(.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do understand that there are many different influences and factors in play that nobody has access to, so I understand what you&#39;re saying and I&#39;m sure you feel as much loss as anybody else.</p>

<p>With that said, in times previous certain authorities were also not assumed that are now being assumed. The legalistic &#39;guilty until proven innocent&#39; approach has a certain shortcoming in the &#39;not-real&#39; world of the internet, and I think it results in a poisoning of the genuineness of the board. When trolls and shills can run around silly with no consequence because they can just claim plausible deniability, nobody is safe.</p>

<p>This place is valuable only because we participate, but as soon as we no longer feel like it belongs to us, it will be forgotten and it has already started. I used to post here daily and I think it&#39;s probably been weeks now since I could give a shit to argue with a bunch of people on paid time. As far as vote manipulation and all that go - whatever. It&#39;s imaginary internet points, and while it IS effective and it IS stacking the deck, I don&#39;t think it really changes people&#39;s minds so much as it provokes them to feel differently about it. </p>

<p>The part that sucks is when you start telling us what we can and cannot know and share. There&#39;s a line there that is dangerous on both sides I think... If you want to truly lose the community, just go down that road. </p>

<p>and again, I&#39;m saying this to reddit - not you personally. I understand you&#39;re &#39;just a mod&#39;, but at the end of the day, you still have to agree or disagree to play by the rules. Just sayin&#39;.</p>

<p>&#39;persists&#39; is a word that applies less and less every day here. The group that requires persistence are finding new places to go considering they are not being protected here anymore... in many ways they have become prey in this arena. You aren&#39;t going to stay someplace you don&#39;t feel safe. I also think this forum is far less influential than it used to be. The genuine base knows what&#39;s up and they&#39;re just migrating away; all that will probably be left soon are manipulated and inflated numbers if the base continues to flee...</p>

<p>You can go anywhere on the internet and yet you decide to come here, where you think everyone is devoid of critical thinking and you are extremely anti-discussion. Critical thinking, which you try to champion here, means that you consider every viewpoint and angle, yet here you are pretending like you are the Oracle of all knowledge.</p>

<p>Get off your high horse and stop with the ignorance. If you want to be a part of the community here and provide what you think is missing here - great... but if you&#39;re only contribution is to belittle the community here and act holier-than-thou then I think you are here for the wrong reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand if DH wanted to remain private out of the public controversy.  As such, reddit is correct in protecting his account and his information.  However, as DH seems to have continued on Twitter and elsewhere in a public capacity, then he&#39;s basically opening himself up, and its no longer about &quot;DOXing&quot;, but about discussing a public figure that wants to stay public.  Twitter, reddit and Facebook banning people from mentioning him once he is functioning in the public spotlight, would amount to censorship and would have nothing to do with protecting user identity or private life.</p>

<p>DH should really retreat from the public spotlight if he values his privacy.  The whole doxing and shaming by social media companies is just a cover for trying to control an out of control narrative that they wish to manipulate.  Those who wish to preserve their rights are correct to fight back. 
 Clearly this is all about playing on people&#39;s emotions to advance an agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got shadowbanned from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> last night for posting this which they claim is russian propaganda.  Even if it is why cant we watch this film in the US or EU &amp; decide for ourselves.  I&#39;ll tell you why... Because this story shows dems &amp; repubs in a negative light...</p>

<p>If we can ban films in the US with ease we can also ban guns just as easily.</p>

<ul>
<li>I just finished watching the Magnitsky Act: Behind the scenes which is a documentary about the sanctions placed on Russia by the United States - the film is banned in the US/EU but the creators are assisting anyone interested in these areas with accessing it if interested. </li>
<li><p>The steps i had to take are strange. It is weird. Never had to do anything like this to watch a film. If you are willing to risk it email this guy &amp; he will give you the instructions - <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/torsteingrude">https://mobile.twitter.com/torsteingrude</a> - it does require you provide whatsapp/sms/few other options for them to send a password to you. You will be given access to the film associated with a watermark throughout the film connected to you. I personally have no regrets. I just watched a movie &amp; they didnt ask for money. If anyone knows another way to watch it without taking these steps feel free to share.</p></li>
<li><p>who here is more afraid of a film than they are guns?  Banning this film was easy because McCain was involved.  Why are banning firearms so hard?  If we do ban guns &amp; Russia is such a great threat... What do we do if they choose to escalate &amp; go further than just meddling in our elections?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>So it&#39;s an interesting case.</p>

<p>The film isn&#39;t banned, per-se, so much as...functionally banned? Browder&#39;s Lawyers are, somehow or another, managing to get the majority of the screenings shut down. What&#39;s hard to tell from what I&#39;ve dug up is exactly why the screenings are stopping. Is it that Browder&#39;s lawyers are successful arguing to the courts that the flim is...libel or something? Is there an argument that there is some sort of secret law they&#39;re using? Is it actually that no one bothers going to the courts, and this is just yet another case of a rich man with lawyers threatening people into silence?</p>

<p>Which brings me to my big question: Is the film so hard to get by necessity (it gets hammered down on whatever site it is put up on), or to make it an &quot;experience.&quot; Have they tried putting the film up for purchase somewhere and failed, or is this just a ploy to make the conspiracy seem more real?</p>

<p>Moving up from Browder, I haven&#39;t managed to find anything that indicates McCain was involved, or that US politicians have turned their eye to the movie at all. It&#39;s all tales of Browder&#39;s lawyers successfully stopping screenings. Where did you get the idea that it&#39;s a greater conspiracy than that?</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m certainly the first to say that if Browder actually felt that he was innocent, his response to the movie should be a detailed paper pointing out all of the ways the movie is wrong. Hammering something down into oblivion instead of ripping a false narrative to shreds is a sign to me that the narrative isn&#39;t so false after all. And I wouldn&#39;t think you&#39;re crazy to believe that US politicians have no desire to turn their eye to the movie, and would rather have their clear cut reason for the Magnitsky act in place. But I&#39;m not finding anything that shows me this is a case of &quot;Government Conspiracy keeping down the truth&quot; so much as further proof our system is fundamentally biased towards a rich person with enough lawyers to litigate anyone they disagree with into silence. </p>

Because my posted highlighted that when you ban or severly restrict things those that want to obtain them will find a way.  What do they think?

<p>like, they don&#39;t know that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> never had a beef with Trump, but did have a long standing beef with the Clinton&#39;s, and it wasn&#39;t based on sexism, or political parties, it was based on a simple concept of right and wrong </p>

<p>so these Russia jokes probably seem quite funny, and plausible, to these new users</p>

<p>oh, its also worth mentioning that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> never had a beef with Russians before HRC lost and RussiaGate was hatched</p>

<p><a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> interest in Russians was probably around the Bolshevik Revolution and the people behind the murder of 10&#39;s of millions of people </p>

<p>and why we aren&#39;t taught much about the Bolshevik Revolution in school</p>

<p>Do your parents allow you to spend your vacation hunting down media to appear on local broadcasts? What about the fact that his father used to work in intelligence? Considering how closely they work with media, is it impossible that this kid is flown in and used as a media asset? I&#39;m not basing this question off one thing - everything from his videos, to the problem remembering lines, to the weird message he delivered makes me question this stuff.

<p>The fine tooth comb is because you&#39;re using misleading language to describe what&#39;s going on, attempting to imply something that isn&#39;t happening.

    <div class="md"><p>so you know for a fact this kid has never been featured on local TV before that? You realize we&#39;re talking about hundreds of channels that produce content every day?</p>

<p>You dont&#39; know shit - you are just speculating like I am. My point is purely that he doesn&#39;t seem genuine in his interviews, his father used to work for the FBI (who&#39;s in a shitload of trouble right now), and his previous &#39;news story&#39; is exactly the type of story that a local news affiliate will hire an actor for in order to produce content (I&#39;ve worked in media - that is completely a thing that happens quite often. It&#39;s hard to trust strangers under deadlines.)</p>

Not sure how long the vacation was but it doesn’t mean the news tracked them down in hours. Even if they were only there a week, that’s enough time for a news station to DM someone and that person to ask their parents if they can meet up with the news station on the beach. Hell, seems like the kid goes to the beach a lot maybe they have a vacation place right on the beach where he could just walk to the interview (I don’t have any info on this but it’s certainly plausible). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes it is plausible. I never said it wasn&#39;t. I&#39;m just bringing up the the fact that he did appear on the news on the other side of the country, and his father is ex-intelligence. Maybe it&#39;s all a coincidence, but it&#39;s interesting nonetheless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I still think there&#39;s something off with this kid. Did you see the student reports that security was switched at the school a few weeks back and &#39;secret service&#39; were seen around campus? </p>

<p>All of these little things are what makes me suspicious. I saw another youtube with a student from the school who claimed to talk to the shooter after the shooting took place in a completely different place at the school. Who am I to believe? and what has the media done lately for me to give them the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>&#39;The only thing I know is that I do not know&#39;. Therefore, I don&#39;t blindly accept bullshit because someones tells me to. These shootings keep happening and almost more than half the time they involve failed or active intelligence assets. Where there is smoke, there is often fire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, and even if the kid doesn&#39;t want to be a journalist or whatever, people love the chance at 15 minutes of fame.  I just don&#39;t understand why this is getting so much traction, I know I&#39;m on a conspiracy sub :) but being a skeptic has to be applied to everything, perhaps even conspiracy theories more so than the &#39;official story&#39;.  We know that TPTB have a lot of tricks up their sleeves, and &#39;poisoning the well&#39; with easily debunkable crap is an easy way to: a) make us critical thinkers look like gullible idiots (I hate the term &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; because of the way it has been weaponized - the first thing most people think of when they hear that term is a loon in a tin foil hat) and b) discount any actual conspiracies by lumping them in with the easily debunked BS.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying anything for sure. I find the whole thing suspicious - from what he said to how he said it, and his &#39;viral video&#39; in Redondo Beach seems like a typical paid story created for a local newscast. Get a few actors, create a &#39;viral video&#39; controversy, fill a newscast for a night.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a possibility. It could be that he was just very motivated to get on TV too. We&#39;ll see how it all plays out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude your theory literally began as a screenshot of two newscasts. Of course that&#39;s meaningless but that was the provenance of the conspiracy. You&#39;ve taken it quite seriously as if being on the news at some point in the past is evidence of...anything. The unfortunate part is that it is not. Using nothing to attack victims of a school shooting, which you&#39;ve now claimed had no motive which is also fake and blatantly ignorant, is shameful and embarrassing. You should be embarrassed. You being deluded by propaganda enough to go to such extremes should be a wake up call. You&#39;re a victim of propaganda. You&#39;re not making some sort of special insight. You&#39;re just parroting immoral rhetoric for the sake of petty and illogical partisanship. You should take a self assessment and realize what you&#39;re doing, think about why you&#39;re doing it, and consider expanding your search for truth to sources that don&#39;t lie to you. </p>

<p>We have him in CNN gear, we have old classmates of his claiming they graduated with him in 2015, and his interest in TV has been noted from the very beginning. </p>

<p>So while you shit on everyone else who is asking questions, it seems like the things you hold true are not very much true, or at the very least there are questions being brought up about the veracity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes that sometimes works and sometimes you get a flake who doesn&#39;t show up and is unreliable. That&#39;s why they often hire actors to provide these interviews if they are under a deadline. Getting an out-of-town kid is bonus so it just fades away afterwards. It&#39;s not uncommon - people never realize how intentional media creation is. Creating media under a daily deadline means you have to minimize murphy&#39;s law. With that said, i&#39;ve mentioned many times that it could have worked out like you mention here.  I can&#39;t know for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with this dude&#39;s wall of text is that it&#39;s FILLED with misinformation. Literally almost every single thing that he says about the shooting is wrong. FBI were not first on the scene, response time was not 20 minutes, the school is not being demolished they&#39;re returning to class, Hogg was not all over newscasts in multiple states, etc. Seriously, almost everything he says is either wrong or just a flat out lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>half the wall of text you just provided is also filled in inaccuracies and false truths, so you are no better my friend. The situation is complicated, and there are points to be made on both sides. It has nothing to do with &#39;wanting it to be true&#39;, but that helps your &#39;holier-than-thou&#39; narrative so you push it anyways. Your argument is not genuine, and you clearly do not understand the angles people are looking at this from. We can agree to disagree tho - that is perfectly fine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I worked in local news for many years. Many times we end up relying on what’s trending locally on social media to do a story on. They’re called talkers. It’s something that will drum up clicks on social media and the website. Sure there is the daily crime and grime but we often want to the weird and wacky. So there’s no reason to believe anything other than this kid posted a video and it went viral and then the media reached out and met up with him. It happens in every market in the country. Like I said I know the photog who shot that original story. And that is exactly how it went down. He even stated the kid almost backed out a few times because he was on vacation and had other things to do.  As a photog I interviewed people on the street who afterwards have told me that they’ve done interviews with  a station in other states before. </p>

<p>Also local media does not plant interviews and stories. We are just normal people doing a job. And trust me no ones paying kids to do interviews. The stations barely pay staff these days. They even laugh when someone tries to sell them video of something. These days with the ubiquitous nature of cell phones there’s most likely 10 other people that will give it to you for free. That’s if someone hasn’t already just sent it to you through email. </p>

<p>Saying that local stations frequently plants interviews and collude with police is the most absurd and laughable thing I’ve heard in this whole debate. Being able to report on corruption is a local journalists wet dream. It would immediately launch you into a far better career. No ones going to turn down that recognition.</p>

<p>National news often gets caught misrepresenting facts and showing bias. I’m not calling out any individual stations here because that’s a different debate altogether.</p>

<p>In short him being interviewed in to separate locations is not noteworthy in the slightest. And to think that local news has the time, money, or resources to collaborate with some deep state entity is laughable. </p>

<p>I know for a fact that it happens. It&#39;s never any story with teeth - it&#39;s always something inane that nobody will ever actually try to disprove - it&#39;s calculated. </p>

<p>Sounds like you worked in a different environment than others, and I have no doubt that stations like what you are describing out there exist where there is no smoke and mirrors, but that wasn&#39;t my and many of my peers experience.</p>

<p>You seem to really be grinding me for conflict, so let&#39;s entertain your angst: since it seems to be the crux of your frustration in this exchange, what do you find compelling about a 17-year old in high school self-describing himself as a 17-year old high school student?</p>

<p>Me?  I don&#39;t find that indicative of anything out of the ordinary.  Part of being critical is the ability to analyze evidence and determine if it means anything.  Dare I suggest, even making a mockery of real conspiracy.  Hence my quip.</p>

<p>Your turn.  Persuade me how it is compelling evidence of anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what it was about. </p>

<p>If a user doxxes his own self on his Reddit account and wants to actively strive to be a national symbol for a movement people should be able to discuss him in all aspects.</p>

<p>This elderly woman was on her property, was ambushed and stood up for herself. She does not want to be famous or a face of a movement. </p>

<p>What it boils down to is some people are perfectly fine with certain people living private lives being doxxed and harassed while others who are hardcore pushing agendas shouldn&#39;t even be questioned.</p>

Then when the girl says &quot;and thats that&quot; it switches to audio overlaying different videos, where he says 9:32. He&#39;s talking to a different girl at that point, and isn&#39;t claiming to be during the shooting(and the girl refers to it being after the event)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was a teen with a chance at internet fame. What conspiracy is there in this? You’re only supporting my sheep argument. Might as well link a popular video to a kid doing water bottle flips or some news segment about planking when it was a craze and link it. Just because a teen wanted internet fame doesn’t mean he’s some paid crisis actor</p>

<p>Seriously. Conspiracy theories should require at least some basic levels of critical thinking, not throwing a bunch of regurgitated shit at the wall that may have been true at some point and pushing it as fact. Entertain the idea, sure, but comments like “higher ups haven’t finished scrubbing his Reddit account” because (presumably) they think he’s a crisis actor and needs to cover his tracks is bogus. When this thread is getting hundreds upvotes without any top comment mentioning an <em>actual</em> point do direct or even circumstantial evidence with a clear link to being a crisis actor, it’s a poor shitshow of conspiracy theorizing. And only contributes to the lack of credit anyone wants to give this place for legitimate discussion.</p>

<p>Also, just to touch on the idea that he’s being manipulated to push an agenda, why do people think that would be effective? A single kid getting 15 minutes of fame is going to steer legislation single handedly? Come on. There have been much larger and more influential media presences that have pushed for gun control or could be pushing for it now than a high school shooting survivor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guy probably is a crisis actor and there are plenty of them.But what’s sad is they throw them into these situations with innocent people who don’t know that and it blurs the line between what’s real and what’s not. They do this intentionally and they like for people to know it so then it creates a dividing people argue about it. The fact that this kid is a crisis actor doesn’t change the fact that this event still happened. </p>

<p>Even if the government or some secret agency orchestrated a shooting or an event like this that kills many people the end result is that people are killed. It’s still a tragedy. And that brings me to the point got all of the shit is orchestrated by those in control not necessarily to get a ban on guns or take away our rights but to create divide and to distract us from the strings they’re pulling in the background fucking with legislations and laws. </p>

<p>They always carry these events out on certain dates that have numerology tied into some thing else that’s important to them the numbers when you see the news stories talking about how many people were killed or this or that have a numerology to them that lines up with other shit. That shits pulled off by the same people that own all your major sports leagues and script all your fucking fake ass sports well people sit back arguing about who’s team is better while these fuckers at the top sit there laughing.</p>

<p>Good advice. The question is, do you follow your own advice?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the litmus test: do you believe anybody died or got hurt in this latest &#39;shooting event&#39;?</p>

<p>Once somebody begins to understand that the telescreen can and does lie about these events to any degree, the only thing stopping them from pondering if the entire event is staged is their own ego.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at a date, you mentioned 9/11/2001...
9 = 9
11 = 11
2001 = 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 3</p>

<p>9 + 11 + 3 = 23</p>

<p>Okay so the date numerology of 9/11/2001 is 23. What are some words or terms in the English language that equate to a numerology of 23 in the language of gematria? </p>

<p>CIA = 23
Puppet = 23 (Bush was a puppet)</p>

<p>Lets bring this back around to the subject of this post. David Hogg.
His initials are DH. D=4 and H=8...48
Propaganda = 48</p>

<p>Lets look at his name...
David Hogg= 76
Theater = 76
Zionist = 76
Judaism = 76   </p>

<p>Hmmm... I once passed it off thinking it was all BS but it&#39;s all ritual to those in control. These shootings and tragedies are ritual sacrifices. Our world is run by religious psychopaths. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude you are such a nut</p>

<p>You&#39;re just straight grabbing random words you want associated with your conspiracy theory. Also, I punched in some of your words into a &quot;gematrinator&quot; calculator I found online and they don&#39;t even match your numbers. I don&#39;t know wtf the difference between &quot;Full Reduction&quot;, &quot;Reverse Full Reduction&quot;, &quot;English Ordinal&quot; or &quot;Reverse Ordinal&quot; is but they only add to 77 not 76 in English Ordinal but not in any of the other notations. And the fact that there are four different notations just let&#39;s people grab different words/numbers to support their own crazy interpretations. Who the fuck is even in control, why would they have such a ridiculous number system for ritual sacrifices, why are you somehow one of the only few to figure it out, and more importantly, why are you wasting your time with this nonsense? Where do you even imagine this goes? What does your crusade&#39; of knowledge lead us to? Fucking nothing</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I’m not. I literally just explained to you what I’m talking about and you don’t seem to even grasp it. Is it that hard to understand that language itself is mathematical.</p>

<p>Do you Believe everything you see on TV? Who owns the TV channels especially the major ones that show news media and sports? The Elite do. Those with money. You might refer to them here in the conspiracy sub as the illuminati.  What are they tied into? Religion. I know it’s pretty fucking cooky isn’t it? religion is fucking crazy.</p>

<p>These people speak in mathematics and they do so as mockery to people such as yourself who don’t understand it. You are Vesely don’t understand what I’m talking about so do yourself a favor and go do a little research on the language of Gematria and how it works. Here I will lead you in the right <a href="https://youtu.be/eYEYecBBxn4">direction</a> .</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even have TV so you can just shut the hell up about that. The illuminati isn&#39;t an actual thing. Religion is pretty fucking crazy but people will believe pretty crazy things, you are a good example of this. You call religion crazy but believe in a Jewish numerology theory?

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gematria">Gematria</a> is indeed a real practice that is very well documented, understood, and practiced...Just not taught in public school. Yes, language is mathematical. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Weishaupt">Adam Weishaupt</a> was a German philosopher who founded the Order of the Illuminati...might need to brush up on your history. I can&#39;t say it&#39;s your fault, they don&#39;t teach this in public school history.</p>

<p>How does the practice of gematria effect your life? Well, think about the movie the Wizard of Oz. once you see the man operating the machine, the machine loses it&#39;s power. When you realize that you are being shown a bunch of illusions those things no longer have an effect on your critical thinking. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk about the current topic of &quot;Fake News&quot;...So, you see the president parading around crying &quot;Fake News&quot;, he isn&#39;t wrong but, there&#39;s a catch. This is part of a divide and conquer scheme. He is pretty outspokenly supportive of Fox News and now they have a base for being &quot;reliable&quot; to his followers. They think CNN and the others are &quot;Fake&quot; while the viewers of those channels think Fox is &quot;Fake&quot;...The truth? It&#39;s all fake. This is plain and simply divide and conquer. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s bring gematria into this mix...</p>

<p>Fake News = 84</p>

<p>Jesuit = 84</p>

<p>Divide and Conquer = 84</p>

<p>United States of America = 84</p>

<p>Go check for yourself. <a href="http://www.gematrinator.com/calculator/index.php">Here</a> is a calculator that will show you the numerical values of whatever you type into it. Maybe you can learn for yourself or at least have a little fun...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, you can stop trying to explain your crazy theory. It&#39;s nonsense and you know it. You can combine so many words and phrases into any number coincidence you want, there&#39;s absolutely no credibility to your theory. Just because something is well practiced and documented doesn&#39;t make it true. Language is not mathematical, you can assign numbers to fucking anything. You can&#39;t see through nonexistant illusions. Thinking the Illuminati is really is fucking ridiculous and pretending that you have the insight into the world is the most disconnected from reality I&#39;ve ever heard someone act.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. You claimed that &quot;Gematria is not a real thing&quot;...I gave you resourceful information.</p>

<p>You claimed that the &quot;Illuminati&quot; is not a real thing...I gave you a history resource. And yet, here you are calling me crazy and stupid for providing you with evidence and information to back up my claim and stance. </p>

<p>And on top of that, you are in a sub dedicated to discussing &quot;conspiracy&quot;...what else did you expect? </p>

<p>Now, I have refrained from belittling you, calling you stupid, etc. Because I am trying to have a discussion. Sadly, you have gotten very defensive when I provide you with information. That is the same type of ignorance that causes people to think the earth is flat, climate change is a hoax, sexuality is a choice, etc.</p>

<p>And finally, no. you cant make any word or phrase work into any numerical value you choose using the language of gematria. Yes, you can assign numbers how you personally want but there is a method and particular way those who practice gematria do so. Just the same as using the correct order of operation in a math equation. You could change the order however you personally want but if you are not doing so by the correct &quot;order of operation&quot; the end result is incorrect... </p>

Teenagers are just as responsible for their actions as anyone else. By holding them to a lower standard we do young people an immense disservice preparing them for adult life. I’d judge a 50 year old the same way. Do you mind if I ask why you think he should be shielded from criticism because of his age?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or PERHAPS he&#39;s a kid who&#39;s grown up with media oversaturating every possible space and moment of his existence. A kid who&#39;s grown up with reality television SO overwhelming, it got an asshole elected President. A kid who&#39;s had a cell phone (like every other kid) that allows him to record himself on a constant basis.</p>

<p>A kid like that--who may ACTUALLY have an opinion--on what happened is VERY likely to utilize the very media he&#39;s grown up watching and understanding has impact--to try and get his message across.</p>

<p>There&#39;s one version of this story (yours) where there&#39;s some crisis actor and/or manipulative little shit that is trying to change this country in a way that you don&#39;t agree with. So you&#39;re forced to attack the kid to attempt to push the agenda off of what it actually should be--what to do about violence in this country.</p>

<p>There&#39;s another version where a 17-year-old kid got caught (like a ton of others) in a fucking bloodbath and decided to do something about it. And because he&#39;s a &quot;kid of an FBI&quot;, he actually has some idea of what the fuck he&#39;s talking about and has an opinion on gun control that he feels strongly enough about to attempt to use the particular moment of tragedy as the ONLY chance he may ever have to alter something.</p>

<p>Of the two, I know which one I believe is true. Then again, I happen to remember how zealous I was about EVERYTHING at 17.</p>

<p>Yes, people aren&#39;t attacking his message. They are attacking him. Calling him every &quot;liberal smear&quot; they can think of and making death threats towards him. </p>

<p>How is promoting something you believe in, wrong? It&#39;s only wrong because you don&#39;t agree with it and you can&#39;t see past your own bias. He just watched classmates and relatives be gun down and now he, as an average citizen, is just speaking out about what he experienced. </p>

<p>No different than what anyone else is doing. Seems like you only support speaking out when it agrees with you. And anything that doesn&#39;t is wrong. Just a thinly veil attempt to scare and silence him because the alt-right doesn&#39;t agree with him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is literally the foundation of all political action. We use events and experiences to shape and mold our discourse. You know, the same way Trump uses crimes committed by minorities to push his anti-immigration agenda. I could literally give you thousands of examples where events lead to action.</p>

<p>Fair enough. And I tend to agree with you anyways, in regards to no using tragedies to draft legislation. Using 9/11 to push the Patriot Act was one of the most horrendous things done to the American population. Politicians of every affiliation love to use reactionary hysteria after an event to push their agenda. It&#39;s as old as governance itself. And you are right not support it. It&#39;s a manipulation tactic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The part that gets me in the end is how hard the media will try and spin it into &quot;crisis actors&quot; and the implications that a crisis actor is someone who is a career crisis actor that is going around doing a bunch of crisis acting.</p>

<p>Iv&#39;e not seen anyone claim that but CNN and other news outlets, all the shit i see is people pointing the reality CNN glosses over, that this isn&#39;t just some 17 year old kid talking from the heart.</p>

<p>Hes a kid with aspirations, a cause and a fire in his heart. That much we know, and it&#39;s when you put all the pieces together it does appear that maybe his drive is not in response to his trauma but the same reasons that drive most of us politically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree with you, but here something people should know</p>

<p>apparently IMDB is like a wiki, where anyone can edit it</p>

<p>after the &quot;shooter&quot; shot up CPP, there was an entry made on IMDB for this guy, and he was credited with acting in a movie called </p>

<p><em>Something About Pizza</em> </p>

<p>which was supposedly released some years previously </p>

<p>so i went hunting high and low for this movie <em>Something About Pizza</em> and it turns out that it only exists within the context of this IMDB website</p>

<p>in the meantime, everyone is running around saying the shooter is an actor, and pointing at the IMDB as their source, </p>

<p>this is deliberate disinfo, put out there to discredit critics and researchers </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many potential reasons for this.  He could be in shock.  It could be &quot;not real&quot; for him yet.  His adrenaline could still be pumping, making him act in a more &quot;manic&quot; way as opposed to frightened and weepy.  He may not yet know the full extent of what happened.  He could be nervous to be on camera, and THAT adrenaline is overriding his grief.  He could be bordering on hysterics.  Teenagers are emotionally immature still, and therefore may react in a way a more mature person would find odd, simply because they can&#39;t quite process their emotions yet. People react to tragedy in different ways, and catching him in a moment where he doesn&#39;t seem upset doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t go home and break down later.  </p>

<p>I was 15 when my uncle died, and when my dad told me, I started laughing.  Internally I was screaming because we were really close, but externally I was laughing harder than I ever did before.  I couldn&#39;t control it.  So who knows what&#39;s going on inside this kid&#39;s head, especially if he&#39;s trying to act differently than he feels because he knows he&#39;s on camera.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said he or anyone is perfect. What I am saying, however, is that right or wrong he&#39;s trying to solve a problem and make a difference. Meanwhile all you can do is bitch about it from the sidelines. You are truly worth less than nothing.</p>

<p>And your tell is obvious. You project way too much insecurity. I never said anything about Russians or Nazis. And it&#39;s not at all uncommon for someone to want to make a difference in response to living through a tragedy. Some people are capable of doing things for reasons other than fame/attention. What you do is you take your own stupid, selfish thoughts and assume that they must be true for everyone else. You lack the empathy and/or intelligence (my money is on &quot;and&quot;) to consider the possibility that maybe these students genuinely want to change the world for the better.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s been a few of the Parkland students who are actually pro-2A and have been speaking out against more gun control and focusing on other solutions. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re just as angry at those kids, right? Of course you&#39;re not. I can see right through you, and it&#39;s fucking repulsive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree with the friends part; my highschool was 300 people and i couldn&#39;t go through a list of names and tell you who even a quarter of them were. There&#39;s a chance they barely knew the victims, because, im my opinion, the people that were ACTUALLY their friends, would be shocked/heartbroken/grieving. He also had a video on YT where he convinced some girl that he had shot his friend; from like a year ago, making his point on gun control rather moot to me. It&#39;s okay to joke about something that serious until it happens, right? Based solely from his old videos, and how much attention he has in the media, it seems pretty safe to say he&#39;s the type of preppy fuck who&#39;d gladly capitalize on the death of kids he barely knew</p>

<p>You should stop yourself right there when you admit to attacking a child, especially one who&#39;s been in a school shooting.</p>

<p>Just because they don&#39;t meet your personal requirements for activism doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re &quot;using the deaths of 17 children for personal profit.&quot; It doesn&#39;t matter if they hated all 17 of the shooting victims before 2/14. They were there and they&#39;re fighting to prevent the next one. Maybe they&#39;re right, maybe they&#39;re wrong. Maybe there will be big changes, or maybe nothing will happen.</p>

<p>But either way, it&#39;s a god damned disgrace that someone like yourself will indignantly pass judgment on them just because you&#39;ve committed yourself to this conspiracy bullshit. I get it: they&#39;re out there trying to make a change, and you&#39;re just impotently sitting in your computer chair doing nothing with your life except attacking those who are trying to. It&#39;s fucking pathetic. Grow the fuck up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t care using the death of 17 people you don&#39;t even no personally for personal gain makes you a scumbag piece of s*** in my book regardless if your kid and adult or a senior citizen it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>Okay so let me ask you a question if they&#39;re really anti-gun show me one instance before the school shooting where they had any sort of anti-gun activism so they&#39;re using a situation that occurred to become famous that&#39;s it they&#39;re not activist theyre opportunist and of story.</p>

<p>No no they&#39;re not making a change there just whining complaining to try to become famous that&#39;s it that&#39;s all that&#39;s going on I don&#39;t know maybe they should be talking about how the county sheriff department didn&#39;t do their job and investigating students who are committing crimes.</p>

<p>Maybe we should look at the children who bullied the emo gazebo in school which Nicholas Cruze used to sit at maybe we should look at the kids who ostracized Nicholas Cruise because you don&#39;t know what he was like I did so obviously you&#39;re admitting that you ostracized him good job Emma Gonzalez.</p>

<p>Maybe we should blame the FBI for getting such an in-depth tip from a person saying these guys going to shoot somebody up his mom just died he&#39;s really on edge he just bought a bunch of guns with money you got from her death.</p>

<p>Guns don&#39;t kill people a gun didn&#39;t kill 17 people at that high school it was a human being who killed 17 people it was a police force who killed 17 people it was the FBI who killed 17 people it was the student themselves who killed 17 people.</p>

<p>Maybe they should first not be arsehole children ostracizing other kids through bullying maybe they should hold their police force accountable their National Intelligence agencies accountable instead of putting blame into a little tool that can protect your life if somebody breaks in your house trying to rape your mother your father you your sister your daughter your wife your husband your gay lover.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Okay so let me ask you a question if they&#39;re really anti-gun show me one instance before the school shooting where they had any sort of anti-gun activism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a remarkably stupid thought. When people experience tragic events, it tends to change them. Maybe they were casually in favor of gun control before, maybe they didn&#39;t have any thoughts on the matter. It&#39;s unimportant.</p>

<p>And wouldn&#39;t it be more opportunist if they had been heavily pro-gun reform before the shooting? By your own ridiculous logic, that would appear to be more opportunistic.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to read the rest of your TL;DR rant until you can explain your first point or take it back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not right or left. Both sides are fucking morons.</p>

<p>And yes there was probably a second shooter who just blended in like cruz.</p>

<p>Unless the women who said she was beside him when she heared bullets was lying. Theres some evidence of a second shooter.</p>

<p>Who easier to manipulate a loser then a women. The things ppl do for pussy.</p>

<p>They are opportunists. Thry blame guns not the police who waited outside as people died. Not the police who didnt have a record on cruz. Not the fbi who didnt investigate a huge tip.</p>

<p>Did you read the transcript of that tip?</p>

<p>Now if they blamed all those things and guns id give them more credence now they just opportunistic assholes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All right, first off I apologize for getting heated. It just infuriates me how people like yourself go after the victims of a shooting. They&#39;ve been through a traumatic event and now you want to make their lives worse because their lived experience is at odds with your political beliefs? But I can see that there&#39;s a difference between you speaking an opinion out loud (even if it is a stupid one) and those who harass the family of a murdered student so I shouldn&#39;t conflate you and that. You&#39;re right that the police and FBI fucked up royally. I&#39;m in 100% agreement with you there.</p>

<p>But do you have any idea how chaotic a scene like a mass shooting is? People running in terror everywhere, cops desperately trying to maintain order and find the shooter, paramedics trying to tend to the wounded...it&#39;s a fucking nightmare. If you try to piece together what happened afterward using witnesses, there&#39;s going to be inconsistencies. People&#39;s minds aren&#39;t objective video cameras, especially not in such an extremely stressful situation. In every single event like that you&#39;re going to be able to find some random clip of a girl saying &quot;I thought I saw two people.&quot; It doesn&#39;t mean that THERE WERE TWO SHOOTERS AND IT&#39;S ALL A CONSPIRACY.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t you see how you&#39;re being used? Gun control discussions aside, some people with strong political opinions have convinced themselves that these types of mass shootings just don&#39;t happen. Doesn&#39;t it seem odd to you that places like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and Infowars and all the other right-wing shitholes never seem capable of accepting that a single person could be deranged and have easy access to weapons used to kill lots of people in a short amount of time? That kind of thing goes against their narrative, so instead they start with their own baseless assumption (&quot;this was a hoax!&quot;) and work backwards. They try to find any little inconsistency like the clip you mentioned and then point to it as hard proof that there&#39;s a shady conspiracy underway. Sadly, people like yourself fall for it every time. It&#39;s amazing how good humans are at self-deception, and it&#39;s ironic when it&#39;s always the ones who claim to be seeking the &quot;truth&quot; while dismissing those who point out their faulty logic as &quot;sheeple.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know there is no clip of someone saying they thought they saw two people there&#39;s a clip of a woman saying she was standing beside Nicholas Cruise talking to him saying I thought you would be the school shooter while someone is shooting up the school.</p>

<p>Sorry you think there&#39;s zero possibility that there was a second shooter who managed to slip in with the crowd and nobody noticed I mean do you recall how they caught Nicholas Cruz he was walking away from the school by himself.</p>

<p>Now if he made it that far how far would somebody else make it if they just Blended in with the crowd of the school after dropping all their body armor in a staircase.</p>

<p>Now we have someone saying that they were wearing a lot of body armor okay that&#39;s one view point then we have someone saying they were standing beside Cruise while hearing gunshots.</p>

<p>So that brings us to the scenario that there are two Shooters one was wearing armor to protect themselves so nobody could see who they were and the other one was Cruz who didn&#39;t give a shit or he was a patsy.</p>

<p>The difference is I don&#39;t accept the truth I think of the other possibilities and if you don&#39;t think it&#39;s a possibility that somebody else was also a school shooter at that school who then Blended in with the crowd successfully as opposed to Nicholas Cruise who managed to leave the school and walk down the street where were the police how can the shooter himself leave the school and walk out?</p>

<p>Just remember that they found Nicholas Cruz walking away from the school how did he exit the school how did he manage to walk away from the school?</p>

<p>Now if you want a real conspiracy hugs father recruited his son and their cousin to help engineer a school shooting and then try to take people&#39;s guns away so the woman probably started hitting on cruise who then she manipulated to do it together you know then they shot up the school one was wearing body armor he just went whatever one ditch the body armor in the stairwell and then just mixed with her classmates you know mix with her cousin or whatever you like oh yeah we were together the whole time.</p>

<p>Did law enforcement agencies take samples from every single student to see if any of them had gunpowder residue on their hands?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you think that should be the main thing you do after you find out that the school shooter tri-tip mix in with the crowd and vacate the building which she did successfully to the point where he was walking down the sidewalk where he was apprehended?</p>

<p>I mean that would just be smart police work right have every student and test their hands for gun residue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>some backstory</p>

<p>these fake shootings have been going on for decades, even in Australia</p>

<p>at one time, knowledge that these were fake shootings was fringe</p>

<p>but with each new fake shooting, a few more people wake up to the propaganda</p>

<p>and it seems we have reached a tipping point in public opinion, </p>

<p>where the majority of observers instinctively rejects these fake shooting narratives</p>

<p>the majority of observers no longer need mountains of incontrovertible evidence, because they have already been convinced by previous fake shootings </p>

<p>so now the majority instinctively watches for how the media and politicians react, what the buzz words are, who the talking heads are, what their talking points are</p>

<p>the public no longer needs to be convinced that DH is an actor of some sort, because we have seen this same M.O. played out too many times, and nobody is falling for it anymore</p>

<p>in times past, the story tellers could baffle us with mountains of evidence, which kept us busy for many years </p>

<p>in the meantime, the administrations change, the officials change, and the perps rotate out </p>

<p>so now when these fake shootings happen, the public hardly even looks at the evidence, and goes straight to the story tellers themselves </p>

<p>and that would be DH</p>

<p>the way the pubic sees it, these fake shootings are a direct infringement on the 2nd amendment </p>

<p>basically, they are waging war against the US constitution, which is treason and punishable </p>

<p>the text of the 2nd amendment reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where is the ACLU? supposedly their only client is the Bill of Rights </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, the BMB was a pre planned mass casualty drill, that had been conducted annually under the DHS program called Urban Shield</p>

<p>as part of the plan, they were going to use very realistic looking victims, to make up for the fact that nobody saw any victims at the Sandy Hook hoax </p>

<p>this particular false flag was set up to have a social media aspect to it, so they could hone their skills on identifying the loudest doubters, defending the official story, and censoring content </p>

<p>what they didn&#39;t anticipate was that they would lose control of the narrative, and it snowballed bigger and bigger every day, until it almost reached a critical mass</p>

<p>and then the establishment covered it up / forum slide by faking a Tornado in Moore OK, and a fertilizer plant explosion in Texas</p>

<p>part of the BMB plan was to have 2 very similar looking suspects, and then present a lot of compelling info to the public to make them believe that the 1st suspect (Sunil Tripathi) was the perp. </p>

<p>Later, the Sunil Tripathi look-alike Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was ID&#39;ed, </p>

<p>and the false leads we were fed about Sunil Tripathi were used to discredit online skeptics and researchers</p>

<p>and Sunil Tripathi has been used to discredit reddit ever since the BMB </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never seen a response like this in the aftermath of a tragedy. Reddit, Google, Youtube, Facebook are deleting posts and channels and threads just for asking questions. Since when are we not allowed to ASK FUCKING QUESTIONS. You should question everything, all the time, and seek out truth. And now we have the Orwellian heavy hand of censorship coming down on us hard. We have no freedom of speech, we never did. We have no freedoms left, they are slowly chipping away at our rights, and not one person seems to give a fuck about that. I&#39;m mad as hell, and im done participating in these online communities that appear on the surface to be pro freedom of speech and pro free thought. This subreddit use to be about searching for truth, now its about conforming to a narrative, and fuck that. I&#39;ll think what I want to think, I&#39;ll ask the fucking questions that I want answers to. Fuck the Mods, and Fuck the Admins, and Fuck every user here that can&#39;t see what is really going on. I&#39;m out, ban me if you want, I don&#39;t give a flying fuck. </p>

Those who control the media are now tech companies and the govt will willingly cede all power to them simply because they don&#39;t understand it. Then they may blame them like they did with Facebook, but nobody tries to reign Facebook in. They simply want to make sure amateur sleuthing has no real world impact.</p>

<p>He did the interviews and stuff and now he&#39;s probably getting hundreds of death threats and  abuse from the cretins who love on 4chan, t_d, other troll-right pages. </p>

<p>In your opinion, when is his previously semi-public online persona no longer an excuse to abuse him? When he&#39;s killed himself? Will that be the time Reddit call it?</p>

<p>Doxxing is the ultimate internet bullying, and seldom does the original doxxer take ownership and the dredges of the internet anonymously abuse somebody. Only when the victim breaks down, does anyone say, &quot;oh, we probably shouldn&#39;t have let everyone abuse that person&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you are doing this, I&#39;m just saying, that even though he previously disclosed his own identity, once he once to reclaim anonymity, he has every right to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not only that, but if the kid is an actor and is going to be in town (on vacation, per se), it makes for a cleaner story because the kid isn&#39;t local. Nobody can do a follow up or prove that the entire situation was planted for content. It&#39;s actually done quite often - relying on the public for a daily show that has hard deadlines is a dangerous game. What if they don&#39;t show up? What if the story changes when the cameras show up? There are too many variables, especially with crazy people wanting their 5 minutes of fame on the local newscast....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s about the messaging or &#39;divide &amp; conquer&#39;... I think it&#39;s about entertainment. They want people to watch the news, and getting a group of actors to create some drama that has little to no impact on anybody is an easy task compared to managing public talent. Most people work and are busy and don&#39;t drop everything because the local news calls them about something - we all have bills to pay. Sometimes its just easier to plan it out yourself, and in the end the product is more polished as well.</p>

<p>The messaging stuff is just the gravy. I think it&#39;s done mostly for ratings and advertising revenue TBH...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the way I see it. Not everything people ask or discuss is meant to be taken as 100% irrefutable fact, but those who spread dissent take it that way and then use that to create a strawman argument- acting as if we&#39;re saying we&#39;re 100% right about any thought we post about even though we&#39;re not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you mean, but if we make a post linking to his Twitter page and something happens, it really doesn&#39;t look good for this community. </p>

<p>A myriad of different stories? You mean the lifeguard thing a few years ago and the school shooting that just happened? </p>

<p>I agree that it&#39;s not doxxing to look up someone&#39;s Twitter account. People have the resources to do that. Let&#39;s not link to it though. </p>

<p>I understand that with other shootings there has been a lot of secrecy and well informed suspicion on our part. This is not one of those cases. There&#39;s nothing suspicious about this shooting. Everything is consistent. People hate having to deal with and accept the harsh realities of the world, so they look for simple answers, but from the outside it looks like some insane inability to empathize - and I think that&#39;s accurate.</p>

<p>Sure, let&#39;s talk about the facts, ask questions, etc., but turning the victims into subjects of personal scrutiny, as if they had done something wrong, is completely fucking insane. </p>

<p>All I can say is that from what I have seen, I strongly disagree. We can at least agree on that.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>who is doing this? The kid was only identified. I havent&#39; called for anybody to reach out to him or harass him - that would be gross. </p>

<p>so what exactly is &#39;turning victims into objects of personal scrutiny&#39;? What do you mean by that? </p>

<p>Of course there are still questions, of course there are inaccuracies. If &quot;CIA men&quot; were in the school, I would imagine their presence wouldn&#39;t be obvious to the students.</p>

<p>If you look hard enough at any situation you can start to paint a picture to support your beliefs - that&#39;s why flat earth is starting to be a thing.</p>

<p>&quot;Turning victims into objects of personal scrutiny,&quot; what part of this do you need clarification on, especially given the context of the original post and the rest of our conversation...?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh please most of that whole thing was overblown and became more of a political thing than anything else.</p>

<p>Who did I accuse of anything here? Did I call for vigilante justice? The kid is willfully putting up his videos and seeking out media attention. There is nothing wrong with looking at what he presented - no trust is being broken nor is anybody trying to &#39;doxx&#39; this guy. You can&#39;t dox someone who puts themselves out there willingly.</p>

<p>Nice concern trolling tho. This isn&#39;t nearly the same situation, and what happened to Sunil Tripathi was horrible and gross. It was back when it happened and it is now, but that is not at all relevant to this subject.</p>

<p>You seem to really be grinding me for conflict, so let&#39;s entertain your angst: since it seems to be the crux of your frustration in this exchange, what do you find compelling about a 17-year old in high school self-describing himself as a 17-year old high school student?</p>

<p>Me?  I don&#39;t find that indicative of anything out of the ordinary.  Part of being critical is the ability to analyze evidence and determine if it means anything.  Dare I suggest, even making a mockery of real conspiracy.  Hence my quip.</p>

<p>You dont&#39; know shit - you are just speculating like I am. My point is purely that he doesn&#39;t seem genuine in his interviews, his father used to work for the FBI (who&#39;s in a shitload of trouble right now), and his previous &#39;news story&#39; is exactly the type of story that a local news affiliate will hire an actor for in order to produce content (I&#39;ve worked in media - that is completely a thing that happens quite often. It&#39;s hard to trust strangers under deadlines.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand if DH wanted to remain private out of the public controversy.  As such, reddit is correct in protecting his account and his information.  However, as DH seems to have continued on Twitter and elsewhere in a public capacity, then he&#39;s basically opening himself up, and its no longer about &quot;DOXing&quot;, but about discussing a public figure that wants to stay public.  Twitter, reddit and Facebook banning people from mentioning him once he is functioning in the public spotlight, would amount to censorship and would have nothing to do with protecting user identity or private life.</p>

<p>DH should really retreat from the public spotlight if he values his privacy.  The whole doxing and shaming by social media companies is just a cover for trying to control an out of control narrative that they wish to manipulate.  Those who wish to preserve their rights are correct to fight back. 
 Clearly this is all about playing on people&#39;s emotions to advance an agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree with the friends part; my highschool was 300 people and i couldn&#39;t go through a list of names and tell you who even a quarter of them were. There&#39;s a chance they barely knew the victims, because, im my opinion, the people that were ACTUALLY their friends, would be shocked/heartbroken/grieving. He also had a video on YT where he convinced some girl that he had shot his friend; from like a year ago, making his point on gun control rather moot to me. It&#39;s okay to joke about something that serious until it happens, right? Based solely from his old videos, and how much attention he has in the media, it seems pretty safe to say he&#39;s the type of preppy fuck who&#39;d gladly capitalize on the death of kids he barely knew</p>
