       Hey everybody, long time lurker first time poster. In the wake of this Florida shooting/renewed gun control debate in the US, I feel like there is an angle being overlooked (am a Canadian living in Europe, so have a bit of an outsider view here)
      </p>
      <p>
       America is one of if not the largest weapons manufacturing countries in the world, both on a military scale and a consumer one. Why isn’t the idea that these companies are suppressing gun control via a constitutional abuse/purposeful misinterpretation to keep large profit margins being talked about more? 
Why aren’t we talking about how this feeding of weapons into the American population gives police more leeway, and budget, to militarize and inflict what they will on the people (you guys definitely have a higher murder-by-cop rate than countries with tighter laws, and at least some of those has got to come from a cop’s fear of being shot at themselves)? 
Why isn’t this gun control issue looked at as something that is actually being used in the same way as other things (identity politics for example) to divide and conquer, with an added bonus of enhancing intense suspicion of your fellow citizens?
      </p>
      <p>
       Genuinely curious as to why people would trust companies that profit off of violence and fear to be integral parts of a call to arms against tyranny, when this gives as much excuse to commit tyranny as taking away guns would allegedly enable it.

       On one minor point, guns don't really make us more free as much as they provide at least some means of defending ourselves if say the government wants to send us all to FEMA camps (or some other tyrannical scheme).  Whether the police are militarized doesn't really matter, because any large scale tyranny would have military involvement.

       Fair point, and is probably the most valid. Maybe gun control counts as part of this, but creeping tyranny seems a bit more likely then immediate concentration camps and a bit harder to fight off in the traditional sense?
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record I don’t think all guns should be banned or anything like that, just seems that the status quo is used to abuse as well

       I don't agree that opposing gun control "gives as much excuse to commit tyranny" as gun control does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps if there weren't a never-ending parade of corrupt government entities perpetrating false flag attacks, pushing propaganda, drug running, and all other manner of evil corruption, people might be more amenable to your arguments. But in the current context, sure the companies are not angels, but at least they're not overtly evil.

       Check out the NSSF. They represent around 8000 gun and ammo manufacturers along with weapons dealers and shooting ranges.
      </p>
      <p>
       '99-2011 they spent $100,000 - $500,000 dollars a year on lobbying.  Usually around $120,000 in that time with some spikes. After Sandy Hook they suddenly spiked and the last 3 years have spent over $3.2 million per year on lobbying.

       In short, everyone likes to talk about the NRA and such because yes, they spend a lot of money and put out some crazy shit. In recent years NSSF has nearly caught them in yearly spending on lobbying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Opinion time: I totally agree with you OP. Gun manufacturers make bank on fear and are a big (often overlooked) part of the fight against gun control.

       The problem is the US government is mind-blowingly corrupt.  They want a disarmed populace solely so that they can continue to be corrupt without fear of retaliation.  Our history is full of founding fathers speaking out about using guns to fight a corrupt government.  We aren't quite there yet, but due to the efforts of our government that day is rapidly approaching.  This is why every time a school shooting occurs, it is viewed as an opportunity to disarm us and finally allow this government to be the world tyrannical force that it really wants to be.  The world should pray that Americans are never disarmed.  Your countries are waiting for us to be disarmed.  Once it's done, it will be impossible to stop the enslavement of the human species.

       Not at all.  They want an armed and belligerent population at each other's throats so they can continue to be corrupt without fear of retaliation - and that's exactly what they have.

       Right, that's why we were one justice from having the second amendment re-written to remove all guns from Americans.  They want shootings to occur IOT make a case for disarming this country.  At a minimum, ban the guns that would be most effective in fighting tyranny.

       The thing is that there are countries that frequently have citizen lead overthrows of govt due to corruption/bullshittery/bad intent. France is on it’s 5th version of a republic, not because of foreign invasion (usually) but because every 60 years or so some group gets pissed and breaks things, and current govts still fear this mechanism. Almost never are personal weapons at the centre of these, it’s just masses of people flipping out, and when/if they’re given the whiff of grapeshot, it makes the govt position weaken and inevitably leads to a change.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last time the US federal govt was challenged (rightly or wrongly) by a group of armed, dissatisfied people, it lead to the civil war. Which ended up w more federal control and a bunch of dead people (also a massive reduction in slavery which was good, but this was never going to a perfect example).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the essays I just really find the tactics and strategy for defending liberty to be interesting and important as hell, and it’s important to challenge my preconceptions with other points of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR other govts get changed more often through unarmed citizen resistance than American fed govt and I am sorry for being longwinded

       It's kind of like if you like to listen to and own music, and there's a powerful music industry lobbying to make it easier for you to obtain and own more music. You wouldn't really care much, you know? Americans like owning guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm certain arms manufacturers lobby for lax gun laws and are at least a spark to a lot of these "anti-tyranny" movements. But I think apart from this, gun rights are legitimately
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       important to many Americans, and there are more logical arguments that justify keeping the right to own firearms vs giving it up (in my opinion). I think a lot of the people on this sub tend to agree that gun rights are a good thing.

       If corrupt people profit from a right doesn't mean that right is wrong. In US and only there the people have the right to defend from the government if it gets corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't have the weapons because is a nice hobby but because they need them to combat the government if necessary.

       If most of the gun owners actually know and understand this is debatable.

       I think you're on to something. It's not some grand conspiracy to take away our rights but rather an result of being the most militaristic nation to exist and being entirely driven by the military industrial complex. It's just a sad, sick deprived culture and country and we've only been driven further and further apart from one another over the past 30 years with the advent of the internet. America has very little genuine community or connections amongst it's people, add in millions of weapons that are only there for profit and this is what we get. Not to mention the police/security state we live in.

       Easy, once we are disarmed, we will be executed and round up by Mercenaries. They still need guns and supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who might be the Mercenaries?
      </p>
      <p>
       Diffrent sources all given the same uniform.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will be given a fake badge and authorization and wound up thinking we are the " terrorist"
      </p>
      <p>
       Possibly:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) MS 13
2) ISIS (bassically guns for hire)
3) militarized antifa
4) contractors
5) UN
      </p>
      <p>
       It will be a blurry mess. Their calculations only work if we're disarmed. Thats the easiest. Any other method will take too long and possibly The Awakening will happen faster than the execution.
