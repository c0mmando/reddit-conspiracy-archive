<li>The shooting took place on the 45th day of the year.</li>
<li>The school was named after the woman who fought against 
&quot;Draining the Swamp&quot; a long time ago.</li>
<li>After JFK was assassinated he was taken to Parkland Hospital.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are many more reasons this was a false flag but these 3 facts are not just a coincidence. I believe this was a message to Trump from the deep state cabal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for providing the coincidences though. I learned three new things today. edit: Two actually because I am super into JFK and knew about how he was taken to Parkland- At gunpoint if I remember correctly? Or maybe the FBI or whoever came after and took his body back to Maryland. It was something sketchy like that lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being the 45th day means absolutely nothing. Valentine‚Äôs day falls on February 14th every year. Did you know New Year‚Äôs day is the first day of ever year? HOLY SHIT CONSPIRACY!</p>

<p>Yes, did you know it‚Äôs possible for there to be a school and a hospital named the same thing? All that proves is that there are two cities/areas named Parkland. Lol. (I bet there‚Äôs hundreds others)</p>

<p>And of course the conservationist was against ‚Äúdraining the swamp‚Äù and clearing out the everglades for land development. She is a conservationist. That‚Äôs literally what their job entails. It‚Äôs even in their job name. Lol.</p>

<p>See how dumb that sounds? I mean honestly lol. Nothing wrong with a good conspiracy but posting something as silly as this just gives a bad name to conspiracy theorists who actually graduated from high school, and don‚Äôt believe everything on InfoWars.</p>

<ol>
<li>45th day, Trump is 45th President (correct)</li>
<li>&quot;Parkland&quot; Hospital JFK assassination ---&quot;Parkland&quot; FL where the shooting took place. (correct)</li>
<li>Everglades can be refereed to as a swamp, who cares what her politics were. What was one of Trumps slogans during the campaign? &quot;Drain the Swamp&quot;. The lady was against &quot;Draining the Swamp. (correct)</li>
</ol>

<p>Like I said, you didn&#39;t debunk anything, especially because my post is about Symbolism. Isn&#39;t this a conspiracy page? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was incorrect in saying debunked, you‚Äôre right. It was more of giving the full story is what I meant. Of course you can‚Äôt argue with what OP said in terms of its truthfulness because it‚Äôs factually accurate information.

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re discussing symbolism so to outright say someone is wrong is sort of moot. In OP&#39;s view, Trump is being threatened by Deep Staters who have been traditionally known to use symbolism in their staged mass murder events. The three things OP pointed put fall right in line with the idea that there occultic, ritualistic secret society with a hand in major events. Do you even conspiracy?</p>
