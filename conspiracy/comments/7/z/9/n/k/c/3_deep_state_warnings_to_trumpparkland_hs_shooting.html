        The school was named after the woman who fought against 
"Draining the Swamp" a long time ago.

        After JFK was assassinated he was taken to Parkland Hospital.

      <p>
       There are many more reasons this was a false flag but these 3 facts are not just a coincidence. I believe this was a message to Trump from the deep state cabal.

       I just googled it and the Parkland Hospital JFK was sent to was named that because it was originally bought from the city to be a park. 🤣 We found our answer boys! JFK is the reason for mass shootings.

       Thanks for providing the coincidences though. I learned three new things today. edit: Two actually because I am super into JFK and knew about how he was taken to Parkland- At gunpoint if I remember correctly? Or maybe the FBI or whoever came after and took his body back to Maryland. It was something sketchy like that lol.

       Following this line of reason, I would assume that the "listening" meeting Trump held with former victims was a response to the deep state, with Point #5 "I hear you" acknowledging their message in this false flag

       Being the 45th day means absolutely nothing. Valentine’s day falls on February 14th every year. Did you know New Year’s day is the first day of ever year? HOLY SHIT CONSPIRACY!
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, did you know it’s possible for there to be a school and a hospital named the same thing? All that proves is that there are two cities/areas named Parkland. Lol. (I bet there’s hundreds others)
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course the conservationist was against “draining the swamp” and clearing out the everglades for land development. She is a conservationist. That’s literally what their job entails. It’s even in their job name. Lol.

       Did you know that racecar backwards is racecar?  I bet this has all been a conspiracy from NASCAR and Dale Earnhardt so that Obama can come and take your guns away. Makes sense, doesn’t it? I mean the proof is in the spelling I just showed you.

      <p>
       See how dumb that sounds? I mean honestly lol. Nothing wrong with a good conspiracy but posting something as silly as this just gives a bad name to conspiracy theorists who actually graduated from high school, and don’t believe everything on InfoWars.

        45th day, Trump is 45th President (correct)

       <li>
        "Parkland" Hospital JFK assassination ---"Parkland" FL where the shooting took place. (correct)
       </li>
       <li>
        Everglades can be refereed to as a swamp, who cares what her politics were. What was one of Trumps slogans during the campaign? "Drain the Swamp". The lady was against "Draining the Swamp. (correct)
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Like I said, you didn't debunk anything, especially because my post is about Symbolism. Isn't this a conspiracy page?

       I was incorrect in saying debunked, you’re right. It was more of giving the full story is what I meant. Of course you can’t argue with what OP said in terms of its truthfulness because it’s factually accurate information. What I was referring to was more about how three coincidences don’t really mean much. Especially when they aren’t provided the full story.

       We're discussing symbolism so to outright say someone is wrong is sort of moot. In OP's view, Trump is being threatened by Deep Staters who have been traditionally known to use symbolism in their staged mass murder events. The three things OP pointed put fall right in line with the idea that there occultic, ritualistic secret society with a hand in major events. Do you even conspiracy?
