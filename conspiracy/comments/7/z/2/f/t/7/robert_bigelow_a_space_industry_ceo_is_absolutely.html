I know this has nothing to do with political bullshit but hopefully there are still some longtime conspiracy sub users in here who still care about this as much as I do </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bigelow seems genuine, and his reply of &quot;I don&#39;t give a damn&quot; in regards to his statements about aliens and public perception said a lot about the veracity of his claims, I feel.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been reading and listening to nothing but podcasts and interviews about Skinwalker for the last few weeks - and I forgot how incredible the stories are.  Here&#39;s an interesting post about underground materials and a possible correlation:</p>

<p>&quot;If you check on Google Earth you will note that the Skinwalker ranch sits barely North of a major hydrocarbon production facility. Underground pools of oil or other types of hydrocarbon resource such as tar sands have been noted as locations for ancient peoples sacred sites as described by William Corliss in one of his last &#39;Science Frontiers&#39; publications so one could chalk this up as another indicator that something to do with underground oil or hydrocarbon resources helps in the production of spooky occurrences on the surface above them. It would be interesting to find if oil drillers and other workers in oil fields elsewhere also think that underground hydrocarbon deposits are related to an unusual level of what is best described as &#39;spooky&#39; behavior as exemplified by Skinwalker Ranch. I&#39;ve noticed elsewhere that Skinwalker ranch appears to be diminishing in activity, one has to wonder if the removal of the deposit underground is causing that lessening in activity.</p>

<p>Orbs are also associated with underground mineral deposits. In ancient times apparently one way to find a place to dig a mine in was to follow the orbs to the spot where they enter the ground. Digging right where the orbs entered the ground was how you started a new mine because the orbs presence indicated that there was one form or another of mineral deposit in the Earth below. Not just oil but also precious or practical metals such as Gold, Silver and Copper.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so heres my take... yes aliens are among us.  a soul takes on a body within a certain logos.  say arounnd our star ,as the logos. the earth then being a sub logos of the star.  the star being a sub-logos to our galactic group... and so on.  either way, larger or smaller in terms of sub logos.  </p>

<p>so of you are with me so far, an alien soul would chose the place of its landing and or incarnation. If that being, not of our logos, were to find a place here, on earth, i mean truly, to walk and live as a normal but probably different kind of person. Then to pass on in whichever way being appropriate and then veil themselves in this sliver of creation and be born as a wee baby.  This involves a forgetting and a potential loop in the path for the entity.  </p>

<p>for all intents and purposes that child growing as a person under the conditions presented is alien but completely human.  the growth of that individual then shapes the alien thought patterns into that of a person living and forgetting who and what their connection to the greater creation is.  the process of individualization becomes complete under this logos conditions. </p>

<p>so you see the conundrum.  if such aliens exist and remember who they were before the veiling of the mind by the bodies senses and emotions.  At that point yes aliens walk among us.  </p>

<p>the lightworkers go on about this often.  beings incarnated to aid in the transition and to find a place in this universe going forward.  some, are here to watch what the end results of their earlier efforts and gain wisdom.  some are here to mess with the order or clean up the problems.  some are here to make sure an imbalance is balanced.  </p>

<p>it is the truth we are here to find ourselves together in this space for a time. Alien or not, make the best of this time.  as it is compressing. things are going to move a lot faster.  most can not keep up.  </p>

<p>so, i call a bit of BS on anyone saying they are legitimate aliens walking around.  although im always open for a differing view.  breakaway civs, transcending beings.  old ones. leftover tech.  </p>

<p>them more time goes on them more comes into focus.  its nice to see people realizing that humans have been around for a lot longer than the church wanted everyone to know about.  we have an odd history.  </p>

<p>i only know what i know about the things i know about.  id like to meet dave wilcocks alien friend whos alleged to be one of the Ra entities from the Law of One.  I would have two questions one being an uncomfortable one.</p>

<p>i guess yeah aliens are us then.  plus the extended chaos of, whatever is passing for society at the moment.  it is great and terrible to watch all at the same time.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is “aliens” code for the Russian investigation or the Clinton Foundation? Oh right, this is the conspiracy sub. Seems like the last post about aliens was around the same time ET appeared in theaters. I’m still on the fence about aliens here on Earth. It’s a never ending battle for me going back and forth between believing and being skeptical. However, the odds of life existing elsewhere in the universe are exponentially high. Prominent figures announcing their belief in aliens always gets me revved up. Thanks for the post OP.</p>
