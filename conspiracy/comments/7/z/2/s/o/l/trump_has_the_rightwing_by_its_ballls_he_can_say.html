        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Historically it has been the libertarian right who have been the most fervent defenders of gun rights. Republicans have usually tried to appeal to the gunlobby and their base which is generally pro-gun. However, Trump has built enough loyalty that many on the right have betrayed all their principles. Look how many former Ron Paul supporters are now supporting this hysteric, interventionist authoritarian.</p>

<p>I am considering that Trump will use this unquestioning control over the right-wing to push gun control like America has never seen. And the right wing will lap it up because it&#39;s their Daddy Trump who is doing it.</p>

<p>Pretty much every actual leftist I&#39;ve encountered (I&#39;m a mutualist) is pro-gun, including fucking Marx himself. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To be able forcefully and threateningly to oppose this party, whose betrayal of the workers will begin with the very first hour of victory, the workers must be armed and organized. The whole proletariat must be armed at once with muskets, rifles, cannon and ammunition, and the revival of the old-style citizens’ militia, directed against the workers, must be opposed. </p>

<p>Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered; any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated, by force if necessary. The destruction of the bourgeois democrats’ influence over the workers, and the enforcement of conditions which will compromise the rule of bourgeois democracy, which is for the moment inevitable, and make it as difficult as possible</p>

<p>Trump is already planning a ban on bump stocks and strengthening background checks with plans to do more. So keep your eyes peeled since the change in rhetoric from his sheep should be hilarious. </p>
