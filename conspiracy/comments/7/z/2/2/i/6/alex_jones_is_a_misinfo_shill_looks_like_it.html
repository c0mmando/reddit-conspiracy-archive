        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Back in the day Alex Jones didnt subscribe to GOP or the DEMs. It was all an NWO plot for the sheeple. Remember? He was all about bringing those Tyrants to justice...Bush, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld etc... over 9/11 being an inside job. He built his career over it. Then the FEMA camps, Sandy Hook, Bin Ladens fake death. Remember all that? I remember other alt media channels calling him a shill. An agent of the NWO to mis lead the population. I thought it was all bullshit. Still do but AJ is becoming a GOP butt boy. A Trump butt boy. Its nothing but Trump this Trump that now. If 911 is an inside job then why is he not pressuring Trump to release the Truth about all that stuff AJ has been saying for tge past 15 years? I dont know anymore. Maybe we should all call in to his show and ask.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s a guy just like you and me.</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t have the money time and intelligence network that a government would have.  He produces his show off the money he makes hawking mediocre supplements.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why the titles of his videos are so click-baity and why when you do click one that sounds interesting you get mostly dickpill ads and promises that more is coming soon.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s also why he has little choice, if he wants to keep content coming out, other than to run with pretty much everything that comes his way regarding the deep state.  And I&#39;m sure that many if not most of the &#39;insider whistleblowers&#39; telling him stuff are plants from the deep state who knows that he can&#39;t really properly vet what&#39;s told to him becuase of a lack of resources.  </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t hold AJ responsible for being some sort of plant, but you&#39;re right to question the information you see in his show.  He does show up at a lot of things like Bildeburgers and other protest situations and I think that coverage is legit and important.</p>

<p>But yeah his show for the most part is a combination of disinfo he&#39;s being fed, infomercial, and a Trump pep-rally.</p>
