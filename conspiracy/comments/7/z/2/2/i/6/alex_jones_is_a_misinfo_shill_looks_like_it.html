       Back in the day Alex Jones didnt subscribe to GOP or the DEMs. It was all an NWO plot for the sheeple. Remember? He was all about bringing those Tyrants to justice...Bush, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld etc... over 9/11 being an inside job. He built his career over it. Then the FEMA camps, Sandy Hook, Bin Ladens fake death. Remember all that? I remember other alt media channels calling him a shill. An agent of the NWO to mis lead the population. I thought it was all bullshit. Still do but AJ is becoming a GOP butt boy. A Trump butt boy. Its nothing but Trump this Trump that now. If 911 is an inside job then why is he not pressuring Trump to release the Truth about all that stuff AJ has been saying for tge past 15 years? I dont know anymore. Maybe we should all call in to his show and ask.

       That is a continual problem... especially with young minds.

       But to say "if you don't like it don't watch" snacks of teenage girls defending the weak writing of twighlight.

       It is a trope that I hear far too often, although taken in a different vein here.

       Trump was on the show before and after the election. Trump is still fighting to keep his presidency and dumping the 9/11 files this soon is not in his interest. Has Alex become a shill or has the left just been too good of a target lately?

       I think the biggest tell he sold out is the fact it's almost been a decade since his last film, and alot of those should be mandatory CT watching.  Police State through Endgame were all pretty good and filled with tons of info.

       He's not "controlled opposition," he's just a loudmouth who sells vitamin supplements to morons. There's a lot of money to be made fleecing the dumbest Americans and he's unscrupulous enough to do it.

       The gold thing doesn't make sense to me. If something happens and our entire society collapses, what use is gold at that point? People will be bartering food, batteries, ammunition, Tide, and other consumables. Gold has virtually no practical uses in that situation.

       Gold will always be valuable. It is soft, pliable, doesn't rust or corrode, is an excellent conductor, and is scarce. Yet, while society and infrastructure is intact, crypto currencies will likely slowly drowned out the value of precious metals.

       Yeah it doesn't make change, he turned into a shill for the government in power. The only explanation that makes sense is that the ruskies got kompromat on him too.

       I don’t think he’s a disinfo shill, I think he gets it wrong sometimes innocently like msm is sometimes just getting it wrong and not always lying on purpose. Infowars has spread my videos in the past so if they are disinfo I guess that makes me a shill too. I’m tired of everything being a shill. Just do your own research, thats what everybody should be doing anyway.

       He's a guy just like you and me.
      </p>
      <p>
       He doesn't have the money time and intelligence network that a government would have.  He produces his show off the money he makes hawking mediocre supplements.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why the titles of his videos are so click-baity and why when you do click one that sounds interesting you get mostly dickpill ads and promises that more is coming soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also why he has little choice, if he wants to keep content coming out, other than to run with pretty much everything that comes his way regarding the deep state.  And I'm sure that many if not most of the 'insider whistleblowers' telling him stuff are plants from the deep state who knows that he can't really properly vet what's told to him becuase of a lack of resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't hold AJ responsible for being some sort of plant, but you're right to question the information you see in his show.  He does show up at a lot of things like Bildeburgers and other protest situations and I think that coverage is legit and important.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah his show for the most part is a combination of disinfo he's being fed, infomercial, and a Trump pep-rally.
