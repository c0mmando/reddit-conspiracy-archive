       The OP says some good things at first.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It's full of complete close minded fools as of late. Nothing is discussed openly and any one with the opinion even close to supporting a conspiracy theory (aka anti msm opinions) are down voted and have accounts take a diarrhea dump of their thoughts, suggestions, and opinions. What happened to friendly open discussion and debate? It's just a bunch of douchebags talking down to you and being over all passive aggressive assholes now.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The key to getting people's attention for your propaganda is to make the beginning true and resonate with your target audience. I totally agree with the OP's first part. Let's look a little further though.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This is the conspiracy sub, why the fuck are we all arguing over who did what left said this right said that, Russia this, trump that Hillary this, Bill that... Fucking give your head a shake people. This is a sub that should reject all politicians. The game is rigged, there is no white horse leader for America...current or in the future.. ..its over. The game is rigged and has been. I've been going to this sub for years. If you have too, then you see what I'm talking about.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       When the establishment shills or "Obama bots" used to come to this sub they would always have the message trust government they are here to help you. What do you expect them to say when it is NOT their person in power? Of course they want you to reject all politicians, really just one though. Let's keep reading.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This sub really started to nose dive around the DNC leaks, Seth Rich, and most importantly.... The podesta emails in regards to 'pizzagate' it saddens me as a critical thinker that this sub is at its lowest point in its history. Just rantin' feel free to down vote to oblivion or discuss using our brains.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Oh so after all that there are conspiracies we are not allowed to look at. That is very strange to criticize critically thinking people for looking at conspiracies involving the DNC.  Why would the OP do that? Oh I see where this is going. "Checks the comments" yep it's a partisan circle jerk alright.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just another cleverly disguised partisan post.

       we're seeing an empire in it's last days and a lot of "middle men" are afraid.

       I think about those things too...but I am also concerned with the Oceans instability and the sea floor rift growth.  Not that anywhere is 'safe' per say...I mean it is all just a crap shoot...thanks for answer, I hope you have honed your survival skills (growing food) already, I spent three and a half years learning to live with no elect. no running water and no internet.  I feel sorry for people who have no skills at this point.

I am not sure how to correlate this to the coming Ice Age but I suppose that depends on how everything plays out...it seems like we have many different 'astonishingly catastrophic potentials all lining up like planes flying into LAX.  It is fun to speculate on 'what to do' and 'gamble with our lives', using skills, resources and ability to plan, though isn't it.  ;)

       Kind of like Jordan Peterson's advice to 'go clean your room if you want to get your life in order'...lol...I suppose, yes, but I think it has more to do with a will to survive than anything else...I would estimate that 95+/-% of the global pop has no more will to survive...it is nice to speak to someone who still desires to survive, just so you know.  Most people are mostly dead at this point and I am not really sure why...perhaps too much tv lolz

       I just read it as being provocative when OP alluded to certain conspiracies being the downfall of the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those conspiracies are huge,important and should be above politics.

       They should be classed as some of the biggest conspiratorial crimes of our lifetimes.

       I understand that sentiment, but there has to be hope. The fundamental government was well designed IMO. You don't kill you kid when he gets a cold. You work to make him healthy again.

       There is hope, and always is. I just don't see any hope here, in the US. The empire is crumbling, and I'm of the same sentinment as the founders of this country, who left their country to start something. That's where I think the hope is. Starting out fresh, with lessons learned. It was a great experiment, but, ultimately failed. Let's start again, but improved :)

       Ya but that didn't work out so great for Libya, Egypt, Ukraine.... The illuminati's whole philosophy revolves around building anew out of the ashes of the old. Without the constitution America will become just another slave country IMO.

       This is where I'm going to highly disagree with you, after researching International Law, the Constitution, and many other topics. We are a slave nation (via the 13/14th amendments), and the Constitution is basically null and void, because of International Treaties (which is why weed is illegal - UN treaty).
      </p>
      <p>
       They (TPTB) are toying with the American people. It's all smoke and mirrors. Not to even mention, the Constitution very well could've been a contract/compact, which only applies to the parties who signed said contract.
      </p>
      <p>
       I highly suggest looking into Lysander Spooner, and the Constitution of no authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, we've been lied to our whole lives, yo'.

        Oh so after all that there are conspiracies we are not allowed to look at. That is very strange to criticize critically thinking people for looking at conspiracies involving the DNC. Why would the OP do that? Oh I see where this is going. "Checks the comments" yep it's a partisan circle jerk alright.

       Noone is telling you not to look at it, in fact look at it as much as you want/like. But next time you do; please find the smallest piece of actual physical evidence, cause the circumstancial vague shit is really quite ofputting to people like me.
