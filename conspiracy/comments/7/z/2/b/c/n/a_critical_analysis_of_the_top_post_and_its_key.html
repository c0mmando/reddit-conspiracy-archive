        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The OP says some good things at first. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s full of complete close minded fools as of late. Nothing is discussed openly and any one with the opinion even close to supporting a conspiracy theory (aka anti msm opinions) are down voted and have accounts take a diarrhea dump of their thoughts, suggestions, and opinions. What happened to friendly open discussion and debate? It&#39;s just a bunch of douchebags talking down to you and being over all passive aggressive assholes now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The key to getting people&#39;s attention for your propaganda is to make the beginning true and resonate with your target audience. I totally agree with the OP&#39;s first part. Let&#39;s look a little further though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the conspiracy sub, why the fuck are we all arguing over who did what left said this right said that, Russia this, trump that Hillary this, Bill that... Fucking give your head a shake people. This is a sub that should reject all politicians. The game is rigged, there is no white horse leader for America...current or in the future.. ..its over. The game is rigged and has been. I&#39;ve been going to this sub for years. If you have too, then you see what I&#39;m talking about. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the establishment shills or &quot;Obama bots&quot; used to come to this sub they would always have the message trust government they are here to help you. What do you expect them to say when it is NOT their person in power? Of course they want you to reject all politicians, really just one though. Let&#39;s keep reading. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This sub really started to nose dive around the DNC leaks, Seth Rich, and most importantly.... The podesta emails in regards to &#39;pizzagate&#39; it saddens me as a critical thinker that this sub is at its lowest point in its history. Just rantin&#39; feel free to down vote to oblivion or discuss using our brains.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh so after all that there are conspiracies we are not allowed to look at. That is very strange to criticize critically thinking people for looking at conspiracies involving the DNC.  Why would the OP do that? Oh I see where this is going. &quot;Checks the comments&quot; yep it&#39;s a partisan circle jerk alright.</p>

<p>Just another cleverly disguised partisan post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is where I&#39;m going to highly disagree with you, after researching International Law, the Constitution, and many other topics. We are a slave nation (via the 13/14th amendments), and the Constitution is basically null and void, because of International Treaties (which is why weed is illegal - UN treaty). </p>

<p>They (TPTB) are toying with the American people. It&#39;s all smoke and mirrors. Not to even mention, the Constitution very well could&#39;ve been a contract/compact, which only applies to the parties who signed said contract. </p>

<p>I highly suggest looking into Lysander Spooner, and the Constitution of no authority.</p>
