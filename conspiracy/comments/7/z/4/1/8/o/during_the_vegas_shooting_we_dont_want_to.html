       Just search the hash tag no notoriety. The Board of Broadcast Governor's BBG and the 3 major media outlets decided it was bad to give the killer glorification and decided not to make it about guns or the killer. Here we are 4 months later and the news is giving the florida shooter glorification which has caused a spike in school threats... The media is abusing its piwer...

       Laws in Florida allow the media a lot more freedom to report on open cases, which is why FloridaMan is a meme.
      </p>
      <p>
       But regardless, I think that one bipartisan position that everyone has regardless of political affiliation is that the way the media handles situations like these is reckless and will kill people.

       Probably better to compare to the shooting in the Florida night club a while back then. I don't remember how that went. Anyhow, looser regulations are no justification for looser morals. If sop dictates not to broadcast every little tidbit because it glorifies the killer and causes an uptick in copy cat behavior, then fuck the media in Florida for being a bunch of cold blooded vampires.

       They're required to release all arrest info on adults. Hence why you hear more insane stories of arrests in Florida. I read yesterday that the LV sheriff released an 80 page report against protocol to stop all the stupid theorizing.

       the vegas shootign was an actual attempt at assasinating one of the princes of saudi arabia. Nobody wanted that mess to come up because it would put the cia and fbi in a lot of trouble for even allowing somethig nliek this to happen. the school shooting is just another way to push an agenda. kid shoots u pa school, lets use this to our advantage. flood the news with it. make it so its all people hear about. gun control gun control gun control. I keep tellign people who cry in the echo chamber for gun control, until the government , police, military, and any other third party entity set out to take my freedom, guns will always be a necessary tool.

       You shoot up the concert to distract law enforcment while partner goes and assassinates real targets. Similar to what Breivik did, blew up government building to distract from killing everyone on an island.

       Imo the answer is too complicated for any one person to understand. People might have part of the truth but not the complete truth because it is simply too complex. 
A.I. knows the answer to your question because it has analyzed the data and has the ability to sort and recommend a narritive for both events. This narritive to a human mind seems contradictory but makes sense to the A.I. that is shaping the narritive because it has analyzed the data and knows how the public as a whole will respond.

       since we are in r/conspiracy I will go one step further and speculate that is why they have been saving all the Facebook, twitter, email, Skype, and phone calls. 
Humans are complicated we do  not always do the rational thing, and A.I. needs all that data so it can understand human mind/decision making process.

       Real perpetrators don't commit suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Colorado abortion clinic killer was 'proud' of whom he killed. This son of a FBI agent is also 'proud' most like.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you kill for religious or political reasons, you want to share your side of the story. There is absolutely no reason to suicide. BUT if you are responsible for maintaining a lie, death is best, like Lee Oswald.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally, you don't commit mass murder with the expectation of not being caught or stopped, and nor do you commit lots of resources and planning to killing others, prior to suicide. If you objective is suicide, you only need 1 gun and 1 bullet. Any work beyond that is to 'send a message', in which case you'd likely prefer to give it yourself.

       What on earth are you basing this on? Killing yourself to avoid consequences for some large scale atrocity isn't uncommon at all. It's also not uncommon for people to want to take others with them when they die. And what about suicide bombers? Every piece of evidence available refutes what you just said. Was Columbine also a false flag?

       What OP is trying to say is that Lee Oswald was killed to keep him silent. Stephen Paddock was killed to keep him silent. 
If it's a conspiracy orchestrated by an unknown party with blame leveled on a single person, it'd be best to make sure this person can not talk after the fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       If "you're" responsible for maintaining a lie, "were" going to make sure "you" maintain that lie forever (by killing "you")

      <p>
       If "you" acted alone, "you're" more likely to want recognition or to explain "yourself" after the fact.

       The do donestic campaigns too. Pbs pri and msm all havr to give airtime to bbg through NDAA. After tge orlando shooting they wanted to not give airtime to domestic terrorism and mass killers. Unless its kids bc like Nancy Reagan did, the government and echelon will use "think of the children" to get unpopular or over reaching policies passed.

       Its funny CNN pushed no notoriety after the Florida pulse shooting and now after the Florida high school shooting they are doing everything they promised not to do because its a dumb ads white kid and not a Muslim baited by FBI... Like keep your promise CNN. And dumb fucks in this thread saying the vegas incident is different because its a different state while completely missing the fact the pulse night club was Florida too. It makes me think CNN has paid internet presence...
      </p>
      <p>
       Its super obvious that the ones who are benefiting from this are CNN and their conglomerate, Neoconservaliberal, very wealthy people scared of armed poor people, and the DNCs urban organization group. And since it works so well in their favor it feels inorganic and manufactured....

       We already have enough regulation and checks but democrats and republicans fail to implement them because their echelon buddies and themselves are heavily invested in these areas. Their golf buddy would not be happy if they hurt his income... Duopolies blow hard and its killing our country. The last time we were this divided, 4 parties popped up. This challenged power so we saw war and a reconsolidation in democrat republican with the parties switching to shake up identities. Money makes america great but also makes Americans suffer so a very select few can live like kings.

       Dude the Vegas sheriff wouldn't call Stephen paddock by his name, only the shooter. Now the Florida shooters name and picture are everywhere.

       Now there is a spike in school threats. Come on Agent Smith. You'll have to try harder than that.

       They are two different police departments, maybe they have different policies on whether or not to call the shooter by name?

      <p>
       Maybe each individual spokesman has the ability to mention the killers name or not?

       since we are in r/conspiracy I will go one step further and speculate that is why they have been saving all the Facebook, twitter, email, Skype, and phone calls. 
Humans are complicated we do  not always do the rational thing, and A.I. needs all that data so it can understand human mind/decision making process.
