    <div class="md"><p>Well some people just seem to not understand the difference between a theory and prove and fact, prove and possibility, and use the terms interchangably. But it has happend quite a few times to me in the last months that whenever calling someone out on this difference or asking for a source for what they believe to be fact, is seen as shilling. I think sourcing is a good habbit and I personally don&#39;t like attacking people based on their sources unless they are really, really shit (read: medium blogs, random private blogs, true pundit). I&#39;ll happily accept Breitbart and sometimes even more fringe extreme-rightwing media as long as they have a verifiable journalist with a name that wrote the article.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no such thing as absolute credibility. However some sources are more credible than others. Because apparently the first answer of OP did not suffice for you (or your keybord broke and you can now only type these eight words), I will help you identify the difference between how to identify a credible and a not so credible sources based on 2 examples: </p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/">https://www.bostonglobe.com/</a> good source! Why you might ask? Well first of all they a long history of groundbreaking journalism and have a ton of credibility, also everyone is aware of their track record and their journalists are held to a very high standard. </p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161115024211/http://wtoe5news.com/us-election/pope-francis-shocks-world-endorses-donald-trump-for-president-releases-statement/">https://web.archive.org/web/20161115024211/http://wtoe5news.com/us-election/pope-francis-shocks-world-endorses-donald-trump-for-president-releases-statement/</a>
Not so good source. Why, you might ask? Because everything in it is false and made-up simply to help a narrative, also there are great suspicions that the owner of the news site, who is anonymous, might not be as local as he claims to be (spoiler: he is Russian) Their journalists are nameless, making them unverifiable, and they have no credible history in the world of media.</p></li>

<p>I hope your keybord gets fixed soon brother!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Use history as a guide, for example: </p>

<p>History has proven over and over again that the mainstream media will fit into the &quot;not credible&quot; category nearly every time.</p>

<p>Use basic logic as a guide, for example:</p>

<p>Any outlet that presents a dual-political system as having one &quot;righteous&quot; party and one &quot;nefarious&quot; party, that outlet will fit into the &quot;not credible&quot; category nearly every time.</p>

<p>Use common sense as a guide:</p>

<p>In your human life, how often are important choices obvious and black &amp; white? Almost never, right? Valid information is the same way. The truth is often uncomfortable and doesn&#39;t fit neatly into a perfect little pocket.</p>

<p>In your work life, how many times have you witnessed corporate greed and corruption? How many times have you seen business models that are presented to the consumer as one thing but behind closed doors there is a very different reality: obvious plans to conspire against the people with money to sell them an inferior product based on clever lies and manipulation. You can look at any government the same way. Take their &quot;advertisements&quot; with a kilo of salt.</p>

<p>These are just the easy ones...</p>
