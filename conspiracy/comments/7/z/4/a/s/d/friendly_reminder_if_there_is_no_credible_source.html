       Don’t start falling for shit that seems like it’s true or maybe you want it to be true. Remember to ask for the source if one is not provided and then scrutinize the source.

       It’s so much of this that has seen such discord in our country. Inaccurate facts no longer matter, if it’s not in line with what you think the should be it’s just fake news. Nobody cares about accuracy or actual facts anymore it’s us vs them.

       I feel like you shouldn't even have to ask for sources. People should just back their claims up with sources in the first place. But maybe I am asking too much.

       That's cool if you want, I believe you, I've seen that tatic before, but it's been a while.  Thought they were bringing it back.  I've even seen the technique of claiming you shouldn't have to source your argument because that means you can't write your own argument clear enough.  Which is complete bullshit.

       Well some people just seem to not understand the difference between a theory and prove and fact, prove and possibility, and use the terms interchangably. But it has happend quite a few times to me in the last months that whenever calling someone out on this difference or asking for a source for what they believe to be fact, is seen as shilling. I think sourcing is a good habbit and I personally don't like attacking people based on their sources unless they are really, really shit (read: medium blogs, random private blogs, true pundit). I'll happily accept Breitbart and sometimes even more fringe extreme-rightwing media as long as they have a verifiable journalist with a name that wrote the article.

       I'm the same, and at the least can back it up with MSM sources.  I stay away from Breitbart and other blog type news outlets.  It's why the Awan situation has been so frustrating.  It's rarely reported on beside WND &amp; True Pundit.

       I think people make mistakes and bury themselves trying to defend mistakes. (I try not to do this but have been guilty of this in the past, but aware.)

       Isn't the whole point of a conspiracy that there is no credible source? If there was a credible source it would be a true fact and not simply a conspiracy.

       That’s where critical thinking comes into play. You need to decide for yourself if you’re going to  believe what a source is saying. Do research. Getting the truth isn’t easy anymore. It takes work.

       There is no such thing as absolute credibility. However some sources are more credible than others. Because apparently the first answer of OP did not suffice for you (or your keybord broke and you can now only type these eight words), I will help you identify the difference between how to identify a credible and a not so credible sources based on 2 examples:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/">
          https://www.bostonglobe.com/
         </a>
         good source! Why you might ask? Well first of all they a long history of groundbreaking journalism and have a ton of credibility, also everyone is aware of their track record and their journalists are held to a very high standard.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161115024211/http://wtoe5news.com/us-election/pope-francis-shocks-world-endorses-donald-trump-for-president-releases-statement/">
          https://web.archive.org/web/20161115024211/http://wtoe5news.com/us-election/pope-francis-shocks-world-endorses-donald-trump-for-president-releases-statement/
         </a>
         Not so good source. Why, you might ask? Because everything in it is false and made-up simply to help a narrative, also there are great suspicions that the owner of the news site, who is anonymous, might not be as local as he claims to be (spoiler: he is Russian) Their journalists are nameless, making them unverifiable, and they have no credible history in the world of media.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I hope your keybord gets fixed soon brother!

       No one is credible. No one. Anything that happens beyond your field of perception is a jumble of unreliable narrators, personal agendas and malevolent forces. You can never know truth because you cannot trust. You can never know love, because you cannot trust. You can only curl up into a little ball of your own awareness, afraid and alone, secure in the knowledge that no human being truly loves you.

       Use history as a guide, for example:
      </p>
      <p>
       History has proven over and over again that the mainstream media will fit into the "not credible" category nearly every time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use basic logic as a guide, for example:
      </p>
      <p>
       Any outlet that presents a dual-political system as having one "righteous" party and one "nefarious" party, that outlet will fit into the "not credible" category nearly every time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use common sense as a guide:
      </p>
      <p>
       In your human life, how often are important choices obvious and black &amp; white? Almost never, right? Valid information is the same way. The truth is often uncomfortable and doesn't fit neatly into a perfect little pocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       In your work life, how many times have you witnessed corporate greed and corruption? How many times have you seen business models that are presented to the consumer as one thing but behind closed doors there is a very different reality: obvious plans to conspire against the people with money to sell them an inferior product based on clever lies and manipulation. You can look at any government the same way. Take their "advertisements" with a kilo of salt.
