    <div class="md"><p>Have you been there?</p>

<p>When I visited Moscow as a tourist -- and it&#39;s a beautiful, culturally rich city like no other city on earth -- I witnessed an anti-government protest rally organised by the Communist Party. Granted, it wasn&#39;t the most well-attended rally I&#39;ve seen in my life, but it was happening.</p>

<p>Also, the Russians are the politest subway travellers I&#39;ve ever seen. They literally leapt out of their seats when anyone from the older generation boarded a carriage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny how every time the US needs to brainwash their own population about Russia they use the exact same publication without fail: &quot;The Moscow Times&quot;.</p>

<p>The &quot;Moscow&quot; Times is a Western-planted publication. I have been watching the US use it as a &quot;source&quot; for years now. I researched it years ago and it turns out that it is a news-rag given away for free in ex-pat cafe&#39;s and has no relevance whatsoever, even to English-speaking locals.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, &quot;The Moscow Time&quot; fills up the back pages with escort and prostitution ads. Its only actual purpose is as a propaganda rag. </p>

<p>Also your views about Russia are completely wrong and conform perfectly to the type of person who knows nothing about a country but thinks he is an expert. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d recommend it. We found a host family to stay with instead of a hotel -- Air B&amp;B by any other name -- which gave us a different perspective and brought us into contact with ordinary Russians (and was much cheaper, of course). The subways are amazing although it does help if you familiarise yourself with the alphabet a little so you can read the maps. The cultural riches of Moscow and its environs in terms of art and architecture have an incredible historical depth, and we also experienced some great music, from classical to jazz.</p>

<p>The Moscovites were very friendly to us and I never felt uneasy on the streets, but I guess we were just following fairly well established tourist trails. I&#39;d love to go again.</p>

<p>One comment I would make about homophobia in Russia is I think it&#39;s quite a conservative, religious society outside of the urban centres and I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s where a lot of the homophobia springs from. In this respect I don&#39;t see Russia as being hugely different from the USA, where there&#39;s also a lot of homophobia in religiously conservative, rural areas. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if that was sarcasm or was meant to be literal. My point is that I believe you have a few misconceptions regarding the Russian people, their opinions towards politics, gays, etc. The actions of the state don&#39;t speak for the people. The same goes for the US.</p>

<p>Average monthly wages in Russia are currently 50500 rub/month, or about $890/month. <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/russia/wages">https://tradingeconomics.com/russia/wages</a></p>

<p>In terms of purchasing power parity, Russia is mid-low table but above equally interesting and culturally powerful nations such as Brazil, Mexico, India and Turkey.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And they are racist as fuck, and they hate gays.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;re not all like that, and it takes an extremely prejudiced outlook to characterise such a massive nation in such a way. As I say, Russia is a religiously conservative society which, like the religiously conservative society in the US, tends to give rise to homophobia. </p>

<p>I have to say, your words reflect a kind of intense closed-mindedness. But then that&#39;s what you are, if you think you&#39;re in a position to judge a whole country and its people without ever having stirred from in front of your computer screen to visit the place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In August 2016, Hillary threatened direct military conflict with Russia over the baseless allegations that Russia was involved in cybercrime on the DNC&#39;s email server. She says she&#39;d use the military in response to the claim that Russia helped Wikileaks publish a bunch of emails. And it&#39;s on video. <a href="https://youtu.be/jz_dZ2SlPgw">https://youtu.be/jz_dZ2SlPgw</a></p>

<p>She was expecting to win after having said that too. They turned Russia into the Boogeyman du jour before the primaries even ended. If she were president today, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we had invaded Russia by this point. Don&#39;t for one moment think that that shit started in November 2016 when Trump won. The MIC needs a scary Boogeyman no matter which puppet is put in office. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, but I do think that they didn&#39;t actually think Trump could win, and turning it against him was an adaptation they made kind of late in the game.  That is to say, the &quot;meddling&quot; narrative was always part of the plan, but the &quot;collusion&quot; narrative was conjured up once they realized that Trump was going to win the primary and it wasn&#39;t going to be Hillary vs Jeb!/Rubio.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The behavior of both sides of the political establishment and the media since Trump won makes that impossible for me to believe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Repeal Obamacare, Trump gave up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He tried.  The neocons like McCain, who literally ran on repealing Obamacare, wouldn&#39;t vote for it when they got the chance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Lock her up&quot;, he said no on day one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How would he do that?  Comey gave immunity to everyone involved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Leave NAFTA, no progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He said renegotiate or leave.  Renegotiation is in progress now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump is so good for the DNC, he might be a Democrat. Oh wait he was one his entire life...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was only a Democrat during GWB&#39;s two terms.  He was a Republican before and after that time period, and he was an Independent for a short time as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re making excuses. He could of tried harder to come up with a solution for repeal that congress could support.  </p>

<p>Hilary is dirtiest bitch that ever lived. Trump could have DOJ investigate so many different things it wouldn&#39;t be hard.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not gonna hold my breath for NAFTA to change. I guess you are one of the people that listens to Trump and believes him for some reason. He is a know bs artist. I can&#39;t believe the American people are falling for this.</p>
