       This is an old article, but whatever it still holds true obviously.
      </p>
      <p>
       This debt based culture imposed on us by the government, imposed on us by banks, imposed on us by credit card companies, imposed on us by powerhouse institutions is taking its toll.
      </p>
      <p>
       America is on the verge of bankruptcy and 80% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Slave to the 9 to 5 rat race. Not able to live luxurious lives, not able to go on vacations, forced to live on government money in increasing numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The economy is trash right now and that is by design. Of course when you have a private Federal Reserve that lends money to our untrustworthy government willing to go into massive debt at an interest, then there will always always always be more debt than actual money in circulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what are the implications of this debt based system. Are we about to go bankrupt? Will the IMF have to come in and bail us out and impose harsh austerity measures like they did to Greece? Are they going to consider a universal basic income in which they basically give us a small amount of money to be their slaves? Are they going to try to push a global currency on us where the power becomes even more limited and even more centralized under the guise that this is the only way we can prevent bankruptcy again? Are they about ready to replace unnecessary people with robots and automation? Will they kill those people off?
      </p>
      <p>
       Crazy world and it seems like thereâ€™s a lot of stuff about to happen and the powers that be are certainly planning for something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Itâ€™s just so sad to see 80% of Americans in debt and the people we elect to serve us donâ€™t care about us at all. ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”

       It's important to remember that "in debt" doesn't mean much. "In default" on specific debts or being insolvent without viable income would matter.

       Depends. Debt creates an artificial forced servitude. If you are in debt with college, cars, house, credit cards, etc then you are forced to keep working two jobs and grinding away. Living within ones means with limited debt makes one much freer to make choices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though we live in a relatively "free" country most Americans are slaves to their debt and obligations. It keeps them from truly being able to make choices and forces choices of circumstance. Most people are "fine" with this setup...until they aren't and they want/need to make a chance only to find out they are unable to because of their debt obligations.

       Slave is a very strong and inaccurate word. Debt hasn't had teeth in a century. If you stop paying, nothing real happens. There's no debtors prisons. The worst a creditor can do is take back a secured item, garnish a paycheck, or snag a State refund. For most debtors, none of those things even apply.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, if you get really sticky, you can just pop a Chapter 7 and it all goes away.

       Modern examples[edit]
In 2014, National Public Radio (NPR) posted a report stating that there were still cases of judges imprisoning people who have not paid court fees.[47] The American Civil Liberties Union has been challenging such policies since 2009.[48]
      </p>
      <p>
       In September, 2015, the town of Bowdon, Georgia made international news[49] when a sitting municipal judge, Robert A. Diment, was surreptitiously recorded threatening defendants with jail time for traffic violations if they did not provide immediate payment.[50] The incidents caused the Bowdon Municipal Court to be closed for a month in order to implement changes in policy.[51]

       in conclusion, it would seem that being illegal it wouldnt happen, but it happens eitherway

       The titles of those documents are very misleading. The people in those instances are being jailed for contempt of court, usually for not showing up despite being ordered to do so. It's not because they didn't pay the debt, but because they violated a Court Order.

       People have been forced to work, in one way or another,  for thousands of years. In the earliest years, people had to work their asses off to survive on much less than we do now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference in more modern times, is that now there's a small group of people that heavily benefit from all of our work, much more so than ever before.

       But to be fair the government has been taking part in a lot of their own wasteful spending and because of that the income tax percent only continues to rise as the decades pass. More taxes = less money for yourself to help you pay off your own debts

       Not defending government spending by any means, and it would be great to see that get cut drastically, but I wouldnâ€™t want the government stepping in to take care of personal debt- what a disaster.

       Majority of Americans care more about flash than substance. I see loads of different people at my job everyday and from all walks of life. People will still have flip phones while rocking a full Michael Kors set. I got a laugh last week when this women being discharged was pissed and yelling because the hospital wasn't going to pay for her taxi while holding a huge Coach bag that could fit a laptop inside. People need to live smarter and not try to be someone they aren't. Yeah the stuff can be fake but it still shows that they went out of the way to get a fake one.

       There are many historical examples of jubilees when personal debts are retired in mass. I expect you'll see politicians advocating this get elected in droves as the problem deepens, especially for student debt.

       The main significance debt has on the individual now, is that interest accrues at about the same rate that stable investments grow. With the debt of a house, student loans, car, and medical bills, you will lose $200,000 to $500,000 during your life instead of gaining it. This is oddly close to the same amount the average person would owe if the national debt was equally divided (~$550,000). Keep in mind that all those items of debt cannot be passed to your children, as houses are now made to deteriorate. Even graves have rent and a 100 year time limit. 
All of those things are also considered comforts. The average person out of high school has the same knowledge a doctor had in the 1800s. A mobile home parked in a parking lot can provide shelter and transportation rent free. We sell out to debt because comfort is the norm. We all only have one life. What is worth more, comfort or success?

       well....that's a dumb way to look at debt. sure, i still owe 500k on this house, but im paying my morgage monthly and im doing well financially. i wouldnt say im in debt.

       It may be somewhat misleading, but the point is not everyone is doing well financially. 41 million Americans are below the poverty line and that number is increasing by the day.

       I bet as time goes by your wages will not go up as fast as inflation and you will have less to spend on luxuries and vacations and good stuff unless you work really hard and continue to increase your pay by getting promotions.

       Debt as a concept is neither good nor bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's debt that can be repaid, it's fine, I guess? I mean, that's a personal choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's debt that can be repaid, because as an investment, the cost of the debt is more than made up for by increased earning potential (e.g. college tuition, most of the time, still does this even if it's a lower margin than in year's past), etc., it's
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's debt that is not going toward an investment or future increased earnings (e.g. pricey car loan), but the person can repay it, that's on the "not good" end of fine. I mean, that money is not being spent on other things, or used to purchase items locally, so wealth gets concentrated in the financial sector instead of spread around.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's debt that doesn't increase future earnings (e.g. pricey car loan) AND the person can't pay it off, it's VERY bad. Both for the reasons in the last point re: wealth concentration, and of course the total financial ruination of the person.

       Not sure why you're downvoted. Debt can be good. Structural debt in a system can be good as you've defined. A government that is deeper in debt than the total wealth of the nation while rapidly escalating the rate of debt accumulation at historically low interest rates is a time bomb.

       I'm much more concerned about future generations than the personal debt the current generation. With Trump's massive $1.5 Trillion give-away to the wealthy and corporations, our deficit has exploded. That debt+interest will have to be paid back by our children.
