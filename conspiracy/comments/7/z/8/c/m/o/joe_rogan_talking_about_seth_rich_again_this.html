<p>What&#39;s his motive?  Show me a single interview with a friend, or a social media post that shows he was a Bernie bro.  His only remotely political comment on reddit was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4bsv80/bernie_sanders_campaign_has_officially_served_the/d1cetfa/?context=3">this one</a> where he sounded upset about a post title that implied the DNC was being sued over the Dec 2015 data breach.  Did you know that Seth was one of a few people with access to that system who could have set up the Sanders campaign, and that he was friends with Josh Uretsky the guy on the Sanders side who exploited the breach? </p>

<p>IT is maintenance of computer systems and networks, not everyone who works on a computer.</p>

<p>You would also have to have access to, know where to find, and not leave any trace of your acquiring said data.</p>

<p>In IT there is a common best practice call a principle of least privilege in which you restrict users access to just what they need access to, but accidents happens and it is apparent that DNC was not on top of their security otherwise the hacks\ leaks would not have happened. I mean just look at the NGP-VAN system exploit that Josh Uretsky took advantage of. Should he have been able to access Hillary&#39;s data files? No but the DNC&#39;s IT staff made a number of mistakes and for you to just say he would not have access or knowledge of how to exploit these vulnerability is just showing your lack of understand of how IT works in organizations of this size.</p>

The metadata established several facts in this regard with granular precision: On the evening of July 5, 2016, 1,976 megabytes of data were downloaded from the DNC’s server. The operation took 87 seconds. This yields a transfer rate of 22.7 megabytes per second.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She admitted she feared an assassin should shoot her through the window at work after Seth Rich&#39;s murder. This implicitly means that she understands that Rich was murdered because of something to do with his work at the DNC. I honestly can&#39;t believe she let that be known. She also dedicated her book to him and called him a patriot, exactly the word that we all use to describe him while praising him as a whistleblower. </p>

<p>Yea when I notice people start to change their behavior and dedicating books in the name of a slain allegedly whistleblower and you’re were complicit,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all, just pointing out that she partially admitted the truth. It&#39;s interesting that she did that. You&#39;re not wrong to criticize her, she absolutely was a party to the election fraud, Wikileaks proved that directly.

    <div class="md"><p>Just do a quick search for IT roles and you will see that you are mistaken. IT is more than networking and matainance of computer systems.</p>

<p><a href="https://targetpostgrad.com/subjects/computer-science-and-it/it-job-roles-and-responsibilities-explained">https://targetpostgrad.com/subjects/computer-science-and-it/it-job-roles-and-responsibilities-explained</a></p>

<p>In IT there is a common best practice call a principle of least privilege in which you restrict users access to just what they need access to, but accidents happens and it is apparent that DNC was not on top of their security otherwise the hacks\ leaks would not have happened. I mean just look at the NGP-VAN system exploit that Josh Uretsky took advantage of. Should he have been able to access Hillary&#39;s data files? No but the DNC&#39;s IT staff made a number of mistakes and for you to just say he would not have access or knowledge of how to exploit these vulnerability is just showing your lack of understand of how IT works in organizations of this size.</p>
