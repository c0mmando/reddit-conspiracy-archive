       What do they call the generation of people post-Millenials? Because it’s obvious that whatever the NWO intends to do will be done with that generation.

       He is here to troll and shill his website where he call himself the world's top skeptic... he wants you to divulge personal info as proof, might challenge you to come on to his show, or inject a link to his paid website to try to get you to become a member at the low cost of $20+/month... He was already banned from cryptocurrency sites. Check his history, spare yourself the aggravation of dealing with prime example of the dunning kurgger effect.

       Well the "post millennial" generation is at the oldest only 12. Millennials run 85-05. So Gen Z or whatever you want to call it will run from 05-20. They have no real impact as of yet- but I agree, they will be the ones targeted to implement the final stages of the NWO.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, Millennials are a very diverse generations as far as ideas are concerned...there's a good representations of Left and Right wing ideology, and also a lot of idiots.

       They have grown up with constant connection to the 'internet'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore they have never developed a sense of independent self.

       Obviously this is not their fault, they are merely products of their environment.

       You see you just don't want people to have guns. Unless you really are suggesting we nerf the world, ALMOST ANYTHING CAN BE USED AS A WEAPON.
      </p>
      <p>
       So by your logic you do not want police officers walking around with weapons of any kind. Or I can't own a knife, gun, or baseball bat cause it is a weapon that can hurt someone?

       Obviously society would need to be better for no weapons to work. I'm not referring to fear mongering in general. I'm talking about how that person is basically threatening that rape gangs would show up if Americans didn't have guns. That stuff doesn't jive well with young folk since rape gangs are a boogeyman to America unlike someone shooting up a neighorhood, school, church, etc.

       The government wants people to have guns. Why do you think politics, and entertainment is so strife heavy? You really think they want people they look down on to take over a country like America? What they want is for people like you to get a wild hair, and go on a rampage to fuel discontent not only toward your kind but the kind you don't like as well.

       Why the fuck should I pretend listening to a 15 year olds opinion on gun control like they have anything unique or of interest to say. I'm supposed to take the opinion of someone who is STILL LEARNING seriously? You can have an opinion sure, but don't act like it isn't completely irrelevant when you are that young.
