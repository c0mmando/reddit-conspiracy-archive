        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With the recent push for more gun control and gun measures, I think it&#39;s prudent to look back on the failed drug war. The failed gun control policies of Chicago that still remains one of the bloodiest cities in America yet has some of the strictest gun control. The failed drug war only created a rich and abundant black market of drugs and powerful cartels.</p>

<p>Are we really trying to go down the same path with guns? Removing citizen rights to fix core problems we need to address as a species isn&#39;t going to make this problem simply go away. Banning tools never works, you have to go to the root of the problem. With drugs it&#39;s rehabilitation and open access to clean safe drugs. Why remove the safe aspect and make it illegal and allow it to be punishable? We have such archaic views on personal responsibility and mental health that we are taking steps backwards, again, to try to fix a problem many don&#39;t even fully understand.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have all the answers but I can sure as hell look and see how much of a failure blocking citizen rights has been. A failed costly drug war that we are only now just realizing, decades later. The same thing can happen with gun control. We need to look at the root of the problem instead of emotionally reacting and banning a tool anyone can use for good or bad. Personal responsibility needs to be taken into account and we need to stop trying to hold each other&#39;s hands as a species. </p>

<p>Focus on mental health if need be. Evaluate troubled individuals and provide them with the support they need so they don&#39;t feel isolated and the need to kill people. Why is there always a reactionary rush to ban the tool instead of tackle the issue? Banning spoons isn&#39;t going to cure obesity and banning drugs isn&#39;t going to make drug problems go away. When will we fucking learn this?</p>

<p>We also have the extreme sketchiness of the official event. Time and time again drills take place the same day as the shooting. We know false flags have been used in the past (not only in regards to shootings but staging attacks against other nations, something far worse) so why should we be quick to jump into the medias arms for calls of gun control and &quot;assault rifle bans&quot; that&#39;s emotional reaction to an awful event and does not take into account past history and mistakes.</p>

<p>Why do we keep repeating the same damn mistakes over and over? We need to go to the root of the problem. Mental health should be a more viable and accessible option. Healthcare alone, not to mention mental health care in the United States is a joke and this is reflected in our mass shootings and morally devoid complacent population. We&#39;ve been fucked over for so long. Why should we continue to allow this to happen to us? We need to be focusing on personal responsibility and fixing problems people have instead of making it harder on us all and blanket banning things out of a reactionary emotional fear. Order out of chaos and while this stinks of a false flag, these are still pertinent points that need to be taken into account. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend reading this gun control debate: <a href="http://www.debate.org/debates/Winter-Regular-Final-Gun-Ban/1/">http://www.debate.org/debates/Winter-Regular-Final-Gun-Ban/1/</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s a well-structured debate over the hypothetical total ban of guns in the USA.</p>

<p>However, a total gun ban and confiscation is not what&#39;s being discussed. No politician is considering this, and even anti-gun activist realize it&#39;s wasted effort.</p>

<p>Gun control is effective and most people believe in some sort of rules. What many people want is to expand certain gun control laws to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Limit access to firearms for those that should not have them. Such as: convicted criminals, suicide risks, domestic violence threats, young children etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce the potential damage of mass shootings when they happen.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Personally, here&#39;s what I would like to see:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Universal background checks.</p></li>
<li><p>Expand funding and staffing for NICS. Offer incentives for states to keep their systems and reports up-to-date. Make enforcement a priority.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That&#39;s a good start but not good enough. I have more ideas and would be willing to discuss them if the replies would be civil.</p>

<p>those things are already in place in a federal level, so i&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;expanding them&quot;. Everyone already goes through a background check to purchase a fire arm through the FBI.  </p>

<p>If you are referring to the &quot;gun show loophole&quot;(which isnt a loophole), selling a gun privately would render these background checks and funding for NICS moot. I could still buy a firearm locally, in most states, without a background check or any federal paperwork. MY state doesn&#39;t even have to have a signed bill of sale. </p>

<p>You&#39;d require a record of the sale. Ideally, all sales would go through an FFL.</p>

<p>You could, but I&#39;m open to the idea of a low cap on fees and subsidies for those that can&#39;t afford it.</p>

<p>The courts already allow for fees related to firearm purchase and ownership: <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2013/rpt/2013-R-0048.htm">https://www.cga.ct.gov/2013/rpt/2013-R-0048.htm</a></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t expect all criminals to follow the rules, (although some might). I do expect a significant reduction in potential sources for firearms. The &quot;legal supply&quot; will shrink drastically and illegal suppliers will have more risk due to records requirements and the inability to claim they &quot;didn&#39;t know&quot; they were selling to a felon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>those are already in affect</p>

<p>Not for every state and not for every sale.</p>

<p>its relevant because you&#39;re talking about a complete overhaul of Federal infrastructure to handle the increase demand for background checks, while ignoring the fact that these dont actually solve crimes of this nature. A person with no previous history would not have a background to check. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The frank answer is that it will require the adults that legally purchased arms to be accountable in some manner.

    <div class="md"><p>Like DC or New York? Because there havent been any murder there since enacting those very same things.</p>

<p>Private sellers in the District of Columbia must have a registration certificate in order to lawfully transfer a firearm.1 See the District Registration of Firearms section. Even where private sellers are so eligible, they may transfer registerable firearms2 only to licensed dealers.3</p>

<p>In addition, no person may sell a handgun to a person: 1) not of sound mind; 2) prohibited from possessing a firearm by any of the specific prohibited categories under D.C. Code Ann. § 22-4503 (see the District of Columbia Prohibited Purchasers Generally section); or 3) under age 21, unless the seller is the parent or guardian of the purchaser.4 Any person who knowingly or intentionally transfers a firearm or ammunition to someone under age 18 shall be fined up to $10,000, imprisoned for up to 10 years, or both.5</p>

<p>The District also prohibits the use of firearms or ammunition as security for a mortgage, deposit or pledge, and prohibits loaning, borrowing, giving, or renting a firearm or ammunition to or from another person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When DC and NYC have checkpoints for entering and exiting the city, then maybe that comparison will work.  But, just as with the lol Chicago argument, it&#39;s easy to bring guns acquired in nearby areas into the city.  If enacted at the federal level, it may be helpful in reducing gun violence.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, I can get behind this. But the full on rush to &quot;ban assault rifles&quot; is a bit of a emotional reaction. I like your points you brought up because there should be expanded checks when purchasing firearms, especially for at risk individuals (such as suicidal and domestic violence cases among others)</p>

<p>This is the type of approach we should be taking instead of outright bans. Banning &quot;assault rifles&quot; will only create an underground market. But if we come at it from a different angle and make it more about making sure the person is qualified and mentally fit to own a gun, then it may help. But even then, with an abundance of fire arms in the US it wouldn&#39;t be hard for certain individuals to still gain access to fire arms. This is why it&#39;s such a delicate issue and why we shouldn&#39;t let our emotion take over after such devastating events.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a really delicate situation and I hope it&#39;s one that can be solved. I thank you for your logical approach and I will be reading that link you supplied. Much thanks for the perspective </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the biggest change should be some sort of method to control what happens to guns after they are legally purchased.  Only about 10-15% of guns used in crimes are stolen, meaning the rest are acquired legally or via loophole (by which I mean someone legally able to buy a guy engages in a sham purchase and subsequently gives or sells that gun to a third party).  Addressing what happens to guns after purchase will require something like a registry, so slippery-slope idiots will rant and rave about it, but it 1) allows citizens to purchase and keep arms, and 2) improves accountability, which should be anyone&#39;s goal.</p>

<p>By having an unelected body maintain a list of this nature you&#39;re putting a system in place that is ripe for abuse. See the no-fly list.</p>

<p>These events such as Parkland Florida are terrible, but tragedies happen every day.

<p>I think the states should be in charge of the lists and should update the federal system regularly.</p>

<p>Lawmakers should consult researchers when deciding the limits of such lists.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s possible abuse will happen, but I believe it will be rare, minimal, and subject to review from multiple agencies.</p>

<p>I believe we can reduce gun violence and reduce the damage done by mass shootings with gun control.</p>

<p>I disagree with the idea we shouldn&#39;t have gun control because of other social problems. Gun control isn&#39;t an attempt to fix all social issues, but it does attempt to reduce the effect that guns can brings to those problems</p>

<p>I disagree, an example to point to would be the no-fly list as I mentioned. The function is the same as you are suggesting, a list which is maintained by a government organization that consists of someone&#39;s diagnosis. Here&#39;s an article to show my exact point: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/07/the-no-fly-list-is-a-terrible-tool-for-gun-control-in-part-because-it-is-a-terrible-tool/?utm_term=.3fd9f82dd2a0">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/07/the-no-fly-list-is-a-terrible-tool-for-gun-control-in-part-because-it-is-a-terrible-tool/?utm_term=.3fd9f82dd2a0</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe we can reduce gun violence and reduce the damage done by mass shootings with gun control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe I wasn&#39;t articulate in my point. The push for gun control is not going to solve the issues with this country. While terrible, mass shootings are minuscule when compared with the number of people who die every year from other preventable causes. If anything disarming law-abiding citizens makes the criminal&#39;s job easier.</p>

<p>Here is a Harvard study which shows that murder &amp; suicide rate is unaffected by stricter gun laws:

<p>Thanks for sharing the article. I agree that abuse and mistakes can and likely will happen. However, I still believe it will be minimal and that the system could be designed in such a way to allow for review and appeal.</p>

<p>I also get the impression that the no-fly list is subjective and based on the decision of government employees. For gun control, I&#39;m picturing something more robust.</p>

<ol>
<li>Convicted of ___ crime, on the list.</li>
<li>Hospitalized for suicide attempt, on the list.</li>
<li>Arrested and charged for ___ crime, on the list.</li>
</ol>

<p>etc. All of these subject to appeal and review and perhaps set with a time limit or other qualification based on research.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I understood, but I&#39;m saying it&#39;s not an attempt to fix those other issues. Gun control focuses on the &quot;enhanced violence&quot; those other issues can cause with firearm access.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If anything disarming law-abiding citizens makes the criminal&#39;s job easier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t want to disarm law-abiding citizens. I want to reduce access to firearms for those that shouldn&#39;t have it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is a Harvard study which shows that murder &amp; suicide rate is unaffected by stricter gun laws</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m familiar with it. A Google search shows me a couple sites refuting their claims, and several &quot;studies&quot; claiming the opposite.</p>

<p>The debate in my link: <a href="http://www.debate.org/debates/Winter-Regular-Final-Gun-Ban/1/">http://www.debate.org/debates/Winter-Regular-Final-Gun-Ban/1/</a></p>

<p>has some interesting back-and-forth about suicides.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suicide by firearm is also more likely to successful; more than half of all suicides are done by firearm [3] and 85% of these are successful [4], the most fatal method. If a gun is taken out of the situation, the troubled person will be forced to use a less lethal method. By using a less lethal method, his/her chances of surviving the suicide attempt are raised drastically. For example, the next most used method is drug overdose, which is fatal 6-12% of the time [8]. Now that the person is more likely to survive the suicide attempt, they can get help and receive treatment for their depression, which cures them of it 80-90% of the time [5].</p>

<p>By taking away gun rights, you effectively give the victim the chance to recover and get their life back.</p>

<p>Chicago has a lot of problems. Easy access to guns in basically every surrounding state is one of them. At some point it would be nice if people could acknowledge that we have a lot of problems. Yes, gangs, culture. mental illness. There are a lot of angles to this. Obviously guns aren&#39;t the only issue.

<p>You cannot do this. Even if you&#39;re talking about a gun (and not an RPG) a Chicago resident cannot drive to Indiana and legally purchase a gun.

The area used to be a government office / theater district but now they want people to live here too.  It comes out the reason for the doubled police presence in the area the officer was shot is that someone was shot in the same location a few days prior.  Never heard a word about it, and I read three local papers every morning.  Then it comes out that a block away, on Lower Wacker, there was a shooting the night before.  Nothing.  Not a word until this officer was shot.  Then it comes out that on Garland Court, in front of a new high rise apartment building, someone was shot three days prior.  Again, nothing. A day after the funeral the police release a brief warning not to travel between the blue line and red line stations in the pedway alone, because of recent armed robberies. </p>

<p>Every day I read articles in the Trib and Sun Times about people being shot on the south side and the west side.  Very rarely do we read about shootings in the heart of downtown, but I am starting to do research that shows statistically it may be no safer to be out in broad daylight at city hall, the Daley Center (County courts) or the Thompson Center (state offices.)  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t own a gun, and really don&#39;t want to.  That said, there are a lot of armed criminals I am likely encountering every time I go out to lunch.  Worse, I just assumed the city was telling the truth about crime when they focus on the poorer areas.  They are lying to us, and gun control can&#39;t be the only answer.  The asshole who shot the police officer was a convicted felon.  He didn&#39;t buy this gun from a licensed dealer.  Gun control wouldn&#39;t have made a difference for the slain officer, and my worry is it isn&#39;t going to do shit to protect me either. </p>

<p>I seriously do not have any idea what the answer is.  I think 95% of people are genuinely decent, but the 5% that aren&#39;t are becoming far more lethal.  Prison isn&#39;t the answer, it is a revolving door to a place where scum can hone their skills, like graduate school for degenerates.  Gun control doesn&#39;t help, the people doing the killing in Chicago couldn&#39;t legally buy a firearm anywhere in the country.  </p>

<p>Edit: Adding a TL:DR, I don&#39;t think there is an answer to the problem, and sorry this is so long but I started to find out about a lot of violent crime the city has been sweeping under the rug that the killing of a Chicago police officer brought to light and I am sick of it. </p>

<p>There are no checkpoints going into or out of Chicago, there were no sweeps through Chicago homes removing existing guns, and some of the measures were quickly overturned (McDonald v.

    <div class="md"><p>In state sale is legal, no?  So I could go to Waukeegan, IL or Rockford, IL, legally purchase a firearm, and then drive right into Chicago?  Cool, so once again Chicago gun laws are beside the point, no?  That&#39;s also ignoring lax (if any) laws on private sales, or lack of tracking of guns once sold, so I can easily get someone in Indiana to buy a gun and sell it to me (maybe I even offer a premium).  Without checkpoints, if guns are easily accessible in the surrounding area, they will get into Chicago.  The US has open internal borders, so trying to control a market in only state or city is difficult, nigh impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The efficacy of other approaches that do not infringe on the rights of law abiding gun owners.  Roughly 10-15% of guns used in crimes are stolen.  Many of the rest are sham purchases, where a person legally purchases a firearm, then sells or gives that firearm to another person.  In many states, the legal purchaser has little, if any, requirement or incentive to ensure the firearm does not fall into the wrong hands.  A registry and mandatory record of sale (and background check for the purchaser) could help.  There are a lot of creative solutions I&#39;ve seen bandied about lately, but unfortunately the debate on both sides has gotten ridiculous.  </p>

<p>Primarily, though, the problem with the Chicago example, which is roundly touted by many who don&#39;t even know what it means, is that it gets nowhere.  Even if you&#39;re right that gun laws can do nothing at all (which is not supported by the Chicago example), I&#39;d wager that 90% of people support some middle ground.  Only nuts on both sides think absolutely zero restrictions on firearms at all or zero guns at all.  We&#39;re trying to talk about a tricky social and political issue, but using salt the earth rhetoric.  It&#39;s just not productive.</p>

<p>Not really. Circumventing the law in the way you describe is illegal. Criminals don&#39;t follow the law, by definition, which is the point of the argument.</p>

<p>You&#39;re also suggesting that only Chicago has strict gun laws, which is not true. IL has extremely strict gun laws. Including background checks, FOID (firearms owner ID) which must be presented to purchase a gun - even in a private transaction, waiting periods, strict transport laws, and zero reciprocity for concealed carry. </p>

<p>Chicago&#39;s gun violence issues stem directly from the criminal trafficking of narcotics. No amount of gun control will do much to curtail this. End the failed drug war though, and you instantly take a huge chunk out of this particular breed of gun (and other) violence.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an obvious progression that you began. You started talking about Rockford and Wakeegan, trying to infer that only Chicago had some super safe gun laws that were being circumvented by other areas in IL. Therefore, we started talking about the also strict gun laws of IL, which leads to Federal transfer laws, none of which I think you have a working knowledge of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You Americans and your guns.</p>

<p>Chicago has a high rate of wealth disparity that makes it so there&#39;s a lot of rich people living close to really poor people, but not in the same communities.</p>

<p><a href="https://voorheescenter.wordpress.com/2015/03/11/a-deepening-divide-income-inequality-grows-spatially-in-chicago/">https://voorheescenter.wordpress.com/2015/03/11/a-deepening-divide-income-inequality-grows-spatially-in-chicago/</a></p>

<p>This stuff is basic community development. Why you guys never focus on issues like that but spend all your time whining about the government taking your guns is like 1/2 the problem.</p>

<p>Chicago closed like 50 inner city schools and are closing more apparently.</p>

<p><a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/school-closing-protesters-take-their-pleas-to-mayors-house/">https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/school-closing-protesters-take-their-pleas-to-mayors-house/</a></p>

<p>That story is from 2 days ago so apparently people are still fighting the local government there so poor kids can get a fucking education.</p>

<p>The US is dominated by predatory capitalism. Gun companies sell you guys guns and you guys defend them without question. Your education system is completely fucked. Privatizing elementary schools now? University students are saddled with debt. You guys have over 2 billion dollars in outstanding student loan debt accumulating interest for the financiers.</p>

<p>Your media system is owned by billionaires and corporate entities who lie to you constantly. Your prison systems unfairly target poor people to make profits for prison service shareholders. Your healthcare system is for profit.</p>

<p>You guys could really do some better improvements than just fighting about your guns.</p>

<p>There is literally no one protecting individual citizens. Every othermajor 1st country in US has it in their consitution to protect and help their citizens. </p>

<p>All of this choas and shit is because those who cant defend themselves are fucked/ get killed. You put your drug addicts in Jail instead lf rehab, and you have privatized healthcare, your country is NOT a country for the people. It is no better than a 3rd world country, the only difference is that there are more rich people who live there.</p>

<p>However, this does not address the issue of mass shootings which are in no way connected to black market narcotics trade. This actually does require a bit of sensible gun control, namely thorough background checks, greater restrictions to the acquisition of semi-autos in general would not hurt either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is insignificant in comparison to many other issues that kill many more people. Opiates are dropping people like flies, but no one cares about that. Guns can and will protect people from others that want to cause harm. A gun can help a woman defend herself when she lives home alone. My girlfriend is at home alone right now because I travel for work. The cops will come way too late in many instances. Guns have benefits to responsible people that want to protect themselves. For example, if there was enough armed security in the school, this dude could have been dead before it got so bad. </p>

Even my poor southern community had at least 1 security/cop on the grounds at all times with a handgun.
