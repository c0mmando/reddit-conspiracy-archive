        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here&#39;s the twitter thread, read the whole thing: <a href="https://twitter.com/xShaf/status/966364855937708032">https://twitter.com/xShaf/status/966364855937708032</a></p>

<p>I think the most interesting part is when he mentions the rapper called Kasinova Tha Don sounding just like Tupac. I&#39;ve always been interested in Tupac conspiracy theories but this is one i&#39;ve never head before. Kasinova Tha Don&#39;s voice sounds literally identical to tupac, in my opinion. Here&#39;s a link to one of his songs released in 2012: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxOVeJ8UoWI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxOVeJ8UoWI</a></p>

<p>That voice is unmistakeble. And the first line of the of the song says &quot;it&#39;s been 16 years.&quot; ...2012-16= 1996 (the year Tupac was shot). Kasinova also says in the song &quot;9-7-96, I remember like it was yesterday, I got a lot to say&quot; ....9/7/96 was the day Tupac was shot. I find this theory pretty interesting and decided to share to take a break from all of the school shooting and political posts for a moment</p>

<p>EDIT: a couple of other lines from the Kasinova song: 
1)&quot;i cant believe what i&#39;d happen to see, a nigga who looked just like me&quot;ï»¿ (body double?)
2) &quot;The media said that i died but im still breathing&quot;ï»¿</p>

<p>Heres a link to the lyrics for the full song: <a href="https://genius.com/Kasinova-the-don-mystery-lyrics">https://genius.com/Kasinova-the-don-mystery-lyrics</a>
Pretty eerie stuff. Can&#39;t decide what to think of this</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been following the possibility he faked his death almost a decade. It&#39;s because it&#39;s only been on youtube and anytime it branched out people laughed it off.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been posted here multiple times over the years and just like this thread they never get past 10 points.</p>

<p>Edit: And by the time I finished my comment this thread lost another 2 karma. People see this story and automatically think it&#39;s bullshit without ever taking the time to glace at the material.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been a HUGE Pac fan since the days he was still alive and dropping double albums.</p>

<p>And I had never once heard of &quot;Kasinova the Don&quot; until this reddit post.</p>

<p>And when I listen to that track, it is very, very, strange and though the voice sounds a bit different, it could definitely be explained by age.</p>

<p>And I am not listening to the track and thinking &quot;Oh man, it must be Pac because he raps about the Pac Vegas shooting!&quot;.</p>

<p>I am listening to the track and thinking about the rhyme flow, breathing patterns and how particular words are said. I have the entire 2Pac discography on my phone. And damn, if Kasinova is not actually Pac, he definitely did his homework to make a convincing show of it anyways.</p>

<p>And again, like you, I am wondering why I have never heard of this guy before. Almost as if he has been deliberately hidden from the public/fans. Weird.</p>

<li>Uh, Yeah,  Hahahahaha...</li>
<li>Let me tell you what happened though, thug life, thug life</li>
<li>It&#39;s been 16 years, still stuck in a dark cage</li>
<li>Living in my mind, thinking about that fateful day</li>
<li>9-7-96, I remember like it was yesterday, I gotta lot to say</li>
<li>They&#39;re gonna make a thug nigga cry, how the media said that i died, but I&#39;m still breathing,<br/></li>
<li>Who do you believe in</li>
<li>Everything they said was a lie, you see, listen</li>
<li>We was in Vegas, getting faded, in the city of sin</li>
<li>I Had a bad feeling that night, after the fight, at the MGM</li>
<li>Can ya feel me</li>
<li>We left the telly on the way to the club </li>
<li>These hoes pulled up right beside us</li>
<li>My adversaries steady plotting on my death</li>
<li>Squeezing bullets till my name on my chest</li>
<li>I heard gun shots, but it got weird, instead of bullets, only smoke appeared</li>
<li>Next thing I knew, 2 men in a suite just standing there</li>
<li>They opened the door grab a nigga by his feet let my head hit the concrete</li>
<li>It was a nightmare, dragged on the street </li>
<li>Scars on my back, looking at the white Cadillac, before the black bag over my head</li>
<li>I couldn&#39;t believe what I happen to see, a nigga who looked just Like me, dressed like me </li>
<li>In The passenger seat,  but it cant be me, sitting there next to Suge </li>
<li>Another 4 shots and That Cant be Good</li>
<li>I gotta find a way is what I said </li>
<li>Next thing I know </li>
<li>A blow to the head..ï»¿ </li>
</ul>

<p>Might be worth noting all versions have the track pause and blend back in right before &quot;two men in suits&quot;. Bet there&#39;s a missing verse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pac was plotting faking his own death after his first attempted hit. He said it was the fbi and they don&#39;t fuck around.</p>

<p>He shot a vegas cop in the ass and got off bc the vegas cop had a stolen gun from the evidence locker on him (suspect?) (Baltimore?) </p>

<p>They say pac was setting up traps to try to prove the fbi had a hit out on him so he could go public or blackmail them into a life back. Maybe it wasn&#39;t him in that car the night? A lot of things changed. The rims on the crime scene photo car,bullet holes ect ect..</p>

<p>makes you wonder about the 2018 vegas massacre? ?ðŸ¤” and how honest the fbi and lvmpd are being??</p>

<p>faking your death was legal in Nevada at that time too. Probably something to do w A51 And having to change lives to work there idk?. Anyway the possibility is there. Pac was huge on reincarnation an using death as revenge and was setting traps to get dirt on the ones who wanted him dead...like maybe using the easiest trick in the book,a body double. That would mean he&#39;s complicit in a murder most likely pushed through by the fbi though so it&#39;s kinda a stand off. If the fbi kills someome bc they think it&#39;s you and you could prove it...what do you do lol. Flee this mf fast.</p>

<p>He was known to act strange and say some strange things the last night he was seen alive too. Like he knew something was coming nobody else did. He didn&#39;t want to go to vegas that night, but made it seem like he had something he had to get delt with and was upset. Could be why he jumped Orlando Anderson bc he knew he waa a dead man either way or that he was getting away either way..</p>

<p>We see footage of the fight at mgm that night but no stephen paddock security video...nobody find that strange? Maybe it&#39;s bc he was NOT working alone? Corrupt vegas police don&#39;t want to hurt tourism revenue and make the city and elites look bad. 7 burner phones ,1 smart phone cameras covered,23 guns ,2 rooms on lvl 32 1 room on lvl 61/41 floor 4 season MB And 1 room at the ogden..a military grade communication device charger that got downplayed to a &quot;charger that doesn&#39;t match his cell phones&quot; ya lone wolf...you HAVE to be slow to believe this guy worked alone.</p>

<p>No offence but come on,nothing adds up. Even the crime scene photos,preliminary, autopsies..just the look on Lombard lol. Come on America we are smarter than this. </p>

<p>He may have shot ppl..Maybe not,who knows? He didn&#39;t pull this all off alone though imo. Lombardo had case solved before they even cleared 32-134 though lol. LONE FUCKING WOLF. IF I SAY IT ENOUGH YOU WILL BELIEVE..DO ITTTT. LONE WOLF SHOOTER. NO MOTIVE,RICH,GOOD RELATIONSHIP. ...LONE WOLF SHOOTER. DON&#39;T YOU QUESTION THIS OR ANY OTHER CRIME IN VEGAS?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL, that actually ties in more than you would think. Check the song and lyrics from the above comment.</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#39;s been 16 years, still stuck in a dark cage</li>
</ul>

<p>Also lip syncing isn&#39;t a new thing and Kasinova has never done a live performance. The one video of him free styling doesn&#39;t sound like his voice in any of the songs and also doesn&#39;t rap the same. </p>

<p>Just compare his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUb60QtxNT8">free style</a> to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxOVeJ8UoWI">song</a> supposedly from the same guy. Doesn&#39;t sound anything alike..</p>
