Which I will still claim. I don&#39;t vote. And I&#39;m not going to start. But let&#39;s be honest here. Look through my shit. Does it seem like I&#39;m on a &quot;side&quot;? Because it probably does.</p>

<p>That said, this sub isn&#39;t what it used to be. It&#39;s mainstream now. And we need to be aware of what influences are here. It&#39;s being gamed, as most of us who&#39;ve been around here awhile can see. </p>

<p>But for those of us a bit newer, I&#39;d suggest looking through user&#39;s comment history before you reply to them. Pain in the ass, I know. But there are people here who seem organic, and simply aren&#39;t. And we need to be aware of this.  </p>

<p>&quot;But Johnny, looking through YOUR post history, it appears that you have a...&quot;</p>

<p>I know. I know man. It&#39;s really, really tough trying to come across as not being part of one of the current &quot;sides&quot; these days. </p>

<p>The best I can say is, I&#39;m on your side, in the best way I know how to be. </p>

<p>Just be aware of who you&#39;re engaging with on this sub. You don&#39;t need to confront them directly once you get a feeling for what they&#39;re about, just be aware of it. And that goes for anyone looking at my comment history as well. </p>

<p>You&#39;re intelligent, and you&#39;re dangerous. Fight the good fight the best way you know how to. </p>

<p>Understatement of 2018</p>

<p>Fortunately i&#39;m famous enough that I come with my own following of users to warn others about me. </p>

<p>The problem with what you&#39;re going for is that it encourages people to dismiss a user based on their history, and not their present post - Which may be factually brilliant. If someone with a sordid history says something great, you should read what they say and not ignore them because of their history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And then block. Block, block, block. </p>

<p>For example: There are 18 comments here. I see eight. This very reasonable and logical post is being heavily down voted. </p>

<p>The success of r/conspiracy has worked against it, as the dark forces are now hitting it hard every day to disrupt, distract and destroy. </p>

<p>What OP says is exactly right. Go through the history of people who appear anti-conspiracy. Block them. Make them scream into the void. </p>

<p>We are in an information war, and I&#39;m not sure who&#39;s winning. Considering the massive push for censorship and shitposting, the good guys may actually be ahead. Tough to say. But don&#39;t give up.</p>

<p>One, I have days when I spew bollocks in comments (troll, if you will) in frustration and impatience, and days when I&#39;m trying my best to be reasonable, constructive and argumentative.</p>

<p>Two, I think we all hold a different persona in on-line conversations or activity, and in real-life interactions. Non of which are our true essence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess it depends how emotionally invested you are in Reddit. I can attest to always enjoying the platform and my converaations on it without going through post historys. </p>

<p>I understand the sentiment though for this sub. This place has been completely ruined. Its always american politics, always politics debates, so much forced shit that this sub wasnt about years ago. </p>

<p>So yeah, I guess deciding factoe would be how often youre commenting and your place in the sub.  The more I think about it, I mostly dont comment here for a reason and that is everyone is out to proove everyone wrong in a passive aggresive manner without actually having real disscussion. </p>

<p>I gave up on that in this sub a long time ago. It&#39;s just changed in every single way, too much. </p>
