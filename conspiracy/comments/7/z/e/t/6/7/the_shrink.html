        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Nikolas Cruz soon after turning 19 was turned over to the Children’s Center for Development &amp; Behavior at the pyschiatric care of a Dr. D.L. whose background in research for Army Intelligence and focused on neuron-control systems. Was psychological treatment deployed on young Nikolas as an expendable asset for operational purposes? Cruz was expelled from Parkland in Sept. soon after he  “went away.” It can be deduced  he was institutionalized for more than 2 months in the fall of 2017.
Is there a connection between Cruz&#39;s foster parent a former military intelligence officer and the shrink/Dr. L. a neuropsychologist?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SS: Was psychological treatment deployed on  young Nikolas as an expendable asset for operational purposes? it is interesting to point out the Cruz boys are entitled to receive upon reaching college age a sum of $800,000 from the sale of the Cruz family properties. Why would someone go on a School shooting spree knowing they were to receive close to million Dollars inheritance? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It should be common practice that people who commit unexplainable violence on the general public, that the persons psychologist/therapist be questioned by authorities, and then documented. It doesn&#39;t have to be made public, butt the criminal&#39;s file needs to be made available to authorities, and then tabulated so we can see if patterns emerge. But no, it&#39;s all secret cuz muh &quot;patient rights&quot;.</p>

<p>If a treatment of hypnosis and chemicals (pills) make a kid &quot;hear voices&quot; while spraying bullets, get these fucking quacks on the stand, or at least document who the doctors are that had their claws in the kid before he went psycho on the public. If any pitchforks should be out, they should be out for these fucking dangerous people with medical degrees who mentally condition others to do bad things to innocent people in our public spaces.</p>
