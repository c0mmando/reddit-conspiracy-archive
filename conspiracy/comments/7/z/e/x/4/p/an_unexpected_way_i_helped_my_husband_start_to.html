        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The other day a documentary about Ted Kaczynski (<em>Unabomber</em>) came on and neither one of us bothered to change the channel. We both started to pay attention and were interested and at one point they made a very slight reference to MKUltra. </p>

<p>Some quick background... my husband has sometimes teased me in the past about my quacky &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; so I rarely even talk about it because it is kind of annoying.</p>

<p>Anyway, just as I started to make some comment about MKUltra I just shut up. I got about 3 sentences in and just kind of stopped. He was like &quot;wait... I think I heard about this. Wasn&#39;t it some government program to screw around with people&#39;s heads&quot; and I didn&#39;t feel like engaging so he could call me a quack again so I just brushed it off and fibbed. I was like &quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t know. I think it was some FBI thing or something. I kind of heard about it but I don&#39;t really know. It&#39;s probably just some made up shit.&quot;</p>

<p>He stopped and pushed back on me. His response was &quot;no, no you are wrong, I definitely heard about this somewhere. It was something with the CIA and some tests they were running at Harvard.&quot; </p>

<p>I just brushed it off again and said &quot;yeah, I&#39;m not really sure about that. I think it&#39;s some ghost story.&quot; and then he got really fucking adamant about it. </p>

<p>He started Googling and trying to show me stuff and I just kinda nodded along and listened. Everything he was telling me I already knew but I felt like I had somehow made some kind of breakthrough with him because it wasn&#39;t me telling him something but now him trying to prove something to me. </p>

<p>He ended up spending half the night reading about MKUltra and every 15 minutes was like &quot;come here, look at my laptop... you gotta see this shit.&quot;</p>

<p>The next day I walked past the bedroom and I heard the TV running and stopped to listen for a minute. He was watching a documentary on 9/11 and what a fucking hoax that is. Before, he would have never even entertained the idea. Later he was bugging me and trying to tell me about a show he saw called &quot;Loose Change&quot; (<em>which of course most of us here have seen</em>) and how he thinks 9/11 was all a fucking false flag. </p>

<p>He&#39;s continued on this path reading and watching all sorts of shit I could never even get him to look at before and it was all because while having a quick conversation about Ted Kaczynski I decided to let him come to his own conclusions instead of preaching to him about it. </p>

<p>I guess I&#39;ve learned a lesson in conversation here that I should have figured out a long time ago. Sometimes it is easier to convince people of something if you let them draw their own conclusions instead of trying to show them on your own.</p>

<p>What difference is there REALLY between being under MKU and having someone try and force their views on you? </p>

<p>So it&#39;s good that he was resistant, even if you were being honest and truthful - it means he simply knows he needs to get there himself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really neat to read about people&#39;s first hand experiences on this subject, especially as there can be such a (often unspoken) void between significant others. I&#39;m glad you were able to open his eyes by getting him to ask and answer his own questions, and I hope this is the beginning of filling that void. Remember, the world might be super duper crazy fucked up, but you&#39;re fighting the good fight together. </p>

Turning on a light in someone&#39;s head is all that needs to be done.</p>

<p>On some issues I have been the one trying to open my hubs&#39; mind over twenty years. On some others, he has been as sweet as can be trying to red pill me. Finally got red pilled about his stuff these past years; he was red pilled about mine long ago. It&#39;s so lovely to have a soulmate in alignment with you!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s definitely easier to plant a seed and wait for them to notice it on their own. Last summer, I saved a bunch of that Podesta artwork and approached my parents with it like I was expecting them to show a certain level of respect for art, like it&#39;s anything I&#39;d personally hang on my walls lmao. My dad faked a sarcastic laugh as if to suggest I was being ridiculous, but you could tell he was uncomfortable. I even offered to print and frame <a href="https://www.justicenewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/zPodesta-TonyArt1a.png">this one</a> for them, but they weren&#39;t having any of it.

    <div class="md"><p>a little off topic but I think it&#39;s worth saying, though you have found an effective persuasion tactic it might be worth it for your relationship to try and drop all this stuff and be more forthright.</p>

<p>If you feel you can&#39;t be open with your husband about your interests, that doesn&#39;t sound like a good thing in the long run. You should maybe talk with him about your feelings here. So the next time you find out something cool you don&#39;t have to waste time trying to manipulate his interest, and y&#39;all can both get into it together from the get-go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My ex and I talk politics/society issues during child pick-ups/drop-offs, and we somehow got on the topic of Hilary Clinton. I made some mention that he should look into just how shady the Clinton business/connections are.</p>

<p>Well, the following weekend, the first words out of his mouth were, &quot;So, pizzagate, huh?&quot; He had a notebook with bookmarks, all kinds of rabbit-holes I&#39;ve already been down, and he was truly blown away. Every time I thought he was done, he&#39;d flip a page and say something like &quot;Have you heard about Bohemian Grove?&quot; Every week now, we have awesome conversations! It&#39;s definitely good to have someone to talk to about this stuff who understands the excitement of piecing things together. Once someone realizes that one thing they believed could not be true <em>is</em> true, it makes it easier, and more desirable, to seek other truths behind what we&#39;re told to believe.</p>
