    <div class="md"><p>Raising the age to buy an AR-15 is not the same thing as taking a person&#39;s guns. I defend the second amendment in every debate about it, but it&#39;s facetious to imply that there is no room for regulations to help prevent tragedy. If we can&#39;t regulate guns, why can&#39;t I buy an Uzi with a 100 round magazine at the age of 12? We <em>can</em> regulate guns and we have, the only question is how it can be done without destroying so many Americans ways of life, without violating anyone&#39;s rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would disagree. Regarding school shootings specifically, they&#39;re mostly attributed to teens. Raise the minimum age on purchases, and it will be difficult to find them. Look at booze vs drugs, for example. Drugs are outlawed but any high schooler knows where to find them. But booze is another story, it&#39;s far more difficult to find someone 21 or older to buy you booze. Because there isn&#39;t a motive for providing kids with liquor, there are consequences. For guns, people won&#39;t want to be responsible for giving a 19 year old a gun if it&#39;s against the law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think of gun violence as a whole,  any age restrictions is just setting up arbitrary fence posts similar to alcohol. If you want something you can usually get it. For school shootings there&#39;s so many cultural factors, mental health, chemical imbalances, hormones, bullying. An 18 year old adult should have all the same rights as a 65 year old imo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, but the parents of sandy hook victims did not &quot;open themselves up to criticism&quot; when their small children were killed in school. Neither did these high school kids who lost their friends.  They&#39;re normal people who underwent terrible tragedy and want to share their opinions, not &quot;political pawns.&quot;  It&#39;s only a political issue because the NRA wants it to be, just like climate change is political because the oil &amp; gas industry wants it to be.

<p>Until now, because everything is all fucked up, and more and more people are starting to realize, why? Why are things like this? Do the 1% own 99.99% of the world because of random chance like god?</p>

<p>Or is it because these familys have been plotting, in secret, for hundreds, if not literally thousands of years.</p>

<p>This is just like the fucking bible.</p>

<p>And during the beginning of the trials of tribulation, no one will know who is, and who isnt telling the truth.
One thing clearly stated there though, and I see this everyday, more and more as the days go by.</p>

<p>The people who seek the truth will be outcasted and exiled.

    <div class="md"><p>What works better than capitalism though? There are two Utopias that can be thought of when you look at the ideal conservative and liberal societies. A conservative utopia would be a complete laissez faire capitalist society where social welfare is met or exceeded voluntarily by the population. This won&#39;t ever be achieved because people are selfish and greedy and won&#39;t voluntarily give enough to meet the needs of those who need welfare or assistance. The second utopia is one where society is governed and ran in a way where laws and regulations prevent anyone from having more than someone else. The collective population funnels the fruit of their productivity in a way that can be distributed evenly among the citizens so that all welfare needs are met. This utopia will never exist because it removes individual responsibility from society and productivity will stagnate. </p>

<p>The first utopia hinges on individuals and their capacity for altruism. The second relies on a perfected set of rules that all of society abides by. </p>

<p>The best reality we can achieve falls somewhere in between. I think America is in a pretty good place all things considered. Sure it can and should improve, but the form of capitalism we have may be the best system we have in order to best protect the liberties of it&#39;s citizens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also think that capitalism is the best system we&#39;ve got, but it is has deep flaws like income inequality that can and should be compensated for in other ways.  A communist system is obviously not the answer, but there are social programs and methods that can assure everyone in a society has their basic needs met.  America is fine in the scheme of things, better than some developed countries and worse than others.  But the changes we do need are stalled by the incredibly inefficient structure of Congress, and that&#39;s holding us back significantly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree on the inefficiencies. My personal belief is that if our societal and cultural values shifted from asking the government to try and fix all of our flaws to one where individuals take responsibility of their communities and bring them together through altruism and support. If you have strong communities, it should stand to reason that the higher levels of government will shift towards how these communities are operating. You can honestly go find a great community somewhere in the US and never hear or have to worry about what&#39;s going on at the state and federal level outside of taxes. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all doom and gloom on both sides of the political spectrum that is spoken by the media, but I actually think that what we have here is pretty great. We should be proud of that and be motivated to improve society as our legacy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re ignoring the fact that debunked conspiracies are still peddled far too regularly. If someone infers that a person is a crisis actor, and then we are shown that it isn&#39;t true at all, why do we have to keep seeing the lie repeated over and over? I am grateful that media companies are taking a more active role. </p>

<p>We are not considering how much damage these lies can do when they&#39;re used to manipulate small minds toward extremism. No one would argue if we said that the Sandy Hook or Giffords shooters were foolish and naive. These were <em>dumb</em> people, who did awful things, and it wouldn&#39;t be a stretch to argue that they felt motivated by lies and unproven or debunked conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>For example, take the Uranium One conspiracy. Hillary&#39;s state department had one vote of ten, nine other agencies / groups also had to approve the sale. It also did not have anything to do with nuclear weapons. There wasn&#39;t a single crime committed in regard to Hillary and Uranium One, and even if you don&#39;t believe what I&#39;ve noted above, you <em>have to</em> accept that there has never been a better time in history for the justice department to investigate and then prosecute while the GOP holds majorities and the White House, and Trump appointees leading every facet of government. That fact alone should be enough for everyone to accept that it&#39;s an irrelevant lie but we still see it peddled over and over. And still, those lies aren&#39;t being censored. You see them everywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a response I am copy and pasting from another conspiracy thread where the word &quot;debunked&quot; was being misused.  </p>

<p>That &quot;debunk&quot; word you keep using is being misused. For something to be truly debunked there has to be some sort of proof that makes the theory impossible. Even if something is proven to be unlikely it is not &quot;debunked&quot;. I mean Popular Mechanics &quot;debunked&quot; the towers collapsing on 9/11 via explosives by citing the bonkers &quot;evaluation&quot; NIST did. In reality nothing was even close to debunked. Saying nuh-uh so and so said this didn&#39;t happen therefor it is debunked is such a crock of shit. Given this new criteria would you mind explaining how each one of your bullet points were actually proven to be impossible?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which bullet points are you referring to?</p>

<p>The Uranium One conspiracy implies that Hillary was the person responsible for approving the sale and that 20% of America&#39;s uranium for nukes was handed off to Russia. That is factually incorrect. You have one side saying &quot;It&#39;s a crime!&quot; And then the other side (including the justice department) saying what I did.</p>

<p>A conspiracy that hasn&#39;t been debunked for example would be Gary Webb&#39;s suicide. Hillary&#39;s poor health has never been debunked either. But flat earth theories, &quot;Uranium One being sold by Hillary is criminal&quot;, the &quot;Trump can&#39;t read&quot; conspiracies.... those <em>have</em> been debunked.</p>

<p>She&#39;d be prosecuted if it was bribery. That&#39;s a fact. And if you are saying that it&#39;s only because bribery is legal, then stop only complaining about the Clintons. Look at the special interests money going to <em>every</em> politician and be fair</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I never understood. If you are so against people questioning the official narrative why do you make it your goal to argue with them on a subreddit literally devoted to it. That&#39;s like going to <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a> to argue that 9/11 was an inside job. What is so difficult about just doing something else with your time and not getting emotional and name calling people you don&#39;t agree with? </p>

<p>I mean they have every right to do these things, I just don&#39;t see the point. No one wants to be wrong I guess, and I get that. Also I like how he just says &quot;asking the same questions and not accepting facts&quot; as if the answers we get are always 100% undeniable, unbiased provable facts, which a lot of the time they objectively aren&#39;t. (Like when you cite a government funded study by someone like NIST as proof that there couldn&#39;t have been a controlled demoliton, just as an example I really don&#39;t want to get into a debate about 9/11 here, there are tons of examples of this, i.e.: &quot;How could you think this is a conspiracy when the government has told us over and over that it is not! These are facts!&quot;)</p>

<p>One example that gets me every-time, there was a youtube video that &quot;claimed&quot; this guy who was a prince for the english family left a journal detailing what really happened with jack the ripper, and the fact that it was masonic symbols carved into the prostitutes. I know convenient right? proably fake, even though royalty falls in love with a whore and has a baby with her, and then they kill her, the baby, and the friends who knew, makes more sense to me than some guy who carved up a few prostitutes and never surfaced again. Thats just not how serial killers work, not to mention serial killer wasn&#39;t even really a term invented until modern america i do believe. Anyway im rambling, my point is, that video is gone, and all evidence it ever even existed has been wiped away.</p>

<p>Even if it was fake, should there not be something left of it? Maybe some youtube videos saying why it was fake? Instead, there is nothing, not even a few words on a blog somewhere about it. </p>
