<p>Ethos (sometimes referred to as an appeal to ethics), then, is used as a means of convincing an audience via the authority or credibility of the persuader, be it a notable or experienced figure in the field or even a popular celebrity.</p>

<p>Pathos (appeal to emotion) is a way of convincing an audience of an argument by creating an emotional response to an impassioned plea or a convincing story.</p>

<p>Logos (appeal to logic) is a way of persuading an audience with reason, using facts and figures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Logos is the most appealing of the 3 think. And not necessarily bad. The other two can be used in harmful ways, but facts are facts. You cannot just weave them as you please like you can do with ethics and emotions. If you are changing facts to be persuasive thats no longer &quot;logos&quot; imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While Logos is the most appealing on the surface it is the least likely to be accepted. </p>

<p>An appeal to logic only works if your target is predisposed to agreeing with your logic. For instance, a K-selected person can not logically engage with an R-selected person on many issues if they share no common ground. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not an emotional game. Nor an intellectual one. I daresay its something more abstract. Environment.</p>

<p>As an example, lets talk about saving for a rainy day. An R-selected person can not be reasoned with by a K selected person to save and not go into debt . Only a change in environment to one where saving is required will force the R-selected individual into change.</p>

<p>That is what the ancients used to refer to as wisdom. Knowledge you must experience yourself in order to obtain it.  </p>

<p>Until someone or someone close to them lands within the boundaries of life changing wisdom they simply lack the intellectual vocabulary to even comprehend what you are saying as anything but insanity. </p>

<p>So yeah, lots of people trust the government implicitly. Until something like Ruby Ridge, a prosecutor using their power to jail known innocent people, The Bundy Ranch, Or Savilles Broadmoor walks across the life of the average person they have no idea why people should fear their government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s even more basic than the K- and R-selected theory. It&#39;s simple tribalism -- in-group vs out-group, friend vs foe. Most effective way to wake somebody up, IMO, is to surround them by other &quot;woke&quot; people that they identify with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why am I reliving 11th grade English class...now that class was full of a bunch of shills(literally and figuratively) and conformimg to fit the teacher&#39;s grading rubric. Oddly, in that same class the teacher showed us a video on the 9-11 conspiracy-I forgot why. This was near summer. Most of us laughed it off as phoney baloney.</p>

<p>Huh I guess my 11th grade English class IS relevant to conspiracy reddit...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was flipping through this book at a bookstore:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Talk-Like-TED-Public-Speaking-Secrets/dp/1250041120">https://www.amazon.com/Talk-Like-TED-Public-Speaking-Secrets/dp/1250041120</a></p>

<p>Going from memory, there was a chapter analyzing the proportions of Ethos, Pathos, and Logos used in certain TED talks. Want to guess what the proportions were?</p>

<p>Ethos (credibility) was the least, Logos (logic/reasoning) came in second, but Pathos (appeal to emotion) formed something like 80% of the &quot;persuasiveness&quot; of TED talks.</p>

<p>And personally, I have a problem with TED talks...at least what they&#39;ve become. Needless to say, I didn&#39;t buy that book. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best Iranian poet IMO Hafez, who wrote his own divination book like I Ching, he knew sooo many words, used them so beautifully and cusses so openly at organized religion and the illusion of spirituality the Mullahs created during his time he was a very intelligent rebel. </p>

<p>His words are so beautiful, perfect and deep that governments use his poetry to promote their religion and skew the truth of what he really means, like being able to read between the lines in religious texts. They say he was called &#39;Hafez&#39; cuz it means someone who&#39;s memorized all the Quran, that is true but he perceived past Islam, he realized the sham they were playing on us then. I used to know the best Hafez translator and extremely spiritual Iranians, I used to write Persian poetry and won a small calligraphy contest. </p>

<p>Every solstice is traditional for Iranian families to have a warm gathering, eat watermelon, nuts, drink tea and read a passage from his divination book to set the mood for the new year. Every action/thought should be seen as a ritual. </p>
