        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>SS: Perhaps it&#39;s the desired effect, that people just give up and stop discussing political issues with one another. And I assume, when that happens, the corporate media and think tanks will gleefully control the narratives everywhere, as is the case with many subreddits. It&#39;s a shame that the only use I find in Reddit now is shitposting to h3h3&#39;s subreddit, some personal finance subs, and asking occasional questions when need be. </p>

<p>I sincerely hope you all find something you love, work on your health, and your sense of wellbeing as people. </p>

<p>Reddit is lost. It has been for a while. I wouldn&#39;t come here looking for discussion. I come here to see what the latest shill talking points are so that they are more easily recognizable in other social arenas. </p>

<p>There is a war for our minds occurring every second of every day, no Alex Jones.  It is important to recognize when an information platform becomes the enemy of free thought and speech. </p>

So, given the sudden explosion and political action behind social media, the powers that be decided to dismantle them and render them useless.

    <div class="md"><p>Just because a user calls attention to rampant shills/trolls/brigades doesn&#39;t mean that user isn&#39;t one of them themselves. I&#39;ve seen plenty of suspicious accounts making posts exactly like this. In fact I&#39;d say you&#39;re more likely to see a suspicious-looking account post something like this than an obvious regular who has been active here a long time. I haven&#39;t investigated op, so I won&#39;t comment on this specific case, but don&#39;t think that the brigaders wouldn&#39;t make a post like this too. They definitely want us to know they&#39;re here, I think they want us to be paranoid about their presence. </p>

<p>think what you will i never try to convince anyone of anything, i float ideas and leave you to make your own judgements. i have no interest in people blindly following anything i say, i want to provoke questions and inspire you to find your own answers.</p>

<p>i&#39;ve been around here since around 2010 using the identical names.
ie Nogrim, Nogrim1, Nogrim2, Nogrim3,Nogrim4, etc etc. each ends up retired after it gets its worldnews ban, and i start fresh, this one is the most recent and im planning on turfing it shortly as its already gotten too much karma for my liking (aka attention)
ive been here since the days of Bipolarbear and his ban shenanigans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just block anyone who appears to be a bad actor, troll, liar, shill, etc. I might get some &quot;false positives&quot; sometimes, but if your comment/post can make me think &quot;this liar is a paid shill&quot;, I&#39;m completely fine ensuring that I never ever have to interact with that person. Even if they&#39;re just an idiot rather than an actual professional agitator. I don&#39;t need that shit in my life, I refuse to let toxic assholes have their way with me. </p>

<p>Yeah, I block a LOT of users basically every single day, but it achieves the desired result. I can communicate in this community without the nefarious influence getting to me. Obviously, we can&#39;t all do this, and it&#39;s a good thing that other people call attention to the bad actors when I refuse to, but for people like me who absolutely can&#39;t stand the disingenuous brigades and might leave the community altogether if I couldn&#39;t avoid them, it is a workable option that&#39;s worth considering. </p>
