<p>This person is an absolute disaster.  This person did nothing for 20 years except plot on how to advance their career.  This person went to Embassy parties and upgraded their travel in order to schmooze Wall Street executives in first class accommodations.  This person also plotted on how to shovel off work to other people in the most astounding ways and then blame these people when things went wrong.  And then plot to communicate damaging information to these people&#39;s bosses. And to my knowledge this is all this person did in 20 years is to back stab and get others to do the work.  </p>

<p>This person is gone now but the damage that was left behind is immense.  This bridge failure cost tens of millions in user costs.</p>

<p>This bridge should never have failed - EVER.  But with utter incompetence and sloth it did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in state.   That fire was the most suspect thing I’ve ever seen.   From those not in the area— the section of interstate burned/destroyed is probablyTHE most major road artery in the whole of the south- or at least a big part of it.  </p>

<p>10s of millions of drivers/delivery disrupted.   The story?   A couple of bums had a barrel fire that got out of control.  And burned down 6-8 lanes of concrete overpass?!?</p>

<p>Never did add up.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To further add on this suspicion.. 
I live OTP and travel to and from Atlanta daily. While a large portion of 85S was closed the the state immediately started to repave at least 40+ miles of the five lanes on 85. Not only that but they have installed and are still installing ‘sound retaining walls’ that completely block view of the highway. I’m sure some of this is being done in efforts to extend the length of the Peach Pass lane however, the sequence of events following the fire was very suspect to me </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I told my colleagues while I was still working that these people must have been smoking ten tons of crack a day to burn this bridge down!  It&#39;s reinforced concrete structure and people should try to set high quality reinforced concrete on fire and see how long it takes!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve worked in infrastructure my whole career and these bridges are built to endure a HUGE amount of damage and not collapse.  I&#39;ve seen bridges that have had half their beams destroyed and they are still standing AND carrying traffic.  I&#39;ve seen piers destroyed also and the bridge is still carrying traffic.</p>

<p>You are right I can&#39;t figure it out myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They didn&#39;t pull of anything.  It was gross incompetence.</p>

<p>ISIS would have a hard time pulling this off!  They would need a lot of High Explosive and somehow would need to park this massive bomb under the bridge and hope it didn&#39;t get noticed.  OR they would need to place a lot of HE around the superstructure which would take hours (days) and hope they didn&#39;t get caught.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone was covered (is still being covered) for. The Georgia DOT spokesman named in this article basically summarizes that the storage of &quot;highly inflammable parts and weak security just kind of happened, like we just never though about this&quot;.<br/>
The conspiracy is blaming a poor old black man solely for his part in the debacle, and ignoring / forgiving white construction contractors for being lazy and leaving parts around and not securing the area.<br/>
Hell, the skate park should have been allowed to stay open!<br/>
