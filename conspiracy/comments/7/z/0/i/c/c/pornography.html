<p>I wasn&#39;t really arguing with you but since you&#39;ve asked...
The collapse will occur when the government defaults on it&#39;s debt - which will happen because it&#39;s mathematically impossible to pay off.  That could be 20 years from now, but my guess would be sooner. The most powerful banking institutions have been literally robbing the world population since 1910.</p>

<p>There will come a time when &quot;quantitative easing&quot; will no longer alleviating the market.  Then hyper-inflation, collapse and ww3 I imagine.</p>

<p>I could suggest some books if you&#39;d like to read more about it.</p>

<p>Yeah, not happening in 20 years or sooner, not in our lifetime even. Germany and Russia who were ruined economically came back from that. The US came back from two &quot;collapses&quot; we have the way to pay, we have to be more fiscal with our monies.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p><strong>Jewish involvement in the X-rated industry can be seen as a proverbial two fingers to the entire WASP establishment in America.</strong> Some porn stars viewed themselves as frontline fighters in the spiritual battle between Christian America and secular humanism. According to Ford, Jewish X-rated actors often brag about their ‘joy in being anarchic, sexual gadflies to the puritanical beast’. <strong>Jewish involvement in porn, by this argument, is the result of an atavistic hatred of Christian authority: they are trying to weaken the dominant culture in America by moral subversion.</strong> Astyr remembers having ‘to run or fight for it in grammar school because I was a Jew. It could very well be that part of my porn career is an “up yours” to these people’. Al Goldstein, the publisher of Screw, said (on lukeford.net), <strong>‘The only reason that Jews are in pornography is that we think that Christ sucks.</strong> Catholicism sucks. We don’t believe in authoritarianism.’ <strong>Pornography thus becomes a way of defiling Christian culture and, as it penetrates to the very heart of the American mainstream</strong> (and is no doubt consumed by those very same WASPs), its subversive character becomes more charged. Porn is no longer of the ‘what the Butler saw’ voyeuristic type; instead, it is driven to new extremes of portrayal that stretch the boundaries of the porn aesthetic. As new sexual positions are portrayed, the desire to shock (as well as entertain) seems clear.</p>

<p>It is a case of the traditional revolutionary/radical drive of immigrant Jews in America being channelled into sexual rather than leftist politics. Just as <strong>Jews have been disproportionately represented in radical movements over the years, so they are also disproportionately represented in the porn industry. Jews in America have been sexual revolutionaries. A large amount of the material on sexual liberation was written by Jews. Those at the forefront of the movement which forced America to adopt a more liberal view of sex were Jewish. Jews were also at the vanguard of the sexual revolution of the 1960s.</strong> Wilhelm Reich, Herbert Marcuse and Paul Goodman replaced Marx, Trotsky and Lenin as required revolutionary reading. Reich’s central preoccupations were work, love and sex, while Marcuse prophesied that a socialist utopia would free individuals to achieve sexual satisfaction. Goodman wrote of the ‘beautiful cultural consequences’ that would follow from legalizing pornography: it would ‘ennoble all our art’ and ‘humanize sexuality’.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Porn is an interesting industry when you start to explore the business end of it. I think what a lot of people don&#39;t realize is that its absolutely huge. Much bigger money than all of main stream Hollywood. It is also at the forefront of tech and I would argue it drives tech in a big way. </p>

<p>In terms of your question. I think the answer is that there is more of all kinds of porn than there has ever been. So with the rise of violence and simulated crime there has also been a rise in things like ethical porn and sex positive feminist porn. The things that tend to make a lot of money cater to niche markets in many cases, so your weird stuff like necro or quick sand. People with specific kinks are willing to pay more for their content. Its really just supply and demand. If you want something exotic that not many people are producing you will probably have to pay more. Some people even commission their own films (expensive). </p>

<p>I have a window into this because I happen to know some people who work in the industry (behind the scenes). It&#39;s not just a bunch of weird guys with cameras in seedy hotel rooms (though there is some of that). Look up VR porn its some of the highest quality VR content out there.       </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I normally don&#39;t even bother to respond to post like OP up there because I realize mine is an unpopular opinion. Guess I just felt like getting some down votes. Sex isn&#39;t inherently bad and porn isn&#39;t inherently bad for you. Just like anything people can have unhealthy obsessions but that&#39;s not the fault of the thing its the fault of the person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno. My roommate is an agent and the industry has been sinking for awhile. His agency is one of the most legit and they have been downsizing for a few years now. I’m always asking where the money is because it isn’t in being an agent. Producers are folding left and right. </p>

<p>I agree that there is money in Niche content. Some producers create custom porn for wealthy clientele that even involves simulated murder. The client chooses the girls, the costumes and the scenario. There’s a producer in Oregon that has a “kill room” in his house to shoot this type of porn. They sell for up to $25k apiece.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The industry is a hard one these days. From what I&#39;m told piracy has been the number one issue for content creators. web sights will blatantly rip content and re-upload as their own all the time. The funny thing about porn is even thought its legal good luck getting any sympathy from the courts when it comes to people ripping you off, they just don&#39;t care. Everything is hard from protecting your content to possessing payments, card companies find out your media company is in porn and they will refuse to serve you.  </p>

<p>I agree with your solutions. It works. But, not when a private bank loans your money on interest. Which is the current mode of monetary creation. </p>
