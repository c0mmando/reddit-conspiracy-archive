    <div class="md"><p>The flu vaccine brings in $1.6b every year to pharmaceutical manufacturers. Sure nothing to sneeze at, but the three main manufacturers (GSK, Sanofi Pasteur, and CSL) make a combined $55b a year as is. </p>

<p>Why would they go through all this trouble to fake it all, to lie to millions, to run the risk of people finding out, for 3% of their revenue (admittedly likely more of their revenue for the smaller two but overall it would require everyone being in on it)? </p>

<p>It doesn’t make any sense at all. There is no reason to do it. They aren’t faking it. The flu vaccine is just not ever going to be 100% effective and this year it’s like 10% effective. And I say this as someone that doesn’t get the flu vaccine anyway because why bother? It’s at best a 50/50 chance to prevent it and I’m unlikely to be one of the few hundred healthy people that get it and die anyway. There’s no conspiracy. </p>

<p>Can you source these?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Getting vaccinated prevents ppl from acquiring natural long lasting immunity. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s never been proven that receiving an illness makes a person more immune than the vaccine. It&#39;s also far riskier as the illness can kill a person at a far higher rate than a vaccine can (technically, at a near infinitely higher rate).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vaccines have several very toxic and dangerous ingredients, contaminants and ‘adjuvants that result in chronic illness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything you eat has &quot;toxic&quot; and &quot;dangerous&quot; ingredients. It&#39;s the amounts that matter. Like the amount of thiomersal in immunizations shots isn&#39;t even in the same realm as an amount that can be considered dangerous. There&#39;s more mercury in tuna fish and more cyanide in apples.</p>

—Avid uptake of Aluminum occurs, when injected, and it accumulates persistently in the brain and organs. </p>

<p>“Safety concerns largely depend on the long biopersistence time inherent to this adjuvant, which may be related to its quick withdrawal from the interstitial fluid by avid cellular uptake; and the capacity of adjuvant particles to migrate and slowly accumulate in lymphoid organs and the brain, a phenomenon documented in animal models and resulting from MCP1/CCL2-dependant translocation of adjuvant-loaded monocyte-lineage cells (Trojan horse phenomenon). These novel insights strongly suggest that serious re-evaluation of long-term aluminum adjuvant phamacokinetics and safety should be carried out.”</p>

<p>More elderly are dying since the widespread use of flu vaccine in the elderly.</p>

<p>Not according to the study.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We could not correlate increasing vaccination coverage after 1980 with declining mortality rates in any age group</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only conclusion was that for this particular vaccine they could not find a decline in elder mortality. Nothing about an increase in rates.</p>

<p>And the contaminants studies could not find any evidence of harm.</p>

<p>We can play wack-a-mole with various immunization studies forever.  But at the end of the day, you will not find one scientist on any of these papers who will say that it&#39;s better to not be vaccinated. Because despite all the <em>possible</em> minor risks involved, it&#39;s still far safer to follow the standard immunization schedule and prevent grievous harm to immune compromised people and prevent the spread of potentially permanently damaging diseases like rubella and measles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First link: Specifically states that it&#39;s far safer to vaccinate.</p>

<p>Second and third link: One doctor. And he already lost legitimacy when he called the Ebola and Zika outbreaks &quot;bogus&quot;. But still, one doctor.</p>

<p>Cleveland article: Guy honestly sounds like a quack. Promoting &quot;wellness&quot; and &quot;holistic health&quot; along with his own food brand. But he&#39;s a doctor so that brings your total up to two.</p>

<p>Ethical Nag: Cherry picked quotes about issues regarding the FDA approval process. Nothing about vaccines being worse than the alternative.</p>

<p>CDC Experts: Doubtful any of them would recommend not vaccinating. But who knows? You can&#39;t find the article so it could be literally anything.</p>

<p>Suzanne Humphries: Ah yes. The golden child of the anti-immunizers since Wakefield lost his license. More subtle methods of cherry picked data and statistical manipulation, but still a doctor. Total doctors: 3. </p>

<p>CDC Whistleblowers: Anonymous scientists, not doctors. And no talk about recommending not to vaccinate.</p>

<p>So there you have it. Three doctors who do not reccomend vaccination. Sorry, but I&#39;ll take the overwhelmingly vast majority of modern human scientific consensus over them any day</p>

“In the United States, measles is generally a benign, short-term viral infection; 99.99% of measles cases fully recover,” said Dr. Miller. “As it has NOT been proven that the MMR vaccine is safer than measles, there is INSUFFICIENT evidence to demonstrate that mandatory measles mass vaccination results in a net public health benefit in the United States.”</p>

<p>There is a five-fold higher risk of seizures from the MMR vaccine than seizures from measles, and a significant portion of MMR-vaccine seizures cause permanent harm. </p>

<p>Furthermore, I find it quite suspicious that an entire organization dedicated to Doctors against Vaccination can only marshal five or six actual MD&#39;s on their board. Most of the doctors in the &quot;About Us&quot; page is made up of post-docs in unrelated fields like Computer Science. </p>

<p>A conspiracy is for example that the flu virus is intentionally altered each couple of months by the government/big pharma in order to sell more of their intentionally uneffective flu shots. &quot;<em>A flu vaccinated woman dies of the flu</em>&quot; is no conspiracy at all. </p>

—Avid uptake of Aluminum occurs, when injected, and it accumulates persistently in the brain and organs. </p>

<p>“Safety concerns largely depend on the long biopersistence time inherent to this adjuvant, which may be related to its quick withdrawal from the interstitial fluid by avid cellular uptake; and the capacity of adjuvant particles to migrate and slowly accumulate in lymphoid organs and the brain, a phenomenon documented in animal models and resulting from MCP1/CCL2-dependant translocation of adjuvant-loaded monocyte-lineage cells (Trojan horse phenomenon). These novel insights strongly suggest that serious re-evaluation of long-term aluminum adjuvant phamacokinetics and safety should be carried out.”</p>
