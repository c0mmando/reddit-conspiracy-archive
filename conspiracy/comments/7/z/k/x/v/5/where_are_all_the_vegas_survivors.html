       Being a non American its just strange that all these kids are making noise about gun control but there has been nothing from the 10s of thousands that were at The Vegas shooting. Do y'all just pick and choose what horrific massacre you protest about?

       My information says that there was ~22000 people in the crowd so yes "10s of thousands" is correct. Please let me know if you have different information and I'll change it. But the point I'm making is still the same i.e. lots more people were in attendance at Vegas than in Florida but non of those are saying anything.

       This is what I don't get: every mass shooting off significance kicks off a nation-wide debate about gun control, as if there is some "In case of mass shooting, break glass" box in every newsroom.  They are prepared for this debate from the first hours after it breaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has never sat right with me that the far-and-away worst shooting in American history is the line exception to the media's narrative.  What usually takes a full week to exhaust itself in the typical news cycle was over in a couple days, as if there were a conscious decision for everybody to stop talking about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't know what any of this means, but it's strange and creepy.

       Well, there's that argument that those would also significantly decrease with stricter gun regulations. You know, since after say trying to cut open your wrist, you can still be saved and treated. A shot to the head is a lot more likely to be fatal. And there are a lot of suicides.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an article (coincidentally released about after the Vegas shooting), that features a study about how particularly suicides dropped after stricter gun regulations were implemented in Australia, while also stating that a decrease in guns and suicides can't be linked that easily. Which is what it'd call pretty fair journalism.

       An argument not backed by data is useless.  Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in America..  around 45k a year.  Only 22k a year are committed with firearms,  I think those assumptions are incredibly misguided.

       Because the majority of suicides happen in the 55+ age group.  Guns clearly have nothing to do with it.

       I posted the article because it has data suggesting that there is a correlation between guns and suicides. But you're right maybe I should've posted more data:
      </p>
      <p>
       So first off, suicide by firearm is the 10th leading cause of death in the US, true. 22k is twice as much as gun related homicides, making suicides with a firearm the #1 gun related cause of death in the US. We should do something about that, because the other top 9 causes are sickness or accidents, this is the only willfully inflicted cause of death in the top 10. (Suicides btw are also the second most cause of death for age groups 10-34:
       <a href="https://www.sprc.org/scope/age">
        https://www.sprc.org/scope/age
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's and article by the Harvard public health magazine, which incorporates some more data on the relationship between guns and suicides:
       <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/magazine/guns-and-suicide/">
        https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/magazine/guns-and-suicide/
       </a>
       One of the professors says what I wanted to say, only way better: “Studies show that most attempters act on impulse, in moments of panic or despair. Once the acute feelings ease, 90 percent do not go on to die by suicide. But few can survive a gun blast.”
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that a gun is the root cause of what kills these people. It's just so damn easy to actually kill yourself with one.
      </p>
      <p>
       A suicide attempt is a lot more likely to succeed with a firearm than it is with all other methods, the fatality rate is about 80%:
       <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/case-fatality/">
        https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/case-fatality/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it's a coincidence suicide by firearm is somewhere steady between 35 and 60 percent of all methods of suicide (depending on age and gender):
       <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db241.html">
        https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db241.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;dr: all I'm trying to say is: if you have a person wanting to kill himself, a gun within reach makes all the difference, and the data backs that up. It's not the guns fault (duh), clearly there's a mental health issue here. To assure a decline in suicides, gun regulations (stricter background and mental health checks) would definitely work and prevent a lot of deaths.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I don't get the argument about how most suicides happen in the 55+ age group and therefore guns have nothing to do with it.

       I'm not sure if this was by accident, but you linked a Wikipedia article to the suicides in South Korea, which specifically pins the high suicide rate in the elderly on socio-economic problems of South Korea. Not the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, my argument still stands: You're still a lot more likely to succeed when a gun is around. No matter is impulsive or not. Plus for age groups in which impulsive suicide is most common, having a gun in the house is definitely more lethal. Let me back that up with some data:
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure owning a gun or not does the difference, at least not for males: 
"State-level firearm ownership was associated with an increase in both male and female firearm-related suicide rates and with a decrease in nonfirearm-related suicide rates. Higher gun ownership was associated with higher suicide rates by any means among male, but not among female, persons." -
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4984734/">
        https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4984734/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, this paper specifically mentions the heightened rate of suicide in homes where a gun is owned (which stands in contrast to your suggestion about age playing a role in this): 
"[it] found in both crude and multivariate analyses, among men and women and in every age group, that states with higher rates of household gun ownership had higher rates of firearm suicide and overall suicide."
-
       <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031811-124636?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;amp;#_i10">
        https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031811-124636?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;amp;#_i10
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So these are two scientific sources correlating gun ownership or prevalence to a higher rate of suicide. As shown, guns are the most lethal means of suicide (80%), they're used in almost 50% percent of all suicides, gun ownership and suicide rates correlate and higher rates of household gun ownership have higher rates of suicides involving a gun plus higher rates of suicides in total.

      <p>
       South Korea has a suicide rate that is much higher than the US,  but they have an exceptionally low level of gun ownership and availability.  I was trying to make several points at once.

       ,  age
       <em>
        absolutely
       </em>
       plays a role in this, emphasis mine:  "Three additional findings from the case-control studies are notable. First, the higher risk of suicide in homes with firearms applies not only to the gun owner but also to the gun owner's spouse and
       <strong>
        children
       </strong>
       ; the relative risk of suicide associated with a firearm in the home is
       <strong>
        greater for young people
       </strong>
       , and greatest for those without known psychopathology. Second, the presence of a firearm in the home, no matter how it is stored, is a risk factor for completed suicide. Third, how household guns are stored matters. One case-control study that focused on the role of firearm storage in suicide risk among younger people found that
       <strong>
        adolescent suicide was four times more likely in homes with a loaded, unlocked firearm
       </strong>
       , compared with homes where firearms were stored unloaded and locked."
      </p>
      <p>
       Again..  the base data suggests there is more than just gun ownership,  but surrounding factors which may not be included in the longitude of the study and there's a strong component of impulse involved given the data on storage.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        gun ownership and suicide rates correlate
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       At a weak level,  and

      <p>
       First off: Sorry for the very late reply, and thanks for this great discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to say that South Korea isn't the US, but I also mentioned Australia (if I'd know more about either of those culture I'd argue that maybe Australia culture is closer, but I don't, so I'll leave it be). Point taken.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the point I made about you saying age is not playing a role in this was exactly the one you made. I was criticizing your comment about kids not being able to own a gun anyways. The quote you're giving talks about heightened likelihood of suicides for kids, and heightened likelihood of dioxides in general if there's a gun owner in a household, among other things. This is the point I'm trying to make.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're definitely right, there are of course other factors playing into this. The well being of society and the individual etc. that would lead up to suicide (I'm ignoring the probably (hopefully) minuscule number of accidental suicides - or people that kill themselves like Terry Kath did, out of sheer idiocy).
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think we reached some kind of common ground, didn't we? There's a heightened possibility of suicides in gun owner households (the extent of which is up for discussion still), but there's other factors playing into it as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people freak easily whenever they hear gun control, maybe because of some crass opinions by some people ("let's take them ALL away!") or for a million different reasons. However you wanna call it, if there's a heightened risk, let's make owning guns safer for everybody.

       So politicizing the death of children is OK with you now?

       And I know what "discussion" means to you neo liberals.. It means "shut up and listen".

       What
       <em>

       <em>

       level. From the FBI not investigating to the resource officer cowering outside while people were getting shot inside. And yet we're supposed to have a "discussion" about disarming and depending on the government to protect us.

       So, you're kind of insane. How do you jump to all of those conclusions? You made up so much stuff. No wonder there are so many problems when people like you literally create a problem out of thin air. The constant paranoia is not healthy. Seek professional mental health help. Forget the stigma attached to it.

       There were over 20,000 people attending the concert if I remember correctly and if you add in all the people around the venue I'm sure that number is at least a few thousand people higher. So op's 10's of thousands isn't off base at all, just pointing it out,not being confrontational. And yeah op, it is rather odd that there wasn't a large movement from that one imo. Kids getting shot just looks worse on tv I guess as nobody would really say "eh those kids deserved it" but I heard/saw people mentioning about Vegas that "those right wing country fans deserved it anyways" and similar types of opinions

       Vegas happened at a country music festival. The voting base was Republican/Conservative so doing a media Blitz would have been a waste of time.   And? Las Vegas washes a lot of money and nobody in power there wants a microscope on the town.

      <p>
       However, Florida is a battleground state for conservative values. It also has the Trayvon Martin incident and the Bush hanging chad incident. So it’s a prime place to pump as much money into exploiting the anger and fear of the situation.

       It’s weird, but I had a friend at the festival, when I asked her if she was okay later at night she said, “yeah we’re fine we just ducked and ran inside :-)” and she hasn’t made a single post or comment on the shooting anywhere, completely unfazed by it

       Quite possible, I know her for usually being in the GA crowd. I’ve personally never been shot at with the intention of being killed, but I think it would affect me a great deal to be in that type of situation

       The times aren't all that different, w just hear from the city folks far more than the country folk about their perceptions of such things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kids are still carrying .22s and popping gophers and snakes from very young ages in rural areas. I've been out with several friends who have kids to hunt coyote or small game and any kid over 5 has their own gun and knows how to shoot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm in my early 30s and us kids would meet up on our bikes with .22s, 410s and 30-30s to go exploring all the time. Many cans, gophers and snakes met their demise during our play.
      </p>
      <p>
       This continued through high school in the early 2000s but the guns were in our trucks instead of strapped to our bikes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's not as common as rural areas are slowly taken over but there's still plenty of people who grow up with a gun in their hands.

       I was talking about them shooting towards each other, using the 22s as toys. And they were using them in a suburb of Los Angeles, not a rural part of the country.

       We dusted each other with .22 birdshot now and then, actually dug a pellet out of my leg last year that had been in there this whole time, haha.
      </p>
      <p>
       They look like standard .22 but with a clear casing filled with tiny pellets. Don't care where you're from though, getting hit with standard .22 for fun is nuts. No way I'd do that.

       My sister was there and she was pretty freaked about it at the time but hasn't said anything about it since. Also, she doesn't believe in conspiracies but she said without a doubt there were multiple shooters. Maybe that's another reason for the silence, they don't want witnesses talking about that.

       It seems like the "media" is going where the story is on this case. I doubt a majority of these kids are taking their cues from CNN or MSNBC. The longer media cycle on this incident is due to the activism the kids are showing. The story is ongoing because the kids aren't staying silent.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's true that CNN hosting that gun control town hall was a flop, but some of those kids are the ones outing CNN for scripting everything.

       The media is a vulture, swooping in only to pick the dead carcass’ of white children in suburban communities. Violence and mass shootings occur in non white inner cities all the time and we hear nothing from the “media.” The MSM is 21st century propaganda at this point, both left and right wing channels.

       You said it yourself. They are from a white suburban community. These kids have the resources for that type of action. Also, they did not march with "CNN approved questions" (tf does that even mean?) The media wasnt encouraging the kids to march. They reported on it after it happened. The town hall thing came after as well.

       Also, after enough of these events happen and nothing happens, eventually people are going to get fed up and it's going to hit a tipping point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Congress was all promises after Vegas, we're going to talk common-sense gun legislation - just not now.  Now is NOT the time to talk about it.  It's too close to the tragedy.  Then, nothing happens, by design.  They kick the can down the road and people move on.  But I think people are fucking sick of that response, and that's what you're seeing.

       No it doesn't. It's just partisan propaganda. 
Does it really take so little to convince you of anything? This is a goddamn conspiracy sub and you just take some randos unsourced opinion and go "well guess that is all the proof I need".

       No I'm not convinced by that one, stand alone, piece of information however it is an opinion that I would never have considered before. So it goes into the bank of my reasoning of why nothing was done after Vegas and I'm thankful for it. I'm just trying to understand why things are the way they are.

       You say "that explains a lot". So excuse me for taking your words at face value...
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the reason it goes into your bank? It's completely and utterly unsourced. It's purely based on his own political agenda. I'm just trying to prevent misinformation to be interpreted as facts or a source. At least ask him to explain in depth why he came up with this reason if you're thinking of "adding it to your bank".
      </p>
      <p>
       Where do you get the idea from that "nothing was done after vegas"? Can you link me some sources? Because I've only really seen it on this sub on some political forums honestly.... which is all just hearsay repeated enough times to make it sound legit. Which is what I'm trying to prevent here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be critical.

       Not sure why I'm even trying to tbh. This sub is lost anyway. No one is here for anything but confirmation bias these days...

       Well I'm happy if ruined your day, that's enough for me. You don't have to accept anything I say, I never asked you to. I appreciate your concern but my critical thinking skills are active and if I do end up writing an essay on this subject be assured I wouldn't be putting "comment from reddit" down as a reference, but it is interesting to hear a POV that isn't my own and consider it. I had a dumb question and I figured that this sub would be the best place to put it, so sue me.

If you're a critical thinker fine all good. But your comment implied you took everything at face value so I jumped in.

       We had a school shooting here in Marshall County, KY a few weeks ago, and it barely registered on the radar nationally. It’s absurd to see how the media picks and chooses what to cover. I’ve been watching all this footage thinking “Why didn’t we get this much coverage? Why didn’t national media blitz KY and talk to kids?”

       We know why.

       Two things I noticed from the reports I read on that shooting:
       <br/>
       The kid used a handgun, not a rifle.
       <br/>
       And I'm not seeing anything identifying the shooter but his age, ie name race or a picture. I see descriptions such as
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Authorities said that the shooter is a 15-year-old boy who is a student at the school.
       </p>

       I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess it didn't get national 24/7 coverage because it doesn't fit MSM's agenda.

       Only 2 died in the Kentucky shooting, compared to 17 in Florida. Sadly 2 kids being shot is too common to be newsworthy anymore in America, you need a much higher death count these days.

       Because big city liberal reporters have no interest in spending any time in Kentucky or any other "fly over" state.

       But if a big story happens in south Florida during cold weather months, you can bet your ass every big city liberal reporter will be all over that, having a reason to stay in south Florida, at least until it warms up in New York City. Plus the virtue signaling potential.

       The reason the Vegas story disappeared is because the Feds wanted it to. Not because it isn't useful to the anti-gun narrative, but because there's a massive cover-up going on. I don't know what really happened, but it's clear the official story about Paddock is bs. The Feds made sure the media faded away.

Somehow lately within the past year Reddit has become HEAVILY left minded. So much that there's about 20 major democratic views subs.. they're pushing an agenda on Reddit as well.

       You are absolutely right. It makes no sense. And millions of people in my country are talking like that. Can you imagine?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right that the Vegas shooting has all but disappeared from the public dialogue. It is definitely bizarre. I really don't have a solid explanation for it, besides a couple of my own theories, but one thing I can say is that you should take it with a grain of salt when somebody talks about people saying "oh, those were country music fans, they deserved it, blah blah blah." Those people are basically quoting the lowest common denominator of the left wing, and that does not accurately represent the gun control crowd over here.

       Yeah it's definitely a small percent of people that say those types of things. Just the same as when it happens to a more left leaning crowd that people on the right say similar things. But since this time it was children again, and basicaly nobody will say that children deserve it, it makes it a better one to get behind for anyone looking to push gun control.

       You have missed my point completely.  A hard working American gun owner knows enough that it wasn't a gun to blame. It was the complete "tool" who took it upon himself to shoot at a unsuspecting group of people. 
 It doesn't matter the age of his target or the political leanings of the crowd. It took a human to pull the trigger. He could just as easily drove a truck thru them or set off a bomb.
  The manner of death is, at this point, immaterial.  The HUMAN that commits the crime should be the focus. Including his motives and mental health. Not the tool he used.

       What's the implication here? Do you think the fact that you haven't seen a lot of Vegas activists on TV means that shooting was a false flag?

       If that is what OP is stating then they are correct, Vegas was a false flag event.

       I did not say that or imply that nor intend a reader to infer that, I was simply wondering why this is getting so much attention where "the worst" public shooting in peace time USA gets comparatively nothing.

       I never meant to imply that you did. My comment was aimed at the other poster letting them know that if you had implied Vegas was a false flag, you would have been correct. My intention was not to put words in your mouth but to correct the other poster as to whether Vegas was or was not a false flag, which IMO, it definitely was.

       Yeah I know, you're cool, I was just stating that my position was that I wasn't going to go down the false flag highway. But if there is some evidence to prove to me wrong I'm more than open to changing my mind.

       One was mostly adults born before 1990. The other was a group of affluent kids many of whom belong to the "my feelins" generation all born after 2000 most after 2001. People care about kids, 1; and 2 this generation has protested over someone saying "he" instead of "she". They will make more noise.

       I saw plenty of small groups taking about this at the time. I listen to democracy now most mornings though, corporate media doesn't actually cover these things, so if your reference point is the TV, you're correct, but for someone like myself with more direct sources, I remember people speaking out differently.

       They did talk to the Las Vegas survivors about it. That demographic was generally opposed to new gun laws. That's fine and they're welcome to that opinion.

       These victims do want gun legislation and that too is fine. The difference is there weren't any movements on the left trying to paint the Las Vegas survivors as paid shills or crisis actors for having a dissenting opinion. You may want to ask yourselves about that if you happen to be part of the movements who work to silence dissent in such a way.

        Get the fuck out of here with this bullshit.

He is rehearsing talking points that are being fed to him, is an FBI agent's and CNN big-wig's son.

       Comments like this are why the term shill is thrown about so much. I'm not saying you are, I'm just pointing out what an ignorant statement that was. Nobody, ever, at any point in any conspiracy theory has ever claimed that every single person present was an actor, they wouldn't need to be because people follow, that's not a dig at people, we are what we are and we follow and copy and nothing more so only a select few would need to be paid actors. Just think before making a comment.

       Actually the term shill gets thrown about so much is because as hominem attacks are the easiest, and laziest, way to argue a point because you don’t address the comment but instead attack the commenter.

       No. "Shill" is thrown at users who are perceived to be disengenuously pushing an agenda, possibly for hire, which sometimes involve massive amounts of effort. You must be new around here.

       Shills are a spanner in the works however they can manage it, it doesn't require massive amounts of effort at all, like i said people follow they only need a nudge and that's why shills are employed, to nudge. You must be new around here hurdur look at you swinging that dick about, grow up.

       Many of those in the crowd know guns and said they weren't real shots being fired, there was also someone recording the area from above the whole time who said they saw nobody injured.  It was probably too easy to expose as a fraud thus they moved onto the next one.. Fortunately it's full of holes too and there are more people aware of it than ever.

       If one of your family members were shot and killed at the harvest festival, whatre the chances you would just be ok with the complete non explanation weve got so far for what happened and who stephen paddock was and why he did it?

       Two things.
      </p>
      <p>
       First paddock was an arms dealer in Vegas to sell to a group of ISIS fighter who were in town that weekend for an Islamic gathering. Yet ISIS being ISIS just killed him and opened fire. It was covered up because paddock was selling for the CIA.

       I'm glad I could clear that up for you.

       Second thing is you are assuming that the families are whiny cunts. Yet this isn't missing people. This is death people. What is there to whine about? In there official narrative, the murderer is already dead. What more could a family want. This was country music fans, IE super pro gun. So they aren't going to go down that road.

       Well, were both aware of the rumored cia/govt connections, so i think families would be as well especially given the lack of answers.

      <p>
       Ive asked hundreds of times for evidence of anyone being shot, and still havent seen any. There was the one video that came out from the scene with that kid frantically checking pulses and non existent bullet wounds while the lights went out with no emts around, but that was completely staged imo. You can disagree about the validity of that video, but ive seen enough videos and pictures of the scene to convince me nobody was shot there.

       Personally I believe it was a globalist plot to take our guns away. They figured if they killed a bunch of right wingers, then they would agree to gun control. Yet the globalist huberous doesn't understand that the core believe every time one of these mass murders happen, is that more people should have guns not less. The globalist will never understand this because they think the public is dumb and can be easily suede in their opinions. Those fucking cunts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like the Valentine mass murder. This time the globalists thought killing kids could change the right wing mind. Yet like always the right responded with, well let's give teachers guns. The next shooting will be a church.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow what were we talking about, oh right yeah I saw that video too. But have you seen the
       <a href="https://youtu.be/JxmEFeKy8aI">
        sound analysis
       </a>
       where he shows the sound of bullets hitting the ground. I agree we have no pictures of bullet holes or bullets. Also that shooting a full auto
       <a href="https://youtu.be/_mXe9dk77bk">
        M240
       </a>
       at 400 yards and getting any accuracy is an absurd notion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet none of the eye witnesses
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/79nyb3/its_been_less_than_a_month_since_las_vegas">
        found dead
       </a>
       were saying it didn't happen. They all were saying multiple shooters. Also considering anyone who knows that it was likely a set up, would also know about people dying for speaking up. Thus wouldn't it stand to reason that people would just let it go rather than chance having a "heart attack". Not to mention that I'm sure every victims family got money from gofundmes and likely the concert.
      </p>
      <p>
       At what point do you just move on with life and realize there isn't much that can be done? Rather than no body died, that is.

       I havent discounted the possibility that people were shot that night in vegas. I, and im sure you do as well, remember reports of gunfire at other casinos and the weird scene at that hooters with all the ambulances lined up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a bunch of videos / pictures i can share with you later if youre curious why i dont believe anyone was shot at the concert. Regardless, its nice to see someone in r/conspiracy these days thats willing to have an actual discussion and present useful information. Cheers

       I know about the gun fire at the other casinos because my friend was at one of them and text me about it when it happened before the news even started talking about it. I thought he was just fucking around at the time. Because we joke a lot so when he said someone was shooting up his casino it seemed like the normal Doom and Gloom we always text each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that one is definitely confirmed in my mind. Now what's this about some ambulance lined up? I didn't hear about that one. After it was clear that the whole thing was fucked I stopped watching it to wait for a clearer picture to come out. Which granted still hasn't happened now 5 months later. While we have a new conspiracy to look at because no one can say where the Valentine murderers body armor went, or even explain how the cops know it was cruz when all reports say the shooter had a mask on. I guess if they found the gun that would be enough. Did they say they found the gun...
      </p>
      <p>
       I digress, yeah I must admit that I was thinking the same thing. Who could have foreseen the day when actual running into another conspiracy theorist on r/conspiracy would be something to feel joy about. This sub has completely been over run with brainwashed useful idiots to the point that you have to sort comments by controversial to see anyone actually talking about conspiracy while all of the top comments are arguing for the fucking official narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the most frustrating thing imaginable, this used to be a great place. So what are these pictures you were talking about?

       Thats not how this works lol, youre asking the wrong person.

      <p>
       Imagine if i said "my friend was raped by bill clinton", and someone then replied to my comment saying "bullshit". You wouldnt ask the person saying "bullshit" for undeniable proof bill clinton didnt rape my friend, youd ask me for proof that bill clinton raped my friend.

       I'm all for listening to you, but you aren't for listening to others, and that is not the basis of a conducive conversation. I asked you a question and you take that as an opportunity to play idiocy and begin the insults. You could have used that question as an opening to expand on your reasoning and make an effort in trying to inform me of my ignorance. I'm trying, you are not.

       All i did was ask why you are implying the OP was lying. No need to get so butt hurt. And what does my last comment tell you? That I disagree with you? Because that's All you can really take from it, you know, since you dont know me. But go ahead and also imply you do know me, based on 3 comments ive made on a website. I'm waiting for it.

       "The Jew is immunized against all dangers: one may call him a scoundrel, parasite, swindler, profiteer, it all runs off him like water off a raincoat.
       <strong>
        But call him a Jew and you will be astonished at how he recoils, how injured he is, how he suddenly shrinks back: “I’ve been found out.”
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       One cannot defend himself against the Jew. He attacks with lightning speed from his position of safety and uses his abilities to crush any attempt at defense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quickly he turns the attacker’s charges back on him and the attacker becomes the liar, the troublemaker, the terrorist. Nothing could be more mistaken than to defend oneself. That is just what the Jew wants. He can invent a new lie every day for the enemy to respond to, and the result is that the enemy spends so much time defending himself that he has no time to do what the Jew really fears: to attack. The accused has become the accuser, and loudly he shoves the accuser into the dock. So it always was in the past when a person or a movement fought the Jew."

       Why, pray tell, are you quoting from a newspaper article by Goebbels and passing it off as incisive commentary?

      <p>
       I posted the quote without listing who it came from intentionally, because the quote is directly applicable to the dialogue. I said the user who said her friend was shot in the arm, was lying. Now you think this has somehow flipped on me where im now, according to the other commenter, bearing the burden of proof that the users friend didnt get shot in the arm.

       Argue politics all you want, but that's the core that's it. Just like who you vote for in local elections affects you more than people in state government and more than people in the federal government. Because your city has a closer connection to you than Arkansas does, and generally want the same things.

       Two of my close friends went to that music festival in Vegas. One is now dead and the other has now joined a march in Southern California in our local town for gun control. It’s hard for them to broadcast all of the marches and things going on like that.  A lot of them are joining the gun control movement they just don’t Point it out.

       Joined a march for gun control? Kind of silly. Brazil. Chicago. Gun control is not something anyone who uses logic, should want. Supporting common sense, such as mental health evaluations, and licensing for guns, and gun control, are different. Gun control is government regulated restriction of firearms, and will ultimately end up with the removal of firearms for citizens.

       My office mate's parents were there and are still deeply upset that there isn't more on what happened. His step dad was carrying people alive and dead and throwing them in beds of trucks to try and save them. They know as well as others that something isn't right. They also know survivors are dying too.

       Also for most people when you go to school it's is an every day monotony.  Vegas is a once in a Blue moon time.  A school shooting takes away everyday safety feeling.  Vegas takes away the special night out safety feeling.

       Yeah it's definitely a small percent of people that say those types of things. Just the same as when it happens to a more left leaning crowd that people on the right say similar things. But since this time it was children again, and basicaly nobody will say that children deserve it, it makes it a better one to get behind for anyone looking to push gun control.

       Two things.
      </p>
      <p>
       First paddock was an arms dealer in Vegas to sell to a group of ISIS fighter who were in town that weekend for an Islamic gathering. Yet ISIS being ISIS just killed him and opened fire. It was covered up because paddock was selling for the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad I could clear that up for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second thing is you are assuming that the families are whiny cunts. Yet this isn't missing people. This is death people. What is there to whine about? In there official narrative, the murderer is already dead. What more could a family want. This was country music fans, IE super pro gun. So they aren't going to go down that road.
      </p>
      <p>
       What else do you expect them to make a fuss about?
