<p>CNN has also been proven scripting town halls by the way. Debating that would be stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop being lazy and do some research.  It&#39;s been proven that the Haabs altered a key email from the CNN producer before submitting it to Fox.  The original sentence that she wrote was, &quot;This is what Colton and I discussed on the phone that he submitted.&quot;  The Haabs deleted the key phrase, &quot;that he submitted,&quot; from the sentence before sending it to Fox.  The obvious reason is that they want to make it seem like Colton was forced to read a script when in fact, CNN wanted him to read his own words.  Furthermore, Colton had agreed to the plan. Instead, the  Haabs changed their minds much later and wanted to read a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG speech.  Since the schedule was already formed, the producer obviously refused.   So yes, the Haabs were dishonest.  Worst, their dishonesty LIBELED CNN and fooled FOX with a false story.  So it wasn&#39;t just an innocent lie but one that affected TWO major media outlets -- and their millions of viewers.  And of course, Trump was stupid enough to Tweet their story so they also made a fool of Trump and his followers.</p>

<p>Now how was this proven?  Simple.  The Haabs submitted the emails to Fox in a Word file as evidence.  Fox then sent the Word file to CNN to verify the emails.  The CNN producer would&#39;ve had seen the deletion but would Fox or anyone believe her?  of course not.  But get this... Word documents have a metafile that keeps track of edits!  And this metafile is embedded in the original Word document that went to Fox BEFORE Fox sent it to CNN.  So there was no way CNN could have doctored it.  And this metafile showed that the Haabs deleted the phrase.  Was it an innocent accident?  LOL</p>

<p>And of course, the Haabs refused to answer any questions about this (as of 2 days ago).</p>

<p>Here is my Reddit post about the affair, with a link to an article with the actual Word documents.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7zk4tu/colton_hobb_just_had_his_prime_time_interview_and/dutmx1d/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7zk4tu/colton_hobb_just_had_his_prime_time_interview_and/dutmx1d/</a></p>

<p>Seriously, do your research.  It was a simple 3 sec Google.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;That in no way disproves the idea that CNN told him what to say. In fact it actually proves it.&quot;</p>

<p>Er, making a statement like that without any details is pointless.  What logical argument are you making that &quot;it actually proves&quot; that CNN scripted Haabs&#39; speech?  QUOTE the lines that &quot;proves it.&quot;  And please, look up the definition of &quot;prove&quot; and &quot;proof&quot; before you reply.  Then show us where the PROOF is with exact quotes.</p>

<p>And yes, it DOES disprove the Haabs&#39; claim because the original email stated that Colton had agreed to read the words &quot;that he submitted&quot; (see how I quoted for evidence?  Please have the courtesy to do the same).  In other words, Colton freely chose his own words and agreed to those words.  That directly disapproves their narrative that he was forced to read anything CNN wrote.</p>

<p>Let me out this in simple terms.  If Colton was given a script written by CNN, what was the script?  And more importantly, WHERE is this script?  Why didn&#39;t the Haabs included this supposedly CNN-written speech in their email to Fox?  Isn&#39;t it relevant evidence?  They only logical conclusion is that there was no such CNN-written script forced upon Colton.</p>

<p>So please answer that question.  Where is alleged script forced upon Colton and what was its contents?  That&#39;s as simple as it gets.</p>

<p>Combine that with the Haabs&#39; willful deception and your claim makes no sense (especially since you provided no logical argument or evidence).  I look forward you your reply (with evidence, quotes, etc).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ShitOfPeace, you&#39;re being disingenuous and even dishonest...</p>

<p>&quot;And arguing that CNN has never scripted a town hall is even more laughable.&quot;</p>

<p>Er, you&#39;re arguing against a point no one made.  Again, please QUOTE where anyone claimed that &quot;CNN has NEVER scripted a town hall&quot; (and once more, see how I had the courtesy you quote your exact words?).  We are talking specifically about Colton Haabs, not the history of CNN. </p>

<p>But since you&#39;ve brought it up, please provide evidence that CNN has ever forced a CNN-written speech on any town hall participant.  Give us the exact town hall event (topic, date), the name of the participant and the words allegedly forced upon the speaker.  I have access to most town hall transcripts.</p>

<p>Finally, it&#39;s sad how you&#39;re trying to redefine the topic.  &quot;Scripting a town hall&quot; is very different from forcing a participant to read words written by CNN (which is what the Haabs are claiming).  Look up the definition of &quot;script.&quot;  First off, of course there&#39;s a script.  The moderator is told what to say.  And everything is timed, and participants are given an order of when to speak, and commercials breaks are inserted, and different cameras are told when you turn on, etc, etc etc.  You seem to be under the impression that a television script only contains the lines of speakers. Wrong.  So yes, town halls -- as well as EVERY other television event -- are scripted.</p>

<p>So your statement is pointless since the town hall was of course scripted.  You can see this the credits.  The fact that there are writers and directors automatically implies that there is a script.  But the real issue here is whether the participants were forced to read CNN-written words.</p>

<p>Think about it.  And don&#39;t change the topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you think calling the Haabs liars wasn&#39;t justified?  Read these ... which lead to the EVIDENCE that the Haabs intentionally libeled CNN and fooled FOX.  Speaking of stupid tweeting, Trump tweeted the Haabs&#39; story.  Which now turns out to be &quot;FAKE NEWS.&quot;  When will that moron Trump learn to check his facts before tweeting???</p>

<p>If anything, CNN&#39;s response was mild and respectful.  If it was me, I&#39;d consider a libel suit against the Haabs (which of course CNN can&#39;t do since this is a time of mourning and Colton was supposedly a hero.  Given this proven deception, do we really know that he was heroic???).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got a couple of questions.</p>

<p>First, where are these emails? He mentions that it was an email from the producer that asked him to switch from a speech to a question. While he doesn&#39;t explicitly say it, I would assume that the <em>scripted</em> questions came via email too, or via some other document. Seems like it would be very easy for him to prove that they altered the questions, or at least support part of his story by releasing the emails that had him switch from a speech to a question. I was unable to find them.</p>

<p>Second, at around 50 seconds in the interview, Carlson says &quot;tell me if I am mischaracterizing any of this&quot; and the Hobb responds &quot;absolutely not&quot; <em>before they have even talked about anything.</em> It&#39;s seems reasonably probable that, like all news networks, they do some prep beforehand instead of just blindly allowing some young man onto the screen. Which is why Hobb knew he wasn&#39;t going to mischaracterize anything. I&#39;ve got no problem with this, it is just kind of funny/hypocritical to do this while bashing CNN for allegedly scripting </p>

<p>Third, Tucker is such a piece of shit. I can&#39;t find anywhere where CNN claims this kid is lying. They said they didn&#39;t script anything, he says they did. He just extrapolates that this is equivalent to CNN calling him a liar, which is entirely presumptuous and it is almost embarrassing that he would use this type of logic.</p>

<p>Why is it so obvious to everyone that CNN is painting a narrative, but when FoxNews and Tucker Carlson make it entirely obvious they are doing the same, people actually <em>use</em> foxnews as evidence of their narrative?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can see all the emails in the Business Insider article. In fact, I think they embedded the original Word file which has the metafile proving that the Haabs are dishonest.  They deleted a key phrase proving that CNN merely wanted Colton to read the question HE originally submitted.  There was no CNN script.  Instead, the Haabs changed their minds, demanding to read a very long speech which would have messed up CNN&#39;s schedule for other participants.  When CNN refused, they set out to pretend that Colton wouldn&#39;t read a pre-written CNN speech.  Please see my two long posts for more details, and a link to the Business Insider article with all the evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Er, no.  Actually, the opposite is true:  IT WAS THE HAABS THAT RE-WROTE THE EVIDENCE TO LIBEL CNN AND FOOL FOX.  Computer forensics proved that the Haabs not only mischaracterized the incident and libeled CNN, but committed fraud in doing so.  In preparation for the Carson interview,  the Haabs provided a Word document of emails TO FOX.  An examination of the Word metafile showed that the Haabs altered the most important email, deleting the crucial phrase, &quot;that he submitted.&quot;  In other words, the Haabs didn&#39;t want people to know that Colton wasn&#39;t forced to read a &quot;script&quot; written by CNN, but rather the original question as submitted by Colton himself.  CNN&#39;s only request -- and it&#39;s a reasonable one that any producer would make -- was that Colton stick to the agreement and not monopolize the time.  After reading the long speech his dad Glenn wanted Colton to make, any producer would agree.</p>

<p>Other than outright fraud, there is no benign explanation for why the Haabs would delete that phrase.  And again, the Word file came directly from the Haabs to Fox so the edits could not have come from anyone else -- unless you want to accuse Fox of defaming the Haabs to help CNN.  LOL.</p>

<p>CNN was completely innocent and did what any producer would do, including those at Fox.  The Haabs not only libeled CNN, but they also committed fraud to Fox -- and in the process, made a fool of Trump, who tweeted the Haab story.  As such, Conservatives should be just as pissed as CNN.</p>

<p>Question for Trump: SO WHO IS GUILTY OF SPREADING &quot;FAKE NEWS&quot;???  Moron.  More proof that Trump himself is the worst source of &quot;fake news,&quot; inaccuracies and outright lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;That in no way disproves the idea that CNN told him what to say. In fact it actually proves it.&quot;</p>

<p>Er, making a statement like that without any details is pointless.  What logical argument are you making that &quot;it actually proves&quot; that CNN scripted Haabs&#39; speech?  QUOTE the lines that &quot;proves it.&quot;  And please, look up the definition of &quot;prove&quot; and &quot;proof&quot; before you reply.  Then show us where the PROOF is with exact quotes.</p>

<p>And yes, it DOES disprove the Haabs&#39; claim because the original email stated that Colton had agreed to read the words &quot;that he submitted&quot; (see how I quoted for evidence?  Please have the courtesy to do the same).  In other words, Colton freely chose his own words and agreed to those words.  That directly disapproves their narrative that he was forced to read anything CNN wrote.</p>

<p>Let me out this in simple terms.  If Colton was given a script written by CNN, what was the script?  And more importantly, WHERE is this script?  Why didn&#39;t the Haabs included this supposedly CNN-written speech in their email to Fox?  Isn&#39;t it relevant evidence?  They only logical conclusion is that there was no such CNN-written script forced upon Colton.</p>

<p>So please answer that question.  Where is alleged script forced upon Colton and what was its contents?  That&#39;s as simple as it gets.</p>

<p>Combine that with the Haabs&#39; willful deception and your claim makes no sense (especially since you provided no logical argument or evidence).  I look forward you your reply (with evidence, quotes, etc).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ShitOfPeace, you&#39;re being disingenuous and even dishonest...</p>

<p>&quot;And arguing that CNN has never scripted a town hall is even more laughable.&quot;</p>

<p>Er, you&#39;re arguing against a point no one made.  Again, please QUOTE where anyone claimed that &quot;CNN has NEVER scripted a town hall&quot; (and once more, see how I had the courtesy you quote your exact words?).  We are talking specifically about Colton Haabs, not the history of CNN. </p>

<p>But since you&#39;ve brought it up, please provide evidence that CNN has ever forced a CNN-written speech on any town hall participant.  Give us the exact town hall event (topic, date), the name of the participant and the words allegedly forced upon the speaker.  I have access to most town hall transcripts.</p>

<p>Finally, it&#39;s sad how you&#39;re trying to redefine the topic.  &quot;Scripting a town hall&quot; is very different from forcing a participant to read words written by CNN (which is what the Haabs are claiming).  Look up the definition of &quot;script.&quot;  First off, of course there&#39;s a script.  The moderator is told what to say.  And everything is timed, and participants are given an order of when to speak, and commercials breaks are inserted, and different cameras are told when you turn on, etc, etc etc.  You seem to be under the impression that a television script only contains the lines of speakers. Wrong.  So yes, town halls -- as well as EVERY other television event -- are scripted.</p>

<p>So your statement is pointless since the town hall was of course scripted.  You can see this the credits.  The fact that there are writers and directors automatically implies that there is a script.  But the real issue here is whether the participants were forced to read CNN-written words.</p>

<p>Think about it.  And don&#39;t change the topic.</p>
