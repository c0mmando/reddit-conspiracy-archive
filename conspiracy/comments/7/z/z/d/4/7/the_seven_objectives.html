       Well I'm not letting them take my guns no matter what because besides a huge event that just wiped us out we will need them to actually fight. And this this right here, you and I are reassuring each other we aren't alone and if something occurs there will be others to help.

       You are right and I think we will I'm not sure what will be the event or catalyst that makes everyone forget the L v R BS and the other shit but in the long run I think we pull it out due to people in here and or people in the government that aren't as gone as we think they are. Maybe I'm being naieve, but I hope not. No matter what we are all in this together and I hope enough get that when we need them.

       Well communism isn’t the way to go no matter what the millennials that loved Bernie think. The folks that fall for communism are the ones that just don’t want to have to fend fo themselves. Try to remember this though we are mostly the same the Left vs Right thing is a construct to keep us from realizing we are more the same than different.

       Abolition of family due to the massive LGBT movement, the mainstream were even pushing ‘cuckolding’ a few weeks ago as a good thing! They want family values and traditions to die as a united community is not good for them. 
Religion is the same, a tool that brings people together, they do not want people to be together and united.

       Neither of those make sense.

      <p>
       LGBT is far from massive; to believe that requires being on the media-teat to an extent I can barely fathom or to grossly obsess over the existence of some 5% (at most) of the populace due to whatever reason. They can't do shit against the family, even if they wanted to; beyond their own decisions on making one or not.

       "I recently got an email from a Townhall reader responding to one of my articles on gay marriage.

       Historical context
      </p>
      <p>
       May 1, 1776 - Adam Weishaupt (codenamed Spartacus) establishes a secret society called the Order of the Illuminati. Weishaupt is the Professor of Canon Law at the University of Ingolstadt in Bavaria, part of Germany. [This date, May Day, is to become highly significant to the Soviet Communists. They held festive military parades on this day.] The Illuminati seek to establish a New World Order. Their objectives are as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Abolition of all ordered governments
       </li>
       <li>
        Abolition of private property
       </li>
       <li>
        Abolition of inheritance
       </li>
       <li>
        Abolition of patriotism
       </li>
       <li>
        Aboliton of the family
       </li>
       <li>
        Abolition of religion
       </li>
       <li>
        Creation of a world government
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       July 1782 - The Order of the Illuminati joins forces with Freemasonry at the Congress of Wilhemsbad. The Comte de Virieu, an attendee at the conference, comes away visible shaken. When questioned about the "tragic secrets" he brought back with him, he replies: "I will not confide them to you. I can only tell you that all this is very much more serious than you think." From this time on, according to his biographer, "the Comte de Virieu could only speak of Freemasonry with horror."
      </p>
      <p>
       1789 - Violence erupts in France. The French Revolution not only overthrows the existing government but also attempts to eliminate Christianity from the nation. A half-naked prostitute is placed on the altar of the Cathedral of Notre Dame and extolled as the Goddess of Reason." Revolutionary officials [103] even do away with the seven-day week and replace it with a ten-day week."
      </p>
      <p>
       "1796 - Freemasonry becomes a major issue in the Presidential election in the United States. John Adams wins the election by opposing Masonry, and his son John Quincy Adams warns of the dire threat to the nation posed by Masonic Lodges:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I do conscientiously and sincerely believe that the Order of Freemasonry, if not the greatest, is one of the greatest moral and political evils under which the uniion is now laboring."
      </p>
      <p>
       1798 - George Washington acknowledges that Illuminati activity has come to America:
      </p>
      <p>
       "It is not my intention to doubt that the doctrine of the Illuminati and the principle of Jacobinism had not spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is more satisfied of this fact than I am.""
      </p>
      <p>
       Since these times, there have been very few decisions made by the American government, on both home and foreign policies, that have not been dictated, or at least influenced, by the policies of the Illuminati, some more obvious than others.
      </p>
      <p>
       To start with, how is the best way to control the population of a country? By control of its money supply:
      </p>
      <p>
       "1816 - Congress grants a 20-year charter to the Bank of the United States, a private bank for this country. [The Constitution had granted to Congress the "power to coin money and regulate the value thereof." Thomas Jefferson had specifically warned the American people against turning this power to create money over to a private group that was unelected and not accountable to the public:
      </p>
      <p>
       If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deptrive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.]
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this situation did not last for long. In 1832 President Andrew Jackson vetoed a Congressional Bill to renew the charter of the Bank of the United States and he removed government funds from the Bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, the Illuminati regained control when, in December 1913, the Federal Reserve was created by act of government giving control of the money supply over to a private company. This meant that the government of America no longer controlled how much money was in circulation and had lost control of setting interest rates. As the American dollar became accepted as the international currency for oil sales, it also meant that the people who controlled the Federal Reserve also took control of the finances of most of the world's countries - effectively a world bank in all but name.
      </p>
      <p>
       1920-1931 Louis T, McFadden is Chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Currency. Concerning the Federal Reserve, Congressman McFadden notes:
      </p>
      <p>
       "When the Federal Reserve Act was passed, the people of these United States did not perceive that a world banking system was being set up here. A super-state controlled by international bankers and international industrialists acting together to enslave the world for their own pleasure. Every effort has been made by the Fed to conceal its powers but the truth is - the Fed has usurped the Government. It controls everything here and it controls all our foreign relations. It makes and breaks governments at will."

       If you actually bought that book to get the quote, you have my condolences; because the quote is a mess and doesn't really make sense for the supposed Illuminati (an organization founded in religious times by religious men, who'd be intimately aware of its relation to power).

       Even if we for whatever reason assume they were venomously anti-theistic, their atheism would've taken a starkly different shape than the one we have today (what with the lack of basic information taken for granted today) and would've required either cartoonish levels of denial or outright stupidity to underplay religion's importance for dominion.

       Weinhaupt was religious therefore he couldn't have possibly been involved with the Illuminati?

       What are you getting at here? I would love to see information on the origins of the Illuminati if the truth contradicts what history tells us about Weinhaupt.

       Weishaupt was either a religious man himself, and at the very least was an educated man with desires for influence in the year
       <strong>
        1776
       </strong>
       . He would have had to be intimately aware of the power-dynamics of faith to a degree most Westerners cannot imagine today, and since we're arguing
       <strong>
        a supposed sinister desire for societal control
       </strong>
       I can't imagine the rationale argued behind abolishing religion: a revolutionist desire.

       I hear you. Why get rid of the church if they could use it to control the masses. I found this:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Griffin outlines the documented formal birth of the Illuminati as follows. Finally on May 1, 1776, the Illuminati (from the same root word for Lucifer, “Bearer of Light” or Enlightened Ones) was founded as a single powerful secret organization to overthrow established civilization and religion, and to establish a Novus Ordo Seclorum (New World Order). Weishaupt developed the following seven-fold plan as the means to arrive at that goal: 1) Abolish all ordered governments; 2) Abolish private property; 3) Abolish inheritance; 4) Abolish patriotism; 5) Abolish religion; 6) Abolish the family unit; and 7) Creation of a New World Order/World Government [emphasis added] (Griffin 1993:52).

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And
      </p>
      <p>
       Griffin interjects the following in this historical narrative. Shortly thereafter, two other works were written: Proofs of a Conspiracy Against All the Religions and Governments of Europe, Carried on in the Secret Meetings of Free Masons, Illuminati, and Reading Societies by John Robison, Professor of Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh University in 1797; and Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism by The Abbe Barruel (in French and translated into English by Robert Clifford) in 1798, which further exposed the secret plans of the Illuminati (Griffin 1993:44-9).

       Your first two statements contradict each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is no government, all property and wealth will be private,  and the only way it will change hands is via sale or via inheritance after a death.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is no government you will have no nation, right? But you will be expected to be obedient to the private owners of everything.

      <p>
       And item 1 and 7 are a contradiction,  is it going to be no government, or a world government?
