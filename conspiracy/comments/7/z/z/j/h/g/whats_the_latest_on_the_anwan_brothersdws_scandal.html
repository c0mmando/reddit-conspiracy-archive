<p>re: DWS&#39;s BROTHER!! heading Imran Awan investigation....Posted on 7/30/17 at 6:04 pm to notsince98
quote:
Three Pakistani brothers who managed the IT affairs for several Democratic government officials were relieved of their duties in February on suspicion that they accessed specific computer networks without permission, also known as hacking. </p>

<p>Imran Awan, who started working for Wasserman Schultz in 2005, received $164,600 in 2016, with close to $20,000 of that coming from Wasserman Schultz. </p>

<p>His brother Jamal, who started working as a staffer in 2014, was paid $157,350.12 in 2016. Abid, who started working in 2005, was paid $160,943 in 2016. </p>

<p>Hina Alvi, who was employed as a staffer from February 2007, was paid 168,300 in 2016. Rao Abbas was paid $85,049 in 2016. </p>

<p>Abid, Imran, and Jamal Awan were barred from computer networks at the House of Representatives in February. </p>

<p>Most of the House Members fired the Awans subsequently. 
Only Debbie Wasserman Schultz kept Imran Awan on the pay roll up to the day he got arrest for Bank Fraud after trying to flee the country. </p>

<p>The rest of the family fled since months to Pakistan along with hundreds of thousands of tax-payer money they mysteriously were able to wire. </p>

<p>Democrats were willing or unwillingly compromised by the Awans and Sensitive Information leaked to foreign Enemies! (Muslim Brotherhood – Yemen Raid with dead soldier for example?) Many of them have Seats on Committees that handle highly sensitive information. </p>

<p>According to Redditt — Imran Awan is now released with an GPS ankle monitor until his preliminary hearing on Aug. 21. 
I suggest we keep the pressure up and push this story until Trey Gowdy subpoenas each and everyone of these Democrats. 
Maybe contact/send the pic or links to local media if your District or State is in this list. SHADILAY! If kek wills it we will succeed and DRAIN THE SWAMP shite SEWER </p>

<p>Here is the complete list of 30 Democrats who hired the Awan brothers for IT services: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not unlike the Russiagate Hoax. Anyone who looks at the news beyond the echo chamber know that Russia, China and others are doing an end run around the US dollar [and the central banks]. This has the Banksters and western oligarchs shitting their drawers. China isn&#39;t Libya where it was easy to squash Qaddafi and his plans for a gold backed, African currency. China has the USA over a barrel. So America has to go at Russia to save their dying hegemony. Who cares if billions of lives are in the balance.</p>

<p>The whole thing is theater. Any thinking person knows it.</p>

<p>Plus, Bernie would have won.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy seems to be that foreign intelligence was able to get their people citizenship by rigging the lottery for their agents. Then they were able to get them ridiculously high paying jobs working closely with congress and have access to congress peoples black berries which are often have security flaws. 
Black berries and lap tops  were Found in a house that awan sold to a marine. So at the very least we have infiltration of congress and the most we have members of our government helping these foreign agents. </p>
