Until then and based on previous experiences, prepare for a full on undressing and dissecting of information. Screw politics and agendas. So far, all I have to go on for a source is the MSM and government. Both proven infestations of corruption and treachery. What choice do I have but to resort to the fringe? Actually, the MSM and government and those who believe them should blame themselves for sprouting OUR kind. And that&#39;s the bottom line &#39;cause stone cold hard facts said so!</p>

<p>Actually you may have a point there. As an example we can look at the late 19th century, aka &quot;Old West&quot;. Everyone who wanted a gun had one. Contrary to what Hollywood and TV would have you believe, there were very few murders. Never more than 5 in any given town/city in any given year of the old west. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The complete gun control idea makes absolutely no sense. When you destroy any legal route you only create a black market. If a mentally disturbed person wants to enact violence they will find a way. Whether you rather it be knife, truck, or gun, etc. Take your pick.</p>

<p>How many kids have we killed throughout the decade, and now we&#39;re butthurt over 17 of them? I guess the fact that they were white americans makes all the difference?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world is and will always be dangerous. But you get to help choose how we react to those hazards and ultimately what type of society we live in. You might prefer a more paternalistic approach that restricts personal freedoms when they are deemed too dangerous for your liking. I might prefer a more libertarian world with more personal freedoms that come with that risk. It&#39;s not really a question of whether or not it&#39;s ok, it&#39;s how much risk do you accept proportional to your personal freedoms. It&#39;s certainly an invitation for some debate.

<p>Your statistics forget to take into account all the <em>other</em> shootings, big and small. So when you narrow it to &#39;schools&#39; it seems like a low number, but if you look at all gun violence you&#39;ll see 100.000 dead or injured in 2013 alone:</p>

<p>100.000 people. Chew on that number a little bit please. That&#39;s roughly a 1 in 2500 chance of being shot any given year. If your lifespan is 75 years average then that&#39;s a 1 in 33 chance of being shot in your lifetime!</p>

You are so much in fucking denial that whenever there is a school shooting you instantly refuse to believe it and claim &#39;it must be a conspiracy!&#39;. It is goddam tragic.

Other countries work just fine without teenagers having access to fucking goddam ARs. What the fuck are you thinking? You think your little local militia or your guns are going to protect you if Uncle Sam decides to go full retard? You must be fucking joking or dreaming, what&#39;s going to happen is you are going to piss in your pants when the SWATs come crashing in and shoot you in the fucking head because they know you are armed, and if you are lucky you <em>might</em> have time to squeeze off a few rounds which will miss or hit body armour. You fucking idiots. If you want to overthrow Uncle Sam then just fucking get on with it, you don&#39;t even need guns for that, history shows that, plenty of dictator governments have fallen without a single shot being fired.
