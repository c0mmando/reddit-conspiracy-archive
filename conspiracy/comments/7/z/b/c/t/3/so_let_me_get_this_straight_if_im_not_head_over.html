       Is this where we are with this? Guilt trips? Emotional blackmail? All logic and reason out the window? Last I checked, cold hard facts and evidences trump a play on human emotion and feelings. IF things are factually confirmed as true, then I get it. Only then do sensitivities become relevant. Until then and based on previous experiences, prepare for a full on undressing and dissecting of information. Screw politics and agendas. So far, all I have to go on for a source is the MSM and government. Both proven infestations of corruption and treachery. What choice do I have but to resort to the fringe? Actually, the MSM and government and those who believe them should blame themselves for sprouting OUR kind. And that's the bottom line 'cause stone cold hard facts said so!

       The only gun control we need is the ability to hit your target. Not only should we NOT take away gun rights, we should mandate gun ownership for every citizen. In fact, we should mandate everyone own bazookas and tanks too.

       Actually you may have a point there. As an example we can look at the late 19th century, aka "Old West". Everyone who wanted a gun had one. Contrary to what Hollywood and TV would have you believe, there were very few murders. Never more than 5 in any given town/city in any given year of the old west.

       The complete gun control idea makes absolutely no sense. When you destroy any legal route you only create a black market. If a mentally disturbed person wants to enact violence they will find a way. Whether you rather it be knife, truck, or gun, etc. Take your pick.

       The reason shoot em ups are effective for facilitating gun control is because it's immediate and impactfull. We were happy drone striking children, and exploiting them for their labor for the last 10-20 years, so what's our problem?
      </p>
      <p>
       How many kids have we killed throughout the decade, and now we're butthurt over 17 of them? I guess the fact that they were white americans makes all the difference?

       I feel bad for the victims but not for being skeptical when the media uses it to shove an agenda down our throat. The same media that lies to our faces over and over. We think our leaders care about dead children, lol, maybe just American ones, sometimes, when it politically benefits them.

       Personally I think gun control will do nothing. Look at Chicago, criminals still get guns. I believe this issue lies with parenting, mental health, and prescription drugs, to name a few.

       I did the math, there have been well under 300 school shooting victims in the United States, total.

       in All of history. Each day 72 million students enter into a school. Statistics seem to suggest schools are pretty safe.

       Oh so that makes it ok then. Just 300 dead kids and teachers. No problem, nothing to see here, move along citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can add to that 300 the many 1000s killed and injured by mistake or roberies and fights that would otherwise have ended less violent etc etc.

       The world is and will always be dangerous. But you get to help choose how we react to those hazards and ultimately what type of society we live in. You might prefer a more paternalistic approach that restricts personal freedoms when they are deemed too dangerous for your liking. I might prefer a more libertarian world with more personal freedoms that come with that risk. It's not really a question of whether or not it's ok, it's how much risk do you accept proportional to your personal freedoms. It's certainly an invitation for some debate. Or better yet, some dialog.

       Nobody said it was okay. At least not I. I just put out the fact that children, on a whole, are
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       safe in schools.
      </p>
      <p>
       Emotions are powerful things. Sometimes emotions make us fear flying, a mode of transportation safer than cars in every way. Sometimes they make us feel kids in schools are under imminent threat of shooters but, reality doesn’t match up.

       You shouldn't fear going to school. However, you should be very very afraid of guns and a population of mentally unstable people with acess to ARs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your statistics forget to take into account all the
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       shootings, big and small. So when you narrow it to 'schools' it seems like a low number, but if you look at all gun violence you'll see 100.000 dead or injured in 2013 alone:

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       100.000 people. Chew on that number a little bit please. That's roughly a 1 in 2500 chance of being shot any given year. If your lifespan is 75 years average then that's a 1 in 33 chance of being shot in your lifetime!
      </p>
      <p>
       1 in 33
      </p>
      <p>
       3%
      </p>
      <p>
       That's fucking huge.

       If by blame, you mean have to read a large amount of targeted bullshit that is spread through the media which demands that action be taken, but always vague enough to never become substantial?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not to blame, but they use people like you as a whipping boy for their frustration in how they are told the world should be, if they could eliminate the problem areas of the society.

       You fucking Americans and your idiotic gun laws. FFS.
You are so much in fucking denial that whenever there is a school shooting you instantly refuse to believe it and claim 'it must be a conspiracy!'. It is goddam tragic. Wake the fuck up and smell the dead kids you fucking assholes. It is because of people like YOU and your archaic gun-worship that kids are fucking dying. Other countries work just fine without teenagers having access to fucking goddam ARs. What the fuck are you thinking? You think your little local militia or your guns are going to protect you if Uncle Sam decides to go full retard? You must be fucking joking or dreaming, what's going to happen is you are going to piss in your pants when the SWATs come crashing in and shoot you in the fucking head because they know you are armed, and if you are lucky you
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       have time to squeeze off a few rounds which will miss or hit body armour. You fucking idiots. If you want to overthrow Uncle Sam then just fucking get on with it, you don't even need guns for that, history shows that, plenty of dictator governments have fallen without a single shot being fired. 
Now get off my lawn you little shits and grow the fuck up.
