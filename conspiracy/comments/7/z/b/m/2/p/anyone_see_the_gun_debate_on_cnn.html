       The students are clearly reading some prewritten statements, including the phony 18 shootings myth.

       They are also not even talking, just spouting their one liners and zingers demanding that all guns be banned.

       They are also very well versed and obviously trained to act.

       Give me one single instance of policy maker wanting to ban guns over this. There are none. Zero. Some may want to ban some guns, but in your SS you said they want to ban them all. That is a lie.

       No, the real lie is the idea that any form of “common sense gun laws”  that aren’t already on the books will fix the mass shooting problem. Take away AR-15s? Mentally unstable people will use handguns. Ban handguns? Shotguns. Ban shotguns? Knives cars and homemade pipe bomb.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is, obviously no politician is going to stand up there and try to ban guns. That’s why they attempt to do it incrementally, year after year, usually after a tragic event that they can emotionally manipulate the public into supporting it. That’s why the NRA fights virtually any further regulation of guns, because if you give an inch, the anti-gun camp will take a mile.

       First off, they didn't "demand" to ban all guns.

       Second off, one incident is a bit dishonest, no? Estimates are that there have been 200 school shootings since 2000 (

       Kinda funny people demand gun control/confiscation without acknowledging that that very act will require guns. So they're never truly anti-gun, they're pro guns in the hands of a small group of people. Sounds like freedom to me.

       The fact that you feel confiscating guns requires guns says a lot, I think. Maybe gun owners of this mindset should take a step back and realize that the only group of people that are as possessive as they are are parents about their kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody says shit like “They can take my car when they pry my dead body out of it!” Or “It’ll be messy if they come and try to take my fireworks from me!” But guns, oh boy, that’s where people tend to get all kinds of worked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also please spare me anything about the constitution and the bill of rights and all that, we’ve amended it plenty to correct mistakes already so the idea that guns are somehow sacrosanct is disingenuous at best.

       I think it just shows an understanding of the reality of trying to disarm a populace.

       Who would come to take the guns in this scenario?

       Very likely the police or army.

       That's because the people demanding gun confiscation are retarded when it comes to history. Hitler confiscated guns. Stalin as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Confiscating guns will not solve the problem. Did prohibition eliminate alcohol? Fuck no. It creates a huge black market (see the drug war) with even less accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these melodramatic kids pushing gun confiscations because of a single act of evil, which should have been prevented when it became known that Cruz was cutting himself, are hysterical morons. It's quite frustrating to see; I hope that most can see right through this charade.

       Hypothetically speaking, do you think our Founding Fathers would be on the side of him, or the government agents attempting to trespass on private property in order to confiscate private property protected in violation of the 2nd, 4th and 5th amendment?

       Certainly if you concoct a scenario in which guns are being confiscated but are somehow still legal to own, then the 4th amendment is being violated I guess, the 5th definitely not though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I don’t think the founding fathers knew about modern day guns, and I think they very deliberately designed a process and document that could be modified and updated as needed. This idea that it’s an unmodifiable document is maddening.

       Passing a law doesn’t just make things wrong overnight because a group of people deem it so, especially when that thing has been deemed a right (not a privilege that can be taken away).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the words of Thomas Jefferson, "If a law is unjust, a man is not only right to disobey it, he is obligated to do so."
      </p>
      <p>
       And modern guns have nothing to do with it. It’s about matching the firepower of your government, so that they continue to fear the people. I’m sure the founding fathers would be horrified to know that they now have predator drones and nukes in their power, and could easily decimate any enemy. However, they certainly wouldn’t recommend lowering the firepower of the people. 100,000,000 citizens with AR-15’s are a lot more difficult to deal with than 100,000,000 civilians with handguns and shotguns.

       If it’s about matching firepower, where were people fighting for our right to own flamethrowers and grenades and RPGs and Apaches and unmanned fighter drones and every other piece of military-grade tech you can’t own? The arms race between the people and government is over, the people lost that a long time ago.

       Thomas Jefferson also thought slavery was baller so I’m not really interested in citing him as some paragon of righteousness.

       As long as no crimes are committed with any of those weapons when in the hands of citizens, then what’s the harm? Why are we ok with our government having that kind of firepower, and use it to kill countless human beings half a world away, but a private citizen with an RPG that has never killed anyone is downright terrifying?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, claiming that the “arms race between people and government was lost a long time ago” is reason for continuing to disarm the people is literally exactly what the founding fathers aimed to prevent.

       If you were gonna be on prime time TV, in front of the whole world, you would just wing it? You would just say whatever bullshit first comes to mind?

       Or do you think maybe that they've had fucking news cameras in their faces for the last two days and idiots on cable fucking news on both sides of our political spectrum asking them stupid questions immediately after someone murdered a bunch of their friends and so they got some help putting into words what they were feeling.

       These kids can’t even vote yet they’re heavily pushing an agenda. The one kid asked Rubio to not accept money from the NRA. He was passionate, and that’s good to see. That poor kid doesn’t understand the corrupt system yet :(
