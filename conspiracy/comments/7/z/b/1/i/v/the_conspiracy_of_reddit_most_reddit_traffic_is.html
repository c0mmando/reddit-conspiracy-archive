        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">116</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-02-22 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/magnora7.html">magnora7</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Reddit seems odd lately. The comment sections seem full of strange disjointed comments and the votes don&#39;t make sense either. This has been getting increasingly worse, and it seems the real people who are logical and conversational have left the site which only increases the density of bad actors as well as bots and shills. </p>

<p>The real proof is the numbers, if you look at searches for &#39;reddit&#39; on google trends it&#39;s a bizarrely straight line that is ever-increasing. Here is a graph of it compared to some other similarly-searched websites, including buzzfeed, bing, and 4chan: <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;q=reddit,buzzfeed,4chan,bing">https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;q=reddit,buzzfeed,4chan,bing</a></p>

<p>Objectively, I find it hard to believe that reddit has had such endless growth since 2008. I also find it very hard to believe how perfectly straight that line is, it seems more like an algorithm to me. </p>

<p>Plus consider how reddit gains its value. It&#39;s run as a company by a huge parent company. It was bought by Conde Nast, who then ended up giving it to their parent company Advance Publishing, who then in turn spun it off to its own company. Consider the line started going up in a straight line around 2008, which was soon after Conde Nast bought it in Nov 2006. </p>

<p>Consider that reddit&#39;s revenue depends on three things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Reddit gold sales</p></li>
<li><p>Advertiser space sales (most important)</p></li>
<li><p>Hush money (who knows how big this is and how many organizations might be contributing money toward this end)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Then we can also consider the shills and bots running amok on reddit, while the admins did nothing for years, even when these groups are proven to be real and working together to falsify votes and comments to push agendas. Like the Jetpack fiasco a long time ago, or Shareblue and Cambridge Analytica in the modern day to just name a few. </p>

<p>Reddit admins (not sub moderators, but the site admins) allow the shilling and fake voting for 2 reasons. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>They might get paid to look the other way, because those shilling orgs can have a fair amount of money due to the effectiveness of &quot;native advertising&quot; on social media sites like reddit. They can create the appearance of organic community content in a way that TV or a billboard cannot. It&#39;s a great way to sell things to people, including ideologies.</p></li>
<li><p>They need the site traffic. Their advertising revenue depends on how much traffic reddit gets. More eyeballs = more income. Both for the advertiser and for reddit. So they are fine with other groups creating the appearance of traffic, because it also convinces the advertisers when they see their banners are getting more views. And so reddit gets more ad revenue, because there&#39;s more views. So when these bot and shilling networks come alive and take over vast portions of reddit, they will turn the other way as long as it&#39;s a net gain in views, because that means a net gain in ad revenue. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I think this is the reason the line is so straight going up It seems there are also bots doing google searches for reddit, and the number of fake searches is increasing with an algorithm as time passes, to show steady growth of the site. They&#39;re giving all the indicators that the site is popular and growing. They just overlooked the fact it shouldn&#39;t grow perfectly linearly because that doesn&#39;t look organic at all. </p>

<p>Meanwhile we the people actually using the site are bombarded with propaganda and enraging nonsense, and entire prominent subs have to be completely ignored because they&#39;re so filled with one-sided garbage. This is on the 13th most-visited website in the US. Well, that&#39;s if we could trust the numbers. Who knows how many humans actually visit this site compared to what they say. </p>

<p>This is a true conspiracy, and it&#39;s the everyday life of this website. Meanwhile the true quality and value in the human relationships and exchanges on this site continue to be hollowed out as sane people are driven out by the sheer noise of non-organic activity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly feel that normal people looking for a conversation make up less than 50% of comments these days. And the votes then drown those people out and upvote the shills.

    <div class="md"><p>That is a very interesting thought. That would technically keep it on the up and up legally speaking. </p>

<p>As for the main point of the post, I agree with everything you have said. I have to wonder if these advertiser are actually getting good results from their marketing here. I know they track the best they can where their new business is coming from, so if most of Reddit is gamed or shilled would they really be seeing the return on investment here? I would be interested to know their results from using Reddit as their platform for ads. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This shows the higher effectiveness of native advertising, which they have defined a little differently than I do, but it&#39;s still interesting and is in the same vein: <a href="https://vitamintalent.com/blog/how-effective-is-native-advertising-infographic">https://vitamintalent.com/blog/how-effective-is-native-advertising-infographic</a></p>

<p>I think <em>totally</em> native advertising (as in pretending to be users and voting and posting things to appear to make them popular) is even more effective than what the article calls native advertising. </p>

<p>People believe it because it seems like a real community consenus. Although we&#39;re quickly waking up to how faked these things are. 10 years ago that type of thing was a surprise and now it&#39;s solidified itself as a PR tactic, which has in turn made more people realize that it&#39;s being used as a PR tactic. Seems as though they took advantage of the trust and information quality and value of the early internet, and are using those assumptions people have to take advantage of them. I imagine TV was the same way as it developed, as I imagine was radio. New techs give new truths, which build trust, trust which is then later abused for profit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i’ve been thinking about this too. can someone explain to me what a shill is? i’ve been called one on this sub and on the politics sub, i always assumed it meant they thought i was getting paid to push an agenda. but the people accusing me were the ones pushing agendas while i was, for lack of a better term, counter-arguing the op. i also notice a complete lack of comprehension when people respond to me. it’s like they ignore all the big points of my argument and twist my words when on a few occasions i was actually agreeing with them. i’m still pretty active, but i’ve been a lot more hesitant to input on threads bc of this overwhelming backlash and defensive responses. even though i do feel that there is some bot bending of numbers and puppet accounts, i also think it might be that the influx of new users are people who have just started using reddit after only using facebook. now we all know that facebook is a breeding ground for ignorance. it’s a echo chamber of mindless sharing and reposts and generally empty conversation. so i wonder if the massive influx of shitposts and reposts are just facebook idiots who havnt adjusted to the more “forum-esque” format of reddit. i dunno, it’ll be interesting to see what has happened to reddit in a few monthes. bc it seems this issue is boiling up to the point of people actually making posts about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I think your experience is unfortunately typical these days for a normal user. Shills are usually among the first to accuse others of being shills. Pre-accusing others of what you&#39;re guilty of, unfortunately is a tactic that works in muddying the waters, and they know it. </p>

<p>Shills will often say things like &quot;So <em>everyone</em> who disagrees with you is a shill?&quot; or other things that just completely make a mess of the conversation trying to be had. It&#39;s infuriating, but that&#39;s exactly the purpose. They want people on tilt, because then they control the conversation. If you can make someone super emotional, then they will lose the debate in terms of upvotes. It&#39;s an awful tactic, but it&#39;s all over reddit. They put people on tilt and then accuse them of being emotional. It&#39;s beyond infuriating and it&#39;s no surprise it&#39;s driven people away. </p>

<p>But think about it, if you had some super-powerful organization and there was a website where people were revealing bad shit your organization did, why <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> you hire a team of people to fill that forum with garbage? (other than morality and empathy, but they don&#39;t have that.) It&#39;s a relatively cheap thing to do if you&#39;re a huge organization. And I have no doubt there are several organizations doing this, and targeting threads that say things they don&#39;t like, and destroying them with nonsense. </p>

<p>In one video he claims missiles cannot fly level as they lack wings, is proven wrong in the comments (vectored thrust, control surfaces, basic physics) and makes a video where he pretends to start to say he is wrong but then states the world is not ready fir his material and he should stay behind a paywall.</p>

<p>He does not believe in all history, that anyone died in any war or conflict or mass casualty incident. He does not believe the earth is round, space, the moon, the sun, gravity atoms, dinosaurs, nukes, evolution, gravity, etc are all hoaxes.</p>

<p>He is an example of the running Kruger effect or a con man... who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your definition of a shill is pretty spot on.  They are just propaganda tactics.</p>

<p>I think it’s a pretty useless tactic to try and “argue” on social media in the sense of trying to convince other people that your opinion is right.  Half of what you believe is probably some BS created by a propaganda team before you realized people were doing that, and half of what the other side believes is also BS.  If you combine it with all close-minded people, trolls, and shills it’s not worth the time to get emotional about it, because you’re likely talking to a wall.</p>

<p>But I do think it’s important to participate, because it helps you get a better understanding of what you believe, and it puts ideas out there that open-minded people will stumble across and over time it helps us get to the truth.  I just don’t get too wrapped up in being right or having my posts upvoted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made a thread a few months back pondering this same thing but for Xbox live/PSN and Steam.</p>

<p>To be honest, i think more than 75% of all internet media content (twitter, blogs, facebook etc.) are all faked. I also believe that, just as you say, large forums are 90% shills. Have a look at any gaming forum nowadays, especially since the EA/Activision astroturf scandal, none of those users or posters are gamers. Neogaf, IGN, N4G are all shills battling it out. Hell, NeoFag that was banned from Reddit, has now turned into an anti-neogaf/ign forum, where &#39;people&#39; now spend hours and hours circle-jerking about how wrong everybody else is.</p>

<p>There is no natural discussion. The only users that aren&#39;t bots are those who say (for example) &quot;Hey, isn&#39;t this continuous debate we&#39;ve had for the past three months now getting a little stale? let&#39;s talk about something else&quot;</p>

<p>People predicted the internet would be censored or controlled. Both has happened. You cannot speak freely on the internet (think about that for a second). You are either banned, shadowbanned or dogpiled.</p>

<p>FREE OPEN DISCUSSION DOES NOT EXIST ON THE INTERNET.</p>
