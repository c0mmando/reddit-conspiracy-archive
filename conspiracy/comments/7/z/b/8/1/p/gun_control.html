        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here we go again..</p>

<p>I find it absolutely frustrating to see how many Americans don&#39;t understand the need for the 2nd amendment and our right to bear arms.. </p>

<p>This is explicitly written to maintain our right to protect ourselves against ALL enemies whether foreign or DOMESTIC..</p>

<p>One of the main reasons is to protect against an overreaching govt if they choose to infringe upon these rights (because that never happens, right?)</p>

<p>If the govt is the only one that has access to firearms (specifically high capacity rifles) then there&#39;s zero chance for The People to push back and fight to maintain the security of these basic human rights.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m getting are arguments based on logical fallacies and someone even said:</p>

<p>&quot;Some people are afraid that others have the ability to just get a rifle and go murder a bunch of Innocents&quot; </p>

<p>So by that logic, if I&#39;m afraid of something I should be able to take away not only my right but yours... </p>

<p>Has anyone ever heard the term &quot;slippery slope&quot;?</p>

<p>I&#39;m really concerned that fear/emotional response is what rules the masses and instead of critically making points all the arguments are based on &quot;I don&#39;t like it so you shouldn&#39;t have it&quot;</p>

<p>I get it, terrible people do terrible things.. but it in no way warrants the removal of our basic human rights which many fought and died for to secure</p>

<p>I really hope that this is common sense at least for some in this sub, I don&#39;t really expect it anywhere else because I&#39;m sure people are being regularly programmed to feel this way but I fear that more and more forget the real reason we have this, arguably the most important amendment to the Constitution</p>

<p>Note* In no way am I seeking an echo chamber, but if you disagree please offer some legitimate reasoning based on logic and not emotion or statistics of &quot;how many shootings there have been&quot; or &quot;how many people have died in the past so and so time frame&quot; as this is clearly based in emotion and looking to initiate an emotional response from people</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have experienced the same issue. People saying I hate kids cause I don&#39;t want AR&#39;s banned. The same people who think AR stands for &quot;assault rifle&quot;. They seem to be ignorant to the fact that I can shoot a glock with nearly the same efficiency as an AR. They have no idea the 2nd Amendment is in place to prevent a tyrannical govt from overreaching their authority. They are ignorant of history and are brainwashed. If it starts with AR-15&#39;s, where does it stop? Ignorance shouldnt be a reason to take my rights away, and unfortunately that&#39;s the world we are living in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll offer my opinion but I&#39;m not gonna get a lot of love. That&#39;s fine. I think the argument that we need guns to prevent tyranny is absurd at this point. First of all, republicans get a lot of help from the NRA and they have complete control of the government right now. Second of all, if the government ever wants to come for you, they will. Nothing you or your buddies can do to stop them. Even if you each have 20 awesome guns. So to me, we are talking about public safety. I want you to be able to defend yourself. I think everybody does. But on the other side of this, we have crazy people using the same tools to destroy 20 lives. That fucking blows. Can&#39;t we do do something to make sure you can have your shit but prevent crazy people from using that same shit to murder so many people? There has to be some middle ground. We have to find an answer to this man. Or we will just keep watching children die while we argue over shit. I don&#39;t think anybody wants that. Let&#39;s try to change. At least try. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For now, there. It stops right there. Dude I don&#39;t understand why people are so worried all their guns are gonna get taken away. At any given point, half the government is always Republican. Right now the whole government is. If you&#39;re terrified of democrats taking guns then you shouldn&#39;t be. They will never have enough people to just take all your guns away even if they wanted to. And they don&#39;t anyway. </p>

<p>You said if the govt wants to come get us they will, true, but I&#39;d rather have a chance at fighting back than none at all</p>

<p>Thank you for responding even if it&#39;s not a popular opinion, this is a public forum and I&#39;m not going to bash you for discussing your perspective as I want to understand your point of view and meet at common ground because at the end of the day we all desire to seek happiness and a good life for ourselves and our fellow man and anyone that wishes anything else for any other will be easy to spot and is part of our common enemy</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start working together as a people to come up with a solution and not allow ourselves to be divided</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed man. The sorry part of it is every time you ban something, you fuck up the liberty of everyone else. Somebody put explosive liquid in their shampoo. So now I can&#39;t bring that on an airplane. I don&#39;t really care though. Because it&#39;s about public safety. If the fact that none of us can bring a shampoo bomb on the plane means it&#39;s a lot harder for an asshole to do it, I&#39;m down. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a gun shooter dude. I&#39;m also not crazy skeptical that the government will turn on me. We are the beacon of light in the world. If our government started killing our citizens in some war then the rest of the world wouldn&#39;t just sit there and watch. </p>

<p>Right now we have this problem where everybody is on drugs and crazy people can just roll up to the store and buy a gun and turn on other people. What the hell dude that shouldn&#39;t be allowed. We should do something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I don&#39;t think there is a conspiracy to take away guns.  I&#39;m not an expert by any means at constitutional law but I think it would take a SC in your pocket and/or a constitutional amendment to actually pass legislation that directly violates the 2nd amendment.</p>

<p>For partisan politics, I think &quot;gun control&quot; is low-hanging, low-risk fruit for both parties.  It&#39;s disgusting how both are using a school shooting to entrench bases and draw lines.</p>

<p>For actual public policy, I think &quot;gun control&quot; is a scapegoat and lazy way to approach this problem.  It actually takes some hard fucking work to try and figure out what made this kid homicidal.  The existence of guns didn&#39;t make this kid have such a low disregard for life.</p>

<p>By no means am I saying ban video games or anything for that matter.  But nobody wants to talk about how hollywood, video games, media, religion, education, how he was treated by others, parenting, values of society, injustice, health all factor into why this kid did what he did.</p>

I live in a country with gun control , but no gun culture existing before those measures were put in place. I&#39;m very anti-gun however I do respect the reason the 2nd amendment exists. However, when the US military has nuclear weapons what good are gun to its citizens? </p>
