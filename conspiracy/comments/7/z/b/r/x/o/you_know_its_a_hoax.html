<p>Hoax.</p>

<p>Pull your heart strings. Isolate you. Villainize you. Discredit you. </p>

<p>“Those selfish and unthoughtful conspiracy theorists” “how dare they” </p>

<p>Turn us against one another. It’s so simple. It’s the cheapest trick in the book. Use the kids. They’ll never stand up to us when it’s the kids. </p>

<p>All these people defending the gun grab or any form of gun legislation, idiots; mouth breathers, sell outs, dumb ass pansies. </p>

<p>It’s so obviously scripted you’d have to go full retard to miss it. </p>

<p>Here’s the “cruel and unusual thing” that most of you probably wouldn’t bring yourself to say:</p>

<p>If it takes a hundred, or a thousand, of hell even a million gun deaths in this country every year; if that’s the sacrifice that must be made: if they were all children, I still wouldn’t give up the gun. </p>

<p>The price of mankind’s freedom is worth it. If America falls to disarmament, it’s over. </p>

<p>Funny how America has the highest gun ownership and also the highest body count from shootings. I don’t think all guns should be revoked though, despite the views you’ve already decided I have. I just think anyone who says they will sacrifice 1m people, and then goes on to clarify that they can all be children, should probably not be allowed to own a gun though, because holy shit dude get a grip</p>

<p>What’s tyrannical is an organization that pays inordinate amounts of money to insure they get to keep their guns, despite the loss of life that it means for everyone else. What’s tyrannical is that citizens can’t actually fight for their own well-being because we don’t have the money to be heard. Our government is ALREADY tyrannical, it’s just convenient for most people so they don’t care. Stepping away from tyranny would be saying “we don’t care how much money you’re offering, preventing the loss of American life is more important.”</p>

<p>I would argue guns actually enable tyranny. The problem is gun owners who think that gun control means they won’t be able to fight back against a tyrannical government that outspends them to the tune of TRILLIONS of dollars per year. You can easily find a happy medium, as pretty much every other country has, if you stop pretending whatever gun you own is going to somehow do anything to an unmanned that you won’t even see before you’re dead. </p>

<p>If people really cared about guns as a means of ensuring the government behaves, I would encourage them to focus on curbing military spending, opposing the way police are being militarized, and most importantly pushing for more stringent guidelines on who can buy and own weapons. I know the last part seems counter-intuitive, but really the people who are buying guns for the express purpose of violence towards other people are the problem, not the guns themselves, right? So take the guns from them, not from responsible folks that have proven they are capable of responsible gun ownership. </p>

Like I appreciate you serving and all, no disrespect, but no one person has the level of exposure needed to reliably assess that statistic. </p>

<p>And certainly many people in the military would not stomach these actions, but were on a board about conspiracies, are you really going to say there’s not a possibility of collusion between like-minded individuals to make something like this happen and keep themselves in control? I just think that’s not really being objective about the scenario. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is they already HAVE the edge, and are continually sharpening it. We’ve already lost the arms race if you’re concerned about protecting yourself from a corrupt government. </p>

<p>Frankly I don’t concern myself with that angle precisely because of that. No matter what guns you own, you will lose fighting the government. You would have to go back DECADES to change that fact. I’m more concerned with preventing needless loss of life in the name of the power fantasy that is gun ownership. Do you really think it’s a coincidence that we are the only country with this problem? It’s not, it’s a direct result of the lax regulations surrounding guns. </p>

<p>I appreciate that many gun owners are responsible folks. I wish they could appreciate that it only takes a few irresponsible people to ruin something, and it’s pretty selfish to continually sacrifice fellow Americans in the name of what are basically cool toys to many many gun owners. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah it’s almost like it falls to us as a society to self-evaluate and make choices for the betterment of everyone, as opposed to insisting that someone will have to show up and kill me to take my guns. </p>

<p>It’s petulance, really. A large contingent of selfish people who jump through whatever mental hoops they need to as long as they can justify owning something that serves the single and specific person of ending a life. Sorry if that statement is offensive but that the truth. If people wanted to overthrow the government, they would have already, either when Obama was in office or when Trump was, so I’m done listening to the rhetoric. </p>
