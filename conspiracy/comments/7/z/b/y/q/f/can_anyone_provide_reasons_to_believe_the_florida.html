       happened (like Nomar Garciawhiner) apply the "Zetetic Method" to everything in life. But they never leave the house to actually prove anything to/for themselves, so they just sit back and make everyone else do the work for them and then respond with, "Says you, prove it"

       Compartmentalize, NDA's, money, being connected to families with ties to dark factions. It's not hard, it's been done before. And in the event that someone has become a liability, they are taken out. And you won't hear about on the news. Half the people involved were there to act out a scheduled drill, so they have no clue. That adds to the confusion. The rest know what they've signed up for. They don't just hire anyone to do the dirty work.

       Hey,
I understand that this is a huge rush for you. If you are set on believing this is fake then I have a suggestion for you :). Instead of commenting about how you KNOW it's fake, how about you take action and research? David hoggs theory has been proven to be false by this very subreddit. You can go on twitter and contact many of the students that went through this. You can tell them you think it's fake, no way in hell did they watch their classmates die! Ask them for proof. I bet they have it. Visit the classmates families and visit hospitals. Then visit the small grave plots for dead 14 year olds. You have the opportunity to challenge the people you claim are lying. Do it. :)

       You're really aggressive for someone who blocked that account almost immediately and only responded because someone else called you out. You wanna tell everyone you don't believe people died? If you can't see how that's toxic then that's pretty unbelievable. Take a chill pill, bucko. I'm just trying to help you find proof. This might help you.

       Please be kind, it helps your blood pressure 
Start with twitter @sarahchad_ she is one of the victims, or to you "actors", of the shooting. From there you can see any proof you need.  You can videos and you can ask her and her classmates for that Gory shit you will love. You can also search this subreddit for recent posts stating that whole David Hogg or whatever his name is, is NOT a crisis actor and in fact a real student. God speed my conspiracy king

       Blood pressure is perfect and I don’t have hernias. Got checked last week by ur mom.  Sarah Chad seems like a real go getter, but when my government starts listening to emotional pleas of 16 year old girls to make changes that drastically alter the sovereignty of the individual is where I draw the line.  I’ll wait until someone posts a liveleak or something rather than bothering her, she seems to have her hands full at the moment.

       It's ok! There are  more classmates that you can harass. I feel the government should be listening to our future generation, knowing full well they are constantly in danger or "danger". 
So you will claim they're all lying but you won't give evidence and you'll ignore the chance to talk to real humans. I think you know what this looks like.

       B: The subject is, GSM is reading into people who are saying that the school shooting did happen, and is not properly understanding what they are saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       either could be the subject or your statement.

       I haven't started digging in to this one yet but my general distrust in media and government is a long list. Most MSM is regurgitating partisan talking points. They have covered for war crimes, mass surveillance, and limits on free speech just to name a few. The CIA has long ties to major media outlets. They were dead wrong about the last election. They have been caught staging news events before.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could go into  their lack of coverage on all matters of the federal reserve. The enthusiastic cheers while Waco burned, the silence of Bill Clintons ties to drug trafficking before his election, and all these other major crimes that they miss time and time again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our government brought Nazis over to continue mind control experiments, They want us doped up on their drugs while punishing us for using better alternatives. They assassinate elected officials, launch wars of aggression, and starve entire countries with blockades. Day after day people watch as politician's get promotions and raises even when they are blatant criminals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking into what the government and media is involved in all of those things plus more must be taken into account plus more. The real question is why would you believe an organized group or known liars, murderers, and thieves?

       No you're not.  You're asking people to prove a negative.  The onus is on the authorities to prove their extraordinary narrative.   So far it doesn't look very convincing.  Why do you believe it?

       I didn't say I did?
      </p>
      <p>
       But I will say I don't really believe the "authorities" have an extraordinary narrative to prove, when school shootings happen on a regular basis in america.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I'm pretty sure proving the negative is not an appropriate application of logic for this. I can't be certain but in this situation the difference between the shooting having happend and the shooting having not happend isn't a negation per se, since we still havnt agreed that the positive of the situation is that "their was a school shooting which was not conspiratorial". Then again I may be incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I really don't understand why you are saying I'm not providing an opportunity for people to talk when I just started a post so people could talk. if they wish to prove a negative then go ahead. I'm not a shill and am just trying to ask questions.

       You should have to as you posted a place for discussion without providing your own input into it. Were you planning on being a silent observer? If so, why post? Why not lurk on any of the various similar posts to yours that have popped up consistently the last few days? At least get the conversation going by providing your own insights so we know where you stand and are coming from.

       Your “question” is exactly what the MSM is doing to the definition of “false-flag”.  We aren’t saying it didn’t happen, we are saying it happened differently than what we are told to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anecdotal evidence that this purposeful manipulation of the definition is real and working: I told my friend that I thought 9/11 was a false flag and he replied, “oh, so the towers DIDN’T fall?

       My take is this... 2 big standouts, The FBI ignoring information, seemingly scripted talking points by some students especially oddities with Hogg. Do I believe it happened, yes. Do I believe FBI allowed it to happen intentionally to push an agenda, 60/40 yes. Do I believe at least a couple people are actors or being manipulated into advancing an agenda and pushing talking points, absolutely.

       Alternate take on the FBI: They were aware of the threat and were discretely doing what they could about it, hence the crisis drill we keep hearing about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our laws love 'em or hate 'em, are innocent until proven guilty. Until he opened fire, what could the FBI have done to Cruz? So maybe they try to keep an eye on him. Get the school to start upping security, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the FBI is mostly flat footed guys who play so rigidly by the book, it's amazing they can get out of bed in the morning without a procedural handbook. My gut is, if anyone is deep state, agenda, manipulating, etc-- that's the CIA. NSA. and perhaps a few of those acronyms you never much get to hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scripted talking points by a kid who probably wants a career in front of the camera don't ping my radar too hard. A well-meaning teacher can give a kid talking points. Or the kids' parents. Or another debate-team kid. If a news crew shows up, there's always a few kids in the audience with their hands up hoping the magician picks them for the show.

       Youtube is taking the videos down quickly, but there are some pretty daming videos circulating.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        female student that knew the suspect since middle school was next to him and speaking to him while gunshots were occurring elsewhere.
       </li>
       <li>
        female student said that they were told of a drill before the event took place
       </li>
       <li>
        one crisis actor identified to be in his early 20s and not a real student...coincidentally was in a viral video previously. Restarts a rehearsed script a couple of times caught on camera.
       </li>
       <li>
        one student interviewed is caught being coached by someone off camera.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I think it's important to remember that they probably did kill people, because if they're going to all this trouble, they are not going to be shy about killing people.

       Nice moving of goalposts. I'm just asking a question so the people who do believe this have a chance to state their piece. Nice work trying to shut down legit questions my friend.

       very vague. Are you saying I'm reading into people saying it didn't happen, or that I'm reading into people saying that it did happen?

       Blood pressure is perfect and I don’t have hernias. Got checked last week by ur mom.  Sarah Chad seems like a real go getter, but when my government starts listening to emotional pleas of 16 year old girls to make changes that drastically alter the sovereignty of the individual is where I draw the line.  I’ll wait until someone posts a liveleak or something rather than bothering her, she seems to have her hands full at the moment.
