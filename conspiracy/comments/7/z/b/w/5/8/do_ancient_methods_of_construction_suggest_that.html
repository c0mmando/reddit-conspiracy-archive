       Correct but the explanation that hundreds of thousands of highly skilled workers who camped at the site for decades and cut granite to millimeters of margins with fucking bronze tools and piled these blocks by piling up hundreds of thousand cubic meters of soil is not helping the mainstream argument.

       My personal belief is that the pyramids are the tower of babel, and i believe in those days people lived extremely long lives, so whats a few decades of construction.

       I am thinking that the pyramids 2000+ft below water off Cuba could rival that, but it is too expensive to go down there to verify age. Oh and then there is the fact that it is off Cuba''s coast.

       This is not evidence, but seeing that one guy lose his shit and not debate him, I realized there was more to the man than what main stream academics give him credit for.

       It shows either that there is a certain method of building enormous structures with extreme percision using the softest of metals as tools and civilizations like Egypt and the Incas just happened to pick up on it..
      </p>
      <p>
       Or that those structures were there before these civilizations actually rose. Like Sacsayhuaman, which was apparently attributed to the Killke people, not the Inca the Spanish found inhabiting it. But why is what is arguably the most massive and stunning piece of megalithic architecture in south America the only one attributed to a comparetively unknown group of people?
      </p>
      <p>
       King Tut had boomerangs and there are groups of South American natives with more DNA in common with polynesians and Australian Aborigines than North American Natives. History's fucking weird.

       I believe that many of the megalithic ruins that inhabit our planet are much older than antiquity would have us believe. Unfortunately we will never truly know much of the truth of what really existed as far as knowledge and civilization before major global religions, mostly Abrahamic, actively sought to suppress the knowledge of the ancients. Those savages that wouldn't accept the given deity were destroyed as well as their stories. Even shamans world wide have been polluted in one way or another by one of the Abrahamic falsities.  South America,  Poly-Micro-Mela-nesia, Africa, the Americas. It's all been pillaged and looted of it's memories to help support myths. If some of the things we are learning are true about calamity hitting the planet every 13,000 years or so you never know what form of humanity has managed to take hold and what they were able to do. And to what scale that calamity was able to destroy whatever forms of life were dominate and what paths they chose to go with their culture and technology. We are taught so intrinsically that we are the best that this world has ever produced and that we must nurture our egos. It's all be design and the people that run the show probably know more about what
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       then we ever will. To know what the Smithsonian and Vatican have in their vaults would be pretty great I'd think.

       We are taught that we've been around for hundreds of thousands of years. We are also STILL apes. Ape is a word with a definition that we fit. In order for us not to fit the word ape would have to modify it's meaning.

      <p>
       Secondly wtf are you talking about. Our lack of being dumb is why we are apex on this planet. Mankind was never dumb. We tamed fire. We invented agriculture. We learned to read the stars. What we were was without knowledge. But with a strong social structure skills and knowledge were passed down to each generation at least in part.
      </p>
      <p>
       The knowledge was lost because it was no longer in that cultures interest or the replacement culture. Or the population waned. Or the food supply shifted. Etc.

       Here's the problem, most of humanity live by the coastline. 12000 years ago the oceans were 450' lower than present sea level. We simply do not have an easy access to where most of humanity would have lived back then. 
Plus an impact even took place in North America. Wiping out most of the mega fauna and what humans would have been there.
