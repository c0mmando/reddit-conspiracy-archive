       I know americans love their liberty, and their guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still don't know why its considered so wrong to want to try to have guns in 'responsible hands', for proper purposes. Seems like a good idea to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       All other western countries I know of have reasonably strict gun controls, and its fantastic. As someone living on the other side of the world I have no fear of being shot in almost any circumstance.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet some people act like gun control = being completely defenceless. These same types also act like the media has a gun control agenda that they can't wait to enact. What nefarious agenda do gun control advocates have? Why are people so threatened by safety? Help me understand...

       Just because Europeans lost many gun rights doesn't mean yanks want the same. Besides gun ownership IS prevalent across Europe and I know many gun owners in places like the UK and France let alone Switze1r1land where guns are super common.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also remember the usa is big and often rural with shit police response times. I certainly wouldn't want to be without a gun in many places in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gun control is not really an ideal solution at all. It's not even about saving lives it's a visceral reaction to something anti gun owners are repulsed by because they treat the issue childishly.

       Criminals in Europe and other places under strict gun control zones don't have easy access to guns because there isn't already 300 million guns in circulation like there is in America. We also border Mexico which is the second most violent country in the world with the third largest black market. It is riddled with gangs, cartels and smugglers who will always flood America with drugs and guns to supply our own criminals with. Criminals will always break the law to buy guns if they are made illegal. Law abiding citizens will defenseless and unarmed. Luckily, we have the second amendment which protects our right to keep and bear arms.

       Chicken or egg. Did Chicago become so violent because gun laws or were gun laws made because of the violence. It doesn't help that there are little to no restrictions on buying a gun in a neighbouring state and bringing it to Chicago.

       Missing the point by a mile. Aside from the fact that they could be arrested for having a gun thus preventing other crimes but there is a good chance that the criminal would not even have a gun in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guns in the US are dirt cheap because there are so many of them. Cut the supply by reducing the number of guns in circulation and you increase the price. This is the case in EU as most common criminals aren't able to buy a gun due to the price.

       Sharing a direct border with a country (Mexico) is a whole lot different than being a semi-distant neighbor with multiple countries in between. Mexico is also far more violent, corrupt and full of drugs, gangs and criminals it doesn't even compare to those countries listed. Being closer to South America contributes to the contraband coming into our country as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eastern European countries that are near Russia and Turkey also have much higher gun violence than western EU countries which proves my point.

       80% or more of the guns used in crimes have been bought illegally through the black market.

      <p>
       Criminals already get arrested for having guns since they have illegally obtained them. As I have said before, there is nothing stopping a criminal from breaking the law to buy a gun.

      <p>
       The same logic was used on the war on drugs and that failed miserably. The price would increase on the black market which would put more money into the hands of the gangs and criminals.

       The point was that most EU countries do not border Turkey, Morocco and Russia, there is multiple countries in between creating a protection barrier for the other 90% of the continent. This is why gun laws work better in Western Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our border with Mexico is incomparable to Morocco only bordering one EU country with a whole sea in between and Turkey having only one decent sized border with the EU. While Eastern European countries that border Russia do have a higher rate of gun violence than your average EU country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, Mexico and these countries do not even compare in terms of the violence and black market system.

       More than that, it's largely a political football. The Democrats know they won't get meaningful gun control anytime soon, and they don't necessarily want it. They want to be able to score political points and claim the Republicans are responsible for all the school shootings.

       The way they feel is the way I feel, it's the first step on the slippery slope. Gun control advocates won't stop ever, you give an inch they take a mile. Therefore you can never give them an inch. There is no safety in gun control, ask Chicago.

       Those folks are totally screwed whether or not the government becomes tyrannical.  Especially Americans, who realistically has no chance against the most advanced military in the world.  Their only hope would be that the military itself stands against the tyranny.  Because your random hillbilly militia stands little to no chance whatsoever.  Maybe they did when the 2nd amendment was created but now the balance of power and technology is so in their favor, it would be nearly hopeless.

       I would still argue that a populace armed with shotguns and semiautomatic weapons has a much better chance at standing up to a superiorly armed military than an unarmed populace. I think you make the right determination that the military itself (and LEOs) would need to stand up to the tyranny, but I think guns make that more likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the military is ordered to implement martial law on an unarmed populace, there's likely to be less resistance from the populace, and therefore the military is more likely to be able to subdue the population with little bloodshed. If the populace is armed, however, some percent will fight back, and the military will need to kill civilians. It's one thing to kill enemy combatants on foreign soil, but killing your countrymen takes a toll on one's psyche. I think you would see more defection in a scenario with an armed populace than one which is not.

       But what are the chances?  I've seen police and other American officials have absolutely no issue with killing unarmed civilians and roughing up peaceful protestors.  Killing or firing at a soldier will more than likely create an "us vs. them" scenario in the minds of both sides.  Then we have to look at American history.  The civil war for example.  Armed or unarmed it would make no difference for the chances of the American population if the military doesn't take the side of the populace and actually protect the people and the Constitution.  Because at best, an armed American populace will stand no better chance than ISIS or Taliban.

       Us vs them, not really. Armed forces members have families, are citizens. If an army is directed against its own citizenry, defection most certainly would happen. No one would want to risk killing their own friends and family because someone gave an order.

       We're not talking about their loved ones. We're talking about people like you (if you're American) who they have no clue about who are in opposition of direct orders given by by their superiors. The family of soldiers would likely be taken care of, or convinced to just go with it. Again, look at the civil war. Each side  thought they were doing the right thing in their own perspective. The same would be the case in this scenario. The citizens would see that they're standing against tyranny. Whereas the army (granted they stick to the side of the elite) would likely feel they are following orders and upholding certain liberties or however the elites spin it in their favor. And in that scenario, gun or no gun, the citizens stand next to no chance when it comes to any sort of violent exchange. It's a pipe dream. A false sense of security. The only chance would be to act against corruption now, or hope to convince the military to join your cause later. Any other way would not end well regardless of how armed you think you are.

       Nothing ends well in this scenario, but most of the army are pro-2A. If soldiers see their citizenry invoke the 2A to protest or resist a tyranny, itâ€™s highly likely defections would occur, soldiers taking their training and equipment to the other side to do what they signed up for, to defend the citizenry and protect the rights enshrined in their constitution. Orders given that goes against their oath of service would not be followed.

       Again, let me bring up the Civil War.  Union soldier had no problems killing Confederate soldiers and vice versa, why?  Because each were fighting for what they believed was right for the country and for freedom (because Confederate soldiers were fighting for their "freedom" and "right" to keep slaves among other things).  It would be the same thing today.  Soldiers will carry out their duties regardless if it's a fellow countryman or not.  Yes, some soldiers will likely defect to the side of the citizens, but it all depends on which way the powers that be spin their tyranny and how deep the corruption goes into the ranks of the military.
       <br/>
       *When I said "taken care of", I meant cared for and kept safe from harm as a favor to the soldier.
Also in your reference to Tianamen Square (which admittedly I have to research as it's been a while since I had to discuss US history), do you think if the citizens had guns they could resist being crushed by a tank or even an air raid?

       Iâ€™ll read up some about the civil war and get back to you. Until then we can safely say in the case of the American civil war that neither side would have a chance for victory without being armed. Guns on both sides provided for a reasonably fair fight. No side fights if they think that they will loose, unless they have very little left to loose. A group without guns has a near zero chance. So to have guns is to increase chance of victory in violent encounters. Iâ€™m sure we both can agree therefore that owning guns increases the chances of resisting a violent tyranny above zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Tianamen square, no, theyâ€™d have still been crushed, but the overwhelming use of force needed to crush an organised armed opposition would have sent shockwaves through the rest of the populace, and they would not have been able to claim that they acted with a proportionate response. They sent tanks at the unarmed, so itâ€™s likely that airforce, bombs, and structural damage would occur to the city which could only be understood as an attack on a country by its government. Other citizens beyond the initial group would be enraged and theres a large chance that this incident would have caused a large-scale endemic uprising if others had the means to engage in non-futile resistance. An armed populace would have made it near impossible for the government to put a lid on the situation. Way more pressure to contain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, an armed populace willing to die to defend itself can ONLY be defeated by a scorched earth policy, where a government destroys a massive proportion of its powerbase, which is of course the people. If a government kills a large proportion of its populace and some of its army during an internal battle, that nation becomes weaker militarily and economically which is not a good situation for a government, which primarily seeks to preserve and acquire power. They overtly reveal themselves  as dictators without the ability to neatly sweep it under the rug. It becomes much harder to contain the truth of events. It would also be a massive blow to a nations geo-political position. Other countries might sense weakness and invade or support armed opposition groups increasing pressure even more.

       I'll take nearly hopeless. As I count on at least some of the military and LEOs to side with us or at least refuse the orders. But without the 2nd and 1st amendments where would we be? We have let things go to far for sure but that is all the more reason to not give an inch on the 2nd because without 2 they come for 1.

       I think Americans have to act before it even gets that far.  The problem is in allowing corruption in the government anyway.  It's not like the corruption is just going to go away.  It's going to grow and fester until there is a situation like the one we're describing.  The best chance is to nip it in the bud.  Complacency and inaction does no favors.  Get rid of every corrupt politician that works in the interest of corporations and the super wealthy over the American people.  Just my $0.02...

       I agree that it needs nipped but I think we missed it by a bit as I think we were screwed in 1913. But we can ywt win if we can expose the lies and get more and more to see it. That is why the while Q thing that 80 percent has to happen behind the scenes is BS all the corruption needs to come to light so ALL can see it. Jo matter how bad it is and no matter who it implicates.

       In all of those cases the US were on foreign soil, and with Vietnam I'm fairly certain they won every battle...
Such examples that you are giving will be much less likely on US soil. Especially if going by history. The US also had no problems air bombing an entire city on it's own soil. How could you prepare for that. Your final sentence sounds noble and heroic.  But it doesn't seem realistic. Again, I think the problem should be addressed before it even reaches that point.

       So what if criminals didn't have guns either?
You could actually defend yourself with a random household item and no one has to die....
Sounds great to me... But the US seems to have this wild wild west shootout mentality. Makes no sense to me. But since there is guns, no one is talking about banning guns outright. They're talking about gun control. I mean, there's freedom of speech, but there's a control factor to your freedom of speech in the the fact that you can't exactly go around threatening individuals, say the n word, and other hate speech. There's certain other restrictions to your freedoms with the purpose and intent to save lives (seat belt laws, age limits for alcohol and driving, drug usage, etc. ), so what's the problem with limiting the populace to lower powered shotguns and handguns, with more thorough background checks if that could save lives and limit the number and ease of mass homicides?

       Who said I was eager to submit?  I'm just not of the mindset that owning a weapon can magically save me from an army with bigger and better weaponry.  A shootout is not a very smart engagement.  And I'm aware I'm different from most but there's very few probable situations where I feel there's actually a need for a firearm personally.   And I've lived in some pretty sketchy neighborhoods.

       Some places in Europe actually have very authoritarian laws already. In places such as Sweden, Germany or the UK, you could say something "offensive" or non politically correct on the internet and the police may show up at your door. It is a very slippery slope and the censorship and oppression won't get any better. It's just a couple stones throw away from the early stages of a tyrannical government and the people of Europe are completely defenseless.

       That's why we have the second amendment, to prevent any sort of oppressive laws from happening in the first place. The second amendment protects our first amendment, the right to free speech and I would say that America has the strongest free speech laws in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it just so happens that our government does impose oppressive, draconian laws against us. Then we will use the second amendment like it was designed to be used. By defending ourselves against the tyrannical government.

       I agree. But once that drone attack was made, the survivors and/or onlookers would adjust tactics.

       And adjusting tactics with guns is a hell of a lot better than adjusting tactics with pointy knives.

       It might be easier to think that way when you come from a mostly single race country. When you have people from backgrounds across the globe living in a city of 20 million or more, who might be just as prejudice as ,apparently, white people here are, it's harder to practice what you said.
      </p>
      <p>
       I lived in a small town of mostly mexican immigrants and most did not have proper documents to be here or had temporary work visa's. Somehow everyone in the town had a gun. From handguns, rifles, shotguns, and full automatic weapons. How did these people even get guns if they do not have proper ID, let alone full auto weapons. Probably not through legal channels. 
It takes emergency response ~20min or so to get to my town because it was so remote. It is not possible to rely on them for close to anything when it came to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This also shows that we can not rely fully on our gov. to protect us. Our constitution is setup so that no one citizen has to rely on gov., but to have the ability to be self reliant. It's our culture to not have to rely on them for anything but the protection of our countries borders. This includes owning land, being able to take care of yourself and family without the need or gov. support, being able to defend your family and property, and really just be able to live without fear of someone imposing their will upon you. Sounds like an old idea but I think the rohingya muslims would like the sound of that right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might have full faith in your gov., but as we learn from history most always end up turning against or oppressing it's populace or just fail. We are setup to be able to survive such an event. I do not expect my gov. to become tyrannical, but i also don't expect it to last forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. before i get some shit about being racist against mexicans, I am mexican, how i found out most were from cartel run border towns and not all were just trying to make a peaceful living. If i wanted, could have got a .30cal machine gun or rpg smuggled to me through these channels.

       I get the impression from this fear that the US is more divided than it appears. People feel scared and isolated (in ideals not distances) from each other. It is a huge country, with a lot going on. North/South. East/West. State/State. Republican/Democrat. White/Black/Yellow.

       I wouldn't say divided, but most people are just to busy to deal with stuff outside of their immediate bubble. It is also a reflection of our failing school system and ability to even be able to talk to each other. Again, not easy to do when you have immigrants coming in who don't speak english and/or do not assimilate our culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO people just need to let the kids be kids, play outside, have dinner with one another, and especially get away from 40hr work weeks. We need more time to interact outside of professional settings. Don't need to fully understand the culture you came from, just realize we all people and America is America because we are a nation of immigrants who came from oppression. Just the 1st amendment can be culture shock to someone, let alone the 2nd.

       gun control challenges one of the earliest and fundamental tenents of the constitution. this would inevitably lead to further degradation of constituitional rights. Furthermore gun rights represents the right of citizens to overthrow a tyrannical government ie deep state.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's perhaps moat noteworthy here is that deep state, as evidenced by the deep state propaganda tool, CNN, is the one pushing gun control.

       Thanks for this. Gun control is seen as an attack/erosion of the US constitution. Hence any agenda to pursue gun control could be seen a a conspiracy to damage the constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure what the solution is in this case. Maybe the constitution and a US version of gun control could be made more compatible somehow?

       But the guy above says in the UK and France let alone Switze1r1land guns are super common. So.. I'm not necessarily defenceless.

       What criteria are you using the judge who's a responsible person?  - This is a good question and worth careful consideration. Other countries have done so and come up with laws that seem to help reduce shootings.

       Plain and simple? All humans have a Natural Right to self protection/defense. This was solidified in the 2nd amendment. The government did not grant us this right, the government was told we have this  Creator given right. Anything that infringes on this is a) Against Natural Law, and b) unconstitutional. The former being the more powerful...

       Im not offending you americans but reading your comments about gun rights, its a liberty value right? Such as having the rights to guns to overthrow the government becoming tyranical? If this is the core belief to the right of arm than how come you americans havent done anything and actually overthrow the government since its already tyranical? Am I missing something?

       Not sure where you are from, but it sounds like you are not anywhere near "free."  Do not forget the lessons of recent history - Germany pummeled unarmed populations because the armies that were supposed to protect those populations were way too small.
      </p>
      <p>
       European countries are run by the extremely rich who like how Europeans have been collared by regulation and laws aimed at their "own safety."  Those same rich people fucking hate America because the masses are not so easily tamed.  Americans aren't tamed because they have the means to fight back.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we lose our ability to fight back we lose our freedom.  People from countries not named the USA do not have the experience of living with the freedoms we have in the US, thus do not understand the feelings we have about preserving those freedoms.

       You are correct that I don't understand the feeling of gun advocates in the US, hence this thread asking for an explanation in this submission.

       I think its worrying how people here are expressing how America freedom hinges on an armed militia. It wouldn't have helped defend any European country from a real army. I cant see it stopping an organised police or military force in the modern day either. From the outside it looks like a colonial hangover.

       I'm pretty conservative for a modern day person, and I believe common sense gun regulations are possible. It ought to start first with the repeal of the ridiculous NFA and the re introduction of firearms instructions in schools by professionals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both are clearly impossible at the moment due to the current circumstances. If the NFA is repealed, accidents with fully auto guns will go up. With shitty schools, accidents at the schools will go up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Current gun laws are basically useless. If you're convicted of a misdemeanor once when you're 6 years old, you're unable to buy a gun for the rest of your life. If you chop down the barrel on your gun too short without paying $1000 to the government and waiting a literal year for their permission, you're a criminal and lose your guns and go to jail. You can buy an AR-15 when you're 18, but have to wait until you're 21 to buy a handgun. In some states, you have to get a concealed carry permit to carry a gun concealed, but you don't need anything if you want to open carry. This includes rifles and shotguns.
      </p>
      <p>
       These laws are stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gun control has shown itself to be full of lies and follows propaganda techniques and critical thought numbing rhetoric perfectly. It's proponents also are hypocrites. Many of the most outspoken and extreme gun control advocates who call for outright bans of all guns own guns, and some even have concealed carry permits. One guy, I forget his name, super gun banner, saw some kid in his pool and freaked out and took his revolver and shot him, told the police he was a threatening home invader.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anti gunners also seem to have no clue how guns even work or what the current laws are. A lot of them seem to literally believe you can buy a fully automatic shotgun or a fully automatic AR-15 ghost gun with a grenade launcher without a background check that shoots suppressed heat seeking hollow points at 100,000 rounds per minute.
      </p>
      <p>
       If gun control advocates offered common sense solutions to gun violence through these regulations, I'd be all for it. Instead, they try to totally ban some guns and then put their foot in the doorstep and offer a "common sense" regulation when the people say fuck no it.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the regulations proposed thus far haven't been by people who appreciate the 2nd amendment or respect gun culture, they've been by anti gunners who hate people owning guns. I'm not gonna believe they have my interest in mind for the same reason I don't believe Jordan Belfort wants to help me get rich quick.

       That's why we have the second amendment, to prevent any sort of oppressive laws from happening in the first place. The second amendment protects our first amendment, the right to free speech and I would say that America has the strongest free speech laws in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it just so happens that our government does impose oppressive, draconian laws against us. Then we will use the second amendment like it was designed to be used. By defending ourselves against the tyrannical government.

       Chicken or egg. Did Chicago become so violent because gun laws or were gun laws made because of the violence. It doesn't help that there are little to no restrictions on buying a gun in a neighbouring state and bringing it to Chicago.

       Missing the point by a mile. Aside from the fact that they could be arrested for having a gun thus preventing other crimes but there is a good chance that the criminal would not even have a gun in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guns in the US are dirt cheap because there are so many of them. Cut the supply by reducing the number of guns in circulation and you increase the price. This is the case in EU as most common criminals aren't able to buy a gun due to the price.

       In all of those cases the US were on foreign soil, and with Vietnam I'm fairly certain they won every battle...
Such examples that you are giving will be much less likely on US soil. Especially if going by history. The US also had no problems air bombing an entire city on it's own soil. How could you prepare for that. Your final sentence sounds noble and heroic.  But it doesn't seem realistic. Again, I think the problem should be addressed before it even reaches that point.

       It might be easier to think that way when you come from a mostly single race country. When you have people from backgrounds across the globe living in a city of 20 million or more, who might be just as prejudice as ,apparently, white people here are, it's harder to practice what you said.
      </p>

       I lived in a small town of mostly mexican immigrants and most did not have proper documents to be here or had temporary work visa's. Somehow everyone in the town had a gun. From handguns, rifles, shotguns, and full automatic weapons. How did these people even get guns if they do not have proper ID, let alone full auto weapons. Probably not through legal channels. 
It takes emergency response ~20min or so to get to my town because it was so remote. It is not possible to rely on them for close to anything when it came to it.
      </p>

       This also shows that we can not rely fully on our gov. to protect us. Our constitution is setup so that no one citizen has to rely on gov., but to have the ability to be self reliant. It's our culture to not have to rely on them for anything but the protection of our countries borders. This includes owning land, being able to take care of yourself and family without the need or gov. support, being able to defend your family and property, and really just be able to live without fear of someone imposing their will upon you. Sounds like an old idea but I think the rohingya muslims would like the sound of that right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might have full faith in your gov., but as we learn from history most always end up turning against or oppressing it's populace or just fail. We are setup to be able to survive such an event. I do not expect my gov. to become tyrannical, but i also don't expect it to last forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. before i get some shit about being racist against mexicans, I am mexican, how i found out most were from cartel run border towns and not all were just trying to make a peaceful living. If i wanted, could have got a .30cal machine gun or rpg smuggled to me through these channels.
