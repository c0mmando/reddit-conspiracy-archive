<p>This user believes in every conspiracy but trump and Russia. </p>

<p>In fact 90% of his comments are trying to discredit trump and Russia. </p>

<p>When a literal shill is on your side, you’re on the wrong side </p>

<p>Check his history (he deletes it every 24 hours)</p>

<p>He’s only allowed to post in this sub (banned from everywhere else)</p>

<p>Believes and supports every conspiracy on this sub but one: Trump and Russia </p>

<p>90% of his comments in the last 24 hours have been trying to discredit the Trump and Russia conspiracy. The only one he ever tries to discredit. </p>

<p>And on top of that he has literally posted in every single thread about trump and Russia submitted here in the last 24 hours. </p>

<p>So you tell me. What’s more believable. The FBI hiring kids to fake a shooting with a plant. </p>

<p>That’s not what I said. </p>

<p>He really cares about discrediting trump and Russia </p>

<p>And he loves EVERY other conspiracy political or not. </p>

<p>I mean sure some people will be annoyed but hopefully it reaches enough people that they recognize his name. </p>

<p>He only posts in these threads (rarely. Literally less than 5% of his comments) so he can keep his karma above the threshold. </p>

<p>You’ll notice that prior to this he was receiving a lot of downvotes for trolling. Most of his comments are downvoted. However, he’ll have one random one with 50-100 because he actually participated in a thread for once instead of trolling/gaslighting and shilling. </p>

<p>I just explained why. </p>

<p>He does this every so often to keep his karma from going below the threshold. </p>

<p>It’s a common tactic by shills. They cannot do their job if they are shadow banned for benign below the threshold. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yet you come in and derail the thread. I never noticed him until about the third time I saw you cut and paste your &quot;shill&quot; evidence. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah because you didn’t post something he needed to try to discredit where he would then troll every single one of your comments in every thread you replied in. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It just made me think you were the crazy one with how often you post it. Why can&#39;t you let other people work out if they take him seriously or not and just block or ignore the guy rather than look like a stalker? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it’s hard to tell sometimes on the internet. Some people will end up wasting a lot of time. </p>

<p>Not to mention the quicker he’s outed, the quicker he can stop gaslighting and trolling in other threads where he’s detailing the conversation. </p>

<p>Sorry I derailed ONE conversation here to point out a user who spend his entire time on Reddit disrupting genuine conversation for the sake of spreading an agenda. </p>

<p>But again. Keep enabling him. It does wonders for people who come to this sub and see users defending a literal shill. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also you said he is banned from every sub from here yet he has multiple comments in other subs in his history? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I said “might be banned”</p>

<p>And what other subs is he commenting in?</p>

<p>It seems the only sub he commented in today was this one. (Again he deletes all his posts after 24 hours)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What game are you playing at with telling lies like that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TIL that saying “might be banned” is lying instead of expressing an opinion/possibility. </p>

<p>But whatever go upvote all his stuff make him the bastion of what this sub stands for. Everyone will take conspiracy theorists a lot more seriously...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont care dude I was happy thinking my interactions with you were over. Are you going to message me every time you think you find something about him? Please don&#39;t. I was more calling you out for spamming than defending him until you started spouting easily verifiable mistruths. You at least owned up to it which was respectable.  Maybe  use your cut and paste shill post on political posts where it may even be relevant so this mistake doesn&#39;t happen again? </p>

I’ve read Dave Grohl took him out as a blood sacrifice-look where it got him. Btw I love foo fighters so I refuse to believe that bc I’m jaded but many ppl think it was him and/or Courtney Love.  He was ready to leave the industry bc he saw it for the fake bs it is- they being the labels and industry couldn’t control him so they offed him. RIP KC. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a prophecy passed down among the elite for a millennia, of a famous person who played music; that by middle-age, would unite the masses to overthrow them.</p>

<p>He or she would supposely be known for their new type of music, hair style, and clothing.</p>

<p>They would also have a strong influence on public opinions. </p>

<p>So... the elite decided to kill all potential leads. Most all of the deaths were at the ago of 27 (in occult meaning 27 is a number representing absolute power). Plane crashes, drug overdoses, and suicides... their three favorite ways to off potential leads.</p>

<p>The 27 Club.</p>
