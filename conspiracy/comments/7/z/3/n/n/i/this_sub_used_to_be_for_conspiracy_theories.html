       To me, it's fine if the only conspiracy you believe in is Russia.  But if you also feel the need to aggressively 'debunk' or 'fact check' any other conspiracy ideas against your political worldview, you sort of are a political shill -- and there are plenty of left-leaning Trump bashing subs out there to go to.  Let people go down all kinds of rabbit holes in search of truths if they want to.

       This is made up BS to serve the need to divide common people. These aren't "theories." These are manipulations. They are common and should be taken apart with facts at every place possible. Mocking deliberate lies is absolutely ok.

       There's an example of this multiple times of day. This one example is less than a few hours old. By the time people respond with facts lots of damage has already been done. It's all about stopping an honest discussion for the people who spread this BS.

       i agree but should be on both sides. a quality conspiracy post should provide as much convincing info and/or decent sources as possible just as a quality “debunk” comment should, whether it’s political or not. a lot of good topics out there, of all varieties, just haven’t been discussed properly ...for a while now in this sub.

       I’m with War Sanchez on this one. I think the pairing of “debunking” and “partisan” is not just odd but disingenuous. If something you claim is legitimately debunked that’s not a partisan thing. It is possible to be proven wrong by someone who believe differently that you, that doesn’t make you any less wrong just because you don’t like the person debunking you.

       And I’ve never been to r/politics, not really my scene. Cute insults though. Personally I prefer to stick to making cogent points not focusing on ad Homs.

       That is true -- but for example look at the current state of Snopes.  90% of their debunking is negative Trump-related or positive Hillary-related.

       I don’t care what percent it is if it’s legitimate. I’m not going to tell someone to stop fact checking because “you’ve fact checked that topic too much”.

       The biggest problem I see on this sub and in the US political structure as a whole is no one is willing to enter conversations with an open-mind.  Both sides are so entrenched in their  political religions; they view their political opponents in the same way the Crusaders viewed Muslims.  These types of convictions manifest into the feelings of superiority and hatred.
      </p>
      <p>
       While we bicker like school children, the people causing these societal divides are laughing all the way the bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without cooperation, open-mindedness, and respect in conversations, we are nothing better than immature children who don't want to change and grow.

       There are swing voters out there (I'm one of them), they swung the election -- 'racist' white middle class &amp; blue collar people who voted Obama and then Trump.

       There are millions of us (worldwide) who are beyond disgusted in general with the Establishment, Media, Large Multi-National Corps and the Government and are willing to listen to alternatives like Bernie &amp; Trump, etc.

       I'm an unapologetic (and perhaps some would say "aggressive") fact checker.  I really don't see the downside.  If you have a theory, it should stand up to fact checking.  If it doesn't, that's cool too, but you should be open and willing to discuss why it isn't holding up.  In my opinion, those questions are what can lead to actual facts and knowledge.  I don't know why this is so difficult for some.

       I recommend r/conspiracyundone.  We clean out the political shills you speak of.  While there is still plenty of political content as we think politics and conspiracies are inseparable, I hope that you find that the other content is what you are looking for.
