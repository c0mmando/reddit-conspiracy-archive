<p>But it is extremely obvious to every regular on this subreddit that any time a post here goes viral, the threads don&#39;t fill up with &quot;debunking evidence&quot;, they fill up with mocking, insults, and mainstream narratives which are only considered &quot;true&quot; because a news logo published it.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one that is 2 hours old created to attack a child survivor who says things some people don&#39;t like:</p>

<p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PolitiSass/status/966198300683710465/photo/1">https://mobile.twitter.com/PolitiSass/status/966198300683710465/photo/1</a></p>

<p>This is made up BS to serve the need to divide common people. These aren&#39;t &quot;theories.&quot; These are manipulations. They are common and should be taken apart with facts at every place possible. Mocking deliberate lies is absolutely ok. </p>

<p>There&#39;s an example of this multiple times of day. This one example is less than a few hours old. By the time people respond with facts lots of damage has already been done. It&#39;s all about stopping an honest discussion for the people who spread this BS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m with War Sanchez on this one. I think the pairing of “debunking” and “partisan” is not just odd but disingenuous. If something you claim is legitimately debunked that’s not a partisan thing. It is possible to be proven wrong by someone who believe differently that you, that doesn’t make you any less wrong just because you don’t like the person debunking you.</p>
