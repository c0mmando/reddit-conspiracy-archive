        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>While this sub is progressively getting targeted more and more obviously, and while reddit continues to deteriorate and we all know what those problems entail, there is good news.</p>

<p>First of all, you are all being told you need to be scared of Russian bots and propaganda and blah blah blah. With all of this anxiety pushed onto the Internet community, the truth is there is a simple answer to this problem.</p>

<p>Just ignore the &quot;bots.&quot; (We know they&#39;re shills.)</p>

<p>They employ a variety of strategies that you are probably getting better and better at spotting them. They even push political agendas in subs that have nothing to do with politics.</p>

<p><a href="/u/brokedown">/u/brokedown</a> created <a href="/r/bestofnopolitics">/r/bestofnopolitics</a>, which is amazing because it is automated to remove political content. You can use these tools for the power of good. But, beyond politics I have come across a variety of troubling agendas being pushed even in places like <a href="/r/relationships">/r/relationships</a>. Imagine if someone was always pushing bad advice in places like that through a variety of accounts.</p>

<p>These strategies cost money. <a href="https://upvotes.club">https://upvotes.club</a> is one of many places where you can buy upvotes or downvotes, accounts, comments, submissions, etc. Check it out.</p>

<p>What this means is that if you talk about Pizzagate anywhere on Reddit, someone is paying to disrupt that conversation. So, while you get hate and you get downvotes, you can take comfort in knowing that those were paid for and you are costing someone money... or bitcoin. Notice people are even buying bitcoin positive propaganda and propaganda that is negative to bitcoin. Who is playing on each side of that?</p>

<p>If you really wanted to have fun, you could employ this type of service to upvote Pizzagate evidence directly to the front page for not that much money. In turn, the opposition has no choice but to outspend you. It&#39;s a win-win for reddit and that is why they look the other way.</p>

<p>Another simple strategy that you can employ is just using basic automation tools, like IFTTT. <a href="/u/SpecialAgentRando">/u/SpecialAgentRando</a> decided he wanted to experiment with some of his friends, so they used IFTTT to search RSS feeds to populate places like <a href="/r/FBIWatch">/r/FBIWatch</a>.</p>

<p>What immediately happened is the news adapted and had to start changing the title of their articles because only negative stuff started showing up. I&#39;m sure plenty of people can do better, but I think those subs were created just to illustrate a point.</p>

<p>Certain topics seem to get you banned and I am very curious how much a ban costs.</p>

<p>For example, if you were to go to <a href="/r/exmormon">/r/exmormon</a> and create a detailed list of evidence that supports the truth of the Pace Memorandum, you will get banned. It seems <a href="/r/exmormon">/r/exmormon</a> is controlled opposition and designed to make ex Mormons look like hateful idiots. If you actually start crushing them with evidence that illustrates how the prime LDS families, like the Kimball&#39;s, have been in bed with the Clintons for ages (in the DR, no less) you will get banned.</p>

<p>Recently, in <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>, I learned that detailed posts about Ruben Vardanyan will get you banned. Ruben Vardanyan was appointed by Putin and was involved in paying up to a $100 million into the DNC machine in the time coming up to the election. Between this money and Herb Sandler&#39;s money, we can see that the Russian interference DID OCCUR, but they were supporting Hillary. Plain and simple. </p>

<p>It is very curious that the most vindicating information for <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> users will get you banned. It seems their interests are diametrically opposed to the truth.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I started with the Panama Papers and became very interested in the Uranium One scandal. The Uranium One scandals proves a few very important things that the Internet interference is desperately trying to keep the public from knowing.</p>

<p>1) The news is NOT just in it for the ratings, they are serving an agenda and they do exactly what the FBI, John Podesta and the CIA tell them to do.</p>

<p>2) Pizzagate is real in the sense that the Clintons are involved in human trafficking and you only have to go so far as State Department reports to prove that the Uranium One mines in Kazakhstan are using forced labor and the Glencore connections also involve forced labor, along with VCS mining, Rusoro, etc. FEC records prove that Comet Ping Pong is one of many money laundering nodes that help break down larger sums, so that Ruben Vardanyan &amp; Co can avoid exposure.</p>

<p>3) The intelligence community is likely multi-national, correlated by think takes like Tavistock and coordinated in a very compartmentalized manner where their guiding principle is to control and manipulate &quot;the social dream,&quot; and they are, essentially, legalized organized crime.</p>

<p>4) The amount of media they have infiltrated and taken over is basically everything... movies, tv, the news, the Internet, music, etc. Again it&#39;s compartmentalized for plausible deniability, but as soon as you know how compartmentalization works, it is impossible to deny. Why? Because now you can follow the money without bias.</p>

<p>FOLLOW THE MONEY</p>

<p>Good luck everyone. It&#39;s all going to be okay.</p>

<p>(Oh yeah... and new accounts are blocked not to stop bots... they are used to stop people who were recently banned from coming right back and posting again. The SS was created to slow down posting because it costs too much to just let everyone post tons of contents that need downvotes.)</p>

<p>Reddit has done well in getting interest from the mainstream[.] I just wonder if [...] allowing these children to run rampant and post whatever they feel will cause the most collateral damage. —William Shatner</p>

<h1>Whence the awfulness?</h1>

<p>“”Though Reddit claims to be &quot;the front page of the internet&quot;, it usually hits the news because of its nurturing attitude toward the asinine or the evil. Be it white power, radicalised sexism or advocacy on behalf of gamers (AKA radicalised white power sexism), it&#39;s hard to find a group Reddit&#39;s mods won&#39;t drag their feet about banning.
—Vice.com[6]</p>

<p>In many ways, Reddit represents one of the worst possible results of enormous popularity coupled with an immense and only loosely-connected pile of largely self-governing communities (Take care not to assume a coherence that really isn&#39;t there). A sliver of any site&#39;s traffic will consist of cranks and malcontents; the jaw-dropping amount of traffic that Reddit receives means this subpopulation can number in the thousands or tens/hundreds of thousands. These cranks then either set up their own or join an existing subreddit that supports their ideas, which can (and do) turn into veritable echo chambers for their viewpoints. Any redditor who posts a comment that contradicts the prevailing opinion within any of the nastier subreddits often finds all their comments and posts (which are accessible via their public profile) downvoted across all subreddits in retaliation (the software attempts to counteract this to some extent: if the user downvotes comments on the public profile page itself, these votes are ignored for karma calculation purposes). While not a significant impact by itself, floods of this sort of retaliatory voting can marginalize sensible redditors, not just on the crank subreddit, but across unrelated subreddits as well (though sockpuppet and throwaway accounts cost only a few clicks/keystrokes, so this &quot;problem&quot; is easily manageable).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the site&#39;s structure further encourages the spread of these ideas into any neutral or &quot;good&quot; subreddits; cross-pollination of users and topics between related subreddits can serve to grow and strengthen the various crank communities and drive away more sensible users. Any thread that vaguely touches on crank redditors&#39; hobbyhorses can be swiftly hijacked by a sufficiently large population of cranks voting as a bloc. Subreddit moderators are often too apathetic, incompetent, or afraid of being too aggressive and alienating their own community to take any action, further encouraging crank redditors to continue colonizing other subreddits.[7] This is made worse when moderators across seemingly disparate or only tangentially-related subreddits are sympathetic to these crank ideas and tolerate them, much to the detriment of the community. For example, <a href="/r/ronpaul">/r/ronpaul</a> redditors spread into the <a href="/r/libertarianism">/r/libertarianism</a> subreddit, which then spread into the <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> subreddit, eventually turning Reddit into a particularly noisy fanbase[8] for Paul and Bernie Sanders&#39; presidential campaigns. Russian propaganda outlets such as SputnikNews and RT (not to mention Breitbart) routinely make it onto the front page whenever they are pushing an anti-Clinton or pro-Sanders story.</p>

<h1>Anti-censorship?</h1>

<p>Reddit also has a strong culture (although by no means a universal one) present within it of subreddits opposing any form of moderation, and believing that upvotes and downvotes should be the sole arbiter of whether content is any good in the name of free speech, and that, consequently, any form of active moderation beyond that prescribed by Reddit itself is censorship. This extends to such things as prohibiting harassing content directed at other users, racism, sexism, image macros, rage comics, and other such things; the basic argument is that if these things are really odious, they will be downvoted, and if they aren&#39;t, that means the subreddit&#39;s readers want them there. This rather peculiar form of the just world hypothesis ignores the fact that all evidence available shows that if you have no form of enforced quality bar on an online community, it will quite rapidly become filled with low-effort content, and become subject quite dramatically to the dickwad theory. A demonstration of this can be seen by the stunning quality of strictly-moderated subreddits, such as <a href="/r/AskHistorians">/r/AskHistorians</a> compared to, well, take your pick.</p>

<p>However, this paper-thin veneer of principled free speech breaks down when it comes to anything that might be critical of Reddit or redditors&#39; particular hobbyhorses. For insight, CEO Steve Huffman is a doomsday prepper who frequently attends Burning Man, a yearly gathering for filthy-rich Libertarians in a desert.[9] This might explain why <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> hasn&#39;t been banned yet (or <a href="/r/AltRight">/r/AltRight</a>, or anywhere else where Nazis congregate, dox people, and spread racist propaganda). <a href="/r/Anarcho_Capitalism">/r/Anarcho_Capitalism</a> is just one bad day away from joining them themselves.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, calls are regularly made to close or ban <a href="/r/ShitRedditSays">/r/ShitRedditSays</a>, a subreddit that overall does nothing other than link to examples of what it sees as bigotry across Reddit (and enrage MRAs and racists in the process), and for sites that dare to criticize Reddit on the interwebs, a &quot;shit&quot; icon is coded on many subreddits to appear on any link that directs to them. This includes Cracked and the Satanic blog that starts with a &quot;G&quot; and ends with &quot;r,&quot; as described below.</p>

<h1>RedditRevolt</h1>

<p>In June 2015, Reddit shut down several breathtakingly odious subreddits that were&#39;nt just saying hideous things or brigading other subreddits, but also operating as bases for harassment off-site.[10]. This included the infamous <a href="/r/FatPeopleHate">/r/FatPeopleHate</a> subreddit, which included over 100,000 subscribers prior to its ban, and was, ironically, one of the more censored subreddits on the site, as showing sympathy or empathy towards fat people quickly earned the speaker a warning or a ban. Upset FPH readers proclaimed the Reddit admins a pack of censoring Nazis (also either blaming <a href="/r/ShitRedditSays">/r/ShitRedditSays</a> or demanding its banning as usual[note 1]), and many decamped to Reddit for a newer similarly-structured site named Voat,[11][12], which promptly melted under the load.</p>

<p>Much of the hatred, centered on the hashtag #RedditRevolt, surrounded Reddit&#39;s interim CEO Ellen Pao, whose sexual discrimination lawsuit against her former employer Kleiner Perkins made waves in Silicon Valley. Thus, the Chinese-American feminist in charge of the site was made into a perfect target by Reddit&#39;s &quot;disenfranchised&quot; assholes. In addition to being compared to China&#39;s Cold War dictator Mao Zedong (with the epithet &quot;Chairman Pao&quot;), as well as the usual cries of &quot;Nazi&quot; because a handful of subreddits exclusively formed to harass other people were banned, a petition was made calling for her removal as CEO. All of this was pretty blatant harassment, racism, and sexism levied at her, until a popular Reddit staff member was fired in July 2015, leading to #RedditRevolt&#39;s revitalization as a form of solidarity with the former employee following a voluntary blackout of several Reddit boards. The petition for Pao&#39;s removal surged in popularity, and comment sections across the Internet seemed to think that #RedditRevolt, which had its origins in June, only started in July in response to the firing.[13][14][15] One commentator on a DOTA2 website, of all places, even noticed an obvious connection between the people pushing #RedditRevolt and Gamergate, pointing out that a feminist woman banning hateful communities is everything 4chan could have ever wanted in a controversy.[16]</p>

<p>Pao ultimately resigned from her position during this shitstorm[17] despite the fact that another member of the executive board who was one of the site&#39;s founders was actually responsible for the popular employee&#39;s firing.[18] But the real bombshell comes from former CEO Yishan Wong, who first suggested that Reddit&#39;s co-founder Alexis Ohanian had set Pao up to take the fall for his actions.[19] Reddit&#39;s chief engineer Bethanye Blount also echoed these sentiments when she quit following Pao&#39;s resignation.[20][21] After the new CEO announced an AMA (&quot;ask me anything&quot;) to handle questions about how Reddit was changing with Pao&#39;s departure, Wong appeared again and revealed that Pao was the only member of Reddit&#39;s executive board, who was arguing in favor of all of the website&#39;s most toxic communities. According to Wong, the board had pressured Pao to &quot;outright ban ALL the hate subreddits in a sweeping purge&quot;, but she resisted, knowing it would result in a &quot;shitshow&quot;.</p>

<p>Now that #RedditRevolt had ousted Pao, there was nothing stopping new CEO Steve Huffman from going through with this purge. Wong stated that Huffman had previously confided in him that he would have banned such hateful communities outright.[22] What actually happened was that Huffman decided that all of the terrible communities shouldn&#39;t be banned entirely and instead be put behind registration walls, and within those new walled gardens, they had no advertisements whatsoever. He&#39;s also fully embodied the libertarian hands-off approach; in response to a question concerning the growth of white supremacist subreddit <a href="/r/CoonTown">/r/CoonTown</a> since the new rules were put in place, he responded, &quot;Horrible, actually, but I don&#39;t think you can win an argument by simply silencing the opposition.&quot;[23] Several more subreddits were banned the following week, such as ones for lolicon, but more importantly <a href="/r/CoonTown">/r/CoonTown</a> and its various satellite subreddits;[24] however, these were not banned for being racist, but because they were damaging to Reddit&#39;s reputation.[25] </p>

<h1>Gullibility</h1>

<p>Redditors, like most massive online communities, are known for being particularly gullible and easily sent into a frenzy. As many redditors are &quot;passive content consumers&quot; who only read the title and then upvote or downvote accordingly, without reading or participating in the comments, many posts with extremely misleading or false titles are upvoted to the front page of Reddit. It is common to see a highly upvoted article on the front page, only for the top upvoted comment in the thread to provide a detailed debunking of the article&#39;s claims. Reddit is at least as susceptible as the Twitterati to hoaxes about pet topics like Republicans, marijuana, gun control, Bitcoin, Feminists, workers&#39; rights, and so forth.</p>

<p>In a well-known example, redditors fell for a hoax involving a user named &quot;LucidEnding,&quot; who claimed to be about to use Oregon&#39;s right-to-death laws to perform assisted suicide. After redditors sent him thousands of comments and well-wishes, some users finally discovered his alleged mode of suicide (IV therapy) is not legal in Oregon. In the first of many incidents, Gawker writer Adrian Chen joked that he was behind the LucidEnding profile.[73] </p>

<p>What are you talking about?</p>

<p>The challenger explosion happened in January 1986.</p>

<p>The first news of any Iran-Contra related dealings happened in November 1986.</p>

<p>Congress didn&#39;t being their investigation until January 1987.</p>

<p>Reagan didn&#39;t address the issue until March 1987.</p>

<p>Congress delivered their report in November 1987.</p>

<p>North and Poindexter were indicted in March 1988</p>

<p>North was convicted May 1989.  Poindexter was convicted April 1990.</p>

<p>So are you trying to say that the challenger shuttle was blown up on purpose in order to stop coverage of a story that was nearly a year away from even breaking?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL, no. If you assume I subscribe to RIGHT or LEFT politics or that I voted for trump, you&#39;re basically throwing around baseless accusations.</p>

<p>I&#39;m banned from <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>, btw.</p>

<p>If you gave a shit, you would acknowledge that Podesta received millions from Ruben Vardanyan, the Clinton Foundation received millions from Ruben Vardanyan and that the logical conclusion is that the intelligence community has made the Russian energy sector their black money bitch.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s curious, because I post my sources and you can see them in my history.</p>

<p>Do you care to be more than &quot;all talk&quot; and actually link the evidence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk if trump is controlled opposition or the right is just trying to control the information like usual irregardless of trump being on their side or not. They don&#39;t need trump on their side to distract and burry stories. In fact, they need it even more if trump doesn&#39;t toe the line. I never was a The_Donald regular but I&#39;ve seen the discourse change a lot since the primaries. Much more hostile than it used to be against moderate and berners. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bots are easy, in that they don&#39;t add anything of substance.</p>

<p>When people call you &quot;crazy&quot; but then never address your evidence.</p>

<p>Attempts to cause anxiety, lots of downvoting... they are going after you on an emotional level, but they are bots without emotions, so it is usually obvious.</p>

<p>A lot of them are shills, too, and their primary goal is to associate your truth seeking experience with negative emotions, as opposed to conversing using actual evidence.</p>

<p>Shills are also easy to spot for these same reasons, but usually are better at it.. but not by much. They have a lot of posts they have to be jerks to, in any given day, so they aren&#39;t going to spend too much time on you.</p>

<p>One thing you can do to them is, when they have successfully dragged out your convo so it falls further and further down, go back to the originating comment and edit all of your responses into it, so it isn&#39;t  buried.</p>

<p>Just being positive is about the best way to deal with them, in general, and not falling for the emotional negativity trap. Knowing that it costs money to fight you is helpful in that regard.</p>

<p>If you start employing automation like iFTTT creatively, you can make them spend lots of money. (It doesn&#39;t require any programming knowledge.)</p>

<p>The shuttle explosion put a stop to anyone covering the Iran Contra scandal en masse.</p>

<p>What are you talking about?</p>

<p>The challenger explosion happened in January 1986.</p>

<p>The first news of any Iran-Contra related dealings happened in November 1986.</p>

<p>Congress didn&#39;t being their investigation until January 1987.</p>

<p>Reagan didn&#39;t address the issue until March 1987.</p>

<p>Congress delivered their report in November 1987.</p>

<p>North and Poindexter were indicted in March 1988</p>

<p>North was convicted May 1989.  Poindexter was convicted April 1990.</p>

<p>So are you trying to say that the challenger shuttle was blown up on purpose in order to stop coverage of a story that was nearly a year away from even breaking?</p>

<p>Please explain how the Challenger explosion could even remotely be tied to Iran-Contra.</p>
