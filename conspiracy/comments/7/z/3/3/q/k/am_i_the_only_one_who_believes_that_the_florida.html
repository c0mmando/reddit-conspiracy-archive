    <div class="md"><p>In fairness though, the FBI seemed to have messed this up.  I think they had multiple notifications of suspicious behaviour from this guy, including notification that he actually said he was going to shoot up a school.  Ignoring something so direct is negligent.  The FBI should be held accountable.  It would be one thing if they were too busy to investigate, but the notice wasn&#39;t event sent to the filed office for evaluation.  Again, negligent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was a credible threat. Tbey went to MS to question the Youtuber who alerted them to his comment about wanting to be a professional school shooter, why didn&#39;t they at least question him as well? Then in January, someone who knew him alerted the FBI believing he was an imminent threat. The FBI had credible evidence from multiple sources that the kid was a threat and did nothing. They even admitted they were wrong and did not follow proper protocol. So yes, I believe the FBI should have taken action (it is their job, correct?) and at the very least he should have been interviewed and had a restraining order keeping him away from any school. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This wasn&#39;t about policing words or opinions.  This was about the FBI being notified that this guy literally said &quot;I want to be a school shooter&quot;.  In the same manner as someone who threatens the president online gets investigated by the NSA, the FBI has an obligation to investigate threats of domestic terrorism to determine their credibility.

    <div class="md"><p>I think you need to admit that you comment was misdirected / incorrect.  Your argument makes no sense.  You&#39;re advocating that the FBI shouldn&#39;t act on tips where someone openly states or admits a desire to perpetrate a crime resulting in domestic terrorism, because freedom of speech?  I want to live in a world where agencies responsible for investigating crimes investigate credible threats.  This was exactly such a case with multiple parties notifying the same agency about different issues both pointing to likely violent outcomes.  This is not about investigating someone because of views that are outside the norm.  This is about investigating someone who is making direct threats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue I have is with people on this sub taking any piece of data, no matter how small, and taking huge leaps to prove its a grand conspiracy, vs deducing it from actual evidence.  The hoggs interviews are a PERFECT example.  Does the kid sound coached?  Hell yes he does, and look at his own youtube background and all the people around him to coach him.  Of course he wants to turn this into a self aggrandising platform to develop his brand.  But that doesn&#39;t come close to making him.a planted agent or crisis actor.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m looking at it from the perspective of how does the father being retired from an agency make it more or less likely that his son is a crisis actor?

<p>Obviously you are not, because the answer to that question is a resounding YES.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It would actually be more suspicious to NOT announce it and then for people to dig and expose it. And any three letter agency would obviously know that and consider it when creating their playbook. So again, your logic is completely wrong. </p>
