It says on the information label of anti depressants that it can cause suicidal thoughts and when guns are are easily accessible, really? Any wonder why these things happen. You can&#39;t take all the guns out of America, don&#39;t you think criminals will find away to keep their guns and make life a nightmare for innocents? If not, guns will be trafficked in from Mexico using underground tunnels. Question big Pharma and why they&#39;re escaping blame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people refuse to think about this.  </p>

<p>Why is no one asking why there are people walking around that <em>want</em> to kill random strangers?  </p>

<p>Think about that mindset.  Of wanting to kill people you don&#39;t even know.  It&#39;s very fucking bizarre.   </p>

<p>It has to do with a total lack of <em>connection</em> to your fellow man.  To feel so alone and alienated from every other human that you view the entire rest of humanity as the enemy, and that in your final act you will show them all.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t give a fuck what you say - if you take away all the guns and still have a society that produces people like that you still have a problem.  </p>

<p>I think there is a real metaphor with psychiatric medications.  They don&#39;t cure the problem, they cover the symptoms.  That seems to be out societies approach to everything.  </p>

<p>There is a growing body of data linking mental health to diet and nutrition. Where are the discussions on the obesity epidemic? Where are the infographics detailing the hundreds of thousands of obesity-related deaths each year? Where are the heated arguments about the food and drink industry lying to consumers, knowingly addicting consumers to sugar? We ban cigarette advertisers... Why are we marketing pop tarts to fucking toddlers?</p>

<p>Nope. Gun control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m relieved I’m not alone in this thought...why someone goes into a school and shoots children is where the focus needs to lie. There was obviously a trigger (or many) that led them there. We need a complete overhaul using a short term loss, long term gain perspective. </p>

<p>Giving guns to teachers so they can shoot the student who’s currently failing...bullied... or someone who may have had a traumatic experience at school...whatever the reason they had a reason and they will continue to find reasons. Our systems suck. They are meant to repress.</p>

<p>I work in end of life care and I can tell you the system is designed to kill us, if it’s not through chemical restraint, it’s shootings. In either case is human against human to distract from the root cause of these expressions of suffering. </p>

<p>At high school age it is in our development to experience an identity crisis in order to find our place within society. If we cannot find ourselves within this world, which can happen when we perceive the future as limited, we experience confusion and a weak sense of self. Added pressure to this crisis in any means is known to trigger acts of rebellion.</p>

<p>But hey, that theory was developed 50+ years ago and look where we are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is that so? What about soldiers killing enemy combatants?</p>

<p>Different subject, you say? Not quite. He had swastikas and &quot;I hate niggers&quot; on his back, the hate speech on Instagram, and other clues that he was harboring certain popular viewpoints we&#39;re all well aware of. </p>

<p>The students in his school are 40% Jewish, one of the main groups people in those circles consider to be an enemy. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too much of a leap to say he felt he was just a soldier deciding to take out some of the liberals he hates so much.</p>

<p>To answer the question none of the other posters could be bothered to research, the mental illnesses he had were autism, depression, and ADHD.</p>

<p>Are we to regulate people with these conditions? In that case, we may as well go round up all of the regular 4chan posters and put them in mental hospitals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, I misread the comment as confirming I&#39;m mentally ill. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think people who kill people are automatically mentally ill, especially when they have an agenda that designates certain people as their enemies.</p>

<p>Are suicide bombers all crazy? Atheists would argue that religion is in fact mental illness but I don&#39;t think that arguement would really fly in America and by that logic we&#39;d have to disarm all the religious people in case their leaders start telling them to kill sinners, sodomities, infidels, etc.</p>

<p>Are soldiers crazy? PTSD is certainly common after the fact but I don&#39;t think killing your country&#39;s enemies is crazy at all.</p>

<p>White nationalists were responsible for the majority of extremist killings in America last year, a huge jump in a number that had been steadily growing. Are they all crazy? I don&#39;t think so at all. I think they have an insidious agenda that&#39;s been fermenting in manners very similar to radical Islam and other hate movements but mental illness is a cop-out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wanting to kill our enemies is very much human nature. A lot of these mass shootings play into that theme very nicely. The self-hating gay Muslim who did the Pulse shooting, bullied kids who shoot up schools, /pol/-posterchild shooters who target ethnic groups. </p>

<p>The caveman desire to destroy our perceived opponents is natural. We go against our nature when we learn to coexist with people who we feel are our enemies. I don&#39;t see how going with the evolutionary flow constitutes mental illness and the data seems to agree since studies show that the mentally ill are more likely to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you’re saying and it’s a good point but I would say that it’s their perception that would constitute them as being mentally ill and while wanting to commit the act makes sense in a primal instinct kind of way; we are no longer cavemen and have evolved past that somewhat and are capable of more complex thinking. </p>

<p>I know mental illness can put you in a position where you are more likely to be a victim but that doesn’t mean that you don’t have a higher chance of lashing out with violence. I would say it makes you more likely but I don’t have any sources to back that up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The studies that have been done don&#39;t show mental illness as an effective predictor of violent behavior.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318286/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318286/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;d like to see improvements to our mental health system because I feel too many people in America suffer needlessly and it puts a strain on loved ones who are unequipped to deal with it. It has little to nothing to do with gun violence though.</p>

<p>Japan and South Korea have some of the highest suicide rates in the world. If the Republican talking points were accurate those countries would blow us out of the water in murder suicides. Then we look at the guns they possess per person (we have 100 times more) and it starts to come together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I realize that as somebody who suffers from mental illness myself. I’m just saying that mass shooters are clearly showing some sort of deviant behavior that will cause them to do such a thing. This coupled with America’s gun culture and our culture in general is what causes this to be a problem mostly unique to America in my opinion. Ease of access to weapons definitely doesn’t help either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you making excuses for mass murder?</p>

<p>Yes mental health is the main issue, but, as everyone knows, a driven person will achieve their goals one way or another. </p>

<p>Getting access to any kind of firearm in the USA is a piece of piss. Legally and illegally. </p>

<p>Without some kind of regulation or reform to reduce the amount of guns stolen from homes, these kind of events will not stop.</p>

<p>Ps- Replying that you are responsible for your arsenal does not account for those who do not and are not held to a higher standard of safety. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it easier to steal a firearm when it is locked in a safe or when it is tucked away under a bed, hanging on a wall or somewhere else convenient? </p>

<p>I own a firearm, approve of qualified people owning firearms and served in the army where I represented my regiment in shooting competitions.</p>

<p>When the vast majority of firearm crimes are made with stolen firearms and the mentally ill it makes sense to act accordingly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly, our mental health care in the U.S. is in dire need of reform. I work at an ER where we have to house mental health patients in restricted ER rooms for weeks due to a lack of psych inpatient beds. We currently have a 12 year old who, despite heavy medication, has been in and out of restraints for 2 weeks! Everyone who works here FUCKING hates this ongoing situation that doesn’t appear to have a solution. Many of these patients talk openly about their firearms when frustrated. I have shared my concerns with LE who bring many of them. LE has the same concerns but can only seize weapons from non felons under limited circumstances. The NRA says they want firearms out of the hands of the mentally ill but has not even suggested any legislation to do so.</p>
