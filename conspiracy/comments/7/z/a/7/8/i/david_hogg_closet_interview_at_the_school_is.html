<p>he clearly says &quot;2:32pm&quot;, but there&#39;s a huge move to claim that he says &quot;9:32&quot;.  The amount of effort being put into this is absolute insanity.. they want to plant false conspiracy theories everywhere they can to discredit the real evidence.  Don&#39;t fall for the 9:32 bullshit (I almost did until i dug deeper)... and always download precious youtube videos if you think they will be scrubbed (just google &quot;youtube to video download and you will see many free services that do this)..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I’m not trying to start an argument but how specifically is it bullshit? Look at the dates these videos were posted. The 9:30 video was posted on the 14th to YouTube, and the 2:50 video was posted yesterday (6 days later). They are obviously filmed on different devices and they both claim that they are hiding in a closet. The second video claims to be filmed directly after the incident and the first video implies that it was in the middle of or directly after a shooting.</p>

<p>So what, might I ask, is so ridiculously fake that you claim it to be “bullshit”? I do agree that the yearbook was in fact bullshit by the way. But you have to admit that there is something really strange about not only the timing of the PM video being posted almost a week after the 9:30 video, and in the midst of extreme skepticism revolving around everything David Hogg.</p>

<p>This shouldn’t matter but for the record, I believe there was a shooting which resulted in the tragic deaths of innocent people. The reason for this shooting is still undetermined (call it a crazy kid or a false flag, I don’t know or care). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m going based off the video linked above my comment. It’s audio only. There’s no indication of where the interview took place. There’s no indication of them hiding in the closet during the audio interview. He just says 9:30.

    <div class="md"><p>In the video you’re referencing they claim to be in a closet hiding because of an active shooter. “Alex” says “...because if you looked around this <em>closet</em> and saw everyone hiding together...” she specifically mentions they are hiding in a closet at school and then discusses people’s ability to access guns highly implying that they are either in the midst of an active shooter drill/or actual shooting. Did you watch the entire thing and actually listen/read to what the girl named “Alex” was saying in the video? It was literally one of the first things she says.</p>

<p>I’ll try to find the original video to give you an exact time it was posted to YouTube but honestly don’t hold your breath. YouTube is trying their best to scrub it off the web so it’s likely you’ll only see a repost. I know that’s a typical shill or shitty “conspiracy” thing to say but that’s just the reality of the situation right now. </p>

<p>The article is just wrong. It&#39;s that simple. He edited an interview from during the shooting and later in the day with two different girls together and nothjng about it is really fishy. I don&#39;t even understand the reasoning behind this conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so here is the full context of the <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article200277689.html">Miami Herald</a> report/video I posted as my first Edit:</p>

<p>David Miles Hogg is the kid that&#39;s been everywhere lately. He recorded the video in which he interviews a girl by the name of Alex(andria aparently). In this video they explicitly state they are hiding in a closet in fear for their lives, and it is heavily <em>implied</em> that they are hiding in said closet due to an active shooter. It is believed that in this same video, David Miles Hogg introduces the girl (Alex) and states that it is <a href="https://twitter.com/RealWednesdayy/status/966373501505449984">&quot;...it&#39;s currently 9:32...&quot;</a>. </p>

<p>There are very two important notes that need to be established (which I thought I did in my OP but I digress); 1. Both videos are HIGHLY edited. 2. We only have these two versions of the video. </p>

<p>The first point is important because we can&#39;t really establish a distinct time frame due to the editing of both videos, and the second in important because of who owns the rights to the video.</p>

<p>I would like to introduce you to a company called Storyful. If you read my 4th edit you will see more details on that company, and what their mission is as a media company. Essentially they buy viral social media for distribution as &quot;real news&quot; (as apposed to &quot;fake news&quot;), and they &quot;fact-check&quot; this media for other news outlets, specifically the MSM.</p>

<p>Storyful owns the rights to the Miami Herald video, which I will now refer to the &quot;9:30&quot; video. By looking at the originally posted video by Storyful on their YouTube channel (look at my 4th edit to view the channel), they have edited the video, as seen by the words &quot;EDITED&quot; at the bottom of the description. You need to understand what is happening here. Storyful is actively showing the world the &quot;EDITED&quot; video (which they fully own) that only shows the &quot;interview&quot; and removes the time distinction by David Miles Hogg which is &quot;9:32&quot;. Storyful is also working with companies like Google, YouTube, FaceBook, and Twitter to suppress any other videos by claiming them to be &quot;fake news&quot;. It&#39;s literally what their company does to make money. It is how they exist. This isn&#39;t a made up thing, google &quot;Storyful&quot; and see for yourself.</p>

<p>Now enter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUJBjEbR0k">this video from the OOP</a>. This is a video of David [Miles] Hogg hiding due to an active shooting. It begins with David explaining the situation and claiming that it is &quot;2:52 PM&quot;. I will now be referring to this video as the &quot;2:52&quot; video. After the announcement of the time by David [Miles] Hogg, the video cuts to the interview from the &quot;9:30&quot; video. You should note that the &quot;2:52&quot; video has a hard cut, and then has an overlay of the girls name as &quot;Isabelle Robinson&quot; (around the 0:31 mark). This is another HIGHLY edited video. One really significant piece of information that you should also be aware of is that the &quot;2:52&quot; video was posted on February 20, 2018. The &quot;9:30&quot; video was posted on February 15, 2018.</p>

<p>What we don&#39;t know:</p>

<p>Who is the girl being interviewed in the &quot;9:30&quot; video, and at the ~31 second mark of the &quot;2:52&quot; video? Is her name Isabelle Robinson, or is it Alex(andria)? It is important to know because we potentially have either the Miami Herald getting it wrong (which means Storyful did) or we have a second edited video (the &quot;2:52&quot; video) being floated around claiming to be something that it isn&#39;t. The second point is really important because the &quot;2:52&quot; video was posted 5 days later, is highly edited, and comes in the midst of David [Miles] Hogg&#39;s character coming into question from the highest level. There&#39;s a strong argument to be made that David [Miles] Hogg created the &quot;2:52&quot; video (or at least the beginning of it) days after the event took place. I&#39;m not saying that happened but this is the sub for speculation so there you have it. It is clear that both videos were taken on different devices, and even the later part (after the &quot;Isabelle&quot; interview) of the &quot;2:52&quot; video seems to be taken on a different device.</p>

<p>Obviously I could be wrong but the fact remains you have one edited video posted on the 15th claiming to be an interview explicitly stated to be in a closet and heavily implied to be during the shooting, and one edited video posted on the 20th explicitly claiming to be during the shooting, which then cuts to an even more edited version of the video posted on the 15th which again heavily implies to be taken place during the shooting.</p>

<p>Her&#39;s the TL;DR that I know someone will be looking for:</p>

<p>Three videos in question, all have roughly the same content and are all based on the same video. All are highly edited, all show something different.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/RealWednesdayy/status/966373501505449984">Video 1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8luXbglTaw&amp;amp;time_continue=1&amp;amp;app=desktop">Video 2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUJBjEbR0k">Video 3</a></li>
</ol>

<p>The content in video 2, some of video 1, and half of video 3 are owned by a company called Storyful who&#39;s business is basically &quot;fact-checking&quot; viral social media for companies like Google and Facebook. They have an algorithm which determines what is &quot;fake&quot; and what is &quot;real&quot; (by their own admission) so who knows what that even means. Also, they&#39;re owned by a company called News Corp (I know, I know).</p>

<p>All three videos are highly edited (obviously) but for what purpose exactly is debatable. Storyful has some kind of rights to the video in video 2 (distribution or otherwise) so they can fully edit the video for any reason or no reason at all. Video 1 shows the same contents as video 2, but with additional content and with an explicit time statement from David [Miles] Hogg of 9:32. It is claimed that this is when the video interview took place, which is hours before the shooting. </p>

<p>Video 3 however attempts to claim that the video was recorded at &quot;2:52 PM&quot;. The problem is this video was posted 5 days after video 2, and is just a recording of David [Miles] Hogg, then a hard cut to the contents of video 2. We currently have no idea when video 1 was originally posted, but we do know it was some time after video 2, and days before video 3.</p>

<p>So realistically what we are looking at is video 2 was posted IN FULL. Video 1 was created and posted showing the additional contents of the now edited video 2. Several days later (amidst huge backlash and strife between this kid/the media, and the public) video 3 is posted with a new time stamp, a hard cut to edited video 2 contents, and then another cut to Hogg. It is my opinion that video 2 actually contains an edited out part where Hogg says &quot;its 9:32&quot; , but was removed because it goes against the narrative (obviously, how could he make a video during the shooting if it hadn&#39;t happened yet?). I also believe that video 3 was created a few days ago (20th to be exact) in order to show Hogg saying &quot;2:52PM&quot; and discredit anyone bringing up the fact that video 2 was highly edited. You don&#39;t have to believe this, but I do.</p>

<p>Sorry for the ridiculously long comment, I should have just created my own post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t really understand everything you said, but My single question is this,  is there any reason to believe that the 9:32 segment was not at 9:32 PM the day of the shooting, after he rode his bike back to the school to get interviews?  I don&#39;t see what the whole mystery is here if so..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok there was 2 videos: 1 where he says “9:32” and 1 where he says “2:53”. The “9:32” video was sold to a company named Storyful, and the posted an edited version on YouTube but they edited out the part where he says “9:32”. Then, a few days later there was a huge shit story about this video because he said it was “9:32” but the shooting was at 2:something, so there was a second video where he explicitly says it’s “2:53”. The point is the second video was posted days after the first, and was posted in the midst of huge skepticism because it claimed to be hours before the actual shooting. </p>

<p>If it’s true that it was 9:32 PM, then that’s even worse because they claim (in the unedited version) that they were on lockdown due to a school shooting. How could he have gone home, got his stuff, and came back hours later, and been “on lockdown” in the 9:32 video, if the event had already taken place and was over? That’s called a staged video. </p>

<p>So no matter how you look at it, one of the videos (or all of them?) is staged. It’s up to you to decide but the original video ever posted claims things that simply don’t add up. That was the point of my post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I’ll see what I can dig up but my OP that you originally replied to was essentially detailing how an original copy doesn’t exist on YouTube or any source that I could find because it had been edited by Storyful, redistributed (by the same people), and then all other versions were scrubbed from the main video sources. I would be willing to bet money that because Storyful owned the rights to the video, they likely threatened YouTube and the like with lawsuits if they allowed posts of the full video, so you’ll be very hard pressed to find an original video. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>true, but I&#39;m hopeful that there are people out there who downloaded the original video and still have it,  I am not a part of any conspiracy-theorist community or anything, so I wouldn&#39;t know who/where to ask, but you seem like a veteran in the game. Anyway I don&#39;t think a original copy is really necessary because you can still hear the same audio of the commotion in the back of the room and the guy talking on the phone,  but an un-cut video would still could be nice.  thanks for the information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man thanks for the sentiment but I’m not even close to being a veteran. Actually the only conspiracy stuff I look at is ok this sub and I came here after the Vegas shooting almost by accident and fell into the warm hole! Stick around long enough and you will too! Seriously though you’re right, we don’t need the full unedited version of the video. And I’ve looked everywhere for a copy of the uncut video with absolutely no luck. There was actually a video posted here maybe a week ago that had the uncut version, and then other stuff spliced in but I didn’t get a chance to save it because it would have been nice to have. </p>

<p>No problem on the info, this is really the biggest conspiracy I’ve looked into this deep because I was really fascinated by the story and the more I looked the weirder it got, especially with the whole Storyful aspect of it. Anyway, happy hunting out there and if you dig up anything good that you’re interested in feel free to post. I mainly browse new content on this sub because it gets heavily brigaded when political stuff gets posted so watch out for that!</p>
