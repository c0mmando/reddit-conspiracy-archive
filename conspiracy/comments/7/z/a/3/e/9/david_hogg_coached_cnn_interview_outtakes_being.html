It was everywhere this morning, YouTube has been blowing it up due to &quot;violence&quot; and &quot;bullying&quot; reasons. Which are bullshit of course.</p>

<p>Anybody get it? You can post it on DTube or DailyMotion. At least you can for now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I tried out for voice-acting  lessons, the first bad habit I was told to stop doing was saying &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; when I would mess the line up. I was told to just compose myself, and try it again, because the recording was constant and studio time is expensive. This interview sounds like roughly-rehearsed lines. His reactions are very similar to the reactions I first had in the studio. These are not words generated by his own thoughts. He is thinking about how to say these things to produce a desired outcome, just like voice actors. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what my experience has to say anyways. And no, I am NOT a professional voice-actor. I have had training though.</p>

<p>There is zero evidence his &quot;lines&quot; were fed to him by anyone. Apologizing for messing up what you were saying isn&#39;t evidence of that either, only evidence that he messed up what he wanted to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me get this straight. </p>

<p>TPBP (but they&#39;re not Republicans or Trump) were able to fake a kid&#39;s entire existence in a major American public high school, keeping it a secret despite needing possibly hundreds of people involved, orchestrated a massive fake school shooting, and yet their planted operatives aren&#39;t even capable of doing a simple TV appearance without flaking out? Not only that, TPBP are then incapable of preventing these flubbed interviews from making it on the air? </p>

<p>Did you ever think maybe if it was a fake shooting that the president, Senate and Congress might be complicit? After every shooting gun sales go up and so does interest in domestic security, which means more money for domestic security contracts, which is essentially a function of the MIC.</p>

Got it thanks, I&#39;m rubber your glue...if you are really half as confused as you seem you could always go back and read my examples of hypothetical arguments that I put forth to play devils advocate for your own short sighted and condescending contentions, because you feigned as if you were too &quot;dumb&quot; to even think of a hypothetical counter to your own comment. At least I hope you were feigning dumb. if not I refer to my original response to you. Of course, that may confuse you even more. Otherwise, does it really seem like I&#39;m the one pulling shit from a shill handbook when comparing our opposing comments? Really, really? Again, you&#39;re the one stuck in the box so bad you seam to be unable to even play hypothetical devil&#39;s advocate, which is something people do while exercising their brains for debates all the time even if they don&#39;t agree with the hypo contentions they are putting forth. I was making hypothetical devil&#39;s advocate arguments simply for the fact your comment was short sighted and ignorant and had nothing to do with Ops contentions here and because we&#39;re in a damn conspiracy sub and u played dumb. At best, you came in here for no reason other than to call people dumb and virtue signal, as if there is no better activity for you to engage in anywhere to be found on Reddit or the internet as a whole or anywhere else for that matter. I&#39;m here cause I genuinely enjoy the conversation and theories or hypothesis&#39;s presented and I&#39;m doing other stuff in real life so I&#39;m just popping in and out to keep my brain occupied between real world tasks.

<p>I do not believe this is a fake shooting. But to play devil&#39;s advocate:</p>

<p>First of all, who said that? Not Op. </p>

<p>Secondly, did you maybe think that if this was a set-up that it could have been done to boost gun sales and domestic security contracts? Because that has actually happened after ever major mass-shooting I can remember. </p>

<p>&quot;..which TBTB have been mysteriously unable to do even though the vast majority of the population is in favor of tighter gun control.&quot;</p>

<p>The vast majority of the population are in favor of a lot of things that don&#39;t happen because donor money speaks louder than votes. A good example would be that I&#39;m pretty sure the majority of the population wanted Hillary to be queen and we all know how that turned out. Marijuana decriminalization is another good example. The list goes on and on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe anything you claim people here believe wholesale is true in this case from the little I know about it. That is to say, I do not think school shootings are live action &quot;plays&quot; or that the shootings are fake. But if you think that hypothetical operations of this size are impossible in a country this big with as many people as hate Trump and guns right now, or, depending on what angle you take, as many people who could profit from an increase in the domestic security apparatus, you are a bit under-researched. Maybe go find some old documentaries on WW2 and some of the huge fake-outs we put on the Germans. That should lead into some of the massive operations and coups the OSS and CIA have pulled in other people&#39;s countries after WW2, during the cold war. It could be argued we pulled covert operations and fake outs much larger than what you are scoffing at when we helped the Germans knock down the Berlin Wall. That was done from the inside out in Communist controlled Berlin for Christ sake. Our spooks have pulled coups and toppled governments all over the world in some of the most highly regulated societies that ever existed, including the former U.S.S.R. many middle-eastern countries, communist Vietnam, communist Korea and so on.</p>

<p>If you think it&#39;s beyond possible, you&#39;re flat out wrong. If you think they won&#39;t make mistakes you&#39;re wrong there too.</p>

<p>I have no reason to believe there were no deaths, but by using the moment of confusion, and having officers restricit access to where the victims supposedly for example are, for example, I&#39;d you can sell a narrative or shooting in said fashion.

<p>The more likely situation is that we love looking for something in everything. Because it seems like most things that have been happening recently are fishy or have several things that don&#39;t seem to make sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. First off, I do <strong>not</strong> believe that the government is killing children to push gun control. Though you may think it is the exact same, I believe that it is <em>definitely a possibility</em> that they are manipulating troubled kids (i.e. Nikolas Cruz) and potentially setting them up to do these things.</p>

<p>Secondly, I sincerely apologize for &quot;spewing such filth&quot;, though I cannot recall where I did such a thing. I am simply asking questions and telling peope what I believe. It shouldn&#39;t be my fault if somebody takes offense to it. I advise that they (and you) provide evidence that either support my claim or disprove it, instead of calling me a bad person.</p>

<p>Third, I can&#39;t seem to find anywhere that I called anybody a liar or a shill. I never said that nobody died. I never said that the families are actors. I never said that it was a hoax. I am, however, saying that it could have been set up or influenced by 3rd parties (or is that the filth that you&#39;re referring to?). </p>

<p>And lastly, I am not a part of the people that do believe that these people are shills/trolls/whatever you want to call them. All that I am doing is announcing things that I personally noticed about these situations.</p>

<p>I agree that people shouldn&#39;t be at risk of being killed at school. I agree that people shouldn&#39;t be afraid of going anywhere. I <em>disagree</em> with your accusations. I <em>disagree</em> with the notion that these issues are caused by guns. And I <em>disagree</em> with the way that the media portray these events.</p>

<p>I could either conclude this with &quot;fuck you&quot; or &quot;I respect and thank you for your input. I appreciate your feedback.&quot; You choose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Violence&quot;? Can you explain? What sort of violence happened to the kid?</p>

<p>&quot;Bullying&quot;? Pointing out he was coached is valid, since he makes such a big deal on Anderson Cooper that he wasn&#39;t. That his dad is FBI? That&#39;s also important for Americans to know. I could go on, but I won&#39;t, because I don&#39;t believe you to be an honest participant in this subreddit. </p>

<p>It might be valid if anyone had actually done that. All they&#39;ve shown is a kid struggling to speak on live TV after a school shooting, and then spread the story that he was coached or fed lines without any evidence to back that up.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve also left out the part where people were accusing him of being a crisis actor for the sin of going on vacation once.</p>

<p>Of course there&#39;s more to it than that. </p>

<p>You left off the part about his dad being FBI, the FBI fucking up the Cruz watch, how this happened in DWS&#39;s district, all the shadiness around Sheriff Israel, how this kid Hogg is EVERYWHERE, how it&#39;s only the anti-gun kids who get on TV, how so many of the interviews with these kids sound scripted, how nobody calls Hogg on being a member of the school&#39;s theater clique as he says &quot;I&#39;m not an actor,&quot; how CNN scripted questions for their bullshit town hall last night, how this whole thing is a giant orchestrated garbage programming fear fest. </p>

<p>But you go on debunking a conspiracy sub. You shouldn&#39;t even be here. Your thoughts are shallow and knee-jerk TMOR crap. I&#39;m blocking you. Ciao.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to quick to hostility. Sensitive?</p>

<p>But really it is absolutely bullying. The poster in the description was accusing him of being an actor. The comments were filled with people ganging up on him and insulting him, calling him a liar, and just shit behavior in general. I could go on but you obviously have no intention of accepting any view point that doesn&#39;t adhere to your theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is this anykind of proof of acting? These news channels fake a shit everyday to get a more emotial reaction from viewers while reporting on news that actually happened. How is it so hard to belive they wanted to get the story straight and practice before doing a shot in order to get a good interview</p>

<p>Could someone tell me what other &quot;evidence&quot; there is on Hogg? Ive seen the surf video and that he went to highschool in california. Anything else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So it&#39;s opposite day again? Got it thanks, I&#39;m rubber your glue...if you are really half as confused as you seem you could always go back and read my examples of hypothetical arguments that I put forth to play devils advocate for your own short sighted and condescending contentions, because you feigned as if you were too &quot;dumb&quot; to even think of a hypothetical counter to your own comment. At least I hope you were feigning dumb. if not I refer to my original response to you. Of course, that may confuse you even more. Otherwise, does it really seem like I&#39;m the one pulling shit from a shill handbook when comparing our opposing comments? Really, really? Again, you&#39;re the one stuck in the box so bad you seam to be unable to even play hypothetical devil&#39;s advocate, which is something people do while exercising their brains for debates all the time even if they don&#39;t agree with the hypo contentions they are putting forth. I was making hypothetical devil&#39;s advocate arguments simply for the fact your comment was short sighted and ignorant and had nothing to do with Ops contentions here and because we&#39;re in a damn conspiracy sub and u played dumb. At best, you came in here for no reason other than to call people dumb and virtue signal, as if there is no better activity for you to engage in anywhere to be found on Reddit or the internet as a whole or anywhere else for that matter. I&#39;m here cause I genuinely enjoy the conversation and theories or hypothesis&#39;s presented and I&#39;m doing other stuff in real life so I&#39;m just popping in and out to keep my brain occupied between real world tasks. What are you really doing here?</p>

<p>Maybe you go about this in civil ways, but others do not. Who knows, one of your &quot;insightful&quot; theories could drive one of these people to threaten a family, or worse. Not worth it. But you&#39;re right, we have very different opinions. And values, it seems. </p>
