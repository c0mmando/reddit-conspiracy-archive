       I'm not a contributing member of this sub but I read it all the time. I just want to comment on the nature of every school shooting and how they're treated here. We have access to more information, faster, from more sources than ever before. The day of a shooting anywhere in this country, we have a thousand voices available, giving disparate, fractured accounts. It's easier than ever to piece this information together however you want when you have a preconceived notion and agenda, from any side. In the parkland shooting, there were hundreds of kids, teachers, law enforcement, local authorities and FBI involved. There always are, and rarely are these people calling any part of the official account into question. You could say they are in on it, or don't question the account, but I would venture they believe it because they see it. The things we don't. The bodies, the scared kids, the background reports on this McDonald triad positives problem child ex-student with a history and reports from fellow students that he would do exactly what he did. Why you people tend to find it easier to believe that there is a massive governmental cover-up over there being one sick kid who bought a gun, as has happened several times before, I don't understand. Agree to disagree, but give the kids the same right. Agree to disagree with their politics, argue their demands aren't justified, but don't call them crisis actors and tell them they didn't experience what they claim, because to be honest, you're insane and wrong. This sub will always grab whatever broken information becomes available and glue it together in a David Icke-esque saga, but in order to not discredit yourself and give you a chance to find
       <em>
        the real fucked up shit going on in this world that you can uncover,
       </em>
       stop being irrational and down-vote silencing anyone who tries to point out your nonsense for what it is.

       The shooting lasted six minutes,[15] after which Cruz abandoned his rifle on the 3rd floor of the building and left the scene by blending in with fleeing students. He walked to a Walmart, where he purchased a soda at its Subway restaurant. He then walked to a McDonald's and lingered before leaving on foot at 3:01.[6] At about 3:40 p.m., he was stopped by a police officer in Coral Springs—two miles from the school—and taken into custody without incident.[16][1][17] He was taken to a hospital emergency room with "labored breathing",[note 3] released after 40 minutes, then booked into the Broward County Jail.[4][18]
      </p>
      <p>
       School surveillance cameras confirmed Cruz as the perpetrator.[19][20]
She didn't ever claim to hear shots while she was with cruz.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Musil‏: Oh, you think he was not the only one?
Student: No, definitely not.
Musil‏: Why do you say that?
Student: Because when shots were fired, I saw him after the fact, so the shots were coming from the other part of the building, so there definitely had to be two shooters involved, I believe.

       I don't know, there's obviously a massive investigation and we have to get the reports because I wasn't there. I do know there's almost always reports of multiple shooters in these situations, going back to before columbine. It seems likely that there were hundreds of kids rapidly sharing what they personally heard and seen, what they'd been told other's had heard and seen, and what they thought was happening. it's very confusing to piece this all together and although the vast majority of information might coincide perfectly people latch onto the sparse details that allow inference or outright contradict the narrative. I believe the authorities can and should investigate every single detail they can, every possibility. I also have confidence that I'mm not smarter than the thousands of people involved, investigating this. it's easy to interpret things the way we want but I personally believe the many, many reports yet to come out will be more accurate than anything I would make up right now just to have a narrative set in my head. Also, do you know how to paragraph on Reddit? I'll google it now...

       I am always weary of anyone who tries to discourafe the free flow of information and this is no exception. People need to brainstorm ideas and in order to do that some really shitty ones are going to have to fly out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important for people to put ideas up for critique. It helps everyone involved. You could silence all ideas with the reasoning that it turns other people off because people will dismiss whatever they don't want to believe anyway.

       I'm one of the people who downvotes the telescreen-believers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me explain myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The telescreen is a known liar. It lied about
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmfVs3WaE9Y">
        Nayirah
       </a>
       for just one example. All of the actors involved got away with it. The telescreen knows it can lie and it knows the lemming masses will, with rare exception, believe whatever they are told by the telescreen.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why I downvote you. For defending a known liar, like a battered partner defending their abuser.

       I don't have television. The several hundred people there who saw it, I believe. The thousands now involved in investigating the evidence, compiling the story and reporting the case to a judge, I believe. Not much benefit to believing television is a single-minded, sentient being, in my opinion, I just don't see a logical reason to assume the story isn't true, and no one has yet given one here, other than calling a survivor a liar because of his father's occupation. doesn't make sense.

       In this day and age, there are literally surveillance cameras everywhere AND everyone has a camera at their fingertips, especially high school kids. Yet actual footage of “certain events” either never seems to exist OR, worse - is sealed or deemed CLASSIFIED with no further explanation.

       I don't believe you have the right to see innocent children get murdered. We get more than enough information to prove these cases, over and over. It will never be enough for someone who believes it's all a lie. Demanding photos of dead children in Sandy Hook is pretty despicable, in my opinion. We got footage of Harris and Klebold, and the Tzarnaev brothers, maybe they'll release footage of Cruz. If they don't, fine, I don't think we're entitled to it. They need to prove his guilt to a judge, not you or I.

       The several hundred people who witnessed it. The thousands who saw the bodies, the reports about cruz's past, the impact on the victims, their children. I find it easier to believe this was the act of 1 person, not the concerted effort thousands to do...what? fake the entire thing for a gun control bill? why? It's an incredible set of mental gymnastics to make cover-up more believable than lone gunman, because no one here is pointing out something that doesn't add up, just that they don't believe it. The next time this happens, let me go ahead and guess the reaction...fake. I love conspiracy theories, and I used to read this sub for hours, but it seems everyone here wants to find contrived theories more than they want the truth.

       Where are the reports of several hundred people who witnessed it? Any proof of witnesses to Cruz comitting the crime? Who are the thousands who saw the bodies? Where are you getting this information from? It doesn't take mental gymnastics to see the reoccurring themes and patterns that consistently pop up each time one of these events occur. It does take mental gymnastics to ignore them and to believe everything as reported by proven liars in the MSM.

       No one is "obliged" to believe anything and if there's one thing that really disinclines the public to believe what the authorities maintain it's when all of the standard procedures that are as predictable as night following day whenever a major crime gets committed, investigated, and followed up in the media all suddenly no longer apply in any way, shape or form to one that is already a highly unusual mess of conflicting and contradicting facts that no one seems to be certain about.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what about this entirely new phenomenon of some goddamned "drill taking place" at the same time as the majority of all of these so called "terrorist acts" suddenly taking place, not just in the US but elsewhere?
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the explanation for that? Why has none been forthcoming?
      </p>
      <p>
       And lest we forget it was 9/11 and the drills that saw the Air Force stand down and that brought FEMA to New York on the morning of that one
       <em>
        before it happened
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And that of course kicked off the great and pressing need for all these other drills that just happened to turn into the real deal too many, in fact in almost every time there was an incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what you saw with Sandy Hook, but I didn't see anything that struck me as being credible. In fact it was all incredible.
      </p>
      <p>
       How could I be more shocked about it than the people that it presumably happened to?
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's the reality that the vast majority of us wound up asking ourselves about it. You think any normal parent doesn't know that they'd be emotionally destroyed and in a state of shock too severe to say anything at all if their child was ever killed in a situation like that?
      </p>
      <p>
       But to calmly stand around less than 24hrs later and nonchalantly allow themselves to be interviewed about it without batting so much an eye about it? Who the fuck is kidding who about shit like that?

       Have you watched your Mainstream Evening News lately? Tonight for example, where I live: they talk about the Florida school shooting, show the students talk about gun control etc...they show trump doing his “listening meeting”, they talk about the bump stock ban, gun control gun, control, gun control. THE VERY NEXT SEGMENT they are showing footage of Syria getting bombed back into the Stone Age. They show the intense fighting, the bombs hitting buildings, and they show women and ESPECIALLY CHILDREN getting blown to pieces. They show wounded children screaming and crying while being carried off by other survivors also suffering from severe injuries. Don’t kid yourself, your Mainstream Media has ZERO problems showing you innocent children getting murdered.

       I don't have television, mainly read reports online, watch videos occasionally from various sources, often main stream news sources. It isn't the media I commented on, but the police, FBI...When they claim footage for investigations, why do you believe that should be released? Because teenagers online think it's a hoax? No one has to prove anything to you, only a judge. Give the dead the dignity of not showcasing nicolas cruz looking like a heroic, powerful figure like eric harris and dylan klebold were to many youth who wanted to follow their path.

       That is exactly the point: “No one has to PROVE anything to you”. There is no transparency or accountability. They can simply claim that x,y, and z happened and your choices are: to go along with it or be called a crazy person. Once you start connecting the dots for yourself, you begin to see that the media leaves out A LOT of important details in MANY stories and blatantly ignore other important stories altogether. You do not deny this, do you? I mean, this thought has crossed your mind, right? Why do they do this? Do they pick and choose when they tell half the story? Do they do it all the time? How would you know?

       Who is they? What is the media? Believing everyone is involved in a concerted effort to deceive you is more indicative of mental illness than social awareness. 'The Media' is a massive amalgam of people who exist to get ratings, primarily, not to feed you a narrative. If there was absolutely anything they could do to get one more sponsor or get one more person to tune it, they would do it. I don't understand why you believe the FBI, local police force or local government owe YOU anything. Your tax payer dollars? We pay for them to prosecute perpetrators and protect the innocent's right to privacy. Thank god Sandy Hook pictures didn't get out, some of the people on this sub alone would be emailing them to the parents for the next 20 years calling them out for make-believe photoshop fakery.

       I'm sure seeing a ton of these types of posts from people who admit they never post here and immediately ask for everyone to believe the official narrative and stop asking questions. Isn't the point of a conspiracy sub to provoke thought by asking questions to find the truth on a given topic? A good majority of us here will never fully believe the MSM narrative on anything. Posts like these are counter to the purpose of this sub and, IMO, designed to stop the free flow of thoughts/questions countering the official story. It is a passive aggressive attempt at censorship.

       not how I meant it. Just pointing out that when everything is a conspiracy theory cover-up, nothing is. If this sub is to piece together what they can to uncover the truth, shouldn't there occasionally be a case where we can agree there isn't a cover-up? otherwise it's an endless cycle of loons howling at the moon with no chance of convincing someone there's finally a real wolf out.

       How does it hurt this sub looking at all of the inconsistencies with the official narrative as well as discussing the similar patterns between this and other false flag events? To ask subscribers to stop questioning any topic hurts this sub worse than questioning the MSM narrative.

       It's meant to be condescending. If you want to look at the facts and determine for yourself what happened, this is an amazing subreddit. If you assume every school shooting didn't happen, you are a loon. Investigate it, but the consensus here every single time here is cover-up, never that it's real. It seems this sub wants the right to question anything and everything except it's own presuppositions, it's own narrative. That's perfectly demonstrated in this thread.

       There is plenty of evidence that this shooting is yet another false flag. There is the evidence of drills being done on the same day, the FBI knowing the suspect and doing nothing to prevent it, the suspect hearing demonic voices in his head telling him to commit the crime, conflicting eye witness accounts of multiple shooters, pushing an agenda, potential crisis actors, etc.
      </p>

       If you mean to be condescending towards conspiracy enthusiasts, then what are you doing on this sub? What is your purpose here? Maybe you should find a sub with people you don't consider loons because we are obviously beneath your level of intelligence.

       I love conspiracy theories. I want my conspiracy theories to be true, not conspiracy theory for conspiracy theory sake. If the truth isn't the goal this entire sub is fan fiction. You are claiming there are how many people involved in this cover-up... thousands? For what reason? The FBI is an organization of over 30,000 people with international concerns, 24/7. If you want to blame them for dropping the ball, ok, I believe they must investigate it and explain to us why they didn't act, I don't understand what they gain by allowing this? creating it? I don't know what you're saying they did.

       I don't know what the main stream media is, I assume you mean everyone that isn't alex jones? What is the main stream media? I asked you, how many people are you claiming were involved in this cover-up? I'll explain again... If someone questions something, shouldn't they be seeking the truth? isn't that what people here claim to want, the truth? Show me a single topic raised on this sub reddit that people determined was NOT a conspiracy theory or cover-up but in actuality occurred as reported? The self referential, cyclical nature of this environment is to take something, real or not, and assume it's not true. a lie. Explaining how it's a lie is a crowdsourced effort in which multiple people add a bit here, theory there, completing fabricating an alternative narrative piece by piece. They try to determine what the most believable lie is, collectively, considering they've already all determined it IS a lie. This sub runs with that, editing as necessary, passing it around, stewing on it and changing it as needed until they have THEIR depiction of events, which is ALWAYS different than official account. When someone comes along and says, 'hey, that theory, it doesn't make any sense. There's no reason to believe that incredibly convoluted story of intricate cover-ups, deception and espionage when the official report makes perfect sense and hundreds of people who spent months investigating it agree THIS IS THE TRUE STORY...' What do you do? You call them a shill and down vote them. You are open minded to absolutely anything, except the most likely cause and your own presuppositions about it.

       You are either extremely ignorant or completely closed-minded. Of course we question everything the MSM tells us. They are proven liars owned by 6 corporations with proven connections to the CIA. The MSM and the US Gov are legally allowed to use weaponized propaganda against us. They have before and still are using it to this day. The purpose of this sub is to question everything. If that bothers you so much, what are you even doing here? Seems you would be much happier without the loons.

       In my view the probability of a conspiracy being true drops off rapidly with the number of people allegedly involved and how criminal it is. And those who don't realize that just don't have a good model of the world and the dynamics between people and organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The complexity of organizing a conspiracy that involves many people is astounding, even mathematical models that simplify human nature greatly are unstable when trying to model this. The uncertainty involved in human affairs pretty much wipes out any predictability that would allow such planning. The laymen know this as the butterfly effect - sensitivity to initial conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       All conspiritors are always engaged in a subgame among themselves - defection. The first to defect can gain immunity and the risk to himself from the others drops off with the number of people involved and how much evidence he is able to collect (so that his value as a potential witness drops).
      </p>
      <p>
       And when it comes to school shootings it is insane to believe that anyone who has anything to lose would want to dabble in that in any way, and who gains what to justify such enormous risk?

       I convinced myself of this by studying game theory and then running simulations of conspirators, the payoff to defect always wins out eventually and the increasing number of participants makes the eventually ever shorter.

       If a simplified perfectly deterministic dynamical system is chaotic I have no doubt the actual messy system will be also.

       These proven conspracies involved a ton of people and yet they were able to keep them secret for decades before the truth came out.

       MKUltra
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in the 1950s the CIA secretly dosed individuals with LSD in order to test the potential effects of mind control. Although the practice reportedly continued for two decades, it was launched before the drug movement of the 1960s made LSD into a popular counterculture symbol. And while being given some free acid might sound like a great time to some, or at least the plot to a bad hipster action movie, dozens of people were reportedly left with permanent disabilities after secretly being subjected to massive amounts of LSD and electroshock therapy after seeking treatment for “minor psychiatric complaints.”

       The Gulf of Tonkin Incident
      </p>
      <p>
       On August 2, 1964, the USS. Maddox opened fire on what it later claimed were several North Vietnamese targets. The skirmish deepened America’s involvement in the Vietnam War, leading to the death of thousands of U.S. soldiers and many more Vietnamese, including hundreds of thousands of civilians. Except, it turned out the “targets” the Maddox fired upon didn’t actually exist. It’s still debated today whether the incident was an intentional misdirection by the military. But one thing is certain: President Johnson’s original claim that the North Vietnamese fired first has been debunked. Even former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara admitted as much in an interview before his death. After all, it’s kind of hard to start a fight when you’re not even there.

       A secretive, cult-like gathering of world elites
      </p>
      <p>
       A secretive organization of people that control the world? Well, it turns out it does exist and many of its members are powerful world leaders and titans of industry. The real action happens at Bohemian Grove, which appears to primarily exist as a place, “where the rich and powerful go to misbehave” according to The Washington Post. Or, alternatively, to hear it from the group directly, where members, “share a passion for the outdoors, music, and theater.” However, along with more traditional fare such as drinking and big dinners, the regular activities also reportedly include performing rituals before a giant wooden owl, according to The Post. Owners of the property host a two-week retreat in California each year for some of the wealthiest and most influential Americans. Past attendees include Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, both of whom attended before entering the White House. Oh, and it’s where the idea for the atomic bomb was first sketched out. No big deal.

       And if you don't believe our government would ever do false flags against it's own citizens, take a gander at this:

       "Operation Northwoods" Cuban False Flag Theory
      </p>
      <p>
       A large amount of conspiracy theorists believe that the U.S. government has used false flags to get the country involved in a majority of the wars we've been in; including instances such as knowing about the Japanese planes before they reached pearl harbor to get us into WW2, or 9/11 being an inside job so we can go fight in the middle-east. One can easily say "There is no way the U.S government would even think about killing all those innocent people on 9/11 just to get us involved in a war," but after learning about "Operation Northwoods" you may think again. In 1962 the U.S. Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff proposed a false flag that would have the C.I.A. commit acts of terrorism on American citizens and blaming it on the Cuban Government, all in order to have solid reasoning to go to war with Cuba. The acts of terrorism would involve bombings and other acts of terror in the Miami area and Washington D.C, hijacking planes whose passengers were college students, and bombings of U.S ships. The U.S government would hide in the shadows, while its citizens blindly blame Cuba for all the death and destruction. Thankfully for us, President Kennedy refused the proposal, and evidence of this entire ordeal was made public in 1997. "Operation Northwoods" did nothing but provide evidence that the U.S. government has made plans to commit acts of terror to get involved in wars without thinking twice of the welfare of the innocent. I'm not saying 9/11 was an inside job, but you can't deny a close correlation between "Operation Northwoods" and the events of 9/11.

       Perhaps instead of a "ton" you can provide the actual rough estimate of how many people were involved in each incident. As well as to the actual legality of the alleged actions. What those actions ultimately led to is hindsight.
      </p>
      <p>
       The murder of children cannot be compared to anything you listed. And neither can all other conspiracies than allege mass murder - not the indirect killing of people as the result of some action.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the waters are sufficiently muddy a bureaucracy can do wonders dispelling blame and accountability, the conspiracies alleged are anything but muddy.

       It's called weaponized propaganda which is completely legal for the Gov to use against us. Just like Sandy Hook, no one died and they are using these false flags to push an agenda to drum up support for a gun control agenda. The last thing I shared about Operation Northwoods was exactly what you say they would never do yet actually planned to until Kennedy stopped them. Once again:
      </p>
      <p>
       "In 1962 the U.S. Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff proposed a false flag that would have the C.I.A. commit acts of terrorism on American citizens and blaming it on the Cuban Government, all in order to have solid reasoning to go to war with Cuba.

       So please, try and tell us again that the Gov wouldn't do that against its own citizens. History proves you wrong bud.

       Seriously? Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. The absence of dead children in that community when they are expected would of generated a lot of disruption. Evidence should be easy to produce.

       Nothing you linked or said establishes a conspiracy taking place, wacky strategic suggestions that were not carried out is only evidence of rational individuals rejecting a risky dumb idea.

       all you had to do was google it, there's plenty of photos? I don't understand your narrative here, are you saying everyone in all of these photos is acting?
