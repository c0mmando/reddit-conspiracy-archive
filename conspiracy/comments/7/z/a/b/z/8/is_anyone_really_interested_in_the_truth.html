       These tragedies strike and both Political parties are trying to use it to further their own agendas. Right-wings using conspiracy theories and giving them a bad name, which now every conspiracy theory is branded 'right-wing propaganda' and left-wing using these tragedies to further their own agendas, calling everyone who doesn't believe the 'official narrative' a 'right-wing', 'tin foil hat crazy' e.t.c
      </p>
      <p>
       Politics aside, is anyone actually interested in the truth? is anyone actually interested in helping make the world a better place? Our communities?
      </p>
      <p>
       A message to BOTH sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dear left-wing, don't take everything at face value. Y'all tend to mock Christianity or any other Religion for brainwashing its followers, yet you are equally, if not more, brainwashed. Y'all are willing to believe everything as long as it fits your side's narrative and the agenda they want to push. USE YOUR CRITICAL THINKING for crying out loud. Y'all have brains. USE THEM. If something smells fishy, regardless of its origin(right-wing, left-wing), try and seek for the TRUTH. If you are a left-wing and you honestly believe there is NOTHING fishy about this whole thing, then I'm sorry but you are not 'woke'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dear right wing, GUNS SHOULD BE ILLEGAL. How hard is that for y'all to understand? Sure, the left is pushing for said agenda against guns. Are they in the wrong for that? Y'all can't honestly believe that GUNS are the solution. They are not. They are the PROBLEM. One of the problems, to put it better. Y'all love to mock war-lover Hillary, but at the same time, y'all want your guns. Also, stop using conspiracy theorists to also further your own agendas. Trump is an idiot. He is vile and he is literally the worst person to represent MEN, because he gives us a bad name. If you idolize him, then I'm sorry but you need to sort your lives out.

       Why do you assume only the "right wing" wants guns? You know, one of the things I actually respect about some "far left" groups is they're very pro 2nd amendment, as just one example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your thread is full of assumptions and stereotypes about both sides. I suggest you broaden your horizons a bit.

       I'm obviously talking about that specific group of people. I've read through enough threads in here to know who is pushing for an agenda and who is genuinely interested in finding out the truth.

       I'm not saying only the 'right wing' wants guns, but it's the vast majority. Both the average Joe and their representatives in said Political parties.

       The second amendment exists so that citizens can protect themselves against a tyrannical government. The government is staging hoax shootings in order take away that right... I would say that's tyranny.

       I used to feel the same way, but now is my distrust of the government is to the point where I'd rather want people to be able to defend themselves if and when the shit hits the fan. They are poisoning our food supply and our minds with propaganda, carrying out false flag operations, spying on us, creating AI, spraying us with heavy metals, destroying other countries, fucking us over with the federal reserve making us all debt slaves... the list goes on. I don't own any guns myself but gun control will only affect law abiding citizens. Anyone can go to Home Depot and make an improvised explosive device for less than the cost of a gun.
