       So yeah, that whole UFO thing. The government actually admitted that it happened.

       Then nothing. No investigations or anything, no reports, just hey we saw a UFO, bye.

       Pssst, it was gone? How is it gone? It's information, it still exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       "That whole UFO thing" didn't come &amp; go. It's just another step along the way. I don't know that it was supposed to produce anything beyond its own information. I hoped &amp; still hope it does. But I dont necessarily think it's a loss that it hasn't. We'll see.

       I was paying attention to their forums at the time and if we're talking about the pilots' eye-witness reports of a 'tic tac' UFO, that wasn't debunked by Metabunk. I think you are mistaken.

       The metabunk take only makes sense if you assume the original investigators were totally incompetent. Checking to see if the source was jet exhaust is literally the first thing they'd look at. If you assume the original investigators are idiots, no debunking is needed.

       I think Freemasonry is often a confirm nor deny thing. He could be faking it. Or he could be part of a "clandestine lodge" (suspicious phrasing). I'm no expert on Masonry, but only they could run a franchise and claim individuality.

       Well, the connections that Podesta has to Masons is kinda alarming.  I wonder why people are more leery of secret societies undermining our government.  The Black Hand started WWI...Washington warned against them being infiltrated...I dunno.  Seems a bit glossed over to me.

       Tom seems like a phony to me. I listened to the podcast he was on and at first was intrigued but it seemed like he was trying to sell his book. I am interested in the company he has going because he has some seriously accomplished scientists working there so I'm not sure what to think about all of it

       Well, I think it's interesting that he's pushed the "fear factor" a little bit in relation to UFOs...and I think it may tie into
       <em>
        religion
       </em>
       , of all things, if ya ask me.  There's a reason why they are holding back information but at the same time fearful of what the information may mean FOR THEM.  Ever think that it's To The Stars because some people might get kicked off the planet?  Maybe that's what the NWO is really about?  Pure speculation, btw.

       To be honest I don't really know too much about all of it other than the podcast and the Times piece so most of what you said doesn't mean much to me. Have you seen the British guy that hacked NASA or some other alphabet organization and claimed to have found information related to us having ships in space with extraterrestrial agents on board along with human officers. That is what got me looking into some of this

       Definitely seen his name pop up over the years.  Never read into it too much before though.  The wiki is interesting...
      </p>
      <p>
       "He did very serious and deliberate damage to military and Nasa computers and left silly and anti-America messages. All the evidence was that someone was staging a very serious attack on US computer systems."[6]"
      </p>
      <p>
       It was very serious, but they couldn't tell because of the silly messages.  I guess you would take it seriously too, if the entire ruse was going to come apart.  The ending is funny too:
      </p>
      <p>
       "In 2006, a Freedom of Information Act request was filed with NASA for all documents pertaining to Gary McKinnon. NASA's documents consisted of printed news articles from the Slashdot site, but no other related documents. This was consistent with NASA employees browsing internet articles about Gary McKinnon; the records of such browsing activity are in the public domain."
      </p>
      <p>
       I fail to see how giving internet articles satisfies a FOIA request.

       interview with Dr. Steven Greer, who is a well-known ufologist. He claims that Tom Delonge is essentially fed UFO disinformation - likely unbeknownst to himself. He cites some of his personal background working closely with the government on UFO research, which leads him to the personal conclusion that Delonge is in fact, a phony. Something about Dr. Greer seems sincere and truthful to me, but I'm honestly not up to par on my UFO research.

       Delonge is controlled. I can tell he means well and does want to break the topic wide open but he is controlled and told when to say things. Even on one of his tweets he literally says:
      </p>
      <p>
       "@tomdelonge
Something's coming, and everyday they tell me "one more day." Ugh... but I will look back at it as one of my life's greatest accomplishments"

       He is definitely used as a soft disclosure outlet, which isn't working obviously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you look at his tweet history you will see a lot of his newer tweets are just different gear you can buy and various bands he plugs and re-tweets.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had hopes for him but it looks like he's restricted in what he can say.

       Reaaally?  Man, you impress me.  How about this one...used to listen to At the Drive In.  Liked Mars Volta a bit but hadn't looked up anything by them in a while.  I checked out a YT video of theirs from a while back and I didn't know they had gotten Thomas Pridgen as drummer...guy's a beast.  Made a comment about him in the video, and someone shows up and says he left the band because they were satanists.  Then I saw songs like "Molochwalker" and I was like, "Oh."

       You know someone JUST brought up Levenda in another comment to me, and had never even talked about the guy before, and had only even seen his name a couple of times in the past.  Anyhow, last time I heard Alkaline Trio was on a CMJ Music CD like 20 years ago.

       The "Sinister Forces" trilogy and "Unholy Alliance" are books that every conspiracy buff--especially those with an inkling to suspect the occult/otherworldly stuff is involved--should read.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Levenda is a satanist, but part of their religion seems to be that they have to release the Truth to the masses, which allows them to claim they're "playing fair." When the masses don't do shit, it's considered passive consent for them to do their shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, those books are full of fascinating connections and forgotten (by design) history. I learned so much. But I don't trust the guy any more than I trust Tom Delonge. Which is to say: Not at all.

       Cedric and Omar have been into many occult and mysticism throughout their career, just that when people find out someone is into something that's older than mainstream religions, those who are clueless and do no research chalk it up to the convenient "satanist" label. Since anything not christian immediately has to be evil right?

       I don't see what that has to do with things.  Moloch is evil.  Milton called him one of Satan's main angels.  Child sacrifice is abhorrent to almost every human.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can sit here naming non-Christian things all day that aren't evil if you want.  I met the Dalai Lama...he wasn't evil.  Most Buddhists I've known aren't evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are Cedric and Omar baddies?  I doubt it.  But seeing as how I haven't listened to anything from the last four or five years, it'd be interesting to listen to more and see how things changed.

       they have a new ATDI lp and ep
      </p>
      <p>
       And waay before Pridgen they had Theodore when they first started TMV I really preferred his style of haitian voodoo drumming, think it definitely accented the style they were shooting for at that time.
They also had an album inspired by catholic priests exorcising a nun or something of that caliber. I believe they are more into the folklore and themes of occult and paranormal to bring more visual to the music and lyrics they execute artistically more than worshipping a dark entity and showing it to the viewers face as some type of subliminal luring into low frequency/neg energy and more, as what I can see is what would easily spook Thomas...more about giving breadcrumbs to listeners on going to research these interesting myths and stories to intrigue the mind. They were also who got me into Alejandro Jodorowsky, who is well known to have many occult symbolism throughout his work. But of course, someone who sees Holy Mountain for the first time without any knowledge will immediately assume...this is too crazy for me, must be satanic.

       You know what sucks?  My brother watched Jodorowky's Dune, and I put it off and they took it off Netflix.  Looked really impressive.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I did hear about ATDI...but I haven't given it a listen.  A lot of good music around these days.  :)

       I still haven't caught the full Jodorowsky's Dune, it's almost a shame to know this masterpiece would have existed...I believe HR Giger was supposed to do work on it as well, to imagine the mind blowing piece of art work that would have been is kind of disappointing

       Thanks for the nice convo as well...I will try and watch the documentary still one day.  Give ya my apprisal.  I know it's gonna be cool, but I wanna see how he would have differed from the other iterations as well.

       man just reminded me of an article where Jodorowsky was going to do a film with Johnny Dep and Marilyn Manson where MM is like an evil Pope, there was some sketches/story board shots, it almost makes me not want to know these things were going to exist...and then the funding or whatever was pulled, now just our imaginations can do the rest

       True story...won tickets to see Marilyn Manson on my birthday via radio call-in contest.  Could not for the life of me find anyone to go with on pretty short notice and ended up just skipping it.  This was right after Antichrist Superstar came out, which I really liked, so I was a little bummed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, that movie would have been interesting.  Reality has gotten a kinda Ninth Gate feel to it recently if you ask me.  In a good way though.  Like how the protagonist is actively passive in a way.  And excuse me for presuming that you've seen it, but if you have, you may know what I mean.

       That really sucks about the concert, reminds me of a similar situation where I missed out on seeing late rapper Big Punisher perform.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not seen Reality, but just seeing the trailer I am immensely interested, it's the same creator of the film Wrong Cops which stars Eric Warhiem and actually has Marilyn Manson playing a small role that if no one pointed out it's him, it might take a while to figure out who it is...I think it was shot around the same time he did a very small part in an episode of Eastbound and Down.

       Lol...I wasn't talking about the movie Reality.  I was talking about reality reality.  :)  Ninth Gate was where Johnny Depp was looking for the lost pages of a a grimoire made by the devil.  I just liked how his character was kinda static and it was more the movie happening around him as an observer.   He seems to get a lot of well-shot movies.

       Yeah, that's a real hoot...I had to check out the premise of that movie after the last message you had and I thought it pretty decent.  Funny, bc I also forgot that I actually walked in on my brother watching Eastbound and Down and saw Marilyn Manson, and I almost didn't see anything else from that series.  So that's kinda weird.

       I'm sincerely interested, if you don't mind my asking, what are you referring to when you say stuff people are into that is older than mainstream religions.? (not sure if a question mark should go here lol.) I feel like I lack knowledge in this area, and probably should do some research of my own, to be less uninformed, but I still was kinda wondering if you had anything specific you were referring to.

       personally I've been reading here and there about different esoteric schools of thought and they pretty much date back to egypt with Thoth and it goes directly to Hermes Trismegistus. Very interesting stuff and how it inspired many spiritualists and beliefs from different cultures, Pythagorus and many others are influenced and inspired by what goes back to Emerald Tablets of Thoth and Hermeticism, I'm still learning...but if there is something that sticks out to you, that you see very frequently in different posts, movies, music, just research it your self..and you will find things start connecting and relative to you specifically. It's as if certain things will start making sense to you personally, that's what I have been noticing when encountering posts or videos on these type of ancient schools of thought. If that makes any sense, I usually go off on a different tangent but a lot of it has a connection to different cultures and especially oneself tapping into the universe through meditation and or hallucinogens

       Because it was freemasons who created this whole fake alien bullshit through hollywood and disinformation. They want to keep us all from believing in God. That’s why they took over the churches, to corrupt them. And they say the demonic entities we encounter are just extraterrestrials from planets that are impossible to get to. Please. Even Stephen Greer believes that “aliens” have never actually abducted anyone, all abductions are done by people. He even said he knew one of the guys that performed them.

       Aside from what you can see on your telescope, everything we know about space has been taught to us. Mostly by NASA, who is run by freemasons. All austronauts are apparently freemasons, and some have “leaked” that they saw bases on the moon. People scour NASA space footage and make great discoveries of manmade structures on the Moon and on Mars that NASA just happened to let slip. The freemasons denounce God. They are followers of Lucifer. And like the great deceiver himself, they are great decivers as well.

       Here's something interesting...my grandfather worked for Martin Marrietta, and actually designed and machined parts for the Apollo Missions.  I still have a mechanical pencil made out of aircraft metal from him.  Anyhow, I don't know if you've ever seen the Denver Airport murals and such, but the "capstone" has Martin Marrietta on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny coincidence that Zimmerman Metals is also listed, and someone pointed out Trayvon MARTIN and George Zimmerman.  Meanwhile, Fentress Bradburn, ARCHITECTS, is in between the two.
      </p>
      <p>
       To piggyback on what you said, if you haven't read the background to the Blucifer statue, that's pretty strange too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, if their tradition started with Tubal-Cain, it would stand to reason that they would know there are things that existed before them.  I dunno, I think maybe Lucifer and CAIN might be related.

       One of the requirements for joining a freemason lodge is that you believe in a god. It doesn't matter which god or gods, but you must believe in one. So that would be contrary to what you're saying I think.

       Everyone is saying Tom Delonge is a phony and a shill and honestly I agree especially after watching his appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       HOWEVER, my personal opinion after a lot of speculation and looking into DeLonge's life is that he traded being a shill and gleefully (probably euphorically as his life long dream has come true) taking on the position for learning a fuck ton of info on the UFO/Project Bluebeam phenomenon. In the interview with Rogan you can see how nervous yet excited he is because he knows a lot but can't really say. Watch the body language interpretation video on the podcast. He's like a kid who just learned some magnificent and juicy secret who can barely contain himself. He has been known to be obsessed with aliens his entire life and Blink 182 has a number of songs discussing the topic. He's probably for a long time been trying to use his fame and fortune from his musical career to get to the bottom of things which he has always questioned and sought answers to. Wouldn't you? I've been obsessed by the same things as Tom and if I was that wealthy and connected I would probably do the exact same thing. Of course I am unhappy he is a shill and wouldn't neccessarilly be comfortable with that but the facts are that there is an agenda unfolding. Whether we like it or not they, whoever "they" may be, will stick to the agenda and the timeline of disclosure. Tom is an instrumental part of the soft-disclosure occurring at the moment and is acting as a figure-head.

       Their disclosure is worthless though.  If you can convince me otherwise, I'm all ears.

       If I had "fame and fortune" and was "wealthy and connected", would I befriend Podesta?  Nope...sorry, that's a dealbreaker.  I've already seen a UFO, and in color, not like that crappy airplane video...and it was faster than that one as well.  Soooo...they haven't shown me

Capable of completely revolutionizing our planet and the way we live as a species. All kept from us because of greed and service to self materialism. Holy smokes does it piss me off.

       Why would the government ever

       friggin ufo technology?
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes no sense to patent anything related to UFOs - because it would mean that terrestial actors could replicate the invention,
       <em>

       that the government was somehow commercializing said invention in the first place.

       Blue beam can't be pulled off any longer, it wouldn't be allowed and plus they aren't even capable of pulling it off at this point. Deep state is in a scramble and their world is closing in. Gotta love the age of Aquarius. People are seeing through the illusion and the lies and control mechanisms. It all starts with one and that one is you

       Thanks man. As bashar said once, humans have been in a long, long, long, dream and are awakening from a deep slumber.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some will awaken faster than others all depending on multiple factors. It's messy, hard, work but we all do it when we are capable and can handle it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never given more than we can handle in any given moment and we are truly loved and supported. It's the beauty of creation and we are all creators.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are all one, and we all can collectively change this world for the better, and we are and will each day in the ways we each know how. 2017 alone was a wave of change and 2018 is already pretty eventful.

       Bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The "Deep State" never scramble or Fear, they simple move somewhere else, or regroup.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) 2012blogspot, Qfag, Kabbafag and any related CBTS pieces of shit provide half truths mixed with deliberate misinfo, trump cultist ideals, and CIA brainwashing, it's all headed by Trumps Media Staff (including one particular cunt who is Qanon) but to be fair, a lot of those truths have been around and known from elsewhere in the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The Deep State isn't real, well they "are" real, but the reality of the situation is that any "white hats" in a majority of the world's governments are undercover/are in secret, the NWO is a well known "open secret" and practically the only good guys to have power are Putin, and a few others. Also the so called "Deep State" has existed for Thousands of Years, and has been headed by the Vlash/Reptoids and Dimoi/Draconians since the beginning, using a lot of Hybrids since then, contrary to the false claims they have only been in power since 1996.

       I agree and have had similar thoughts on it as you.  I honestly don't follow the news that closely, so I thought that maybe more came up, but I guess that small spark of info was all there was to it, eh?
      </p>
      <p>
       It really does make you think about the motivation for it though. If they wanted to push disinformation, they could have kept pushing. And if it's real then why was it so openly admitted to the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly do think there has been some extraterrestrial contact, simply based on the extraordinary number of sightings, abduction and contact stories, cattle and animal mutilations, UFOs depicted in ancient art....
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet why would they so readily admit to this now, unless there was a spin or something to be gained from it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where they simply gauging the public's reaction to the story?  I think that could be it. I guess we will see how it all unfolds.

       I think it was a flop. The conspiracy theorists turned against it, which I think they figured was their natural constituency. So when the normies, which were never on board, didn't want to wake up to their "muh alienz," it was doomed.

       Plus Tom DeLonge's whole presentation about the alien spacecraft picture turned out to be a weather balloon, which made him look like an idiot.

       That was my read, too. It was intended to draw the attention of the conspiracy theorist crowd, but everyone here just wanted to know "hmmm, and why did they just decide to disclose this
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       ?" -- almost certainly not what they were going for.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they do it again, I bet it'll be a "leak". The unprompted official announcement is what made it so suspicious.

       This was admitted on main stream media. And not a fucking peep. No one ever said anything at all that I knew. Even at my work. Other people I talked to, nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I consider this a good thing, because now the cabal's soft disclosure narrative will never work. The only way this will work is for full disclosure, existence and technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the book written by Col. Philip Corso, The Day After Roswell; not only does he admit to several ET grays in person, he had direct access to the "nut files" aka the Roswell files. In it contained the full truth and the various samples found etc. He admits to the government reverse engineering ET craft and technology. This is the result of LED, Kevlar, night vision, fiber optics, etc
      </p>
      <p>
       That book alone confirms so much. And he was a colonel who regularly met General Trudeau on the regular and discussed openly about the Roswell files and technology (sifting it through corporate entities to then be mass produced and distributed to the public for profit)

       They are already doing damage control. That’s why they are shifting the narrative of what these entities are. The entities that have visited humanity for all of its existence. They want you to believe they are extraterrestrials from another planet.

       I think ~90% of ufos seen today are man-made. But back in the 40s/50s I'd have said 10% were man-made and 90% were extraterrestrial. And then before 1920s practically all ufos were extraterrestrial.
       <br/>
       That's the current conclusion I've come to based on the evidence I've personally seen. What's your current idea?

       I don’t believe in extraterrestrials. I believe they are demonic entities. I believe this because since ancient history these beings have lied to humans about where they were from. For example some have said they’ve come from Venus or Saturn, but now we know those planets are uninhabitable. I believe in God and in the bible. There’s been testimonies of people who were being bothered by these entities or in the process of what they believed was abduction and when they called for God or Jesus Christ the entities left them alone and never returned. I recently heard a really captivating testimony of someone who was communicating with demons through a ouija board.

       Fair, thanks for explaining your theory. I don't personally take anything from the bible, or any holy book for that matter, in a literal sense. The Bible's been around for 2,000 years. It's been corrupted in that time. With certain information omitted, and other misleading bits added etc. I believe the bible as we see it today is an obfuscation of the truth. If we were to take it metaphorically however, then I could get on board. (I've roughly explained this in the "religion" subsection of my long post in the current round table discussion, in which I relate holographic theory with consciousness and it's applications and mechanics via religion, the Occult, ufos etc).
       <br/>
       If by "demons" it refers to beings which exist in/on alternate dimensional planes of existence, and can sometimes interact on this plane (either via their own means or "summoning") then sure. But I don't think they serve an all powerful, evil entity called "Satan". I believe rather that "Satan" represents the certain mindset of self-service at the expense of others (aka: evil). I also don't believe that a creator entity known as God exists. I believe that "God" represents the universal unity of all things (aka: love). All the information of every single thing in the entire universe from beginning to end, and all the information of every other thing and every other universe from beginning to end ever... That's "God". Literally everything. I don't believe that this is the only life we get and that at the end of it some guy decides whether we spend an eternity in absolute bliss or utter damnation. I believe in infinite reincarnation, tracing every path from the lowest planes of existence, through every life and utterance of conscious expression, back up to universal unity and then back down again to try it another way.
       <br/>
       I reckon the reason that some of these entities leave at the utterance of the name of Jesus Christ is moreso because jesus represents a certain mindset. He represents love and the expulsion of evil from ones life. Buddha and Krishna also represent this mindset. Doesn't mean they weren't real people. I think they quite likely all were. But I think they were all preaching the same message of certain fundamental laws of this universe, and that over time that's been misrepresented in the books they've been written about in to the point that the metaphor is taken as the literal interpretation.
       <br/>
       I believe that multiple extraterrestrial species have been watching us on earth for longer than we humans have even been here, generally taking a non-interventionist approach, but sometimes intervening the same way a scientist does with a certain species they're monitoring. I believe most ETs follow this general mode of operation, but that some have a more sinister agenda (to liken it again to the scientists, those more sinister individuals are sort of like illegal poachers) and that explains the traumatic experiences some people have with them. I also think some of the more traumatic experiences could be from military/black budget project abductions under the guise of being extraterrestrial.
       <br/>
       Thanks for the link, I'll add it to the the list of things I've got planned to watch over the next few days as I'm at work now and can't watch it. But a link I'd recommend for a relatively decent explanation of part of my theories is the documentary "Unacknowledged", which is on Netflix.

       Yup because Christianity, and most modern organized religions, tell people to compartmentalize their spirituality. That alone has so many consequences.

       There always seems to be this notion that everyone is waiting for something big (a war, a crash, bitcoin economy, aliens, etc) when perhaps it is the other way around and “they” have already put it out there and are waiting in frustration for a critical mass to get the clue ...

       Ever heard of Walter Bodley? He was a spook himself in the air force and later FBI and his dad was part of Air Force recovery which means he was there at Roswell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bosley could be playing a game but if you listen to him he sounds pretty jaded by his time working for the government and if i had to guess he was or is still part of the white hat group that seems to be in the middle of a coup.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway something he said that stuck with me was this. He said his father told him they aren't extra-terrestrial at all. They're humanoid and they've been living on this planet a long time. basically a breakaway civilization from a while back. From a pure logical stand point this makes far, far more sense than alternative origins. Do we really think some benevolent galactic order is concerned with our wellbeing here on earth, especially when getting here by known physics is impossible so far as we know? Or did we start seeing a massive uptick in UFO activity
       <em>
        especially concerning nuclear testing
       </em>
       because we share a planet with these things.

       The public has been mass brainwashed to believe and disbelieve certain things. This "disclosure" was a gauge of how well that process is coming along. Another 20 years and they'll be able to fly around reverse engineered alien spacecraft in public and no one will say anything.

       I mentioned this news to people when it initially came out and every single one acted like it was no big deal and even obvious that the government was admitting to interacting and even having a special program donated to UFOs.

       Have you seen the news lately? Between toxic politics, alt-facts, alt-alt-facts and mass shootings, no one has any head space (to say nothing of trust) left to process aliens. News has become one gigantic trauma.

       On the other hand they could not have picked a better time to disclose something and have it be largely ignored. Now you can't complain that they kept secrets, can you?

       Here is a conspiracy, why is corporate run US making Space X launches easier, but still working on shutting down nasa through pretty much every way possible. Because Corporate run US gov is in affect, so corporate conglomerate will fix problems not the gov, like they(amazon and a bunch of other companies like health insurance and some others are planning on cooperating) to fix the runaway costs of health insurance. Instead of just making medicare a thing, no its going to be better than medicare it's going to giant for profit conglomerates int he health industry. Instead of NASA there is spaceX and no one else, so corporations got together and funded it, now they are making space X easier. (I am not saying its a bad thing or a good thing, it is what it is atm, only time will tell if SpaceX will be a good thing or a bad thing, like private health insurance which is bad, but only with time we found that out, and private prisons, and privatisation of water...only time will tell).....

       They induced an alien communication and a demon possession experience with their technology for me but I'd already meditated a lot and had legit spiritual experiences before so could discern their tech. It's like I heal neural pathways in my brain and the environment around me when I meditate or increase the DMT in my body. I remote viewed my DNA being restructured and saw a very beautiful place that might've been Atlantis or a potential past/future.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could communicate telepathically, shape clouds, astral project, heal some pains and most important thing I learned was that life is like a dream and our minds are very powerful, I was creating synchronicities in other people's lives. When I meditate a lot I have very high intuition to know things before they happen or know where hidden things are or events around me get affected by my mind like I'm living in a dream.
      </p>
      <p>
       My life's been systematically ruined since childhood by different governments anywhere I move to and they induce lot of pain in my body with advanced tech whenever I meditate.

       The government didn’t admit it. A disgruntled ex employee was forced to quit and sneaked out a couple of videos. This guy then gets a job with a silly disclosure company and releases the videos to draw attention to the company.

       Big reveal? Wait another two years an you’ll see a big reveal.. and even then, they won’t tell us everything they know. We are being treated like children. Don’t tell them, they will panic. Fuck sake!

       What I find hilarious is the fact that people on the news finally got in front of cameras and said "Hey here's a UFO video", and the rest of the world was like, "......meh...."
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, not totally "meh". I had a few friends who are pretty mainstream in their world views post the video on social media and raise a bit of a fuss about it. But, it's still kind of funny that we had a soft disclosure, and no one really cared.
      </p>
      <p>
       To anyone reading, I'd just say, if you want to see a UFO, spend the summer nights outside watching the sky. You'll see something eventually. Might be one of ours, might be something else. But you can see them.

       To be honest I don't really know too much about all of it other than the podcast and the Times piece so most of what you said doesn't mean much to me. Have you seen the British guy that hacked NASA or some other alphabet organization and claimed to have found information related to us having ships in space with extraterrestrial agents on board along with human officers. That is what got me looking into some of this
