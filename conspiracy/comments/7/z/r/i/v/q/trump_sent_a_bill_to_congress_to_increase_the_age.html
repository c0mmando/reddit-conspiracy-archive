    <div class="md"><p>Trump voter here. Totally cool with the 21 thing. My position on guns is home defense meets the secone so either the kid&#39;s will have parents in the home to defend, or just a few years being safer than the time after 21 assuming they moved out young. I feel an age restriction meets both sides of the isle. Keeps the guns for the right reasons but asks for mental maturity. So I actually think it was a good move by Trump being pulled in both extremes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you talking about? You just said that you still stand behind your statement that these shooters are not buying guns in the open market. I shared with you an article that disproves that statement. Please tell me which incidents back up your statement. It shouldn’t be that hard based on what you are claiming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK we are saying the same thing. Show me an example where you prove your point. All you need to do is name one shooting that was because of a gun purchased on the black market or illegally. </p>
