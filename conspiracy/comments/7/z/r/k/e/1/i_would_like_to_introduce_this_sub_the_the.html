        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Disclaimer: This is not a conspiracy but just something of a lighter note that I want to share with the rest of this sub.</p>

<p>I have been an active member of this year for about 2.5 years, but I have been into conspiracies and alternative histories for 20 years.</p>

<p>My introduction to these concepts did not come from a book or documentary, but a cartoon better known as The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest (1996). For those that who may not know but this was reboot of earlier 60s cartoon produced by Hanana- Barbara. In both shows, they follow a family of adventures that deal with cryptozoology, the paranormal, extra-terrestrials, and beyond. What makes the 90s show standout to me is that they explored conspiracies and ideas that may have some merit, such as:</p>

<p>The government leaves its agents in the field and lets them die if they are compromised.

<p>Aliens have penetrated the US government and the governments of the world. 
<a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5zazmj">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5zazmj</a> </p>

<p>Federal agencies stealing alien technology from the Roswell Crash and using them for their own purposes.

<p>The Declaration of the Independence may be a fake, and the real one has been lost for all time.

<p>ET’s may have had a hand in human evolution

<p>Vikings not only came to North America, but established settlements

<p>Private companies developing microchips for controlling human emotion

<p>And that is just the tip of the iceberg. Like I said, watching this show as a kid helped me to at least consider other possibilities and probably made me an avid pursuer of conspiracies. In its own right it’s a good, incredibly underrated cartoon worth watching. If you have any questions regard it, feel free to ask. </p>

<p>Have you watched the Venture Bros.? They have an episode with &#39;Action Johnny&#39;, a parody of Quest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love the Venture Bros and I think its a bit underrated among similar cartoons. It&#39;s interesting to note that the creators of the show said that failure was the main theme of the show and you can see this in all of the characters.</p>
