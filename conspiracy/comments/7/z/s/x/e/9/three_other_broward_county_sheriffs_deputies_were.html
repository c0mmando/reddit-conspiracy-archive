    <div class="md"><p>I think the real question is does anyone know why they just happen to be at the school at that time? i believe all the shooting by Cruz was done in 6 mins. Did they get a call and arrive after the shooting and were trying to figure out what was going on. Or were they there before the shooting started? And if so why were they there? I cant image they got a call and got there while it was going on, from what i have heard it all happen in 6 or so mins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they were at the school during the shooting, then it was becasue they were having a drill, like all the witnesses are claiming.  Why else would they already be there?  The shooting only lasted a few minutes according to the CNN bullshit story, and then Cruz slipped out with the other students.  So the cops shouldn&#39;t have even been there yet.  How many witnesses do you have to hear say &quot;It was a drill&quot; before you realize it was a drill?  Multiple kids interviewed said they were told there would be a code red drill with blanks fired, people screaming, and fake bodies.  This couldn&#39;t be any more obviously a hoax</p>
