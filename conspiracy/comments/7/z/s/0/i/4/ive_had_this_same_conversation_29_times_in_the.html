<p>“Yes, I know it’s sad but we have to have guns, it’s essential.”</p>

<p>“Guns are bad, if we didn’t have them then no one would get shot.” </p>

<p>“Right, I hear you, but then we would be vulnerable to the government like never before; they could pass whatever laws they wanted and use any force necessary to enforce these unlawful laws if we had no weapons.”</p>

<p>“Guns are just for home defense, or hunting.” </p>

<p>“No... again, Guns are there so we can defend ourselves from potential misuse of government power, it’s in the Constitution.” </p>

<p>“But.. but.. but okay. If the US government WANTED to kill you and take your guns they COULD.”</p>

<p>“...wrong again. That’s illogical. There are tens of millions of men and women in America who would fight back not to mention an unknowable number of dissidents within our own military who would fight back.. the government simply does not have the capability of fighting off a militia that size, just ask Iraq and Afghanistan who have populations the size of Florida.”</p>

<p>If they had a confrontation with the Americans public how much more do you think they would have to neuter their efforts? It’s a zero sum game. </p>

<p>If they manage to weaken and trick us, steal our guns? Betray our soldiers. </p>

<p>I own guns, enough to constitute two full six foot safes. Most were inherited, but some were purchased. I don&#39;t appreciate you implying I&#39;m not a &quot;real man&quot; just because I don&#39;t think guns should be as available as they are, nor do I think it should be a &quot;right&quot; in America.</p>

<p>I think that if guns were actually a deterrent for the government, they wouldn&#39;t let us own them. Full stop. Instead, they let us own them and we get to jerk off about the idea of fighting them, and then all of our poor people murder each other at an absolutely insane rate while the TPTB laugh and count their money.</p>

<p>Again, we’re not working with black and white aspects; all of this is gray. Right now we happen to live in a civil society that allows gun ownership: this ideal situation is bound to fail.

<p>Do you think it&#39;s an ACCIDENT that we&#39;re the one the world has to rely on militarily? That everyone else was a pussy, or something, and we just HAD to step in? It&#39;s by design. It&#39;s what TPTB wanted, so they could profit and profit forever. </p>

<p>I get that you have your viewpoint and that you&#39;ve somehow rationalized this, but just so we&#39;re clear - you firmly believe it&#39;s &quot;The State&quot; vs &quot;The People&quot;, but you work for the state, accept money and benefits from the state, and happily further the interests of the state at the expense of innocents around the world.

<p>Now multiply that by 10-20 million veterans who are still in shape and you’ll see that we have the advantage. The world is getting better, overall. So, yes I’m sorry I contributed to pain and suffering elsewhere but I’m proud that I did what I did to learn and use my talents for good. </p>

<p>I also learned things and memorized things that I won’t repeat here for my own safety. The military is not your enemy, that is brainwashing. 90% of people in the military are just like you and want to live in a peaceful, just world. </p>

<p>I won&#39;t listen to you, an extension of the state, lecture me about how you need guns to fight the state. Rationalize it all you want, but you&#39;re effectively the state. </p>

<p>And if you think the &quot;good folks&quot; in the military won&#39;t fire on the people, just tell that to those poor kids at Kent State. Just tell that to the thousands of people killed by cops every year, and just tell that to the innocents around the world that you murder and kill to further the interests of The State. </p>
