       Since the events in Florida, I've kept asking myself, why was the focus on the victims? Why was there so much disinfo flying around regarding the VICTIMS?
      </p>
      <p>
       Highchool kids were somehow taking taking the brunt of the blame over something that just happened to them. They were/are the victims. Kids who saw their teachers and peers fall injured or even worse dead where suddenly the target again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theories flew rather quickly, first to wrongly identify the shooter, then to accuse the students of being actors, then to try to seemingly blame the victims of this tragedy as being in on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is honestly very upsetting.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should be focusing on the provable issues that lead up to this event:
      </p>
      <p>
       *The FBI's "incompetency" and inaction even when given credible information.
      </p>
      <p>
       *The mental health aspect and the side effects of psycho-pharmaceuticals
      </p>
      <p>
       *The failure of federal background checks to identify the perps violent behavior that lead to multiple expulsions from school
      </p>
      <p>
       *The radicalization of the perp through internet propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       The list goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       What should have NEVER been on the list was blaming the victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not asking you to not question things, I'm asking you to do your due diligence and find the truth. I'm asking you to be civil and strive to better this community.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you all understand the reach and influence this community really has.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to have a conversation with me about this I'll be here.

       Thanks.

       i genuinely feel that most of it is blatant disinformation to draw attention away from, what to me is the most compelling theory, that they are using these children to push an agenda. Kids are extremely desensitized these days, and while assuming that they are incapable of going on TV without breaking down does make sense, as a millennial myself I feel that kids are also very capable of bottling up those emotions and/or not even feeling very traumatized from the event at all.

       Even if that's the case, they still have the right to talk about it. They just  went through hell, why not listen to their stories and have a conversation about it?

       That's VERY misinformed. These are their formative years. What happens here affects them for the rest of their lives. Adults who go through similar situations in war, who are TRAINED to expect this still come out damaged.

       I was not at all saying that they don't have a right to or shouldn't speak on their stories, what I'm saying is that it seems to be they are being coached and driven into pushing a narrative moreso than to share their tragedy with others. Rather than that they won't feel traumatized from this event, what I intended to propose is that everyone is capable of handling tragedy differently, and just because they are able to go on TV without breaking down does not, to me, scream that they are crisis actors, but moreso that they are being driven to push a narrative while given the illusion that they are on Mainstream Media to share their tragedy.

       These kids aren't millenials, millenials are all old fucks now, they're Gen Z and you have nothing in common with them unless you were born in the last four years of the 90's.  If you didn't grow up watching adventure time as a tiny tot, you are not part of their generation.  Most of them were 8 years old when Obama was elected.  This is some

       Every time something tragic occurs the race is on to claim it was faked, a hoax, or false-flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too many people have no interest in truth, they just want some sort of scenario where they are more ‘woke’ than other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can find all the things you mentioned being discussed outside of r/conspiracy, so those points are no longer good enough for them. It’s all too “mainstream.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Infowars and other fake news sites, YouTube “conspiracy theorists,” and others who make their living from shilling this crap make it blow up; and they’re the reason why the discourse here is complete shit at the moment (there was some decent discussion here before the propaganda and fake stories got going). But I still saw r/conspiracy users rushing to cry “False flag!” from the very start. It’s damn sad.

       I don't know if it's worse or better than the usual "I demand to observe the autopsies and collect DNA." That's so sick and thoughtless, but it's not (or not always) being done cynically by political trolls as in your example.

       You're not going to stop anyone from posing as a member of a "conspiracy" community and then acting awfully simply to discredit everyone and any theories being debated (especially if there is any truth involved). Imagine the headlines "victim further traumatised by death-threats from conspiracy community". It's a very simple and effective tactic. Appealing to people's good nature wont do anything to stop dis-info attacks.  I have a feeling we will be seeing more headlines discrediting conspiracy theorists as deranged in the near future.

       I completely agree with your opinion.
I think what is happening after these mass shootings are people thinking...
Here we go again... another shooting which always has been worse then the last one.
Say what you will but I am certain Sandy Hook, Boston, and pulse were totally staged events. I say this after watching hours upon hours of video enate things just don't add up.
You have crisis actors at multiple events, narratives which make zero sense and people calling for gun reform before the blood is even dry.

       All mass shootings in the media are fake, simple as that. There isn’t any evidence for a single one of them being real.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Hogg, I suspect he and his cohorts just fit the bill for this event. Their views and his enthusiasm for the media were highly compatible with the intended narrative, so he was thrust into the spotlight. A tool, a useful idiot, but probably not fully aware of the fact he is being played like a fiddle.

       Says the guy who ignores all evidence just to fit his narrative. Yeah it makes much more sense than tens of thousands of people are co-ordinating lies to take your guns away or whatever (even though they haven’t even tried and gun laws are laxer than they’ve been in decades).

       You’re doubting nearly every school shooting as far as I can tell. That means all the victims, the police officers, local government, teachers in each instance, oh and I imagine in your mind the federal government is also involved, and that would bring in the various security services, plus whatever cabal/secret society you think is orchestrating and planning these events - they’re all lying. That’s easily tens of thousands of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of kids have died because of this. I know that’s hard to accept, but they did. You’re twisting reality to fit the idea that they didn’t, but the truth is the world is chaotic and doesn’t make sense a lot of the time. You need to learn to deal with that because what you’re doing is disrespectful to the victims and their families.

       I doubt any that get widespread co-ordinated media coverage, and which fit neatly into the average news cycle, where the perpetrator is caught and the crime is nearly wrapped up within a matter of hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Real shootings don’t get that kind of blanket media coverage, because real mass shootings are incredibly rare and the motivation behind each one is different and complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I’m really saying is that the press is essentially a propaganda tool of the people in charge of these events, and anything you see or read about in mainstream media is not to be trusted at all. Editors have no need to double check facts provided by their “securedrop” 4am feeds, or accredited AP photographers, or news wires. They are all accustomed to towing the line as far as national news stories are concerned.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, it doesn’t. It’s absurd to suggest everyone is in on each one of these events. It’s also pure speculation to attempt to guess who is and who isn’t, but it’s pretty easy to spot fakes on camera. Victims who can’t cry tears while sobbing away, families who are all smiles and forgiveness within hours of the event taking place, police officers being fed lines off camera, coroners dramatically describing “this magnificent...
       <em>
        thing
       </em>
       ” (hello Wayne Carver).
      </p>
      <p>
       A large majority of shootings seem to coincide with drills of one kind or another. This is obviously no accident and provides the perfect cover story for having all the resources in place to stage the event.

       I’ve already outlined what I think, which is that pretty much all mass media spectacles are faked. It therefore follows that all “evidence” presented
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       be faked too.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s not only plausible, it’s probable and I am willing to bet neither you nor anybody else reding this has ever followed up on a single piece of evidence to determine its authenticity.
      </p>
      <p>
       This then begs the question: why are you convinced that the “evidence” presented is genuine? Do you think it would be especially hard for an organisation capable of pulling off a deception on this scale to also fake those certificates, or to place actors to lie on camera, or to stitch clips of people who thought they were doing a drill into other footage, or to use the world’s shittiest cameraphone footage to show brief glimpses of Hollywood gore?

       <strong>
        one piece of evidence
       </strong>
       that cannot be attributed more easily to lies and media fakery than to the purported event. Not one.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think you have something compelling to share, from this event or any other, please do so. It would be even better if you could explain why it convinces you. I’m certainly open minded enough to be persuaded by extraordinarily compelling evidence.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I don't believe this organisation exists, because there's no evidence to suggest it does
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What evidence would you expect to find? Such an organisation must necessarily be able to operate in total secrecy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you agree there are large and powerful organisations that have the capabilities to operate in whole or in part in secrecy? If so, is it really such a stretch to extrapolate that notion to one of the
       <em>
        largest
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        most powerful
       </em>
       organisations that has ever existed?
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, the totality of evidence of fakery at each and every one of these media circus events is more than enough reason to consider it a possibility.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        no push from either side to ban guns - so no motive.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I didn’t speculate on a motive or a specific agenda, so why are you doing it?

       So you automatically discount all evidence as being manufactured by some shadow-y organisation that has seemingly unlimited power and influence. Right.

       You'd discount any piece of evidence as being faked by the deep state, there's nothing in the world that would convince you because in your mind there's nothing this organisation isn't capable of.

      <p>
       If everything can be explained away as some big conspiracy then you'll twist anything and everything to fit that agenda. Hopefully one day you'll see the fundamental flaw in your logic. I'm done arguing, I've made my point pretty clearly and mine is backed up with actual

      <p>
       There’s a big difference though. You seem to be asserting that the event actually happened which one would think could easily be proven... unless for some reason all evidence that constitutes irrefutable proof is being deliberately withheld?
      </p>
      <p>
       An allegedly uncontrolled and spontaneous event of this scale would surely result in some evidence of that quality leaking, no matter how tight the controls put in place after the fact. Would t you agree?
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, an event controlled from start to finish and designed to paint a certain picture would only be supported by ambiguous snippets of “evidence” tossed deliberately into the public domain, specifically to prop up whatever narrative is being spun. No compelling evidence would ever come forwards later because no such evidence exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which scenario do we actually see at Parkland and at all other media circus events of that nature?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m asserting that Parkland didn’t happen as described by the media, and that all we
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       seen is a co-ordinated staged production. I can’t prove the event didn’t happen, but then again, I don’t need to when there is a total absence of physical evidence to prove that it
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you see why this admittedly cynical and skeptical argument always has its place in the absence of compelling and extraordinary evidence to the contrary?

       Its funny when anyone speaks of David Hogg in a negative light you get mass down voted for whatever reason...the guy is a fraud and its completely apparent when 173 people down vote a single post. 
The shills are strong in this pre planned garbage they call a mass shooting.
When have you ever seen 3 police officers arrive at an active shooter scene and sit outside while maniac dude is picking kids off at will?
Seriously....who in the Fuck would sit back while kids are being slaughtered
With the mentality of..."I'm just going to sit here and wait, no need to do anything...I'm just going to play candy crush till shit gets real.

       This is what stuck out for me.  I live relatively close to the shooting that happened in KY last month.  Hardly a mention from the MSM.  Some bigger news crews from Louisville and Lexington covered it, but not much other than a nod from MSM.

       Fast forward to FL.  Instant 24/7 wall to wall coverage and paired with political agendas.  For me, that is extremely telling from an organic event to one that was engineered to some degree.

       I’m not saying no one died. I’m not there in Floridia. But it’s obvious to anyone who’s in the know that the shooting is being used as political ammunition.

       I think you missed the point completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       The strategy was this: 
Use the children because adults cannot ARGUE BACK.  The optics are terrible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could you imagine in that CNN hour of hate, if one of the adults argued back vs a small teenage victim?  I mean those kids said some completely immoral things, and the adults had to take it in stride.  This was just a political strategy in favor of dismantling the Second Amendment.

       The problem is you are forced to talk about the kids because they’re being plastered on every news station 24/7, and most a talking about issues that they don’t fully understand. And on top of that the media was very quick to jump on the conspiracy crowd claiming something was wrong, again forcing the hands of those talking about the kids to double down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I would like to point out that no one is really talking about the “kids” but more specifically about a “few kids”. Those few being talked about have actively thrust themselves into the limelight, so let me ask you this: do you disagree with other people in the political limelight being talked about? Are you bothered by the scandals surrounding Donald Trump? What about the fall out of the Rachel Dolezal situation a few years back, did that irk you? Or anything about Hillary Clinton’s health during the election? Face it, when people are in the spotlight in a political atmosphere they are criticized and typically it’s personal. It doesn’t change that they are 17-18 (which is typically the age where one is “legally” an adult). And yes, the atmosphere surrounding these “kids”
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       political because of the talking points
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       chose to discuss.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m sorry that this is probably against the grain but that’s part of the game and this is the way it’s been since Nixon. Literally no person involved in the political scene is safe from criticism especially when they volunteer their time to go on almost any news outlet, and their talking points quite literally go against the second fundamental pillar that this country was built on. That’s just the reality of the world we live in, and I’m sorry for that.

       Oh wow, I only recently became able to post here because my account is still fairly new so I wanted to try before typing something long.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the tldr of what I wanted to write:
False flags are sloppy on purpose to agitate the people, divide them in camps and incite hatred (conspiracy theorist, sheeple, truther, etc) and also to lower trust in the government as well as the media. I think that's all part of the plan. That's why they regurgitate older hoaxes and will pick up 'truther' arguments and talking points as well as disseminate disinformation to obfuscate public perception. I think it's part of the planned slow destabilisation of the only white country with a large armed christian population.

       The evidences are listed in the posts. They are pieces of information that are factual. Determining what they mean, if anything, remains to be seen. That is a conclusion. Facts I’ve seen are some of the students have a background in film making, have been interviewed in other disasters, have questionable activities during an active shooter event, like interviewing students, have connections to federal agencies, appear to be rehearsing lines. I’m sure you have seen them. Are they a crisis actor? Have to wonder.

       Some of the students have a background in film making so what? It's a course offered in schools world wide that's hardly surprising.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of them have been interviewed during another disaster, David Hogg was interviewed cause his mate got into a feud with a lifeguard over putting a bogie board on top of a bin on the beach, or is that how they train crisis actors?
      </p>
      <p>
       Having a father that is a retired FBI agent is hardly a teenage kid having connections to a federal agency, not only are there thousands of people working for the FBI, but even more than that that use to work for the FBI.

       So yeah your "facts" hold up if you don't apply any realistic critical thinking to them, but that's not quite what a conspiracy subreddit is suppose to be about.

       The thing I feel like needs to be said, and is never said, is that faking an event is much harder than faking a fake. The number of people likely to dissect a double layer fake is extremely small.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a video showing a faked suicide bombing on the front page right now. Yeah, it's plausible that a government would fake that. You know what else is plausible? That someone else would fake that for the express purpose of making you question the government that faked it.

       Any word on how he passed the background checks? I assumed maybe school suspensions wouldnt show up. I never got to that info. I read about the three day loophole and stopped there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The three day loop hole is this. The feds have three days to respond to the background check. If they dont respond in three days the seller can proceed with the sale.  Three days doesnt seem like much time too do a thourough background check if there are red flags

       I think you make some valid points, however you stop at the word "children". Not gonna bash you for that, that's your blind spot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a skeptic asks many questions, such as the ones you presented, but some of us ask one more: are these children really victims?
      </p>
      <p>
       Children have been used in the past to push agendas, so I think that while morally questionable it's a fair question to ask.

       Sorry, but when victims turn into political pawns, that goes out the window, and fast.  Even more so when they want the equivalent of taking all sports cars away because a guy somewhere crashed into a bus of nuns.

       Were the nuns victims?  Sure.  Once the nuns start calling for property to be confiscated from others who have done nothing wrong...now they're actors.  Not in the film/video/media sense of the word, but the other definition:
      </p>
      <p>
       One who takes part; a participant
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect a large portion of folks can't comprehend that idea.  They're participants in a political cause, agents, actors, whatever you'd like to call it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the guy behind the wheel was just nuts?  Is it ok for anyone to be skeptical in any regard to any produced reality?  I'm not saying the kids are film actors, but I will say they've been twisted into political pawns by their own willingness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does everyone make the statements to which you allude?  Of course not.  That's like saying all of conspiracy is a joke because of flat-earthers.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       after all.  However, I do mind when people just blatantly ignore real evidence and just call a thing a 'hoax' when there are real dead people.  What really gets to me is when I think about those people who really lost their children at that school and how unbelieveably anguished they must be when some dumb ass says "stop acting".   Can you imagine the pain something like that might cause you?  Lose a child then have these retards call you a crisis actor?  Unreal.

       You're not going to stop anyone from posing as a member of a "conspiracy" community and then acting awfully simply to discredit everyone and any theories being debated (especially if there is any truth involved). Imagine the headlines "victim further traumatised by death-threats from conspiracy community". It's a very simple and effective tactic. Appealing to people's good nature wont do anything to stop dis-info attacks.  I have a feeling we will be seeing more headlines discrediting conspiracy theorists as deranged in the near future.
