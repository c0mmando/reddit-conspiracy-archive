       Longtime r/conspiracy lurker.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm starting to think we should be less concerned about these small events, and more concerned about the overall lasting effects. The long play.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, I think 20 years ago if this sub existed and there was enough proof (and this sub posts a lot of proof of cover-ups, conspiracies, etc), there would be an uprising. Tons of coverage, and maybe a lot of things coming to light in the media. People might stop believing everything they are told and start listening to the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, it's about control of the children and teens and what they believe as they begin to procreate and create families of mindless sheep believing everything that comes through the tube. It's a long play, perhaps similar to how China is playing the US to become the next superpower. Every shooting, every event, is a small step to erode confidence in "the old way to do things" and usher in an era of government control, slowly but surely. I'm listening to this CNN town hall of the shooting and can't believe people are buying into what is clearly an act, a show. Or perhaps it's not and people are THAT desensitized to violence that they act like it's no big deal and can have full composure after losing friends/family on live TV just days prior. Some say shock, I call bullshit. I'm a parent and a husband, and I can tell you if I lost my wife or kids I'd be seriously thinking of ending my life, not going on CNN, not talking to people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there is still enough common sense, but it's being neutered by the deep state/powers that be/what have you. If someone of major influence (president, past president or cabinet member) came out today and said 9/11 was an inside job, people might be shocked, but then when the next Kardashian baby pops out, interest will die down. Fucking sad, and this is what scares me the most.

       Ok so 2 competing conspiracy theories:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) the libs want to take away guns to suddenly without warning institute a commie gulag state to advance their commie gay agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) the NRA, the gun lobbyists, get paid to pay senators to lie about gun control, and defaulting to blame an "insecure state", offering more guards, more police, more guns as the solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       So (1) is "they are lying about implementing a police state" and
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) is "they want a police state"
      </p>
      <p>
       The common retort to (2) is "but we'll have guns to fight them if we don't like the police state !" and the retort to that is "the police state will have rockets and bombs and drones and surveillance"

       (1) is certainly more fun.

       Deep. But while there are some completing agendas, only one agenda will get through. Interesting to see which one comes out in 10-20 years. We will find ourselves in a much different country.

       Moving past left-right, i do believe both
       <em>
        parties
       </em>
       like police states. That we'll have more in the next 10-20 years, and like DHS/TSA/ICE/NSA/CIA in the last 20, we'll just ignore it as a society and learn to live with it.

       I agree. And ignoring becomes the norm for everyone due to desensitization. I just got to the point where I convinced my family members to believe in a few of conspiracies. They were brainwashed taking everything at face value.

       I agree but the democrats are equally corporatist shills.. i don’t think any democrat has given indication of leaning communist. Both sides in the US are in corporate control.

       Agreed those in the middle. The more libertarian folk are silenced and/or suck at marketing their beliefs. Gotta do more than Gary Johnson and 4/20 24/7 to win peoples hearts and minds.

       It’s because we are stuck in the 2 party system. We need to break that down first - I think that will help with a lot of the political infighting. I wrote in Green Party in GA last year only because Jill needed 10,000 votes in order for the Green Party to even be on the ballot in future elections. We need to break down the 2 party system at any cost.

       If that's what scares you the most, then your head is in the right place.  You speak of the long play. That is exactly what our governments are playing at.  They want to control where we head as a species.  They want to hold the reins back on societal evolution because we're at the end of the path for government.  Government is at a crossroads.  They either oppress our species to maintain a tyrannical control of us all or they get the fuck out of the way and let Liberty guide us along our path of evolution.  Government is currently taking baby steps of increased tyranny. Baby steps because too much too soon and people will wake up and reject them.  The baby steps are increasing to toddler steps. Government is getting impatient. They want a disarmed nation in the US so they can ramp up the oppression and ensure their grip on control.  You see, without government making decisions that benefit them but affect us all, the ideas of our species would be judged on its merits alone.  The best ideas would spread and define us as either a great species or a mediocre one.  Imagine what could happen if we could freely make decisions for ourselves.  I want to give humanity a chance.  What we have now is not humanity, it's slavery.  It's all slavery and it's there because of the greed of the people we elect to rule over us.  They don't want to rule or lead or even take care of us. They only want what we have and that is our Liberty.  The commodity of government.  They trade and sell our Liberty on the global market for money and power.  We are doomed to be mediocre until we abandon these notions of greed.  We must.

       Sounds like a liberterian dystopia to me, as in Ayn Rand gone wrong. It's one thing to value (worship?) the tech entrepreneurs, it's another to dismiss (dispose of) the 90% who are more likely to either work (slave) for them and their grand devices (AI, immortality), or to claim guaranteed subsistence checks in a meaningful-work-less future. The downhill slope is slippery.

       It's our job to set these kids on the right path and awaken them to the constant mental manipulation going on in all forms of news/entertainment. We need to instill in them a sense of inquisitiveness and critical thinking so that they can ascertain for themselves what is real, what isn't, and what motives lie behind the completely legal weaponized propaganda being levied at us on a daily basis.

       Right. We need to stop prescribing benzos and SSRI's for fucking every issue they have. It's ridiculous and creates a completely different brain. One that's more open to influence. I've seen Manor changes in people I'm close with and they are totally different people now.

       We have a medicate first mentality. I can't even count how many times I've heard people in my family recommend immediately getting on anti-anxiety meds any time I or someone else in my family deals with a stressful situation. There are far more healthier and effective ways of dealing with mental health than shoving drugs that are potentially more dangerous than the stressors themselves down our throats.

       I'm very versed in anxieties. Went through some shit myself, been through hell and back, and all without meds. There's no need for them unless you're schizophrenic or something. It's all just a state of mind and it will pass once you regain confidence and control of yourself.

       I'm putting together a political/coaching/anxiety podcast soon that goes over all of this. Sort of a self-help for millennial that can't figure out why they are in debt, why they aren't having sex as much anymore, or need to be offended by everything. There's a place for me to help, make an extra buck, speak out in this world and I'm going to take it.

       It very much is. It's really a double-edged sword. It's a wonderful tool to help enlighten others and get the truth out there but if not careful, it can be used to do exactly the opposite. My son fortunately isn't at the age of using Facebook or Twitter yet but Youtube can be as bad if not worse. I do my best to keep an eye on what he watches and limit his exposure to it.

       The real biggest issue is affordability of life. Housing, medical, food prices are way higher than wages dictate and need to be brought back in line. Combine this with reducing worker rights, we are being turned into wage slaves who have no freedom in life.

       By no means am I in favor of a basic income for all, including those that don't work, but a minimum wage for unskilled workers should be enough to pay for basic amenities only. It's a states issue at that point to put the pressure on people who price gouge food and rent.

       We need to be afraid of the deep state's end goal. What that entails exactly, I don't know. Should you be worried about the little things leading up to it? Sure. We could all be long dead by the time their final goal is achieved.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the willful ignorance of the public is what scares me the most. We either don't want to admit what's happening right in front of us, or we push it away and focus on really trivial crap instead. It's far easier to accept life as we know it right now than it is to admit that we're pawns in a sick game that's probably too big for us to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like you said, someone could come out with undeniable proof of something, and as soon as a celebrity does something it all goes away and the celeb gets all the attention instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't understand how people don't realize how much they're being manipulated through the media and politics. The news plays on our emotions, and politics make us think we have freedom and a voice when the reality is that we don't. Personally, I think all the shootings are to sway the public into willingly giving up their guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr the government would throw you under the bus, back over you, and then light you on fire. Those who speak out against the deep state are promptly 'silenced'. If that doesn't scare you, nothing will.

       Grown ass adults who are relatively smart, will start doing/saying things that are not smart. That's derangement at it's finest. Desensitization of things that really matter and over sensitization of things that don't. The ignorance is truly frightening.

       I think we should fear crypto currency, it has everyone going crazy trying to invest their hard earned money into digital currency. It seems like a plan to finally take away everyone’s money, to only have them have their wealth in a digital world so they can easily be tracked, and withheld from using or taking.

       It’s because we are stuck in the 2 party system. We need to break that down first - I think that will help with a lot of the political infighting. I wrote in Green Party in GA last year only because Jill needed 10,000 votes in order for the Green Party to even be on the ballot in future elections. We need to break down the 2 party system at any cost.
