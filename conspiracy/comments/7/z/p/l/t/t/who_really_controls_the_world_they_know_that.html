        <em>
         Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men’s views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organised, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.
        </em>
        – Woodrow Wilson, 28th President of the United States (1856-1924)
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         So you see, my dear Coningsby, that the world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes.
        </em>
        – Benjamin Disraeli, British Prime Minister
(1804-1881)
       </p>
       <p>
        The advent of the industrial revolution, the invention of a banking system based on usury, and scientific and technological advancements during the past three centuries have had three major consequences. These have made the incredible concentration of wealth in a few hands possible, have led to the construction of increasingly deadly weapons culminating in weapons of mass destruction, and have made it possible to mould the minds of vast populations by application of scientific techniques through the media and control of the educational system.
       </p>
       <p>
        The wealthiest families on planet earth call the shots in every major upheaval that they cause. Their sphere of activity extends over the entire globe, and even beyond, their ambition and greed for wealth and power knows no bounds, and for them, most of mankind is garbage – “human garbage.” It is also their target to depopulate the globe and maintain a much lower population compared to what we have now.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was Baron Nathan Mayer de Rothschild (1840-1915) who once said: “I care not what puppet is placed on the throne of England to rule the British Empire on which the sun never sets. The man that controls Britain’s money supply controls the British Empire, and I control the British money supply.” What was true of the British Empire is equally true of the US Empire, controlled remotely by the London based Elite through the Federal Reserve System. Judged by its consequences, the Federal Reserve System is the greatest con job in human history.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is sad and painful that man’s most beautiful construction, and the source of most power and wealth on earth, viz. scientific knowledge – the most sublime, most powerful and most organised expression of man’s inherent gift of thought, wonder and awe – became a tool for subjugation of humanity, a very dangerous tool in the hands of a tiny group of men. These men “hire” the scientist and take away, as a matter of right, the power the scientist creates through his inventions. This power is then used for their own purposes, at immense human and material cost to mankind. The goal of this handful of men, the members of the wealthiest families on the planet, the Elite, is a New World Order, a One World Government, under their control.
       </p>
       <p>
        Secrecy and anonymity is integral to the operations of the Elite as is absolute ruthlessness, deep deception and the most sordid spying and blackmail. The Elite pitches nations against each other, and aims at the destruction of religion and other traditional values, creates chaos, deliberately spreads poverty and misery, and then usurps power placing its stooges in place. These families “buy while the blood is still flowing in the streets” (Rothschild dictum). Wars, “revolutions” and assassinations are part of their tactics to destroy traditional civilisation and traditional religions (as in Soviet Russia), amass wealth and power, eliminate opponents, and proceed relentlessly towards their avowed goal, generation after generation. They operate through covert and overt societies and organisations.
       </p>

        Professor Carroll Quigley wrote:
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         The powers of financial capitalism had another far reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands to be able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements, arrived at in private meetings and conferences.… The growth of financial capitalism made possible a centralisation of world economic control and use of this power for the direct benefit of financiers and the indirect injury to all other economic groups.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        Winston Churchill, who was eventually “bored by it all,” wrote around 1920:
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         From the days of Spartacus-Weishaupt to those of Karl Marx, to those of Trotsky, Bela Kun, Rosa Luxembourg, and Emma Goldman, this world wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation and reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence and impossible equality, has been steadily growing. It played a definitely recognisable role in the tragedy of French Revolution. It has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the nineteenth century, and now at last, this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their heads, and have become practically the undisputed masters of that enormous empire.

         The High Cabal Exposed by JFK
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        It was in the dark days of World War II that Churchill referred to the existence of a “High Cabal” that had brought about unprecedented bloodshed in human history. Churchill is also said to have remarked about the Elite: “They have transported Lenin in a sealed truck like a plague bacillus from Switzerland into Russia…” (quoted by John Coleman in The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, Global Publications 2006). Who are ‘they’?
       </p>
       <p>
        Consider the 1961 statement of US President John F. Kennedy (JFK) before media personnel:
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         The word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society, and we are as a people, inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, secret oaths and secret proceedings. For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy, that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence. It depends on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific, and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published, its mistakes are buried, not headlined, and its dissenters are silenced, not praised, no expenditure is questioned, no secret revealed… I am asking your help in the tremendous task of informing and alerting the American people.”
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        Secret societies, secret oaths, secret proceedings, infiltration, subversion, intimidation – these are the words used by JFK!
       </p>
       <p>
        On June 4, 1963, JFK ordered the printing of Treasury dollar bills instead of Federal Reserve notes (Executive Order 11110). He also ordered that once these had been printed, the Federal Reserve notes would be withdrawn, and the Treasury bills put into circulation. A few months later (November 22, 1963) he was killed in broad daylight in front of the whole world – his brains blown out. Upon assumption of power, his successor, President Lyndon Johnson, immediately reversed the order to switch to Treasury bills showing very clearly why JFK was murdered. Another order of JFK, to militarily disengage from the Far East by withdrawing US “advisors” from Vietnam, was also immediately reversed after his death. After the Cuban crisis JFK wanted peaceful non-confrontational coexistence with the Soviet Union and that meant no wars in the world. He knew the next war would be nuclear and there would be no winners.
       </p>
       <p>
        The defence industry and the banks that make money from war belong to the Elite. The Elite subscribes to a dialectical Hegelian philosophy, as pointed out by Antony Sutton, under which they bring about ‘controlled conflict’. The two world wars were ‘controlled conflicts’! Their arrogance, their ceaseless energy, their focus, their utter disregard for human life, their ability to plan decades in advance, to act on that planning, and their continual success are staggering and faith-shaking.
       </p>
       <p>
        Statements by men like Disraeli, Wilson, Churchill, JFK and others should not leave any doubt in the mind of the reader about who controls the world. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt wrote in November 1933 to Col. Edward House: “The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centres has owned the government since the days of Andrew Jackson.” It may be recalled that Andrew Jackson, US President from 1829-1837, was so enraged by the tactics of bankers (Rothschilds) that he said: “You are a den of vipers. I intend to rout you out and by the Eternal God I will rout you out. If the people only understood the rank injustice of our money and banking system, there would be a revolution before morning.”
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Interlocking Structure of Elite Control
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        In his book Big Oil and Their Bankers in the Persian Gulf: Four Horsemen, Eight Families and Their Global Intelligence, Narcotics and Terror Network, Dean Henderson states: “My queries to bank regulatory agencies regarding stock ownership in the top 25 US bank holding companies were given Freedom of Information Act status, before being denied on ‘national security’ grounds. This is ironic since many of the bank’s stockholders reside in Europe.” This is, on the face of it, quite astonishing but it goes to show the US government works not for the people but for the Elite. It also shows that secrecy is paramount in Elite affairs. No media outlet will raise this issue because the Elite owns the media. Secrecy is essential for Elite control – if the world finds out the truth about the wealth, thought, ideology and activities of the Elite there would be a worldwide revolt against it. Henderson further states:
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         The Four Horsemen of Banking (Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo) own the Four Horsemen of Oil (Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP Amoco and Chevron Texaco); in tandem with other European and old money behemoths. But their monopoly over the global economy does not end at the edge of the oil patch. According to company 10K filings to the SEC, the Four Horsemen of Banking are among the top ten stockholders of virtually every Fortune 500 corporation.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        It is well known that in 2009, of the top 100 largest economic entities of the world, 44 were corporations. The wealth of these families, which are among the top 10% shareholders in each of these, is far in excess of national economies. In fact, total global GDP is around 70 trillion dollars. The Rothschild family wealth alone is estimated to be in the trillions of dollars. So is the case with the Rockefellers who were helped and provided money all along by the Rothschilds. The US has an annual GDP in the range of 14-15 trillion dollars. This pales into insignificance before the wealth of these trillionaires. With the US government and most European countries in debt to the Elite, there should be absolutely no doubt as to who owns the world and who controls it. To quote Eustace Mullins from his book The World Order:
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         The Rothschilds rule the US through their Foundations, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Federal Reserve System with no serious challenges to their power. Expensive ‘political campaigns’ are routinely conducted, with carefully screened candidates who are pledged to the program of the World Order. Should they deviate from the program, they would have an ‘accident’, be framed on a sex charge, or indicted in some financial irregularity.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Elite members operate in absolute unison against public benefit, against a better life for mankind in which the individual is free to develop his or her innate creativity, a life free of war and bloodshed. James Forrestal, the first Secretary of Defence of the US, became aware of Elite intrigue and had, according to Jim Marrs, accumulated 3,000 pages of notes to be used for writing a book. He died in mysterious circumstances and was almost certainly murdered. His notes were taken away and a sanitised version made public after one year! Just before he died, almost fifteen months before the outbreak of the Korean War, he had revealed that American soldiers would die in Korea! Marrs quotes Forrestal: “These men are not incompetent or stupid. Consistency has never been a mark of stupidity. If they were merely stupid, they would occasionally make a mistake in our favour.” The Bilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission and the mother of all these, The Royal Institute of International Affairs, are bodies where decisions about the future of mankind are arrived at. Who set these up and control them? The “international bankers” of course.
       </p>
       <p>
        In his book The Secret Team: The CIA and Its Allies in Control of the United States and the World, Col. Fletcher Prouty, who was the briefing officer to the President of the US from 1955-1963, writes about “an inner sanctum of a new religious order.” By the phrase Secret Team he means a group of “security-cleared individuals in and out of government who receive secret intelligence data gathered by the CIA and the National Security Agency (NSA) and who react to those data.” He states: “The power of the Team derives from its vast intra-governmental undercover infrastructure and its direct relationship with great private industries, mutual funds and investment houses, universities, and the news media, including foreign and domestic publishing houses.” He further adds: “All true members of the Team remain in the power centre whether in office with the incumbent administration or out of office with the hard-core set. They simply rotate to and from official jobs and the business world or the pleasant haven of academe.”

        <strong>
         Training the Young for Elite Membership
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        It is very remarkable as to how ‘they’ are able to exercise control and how ‘they’ always find people to carry out the job, and how is it ‘they’ always make the ‘right’ decision at the right time? This can only be possible if there exists a hidden program of inducting and training cadres mentally, ideologically, philosophically, psychologically and ability-wise, over prolonged periods of time and planting them in the centres of power of countries like the US, UK, etc. This training would begin at a young age in general. There must also be a method of continual appraisal, by small groups of very highly skilled men, of developing situations with ‘their’ men who are planted throughout the major power centres of the world so that immediate ‘remedial’ action, action that always favours Elite interests, can be taken. How does that happen?
       </p>
       <p>
        It is in finding answers to these questions that the role of secret societies and their control of universities, particularly in the US, assumes deeper importance. The work done by men like Antony Sutton, John Coleman, Eustace Mullins and others is ground breaking. Mankind owes a debt to such scholars who suffer for truth but do not give in. Whenever you trace the money source of important initiatives designed to bring about major wars, lay down policies for the future, enhance control of the Elite over mankind, etc., you will invariably find them linked to the so called banking families and their stooges operating out of Foundations.
       </p>
       <p>
        In April 2008 I was among approximately 200 Vice Chancellors, Rectors and Presidents of universities from Asia, Africa, Europe and the US at a two day Higher Education Summit for Global Development, held at the US State Department in Washington DC. The Summit was addressed by five US Secretaries, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The real emphasis throughout the Summit was only on one thing – that universities in developing countries operate in partnership with foundations so that global problems could be solved! These are private foundations and the only way to understand this emphasis is to realise the US government is owned by those who own these foundations. As an aside the inaugural address was delivered by the war criminal responsible for millions of deaths in Rwanda, trained in US military institutions, and awarded a doctorate – Dr. Paul Kagame! The very first presentation was made by the CEO of the Agha Khan Foundation!
       </p>
       <p>
        In a fascinating study of the Yale secret society Skull and Bones, Antony Sutton uncovered numerous aspects of profound importance about this one society. In his book America’s Secret Establishment – An Introduction to the Order of Skull &amp; Bones, Sutton points out there is a set of “Old Line American Families and New Wealth” that dominates The Order (of Skull &amp; Bones) – the Whitney family, the Stimson family, the Bundy family, the Rockefeller family, the Harriman family, the Taft family, the Bush family, and so on. He also points out that there is a British connection:
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         The links between the Order and Britain go through Lazard Freres and the private merchant bankers. Notably the British establishment also founded a University – Oxford University, and especially All Souls College at Oxford. The British element is called ‘The Group’. The Group links to the Jewish equivalent through the Rothschilds in Britain (Lord Rothschild was an original member of Rhodes’ ‘inner circle’). The Order in the US links to the Guggenheim, Schiff and Warburg families… There is an Illuminati connection.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        Every year 15 young men, and very recently women, have been inducted into The Order from Yale students since 1832. Who selects them? A study of the career trajectories of many of those ‘chosen’ shows how they rise to prominence in American life and how their peers ensure these men penetrate the very fabric of important US institutions. They are always there in key positions during war and peace, manipulating and watching ceaselessly.
       </p>
       <p>
        The influence of the Elite families on the thought processes of nations is carried out through academic institutions and organisations, as well as the media. Sutton writes:
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         Among academic associations the American Historical Association, the American Economic Association, the American Chemical Society, and the American Psychological Association were all started by members of The Order or persons close to The Order. These are key associations for the conditioning of society. The phenomenon of The Order as the FIRST on the scene is found especially among Foundations, although it appears that The Order keeps a continuing presence among Foundation Trustees… The FIRST Chairman of an influential but almost unknown organisation established in 1910 was also a member of The Order. In 1920 Theodore Marburg founded the American Society for the Judicial Settlement of Disputes, but Marburg was only President. The FIRST Chairman was member William Howard Taft. The Society was the forerunner of the League to Enforce Peace, which developed into the League of Nations concept and ultimately the United Nations.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        The United Nations is an instrument of the Elite designed to facilitate the setting up of One World Government under Elite control. The UN building stands on Rockefeller property.

         Selecting Future Prime Ministers to Serve the New World Order
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        In his article, ‘Oxford University – The Illuminati Breeding Ground’, David Icke recounts an incident that demonstrates how these secret societies and groups, working for the Elite, select, train and plan to install their men in key positions. In 1940 a young man addressed a “study group” of the Labor Party in a room at University College Oxford. He stressed that he belonged to a secret group without a name which planned a “Marxist takeover” of Britain, Rhodesia and South Africa by infiltrating the British Parliament and Civil Services. Since the British do not like extremists they dismiss their critics as ‘right-wingers’ while themselves posing as ‘moderates’ (this seems like the anti-Semitism charge by ADL, etc. whenever Israel is criticised). The young man stated that he headed the political wing of that secret group and he expected to be made Prime Minister of Britain some day! The young man was Harold Wilson who became Prime Minister of Britain (1964-70, 1974-76)!

        All young men studying at Ivy League universities, and at others, must bear in mind they are being continually scrutinised by some of their Professors with the intention of selecting from amongst them, those who will serve the Elite, and become part of a global network of interlocked covert and overt societies and organisations, working for the New World Order. Some of those already selected will be present among them, mingling with them and yet, in their heart, separated from them by a sense of belonging to a brotherhood with a mission that has been going on for a long time. These young men also know they will be rewarded by advancement in career and also that if they falter they could be killed!

        Utter secrecy and absolute loyalty is essential to the continued success of this program. This is enforced through fear of murder or bankruptcy and through a cult which probably takes us back to the times of the pyramids and before. Philosophically ‘they’ believe in Hegelian dialectics through which they justify bringing about horrible wars – euphemistically called ‘controlled conflict’. Their political ideology is ‘collectivism’ whereby mankind has to be ‘managed’ by a group of men, ‘them’, organised for the purpose – a hidden ‘dominant minority’. ‘They’ believe that they know better than ordinary mortals. The Illuminati, the Freemasons, members of other known and unknown secret societies, all mesh together under the wealthiest cabal in human history to take a mesmerised, dormant and battered mankind from one abyss to the next. Former MI6 agent John Coleman refers to a “Committee of 300” that controls and guides this vast subterranean human machinery.
       </p>
       <p>
        In his book Memoirs, published in 2002, David Rockefeller, Sr. stated that his family had been attacked by “ideological extremists” for “more than a century… Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterising my family and me as ‘internationalists’ and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure – one world, if you will. If that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.” That’s it!

       Wow great read. In the book of Daniel,King Nebuchadnezzar is given a dream of an immense statue,showing the progression of world powers. The head was Babylon,on down to the Anglo-Saxon dual world power. It shows the feet being mixed with iron and clay,which can’t be mixed. The iron is these groups you showed us. Then a rock is cut from mountain of God and hurled at image destroying the whole image. Only God can save humanity.

       How are they going to outsmart nature though?
      </p>
      <p>
       If global warming and degradation of natural resources is the main problem our species faces, then what? Their schemes are economic dominance.
      </p>
      <p>
       But nature doesn't care who's got fake money points. These people have no end game.
      </p>
      <p>
       They assumed a planet with unlimited resources and that they can do whatever they want for as long as they want. That's not the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their actions cause global warming. Wealth and economic growth is leading us to catastrophe. What is their solution?
      </p>
      <p>
       All these world dominance games are for what exactly? They will have to go live in a mountain retreat, in the end, right? And they will live six months longer than the rest of us, maybe 12 months more?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have no one to run the power plants and no one to grow your food and no one to protect you, what is the point of empire and dominance?

       I'm thinking you're kidding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bankers are going to prop up fossil fuels as long as they can. They don't have another plan, maybe carbon credits. But oil is the basis for the dollar. Bankers and rich countries cause global warming and lie about it, they don't fix it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want more dollars or more GDP per person, you have to launch more CO2 per person.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't want more CO2 then you have to replace banking and monetism itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bankers aren't going to replace the system they invented. And what would be the alternative to the social control inherent in the financial system?
      </p>
      <p>
       See no one knows.

       Maybe you can explain it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where does oil, gas and coal come from?
      </p>
      <p>
       How are we generating electric power? What fuels planes, barges and autos?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think you can just transform buried oil, gas and coal into a greenhouse gas at ever increasing rates for more than a century and there will be no impact on the atmosphere, ocean, soil and climate? There will be no impact on food and drinking water? You can burn down the forests or carbon sinks and there is no impact?

       The bankers think this is fine. It's not.

       Who is it? well, that's easy. It's a combination of the banker oligarchs of each nation and the people in the secret societies in nearly all institutions. Now what's complicated is figuring out how much of the history we are told to is bullshit and who is truly in charge of everyone.

       Yeah, it's a head one to unravel and tend to shy away from it, because you find so many different people with biases that all point at different people.  I tend to focus on which way the wind is blowing and what notable people have said in the past.  An interesting Charlie (walks around naked) Rose interview I listen to every couple of years was from 2007 with  Zbigniew Brzezinski, Henry Kissinger, Brent Scowcroft.  Also his Alan Greenspan interviews are also very informative in how these globalists think.

       They certainly executed the next phase of their plan with the advent of capitalism in the 1400's or so. Capitalism is a great system for dark secret societies/evil entities to deploy, as it literally demands 'growth' (destruction of the global environment, invasion of every country in the world for resources/profit) for survival of the system. So of course capitalism was always really about transforming earth from a place of light and beauty, to a machine kingdom where humanity is enslaved to a labor machine guided by a very small cadre at the top, (and they in turn, I would argue, are guided by ET intelligence), and which will be 100% locked in with the singularity. Basically, a hostile hijacking of humanity (although I don't think this is the first ET interference in human affairs by ANY means).
      </p>
      <p>
       'Caliban and the Witch' by Sylvia Federici is a great book about the advent of capitalism, and Wes Penre and David Icke are great sources for info about ET interference, the singularity, etc.

       What do you think of Wilcock? I used to follow him years ago but was really put off by him shortly after and never went back to him.

       I enjoy the content, but I can see how all the god/spiritual talk can turn a lot of people off.  It kind of feels as if tries to present himself as a rock star or tony robbins-esque person.  but I like the research and theories.

       Since it is content heavy so much like watching George Webb stuff you kind of have to stand back a bit and not focus too hard on it all and just get through it.

       Yea he seemed to be a bit full of himself and I also started seeing him as disinfo.

       He does have some good stuff, I really liked his earlier stuff on Montauk.

       I actually just found him a couple months back, via David Seaman/Fulcrum News site.  He had a very interesting break down on the vegas shooting.  I'm still needing to get into the older stuff.  Montauk sounds like a good place!

       This looks like a very well researched post, thank you.  It's interesting to me that in past eras, the general population was very wary of secret societies.  They often had to operate in secret.  In this day of information at our fingertips, they can operate out in the open and no one cares.  The Bush family with their skull and bones background, CIA connections are especially interesting.

       My personal TL:DR for you -

      <p>
       The shadows are my cover, 
Trillionaires are my lover, 
The usury under which I suffer,
is attenuated by the bomb blasts muttered,
rather than end the fed for my brothers,
I'll continuously rape the mother.

       Very good read, and a lot of truth in there. But what's with the anti-Marxist and anti-Anarchist tone? Karl Marx and Emma Goldman were extremely opposed to the current banking system. Marx did support a national bank, but one controlled via democratic means and not oligarchs. Anarchists like Emma Goldman are completely opposed to banking.

       Pretty overwhelming amount of truth here. I try not to feel powerles after reading through information such as this and yet how else is someone not involved in the conspiracy meant to feel? Sometimes i wish i didnt know about the truths of the world such as this and could just plod unknowing through life like all the normies
