<p>The mod bans are, in my opinion, a very fishy thing. There are a lot of decisions (in terms of who get banned, etc.) made based on feelings and emotions instead of reasoning and logic. Look at the mod log. There are a shit ton of band. And people wonder why there are sometimes a ton of votes without an equal amount of comments. It’s cause there’s a fuckton of people who have been banned and the only voice they now have is the upvote or downvote arrow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>idk if it&#39;s was ever a matter of posts being buried, but I think the SS have cleaned up our stream of information.

<p>Do you think this rule is mostly for the majority of users who want to be able to browse the entire sub in the short amount of time they may have?</p>

<p>I will disagree with you on memes. Memes are a humorous and concise way to get information across. I would rescind the meme rule, personally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk - that&#39;s a good question. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily for users to save time when they browse, but moreso save time in the sense they don&#39;t need to ask the OP for the context if it&#39;s just a title post with no context. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it certainly can make a post easier to contextualize, but how consistent are the sub statements?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen them run the gamut from walls of text, to vague one liners. Personally, I keep my sub statements as short as possible and usually just ask questions with them.</p>

<p>I still see the &quot;What&#39;s the conspiracy?&quot; line. This was supposed to be one of things that sub statements made less an occurrence of.</p>

<p>While I agree with the theory of Rule 13 &quot;cleaning up the sub&quot;, I&#39;m am skeptical that it has had the intended consequences it sought. Others consistently tell me differently, but I am not having the same experience.</p>

<p>I think if we really wanted to clean up the sub a couple of options would be: Titles must be longer than x number of characters, no post of the same article within 48 hours, and posters are limited to 2 or 3 posts a day.</p>
