        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, if this sub is really down for conspiracies, here is one.  I think FOX is trying to steer the attention away from the students protesting in Florida and have tried to create their own story with CNN, claiming that CNN is force feeding students with pre-made questions and answers. </p>

<p>FOX says that CNN is providing these kids with fake questions and answers, but this kid is the only one to say anything.  After this kid came out and said something, Tucker Carlson interviews him and he can&#39;t stop looking to his right...it looks exactly like he is looking into a teleprompter and getting fed the answers that FOX wants to hear.</p>

<p>This is extremely hypocritical and something that should be looked into.  This wouldn&#39;t be the first time FOX was doing something hypocritical, so I don&#39;t find this idea to be too far-fetched.  CNN also denies feeding this student questions or answers, which may not mean much to some, but with this student answering questions directly from a teleprompter, I don&#39;t find it too hard to believe.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDZb9nDvl3Y">Here is the full interview</a></p>

<p>Just watch the kid&#39;s facial expressions and look where his eyes go every time he talks.  Seems pretty obvious...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, could be a teleprompter or just a producer kind of feeding him answers.  It just seems so weird that he is the <em>only</em> student to say something like this happened...and usually when claims like these happen, news organizations will back away, but CNN flat out denied it on Twitter earlier.  </p>

<p>And yes for all the people who say &quot;of course they denied it&quot;, it&#39;s not that simple...they would draw a lot less attention to themselves if they just hadn&#39;t said anything, but instead they went full counter-attack here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could easily be a distraction to take everyones focus off other areas that are more important to uncovering the truth. Instead of looking at inconsistencies surrounding the event or the news yesterday about the many errors of law enforcement before and during the event as well as the nearly 30 minute delay on the school cameras keeping officers from locating the alleged shooter, we are now focused on a war between FOX and CNN.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how when an actual, rational conspiracy is brought up, so many of you downvote it because it goes against what Trump said...then you tell everyone else to stop with politics on this sub while simultaneously posting Pro-Trump threads like &quot;Trump thinks scientology should lose it&#39;s tax exempt status&quot;...<strong>that post is literally up every single week, yet it is not a conspiracy and he hasn&#39;t done anything about it yet.</strong></p>

He’s a fellow Trump supporter and used the opportunity to make them look like the evil FAKE NEWS he and other Trump supporters mindlessly blast whenever they see those 3 letters together (CNN). </p>

<p>His father said they just had an issue with how long what he wanted to say was and wanted him to shorten it. CNN also denies what he is claiming. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There is absolutely no truth to this. CNN did not provide or script questions for anyone in last night&#39;s town hall, nor have we ever. Colton&#39;s father withdrew his name from participation before the forum began, which we regretted but respected. We welcome Colton to join us on CNN today to discuss his views on school safety.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of TV is scripted or deeply edited. Even your local news is clipping quotes. Tucker Carlson is just as scripted as CNN. You can see him lose interest in what the kids says, cringes at his grammar. That&#39;s why there&#39;s police presence at most Congressional townhalls. They&#39;re not worried about violence, they&#39;re more concerned with police the mic. </p>
