       So, if this sub is really down for conspiracies, here is one.  I think FOX is trying to steer the attention away from the students protesting in Florida and have tried to create their own story with CNN, claiming that CNN is force feeding students with pre-made questions and answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       FOX says that CNN is providing these kids with fake questions and answers, but this kid is the only one to say anything.  After this kid came out and said something, Tucker Carlson interviews him and he can't stop looking to his right...it looks exactly like he is looking into a teleprompter and getting fed the answers that FOX wants to hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is extremely hypocritical and something that should be looked into.  This wouldn't be the first time FOX was doing something hypocritical, so I don't find this idea to be too far-fetched.  CNN also denies feeding this student questions or answers, which may not mean much to some, but with this student answering questions directly from a teleprompter, I don't find it too hard to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDZb9nDvl3Y">
        Here is the full interview
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Just watch the kid's facial expressions and look where his eyes go every time he talks.  Seems pretty obvious...

       I was wondering the same thing. I couldn't figure out what he found so interesting over to his right that he had to keep looking over there. I definitely believe either he had some talking points given to him.

       Yeah, could be a teleprompter or just a producer kind of feeding him answers.  It just seems so weird that he is the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       student to say something like this happened...and usually when claims like these happen, news organizations will back away, but CNN flat out denied it on Twitter earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes for all the people who say "of course they denied it", it's not that simple...they would draw a lot less attention to themselves if they just hadn't said anything, but instead they went full counter-attack here.

       It could easily be a distraction to take everyones focus off other areas that are more important to uncovering the truth. Instead of looking at inconsistencies surrounding the event or the news yesterday about the many errors of law enforcement before and during the event as well as the nearly 30 minute delay on the school cameras keeping officers from locating the alleged shooter, we are now focused on a war between FOX and CNN.

       Conspiracy theories don't always have to be crazy shit that you find some obscure youtube video on to claim that the school shooting is fake ya know...it happens every time.  I'm sure you can find videos that claim the Vegas shooter was fake too, and you'd probably eat that up as well.

       I love how when an actual, rational conspiracy is brought up, so many of you downvote it because it goes against what Trump said...then you tell everyone else to stop with politics on this sub while simultaneously posting Pro-Trump threads like "Trump thinks scientology should lose it's tax exempt status"...

       Tucker would have been better off allowing the student to voice his opinions right there, instead he focused on proving that CNN was in the wrong. Neither story is focused on the kid, he is just a narrative tool.

       All of TV is scripted or deeply edited. Even your local news is clipping quotes. Tucker Carlson is just as scripted as CNN. You can see him lose interest in what the kids says, cringes at his grammar. That's why there's police presence at most Congressional townhalls. They're not worried about violence, they're more concerned with police the mic.
