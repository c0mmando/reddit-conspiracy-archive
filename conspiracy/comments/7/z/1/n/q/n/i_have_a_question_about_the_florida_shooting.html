    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s honestly hard to tell since the video I&#39;ve seen focuses on the body for like all of 3 frames. If I had to guess, it&#39;s possibly Helena Ramsey due to the way the victims hair looks. Or at least I assume the dark mass encircling the victims head is hair. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I had to guess, I&#39;d say the victim in the video was Helena Ramsey, who is definitely not white. Survivor Hannah Carbocci was interviewed on CNN, where she mentions the video and the fact that two students died in that classroom (one being Ramsey). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is correct. I believe her dark curly hair mixed with blood + low video quality makes the clip seem like the person on the floor was African-American/black.

    <div class="md"><p>That’s true. I also wondered about this video when it was going around Twitter last week and the victims’ identities hadn’t been revealed. When the victims were being identified and publicized bit by bit, I kept waiting for someone who would match the deceased girl in the video. Helena Ramsey is the most and only likely candidate. </p>

<p>Not sure why people are even speculating about this since it’s pretty obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s okay to have a different viewpoint. I&#39;ve taken the time to watch the video over and over. It&#39;s grainy and it&#39;s obvious that her DARK hair is in her face. You&#39;re being a bit hypocritical, aren&#39;t you? You&#39;re hoping I&#39;ll agree with you when I don&#39;t. I understand not wanting to take everything at face value. I believe in questioning everything. I&#39;m always called the devil&#39;s advocate, because I want to learn for myself and not take anyone&#39;s word for anything. I don&#39;t care if anyone agrees with me. I was simply throwing it out there that there was in fact a black victim and I believe this to be her. If you research Helena, she&#39;s black (or at least biracial ... her family photos have been released). I&#39;ve taken a look. I&#39;m not sure what else I can do besides watch it 20 more times. Don&#39;t become so blinded by your need to prove everyone and everything wrong that you develop your own bias, which take control of you. You realize that it works both ways, right? I&#39;m being serious and not trying to be an ass or anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, and I’m saying the girl on the floor’s skin color does not match any photos when using photo editing software (“color picker”).</p>

<p>I’m telling you I want to believe, desperately, but when you run the still frame through photo editing software it’s clear the skin tone is not Helena’s. I’ve tried matching to the 10 or so different photos I could find of her, and will continue to try and find out if she has other pics to test.</p>

<p>You can replicate it yourself:</p>

<p>1-Take a still photo
2-Open the photo with editing software or web browser with a color picker feature 
3-Compare color ranges of the still collected with any photos you can find.
4-Compare and see if they are close. </p>

<p>There are tools that do this pretty fine grained.</p>

<p>See for yourself!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen some people claiming that she was white, because you could see her white ankles. I also believed she was white because of that. However, I later saw a full picture and noticed that her face definitely looks black, and now I&#39;m thinking her &quot;white ankles&quot; were actually her socks.</p>

<p>So to address your question, I don&#39;t know how she survived, or why she isn&#39;t on the list of diseased victims.</p>

<p>Sorry this literally doesn&#39;t answer your question but I&#39;m just saying that I definitely think she was a black girl unless someone can find a picture with better quality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I did my research on Sandy Hook and I came to the conclusion that it was a hoax. The optics on this are somewhat similar.</p>

<p>Also I don’t like researching shootings. I just prefer researching what’s happening with the military industrial complex. I prefer figuring out what’s going on in Syria. I prefer looking at the actions of the federal reserve and pick apart how they are manipulating markets and putting people into debt slavery. </p>

<p>So I will assume it’s a hoax simply because I don’t trust anything the government says and I just glance at the headline of some peoples posts on Reddit on this matter and I think “yea that seems plausible.”</p>

<p>Ultimately these shootings don’t matter at all even if it was real and not a hoax, and I took a lot of flack for saying that but it’s true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bingo that is correct. Whether this shooting is real or not I am proud to say that I always lean towards the side of not trusting what the media and the government puts out. The same media that has promoted countless wars that has killed millions and millions of people. The same government that continues to fight bullshit wars on terrorism as they continue to infringe on our freedoms at home. The same media and government that refuses to alert us about the federal reserve and how they are destroying our currency and ensuring we live lives full of debt which ultimately limits us from living life and moving up the economic ladder. </p>

<p>So I’m glad I believe this shooting was a total hoax. I’m proud I don’t believe what rich scumbag media moguls who own 95% of the press and are often controlled by the sponsor have to say about anything. I’m glad I’m not brainwashed </p>

<p>There were literally more than 3,000 students attending that high school. Are they all in on it too? </p>

<p>Are the families of the children who died entirely made up of paid actors?</p>

<p>Is the federal government, including the president, and the state government, including the governor, in on it too?</p>

<p>And you wouldn&#39;t just need security and a handful of actors. You&#39;d also have to pay off the guy to pretend to be the shooter and spend the rest of his life in prison. You&#39;d need to pay off the police, you&#39;d need to pay off the paramedics, you&#39;d need to pay the hospital to wrap a few of your actors up in bandages and pretend they&#39;re in mortal danger.</p>

<p>Just paying security and a few crisis actors wouldn&#39;t cut it for a job like this.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s more likely? All of these people were paid off or hired actors, and of the potentially thousands of people who would have to be directly involved in the hoax, not a single person let the word out?</p>

<p>Or some guy shot up a high school and killed a bunch of kids?</p>

<p>This shouldn&#39;t even be a question. Obviously you haven&#39;t thought this through that much</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is a joke, right? The fire alarm went off <em>after</em> the shooting started. The students didn&#39;t just hear a fire alarm, gather on the lawn in front of the school, and then security and crisis actors snuck in and did the operation. </p>

<p>Students on the other side of the campus heard the fire alarm, left their classrooms briefly, and then were promptly told to get the fuck back inside because someone was firing a gun. </p>

<p>No one left the school because of the fire alarm, so it couldn&#39;t have happened this way.</p>

<p>And did you not see the videos several of the students were taking as it was happening? There was a video of the shooter shooting through the wall of one classroom into the one next door.</p>

<p>If just the people in the videos alone were the only people there, there&#39;d be way more than 30 crisis actors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And what would they need to do? Pay maybe 10 paramedics to be in on it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope.  Several dozen paramedics would have to be in on it. But not only that, they&#39;d need to make absolutely certain that exactly these paramedics and only these paramedics arrived at the scene, where they were getting lots of 911 calls from. </p>

<p>Also, they&#39;d need to pay off a lot of the hospital staff too. Remember, lots of these kids(or actors) had to go to the hospital and are <em>still</em> in the hospital, being treated for bullet wounds. </p>

<p>You&#39;d have to pay off everyone who would deal with them to pretend they actually had bullet wounds. Pretty much the entire hospital would have to be involved in order to make it work.</p>

<p>Otherwise people who actually work there would be like, &quot;Well this team of 40 doctors and staff who we&#39;ve never seen before suddenly showed up and only they and they alone are allowed to deal with the shooting victims&quot;, and the jig would be up.</p>

<p>So, to lay it all out, the president of the United States teamed up with the governor of Florida and they staged this operation involving:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Dozens of paid paramedic actors</p></li>
<li><p>Dozens of paid police actors to arrest the guy</p></li>
<li><p>Dozens of paid child victim actors</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of kids who actually attend the school, paid off to pretend that they knew the victims. Otherwise, of the 3,000 students there, it&#39;d become quickly apparent that not a single one of them knew the victims or the people who were injured.</p></li>
<li><p>Lots of hired actors to pretend to be the victim&#39;s family</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of people paid off at the hospital to keep up a charade that the survivors, who are also actors, had bullet wounds</p></li>
<li><p>One hired actor to pretend to be the shooter and spend the rest of his life in prison</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is literally the bare minimum you&#39;d need to pull this off. You would need <em>way</em> more than 30 minions, or it&#39;d be super easy to poke holes in what happened and you wouldn&#39;t fool anyone. </p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t be some fringe conspiracy, students at the school would be like &quot;I&#39;ve literally never seen a single person who was shot in all the years I&#39;ve attended this school&quot;. People at the hospital would be like &quot;I&#39;ve literally never met a single person, of the dozens of people, who worked on the victims&#39; wounds&quot;. The official story would never get off the ground. And since the president himself is personally behind it, they couldn&#39;t take risks like that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The powers that be have infinite amounts of money basically, and you act like nothing of this sort could even be feasible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s not feasible. I&#39;m asking you, and you&#39;ve never answered, which is <em>more</em> feasible?</p>

<p>All this stuff happened? Or some guy got a gun and shot up a school?</p>

<p>Why do you think it&#39;s impossible for someone to do something like that? That it&#39;s so unlikely, that it&#39;s more likely that the president himself teamed up with the governor to orchestrate a well executed hoax?</p>

<p>Even if the fed was looking out for our best interests, which is just an absolutely absurd statement, but even if they were I don’t want so much power to be so centralized in a private institution that is very secretive in the way they operate and our own government doesn’t investigate or audit them. </p>

<p>Though the government is not totally evil it is certainly the most evil thing I can think of. Just think of all the massive genocides that have been carried out by the government.

Also you go on to say you dont want so much power centralized in a private institution, and then go on to say govt is the most evil thing on the planet... so who gets the central banking power in your utopia?</p>

<p>You dont have a framework for your beliefs. I dont think youve taken that long introspective look at why you believe the things you believe. Govt doing terrible things is a fact, their ultimaye untrustworthyness is a fact... buf the reasons behind those facts and your need for everything to have some locus of control behind it I think requires some more thought on your part.

<p>I’m not saying you’re wrong, but I’m offering a counter point that COULD be an explanation, but you seem to just not care, and that’s the big issue with people who actually want to look at all angles before making assumptions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at it from the lens of “Hey, we thought this was supposed to be fake, why did our classmates actually get shot?”</p>

<p>Nobody seems to be worried about a shooter coming back, they looked traumatized in sense, with some continuing to think they are ‘acting’.</p>

<p>Someone slipped a real ammo shell into a gun swat thought would be filled with blanks.</p>

<p>Yes, this is much more scary than some lone shooter bs, isn’t it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was a question I’ve been trying to answer myself before forming any judgement on this event. The snap video with the black girl on the floor was initially scary, but then I saw a few details that didn’t fit.</p>

<p>Two striking issues, among others:</p>

<p>1) The black girl ignored and left for dead on the floor is not listed as a victim, and is not listed as an injured student. She was potentially ‘triaged’ due to her appearing deceased. What happened to this person? </p>

<p>2) The boy in the gray jacket leaving with the students as they evacuated appeared to be ‘faking’ a bullet to his arm, holding his left arm as they vacated the classroom. It’s possible he was having a heart attack, but the fake groan sound indicated he may not have been shot. It didn’t sound quite authentic. It’s possible he was dealing with ‘trauma’.</p>

<p>When combining these two questionable elements along with the fact many students expected a ‘live fire’ code red crisis as reported now by two separate students on live TV, it appears one of a few possibilities exist:</p>

<p>Likely: It was a staged event with students prepared and ready to ‘act scared’ and record the event as it happened. It was well acted, recorded, and had enough realism to go viral.</p>

<p>Also Likely: A staged event went live with one or more shooters, likely the swat who thought they had blanks loaded but didn’t...maybe intentionally or unintentionally when using live ammo? Until more details come out, this could end up ringing true.</p>

<p>Least Likely: A single shooter from the student population killed a bunch of classmates and calmly blended in with the chaos to escape and eat McDonald’s and Subway before heading to his new home. </p>

<p>The gunman’s father figure in the home he was living with at the time of the shooting was a military intelligence analyst, and the main mouthpiece for the students seems to be a camera hog with a father in the FBI. </p>

<p>Oh, and this is Debbie Wassermann Schultz home district.</p>

<p>These details could not add up to anything but spook.y.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, silly you. </p>

<p>There is a difference between saying something is fake and something is misrepresented. </p>

<p>Keep an open mind, and use Cartesian Doubt whenever possible. We are in the midst of an information war, and your ability to sort and filter for true authenticity is extremely valuable.</p>

<p>It’s a morale obligation to allow our colleagues to question, observe, and conclude findings of opinion and fact on one’s own journey.</p>

<p>Who are you to say my quest for real knowledge should happen in any certain way?</p>

<p>HOW DARE YOU QUESTION MY LIBERTY.</p>

<p>Edit: Removed insult and would like to re-assert that we have no idea who lays DEAD in the video which everyone thinks is real and authentic. </p>

<p>Can anyone link to the dead black girls identity from the video or not? </p>

<p>I’m not sure if you were trolling at the end there, but it’s not ruining your quest for knowledge to tell you you’re wrong. There’s a community in mourning, parents who have lost children. Do you not think it insulting to insinuate these deaths were not even real?</p>
