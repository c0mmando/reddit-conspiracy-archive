<p>This seems like cognitive dissonance because anyone &quot;thinking freely&quot;, and who is aware of conspiracies, must know that we cannot trust government. Nevertheless, it seems like a majority here see government as the solution instead of the problem.</p>

<p>Given all the cover ups and contradictions surrounding shootings, it should not be controversial here to ask if government could also be playing some role in causing these shootings--and yet it seems frowned upon.</p>

<p>I have only been here about two months, but even in that time it seems like many new people have arrived and are the cause of change here--but I have insufficient data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What sort of evidence do you want?  There&#39;s plenty of lefty arguments for gun rights and left wings orgs pushing them.  That&#39;s rare for liberals, and while there are pro-gun liberal groups they&#39;re fairly small and uninfluential relative to the size of the respective groups (compare the relative size of r/socialistra and r/liberalgunowners to the relative size of r/socialism and r/politics).  The politicians suggesting significant gun control and the Barbara Boxers, not the Bernies.  And the lefties are far far more likely to want to disarm the government, and so don&#39;t face the same hypocrisy issue liberals do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what your saying but the government has advance weapons far beyond what the public holds. Its pretty obvious any corrupt gov in the future would be able to lie to its population and majority of the people would fall for it. However, with a gov so good at manipulation anyone with guns would not matter because they too would fall for false ideas in order to defend their side of the team. Look at your political belief and those on the opposite party. Im willing to bet you are quick to belive any conspiracy theory that confirms your pre existing beliefs, but would be quick to say those conspiracys or factsthat go against your belifs are fake. Fake shit is everwhere and can look like real stuff if you buy into it. Then you become stuck in your echo chamber surrounded by fake stuff that is building your political beliefs. No amount of guns can save you. Only education and not bekng quick to judgment would. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Please educate yourself. The &quot;no-fly list&quot; is arbitrary and is subject to grave mistakes. It should not be used to revoke someone&#39;s rights because it can be abused/misused and is a denial of due process. </p>

<p>That being said, some convicted criminals cannot legally purchase firearms. Wanted terrorists cannot legally purchase firearms. So your argument is completely moot.</p>

<p>Your &quot;minor regulations&quot; already exist and do nothing to hinder a criminally-minded person from obtaining a weapon of choice, since it would be obtained <em>outside</em> the legally-regulated means.</p>

The news blows it out of proportion. 40000 people will die from second hand smoke in the US this year. 450000 from tobacco in general.

So really, our shit is together. People are safer than when I was growing up 30 years ago. Crime rates are down.</p>

I mean the current population isn&#39;t putting up a fight even though we have gradually dropped farther and farther into debt, prices have gone substantially higher, but the average wage stays relatively stagnant.

When I left uni I didn&#39;t know a single other person who thought 9/11 was a false flag.  Now I&#39;d say it&#39;s 50/50 among my acquaintances and family, and few of them are conspiracy theorists.
