    <div class="md"><p>It’s funny bc Assange is one of the few twitter notifications I have set up so when you say he’s dead I feel like you’re talking about someone that I hear from often. I went to Youtube looking for video evidence and there isn’t much that is verifiable 2017 video interviews. I do believe he is alive, but at the same time I thought it would be much easier for me to march in here with a link and smugly debunk you. Pretty freaky stuff going on these days indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do believe Assange was probably killed.    </p>

<p>What I don&#39;t buy is the alleged reason.  What exactly has he done that is dangerous to the establishment?  If you know that politics is mostly a dog and pony show, and the politicians themselves are very expendable, has he actually done anything harmful or dangerous to the assholes who run the the US?  I don&#39;t think so.  World has kept turning.    </p>

<p>I think it more likely that he was a Russian asset.  Leaking politically embarrassing info has no effect on a nation of fake politics (the game is the same now as it was before Wikileaks), but could be used as a precision weapon against the US &#39;deep state&#39; by a foreign government.    </p>

<p>Why would Putin want an asset working against the Bush/Clinton cabal if he&#39;s making secret deals with them and is all buddy-buddy with them?  Because he&#39;s not buddy-buddy with them.  Assange was a dagger slowly turning in their backs, and the uranium deal was ammunition for the future (now).    </p>

<p>Think about early Wikileaks.  All started with video footage of a helicopoter pilot firing on iraqi civilians.  Continued on with other political bullshit designed to weaken our &#39;war on terror&#39;.  Now it&#39;s all about NSA spying and rootkits and your smart TVs spying on you.  Keep in mind also the clinton emails, and the &#39;extras&#39; found in the JFK files release.   </p>

<p>What changed?  The russian puppet is dead, and now the deep state can attribute whatever the fuck they want to his name.  Why the hell would the deep state want us knowing about the fucked up shit the CIA and NSA are doing?  Because there are factions, and there was a fundamental shift in the balance of power this election cycle.   I&#39;m not sure I understand who&#39;s who, or what&#39;s what, or who if anyone I should root for... but for sure, things are different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>in a nutshell, &quot;Q&quot; was a person who posted on 4chan and made some pretty wild claims about Trump fighting the &quot;Deep State&quot; and all the satanic democrats (isn&#39;t it odd how the republicans aren&#39;t ever satan worshipping?)</p>

<p>but most importantly, this post really stroked the confirmation bias of a lot of trump supporters who have been having trouble reconciling his terrible actions with what they thought he would do. this post assured them all that it&#39;s all going to plan, and that soon (any day now!) the mast plan would be complete, the swamp would be drained, and everyone would see Trump as the savior of mankind.</p>

<p>in that original post, they predicted that on 11-3 to 11-5, tons of top level officials would be indicted (because mueller isn&#39;t actually investigating trump-russia, that&#39;s just a trick, he is really investigation the democrats!!! according to Q) and they specifically predicted Podesta, Clinton, Obama, and Abedin would all be indicted and taken into custody.</p>

<p>Also predicted that Trump would declare martial law, and use the marine corps to launch a frontal assault on the CIA headquarters.</p>

<p>So, when literally none of that happened, Q kept posting and referencing current events and stringing people along.</p>

<p>So far, none of their predictions have come true. literally none.</p>

<p>but despite that, all these people keep posting about it and doing mental backflips trying to justify how it&#39;s all still true somehow.</p>

I kind of believe it&#39;s a psyop because I just couldn&#39;t get anything fruitful to happen and the people trying to help just really wouldn&#39;t answer the hard questions. It became more about finding hidden bits of data within wallets and piecing together multiple wallets.</p>

<p>Then it was finding corrupted transactions and spitting out whatever good bits came out with a program and piecing those together. It just continued to get more convoluted and I couldn&#39;t understand why they couldn&#39;t be more direct. They could of easily figured out a simple method of dispensing the keys to the insurance files if they really wanted.</p>

<p>Maybe Assange was really kidnapped and they backed off once they realized they were serious about dropping the files. I don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno, I constantly see people complaining about &quot;The Cabal&quot; doing X when X is literally only possible because of their ownership of capital. The media lies and is beholden only to their owners, not the citizens. Banks lie cheat and steal and, really, any other capitalist institution does the same in order to achieve maximum profit. The big players trick the smallfolk into defending this state of affairs by framing things such that it revolves around small business (the petite bourgeoisie) when in reality the vast majority of our economic and political life is controlled by billionaires and corporate conglomerates. Controlled in ways that are literally only possible because of their ownership of these things. </p>

<p>And people have been talking about this since capitalism was new, but there&#39;s been so much Cold War brainwashing (gee, why would the MIC want to poison the well here?) that people think capitalism = good and socialism = satan.</p>

<p>Also most people don&#39;t even know that socialism describes a wide range of economic and political ideologies. It doesn&#39;t mean &quot;the state owns everything.&quot; There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism">forms of socialism which even preclude the existence of a state</a>. Funny to me, too, how the most successful example of that form of socialism was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Catalonia">crushed between the Fascists and Marxists</a> (since so many people here believe Marxism to be part of some ZOG conspiracy).</p>

<p>Anyway, here&#39;s a quote I like from a 19th century Russian prince:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In our civilized societies we are rich. Why then are the many poor? Why this painful drudgery for the masses? Why, even to the best-paid workman, this uncertainty for the morrow, in the midst of all the wealth inherited from the past, and in spite of the powerful means of production, which could ensure comfort to all, in return for a few hours of daily toil?</p>

<p>The socialists have said it and repeated it unwearyingly. Daily they reiterate it, demonstrating it by arguments taken from all the sciences. It is because all that is necessary for production – the land, the mines, the highways, machinery, food, shelter, education, knowledge – all have been seized by the few in the course of that long story of robbery, enforced migration and wars, of ignorance and oppression, which has been the life of the human race before it had learned to subdue the forces of Nature. It is because, taking advantage of alleged rights acquired in the past, these few appropriate today two-thirds of the products of human labour, and then squander them in the most stupid and shameful way. It is because, having reduced the masses to a point at which they have not the means of subsistence for a month, or even for a week in advance, the few can allow the many to work, only on the condition of themselves receiving the lion’s share. It is because these few prevent the remainder of men from producing the things they need, and force them to produce, not the necessaries of life for all, but whatever offers the greatest profits to the monopolists. In this is the substance of all socialism.</p>

<ul>
<li>Peter Kropotkin, <em>The Conquest of Bread</em> </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s another quote I like from Albert Einstein (hopefully his being a Jew doesn&#39;t mean my essay gets docked points):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. <strong><em>This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature.</em></strong> The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. <strong><em>Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Albert Einstein, <a href="https://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/">Why Socialism?</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The Einstein quote in particular... I&#39;m just blown away that it&#39;s not <em>obvious</em> to everyone. Especially when we&#39;re sitting here, dicks in hand, complaining about <em>the exact phenomenon he is describing</em> whenever we talk about our political parties being bought or the Mainstream Media having an agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Centrally planned economies don&#39;t work. Period. It&#39;s been tried and it&#39;s failed everywhere. Voluntary mutually beneficial exchanges in free markets is the best way to organize an economy. Sorry man, that&#39;s just how it is. What makes your think you will get real information when the state controls the information like in your socialist society you so dearly want. You want the state to be even more powerful and more secretive? I don&#39;t know how anyone can be a socialist and be into conspiricies. Socialism is literally a conspiracy. It&#39;s state authoritarian government that has no regard for the individual. That&#39;s the scariest thing of all. </p>

<p>Free market is a strawman that people hold up as though it actually exists. Adam Smith wrote his economics before the world became globalized and people still think it&#39;s relevant. We&#39;re definitely in need of a paradigm change and it&#39;s not just in economics</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mixed model will work best, why does it have to be one or other. We have a mixed model, but it is broken because we allow monopolies to form, this is where government is suppose to help but it is because of government these were allowed to form in the first place. So the government isn&#39;t stepping in when it needs to, instead it steps in to crush the new upstart companies.  We need reform on our patent laws at the very least for the medical patents, at most a whole reform for the system. </p>

<p>Mixed model is the best model, it is just that our mix model uses the bad from both and puts them together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Breaking them up or injecting healthy new innovative alternatives would be another option. I think taxing them would be the downfall. We don&#39;t want to have a high tax rate. We likely don&#39;t need one. If we had full transparency on where our taxes went. We could reduce the size of government while having a more open and transparent government. The possibilities are endless and we don&#39;t necessarily need to revolutionize our government so long as we just actually impose our laws justly.  We could have true public options where it comes to taxes, and public infrastructure could be crowd sourced. With transparent bidding. No government contracts. Full public transparency in the process. The way we live this 40/per week doesn&#39;t make sense. Try to bring the work week to 25/week. Get rid of the property tax. Help bring down the cost of living. Re enforce the family. And hobbies. We need a healthy society not a society that is full of depressed people, or people so riddled with problems it is common place for one person to be on one drug or another.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed but don&#39;t want to back way from the foundations this country is founded on. What kind of revolution would result in us winning of anything? Serious question because the moment we do any thing alluding to the sort it will be crushed harshly and new laws will be passed subverting our even more of our freedoms. There is no way at this time we&#39;d be able to accomplish that in which you seek. So our only measure in reality is to try to take the fight to them on all fronts. Take to the local government call out all the waste. Hit them hard. Dry up their fundings. By exposing the waste. Plenty of people in the trades know that their is excess spending. Just so they can maintain budgets. Just start exposing it. Expose how the regulations that the government imposes allows monopolies to form. Expose how your energy provider isn&#39;t likely to be a public institution but a corporate one, and one that is likely owned by an over seas entity. </p>

<p>The only way we can over haul the system is to flooded it, with exposure and lawsuits. Drain it of its wealth. Bombard it with evidence and merit based lawsuits. We&#39;ve got the means to do so. I&#39;m not sure about the will. I don&#39;t even have the damn will to change my life. So all that I say is hypocrisy. </p>

<p>Trolls win when you entertain them.  Did you ever hear the expression &quot;don&#39;t feed the trolls&quot;.  It means: <em>don&#39;t feed the trolls</em>.  That&#39;s what they want.</p>

<p><em>Revolutionary</em> Catalonia was <em>an</em> example of a successful implementation of <em>anarcho-syndicalist socialism</em>, which functioned magnificently until it was crushed in part due to the actions of the Marxists in combination with the military advance of the Fascists in Spain. Read a fucking history book. </p>

Of course we see a cartel of elite interests controlling much of what goes in within world of free markets but the system does not by nature require a cabal for it to operate.  </p>

<p>The collective is made up of individuals, how else could you have collective rights than by having the members of that collective respect those rights? And for an example of socialism done well, see Chiapas or Rojava as I said earlier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s simply not true regarding society and government.  There is a difference between society&#39;s unwritten rules and values and the state that administers justice and protection.  I&#39;m all for an efficient government that protects its people and administers justice.  But people - mostly with good intentions - repeatedly see society&#39;s problems as government&#39;s to solve.  And in our foolishness and laziness we abdicate rights and property that all too often never solve the problem.</p>

<p>The scary reality is that you&#39;re funding the very people you espouse to want to take down.  The taxes that citizens pay are merely the collateral on the national debts that are not payable.  Meanwhile there&#39;s always a justification as to why we need to do this or that - which either means taxes are going up or we&#39;re borrowing, piling up debt - and it leaves you with two choices: give up a portion of your property (product of your faculties) or borrow from banks that are your sworn enemies.  In the end, the money and rights you give up for your so called protection is only turned into the equivalent of &quot;state secrets&quot;, which only serve to give the government powers that monarchies and theocracies held.</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t care about Rojava or Chiapas who have local autonomous structures within large states.  Nothing against them and good for them. For all intents and purposes we are talking about federal governments that would have to face all the problems of the modern, technocratic world.</p>

<p>State-socialism does this, but socialism itself is defined by the workers owning the means of production. That can be done without the government seizing an entire industry by force. Worker-owned co-ops exist and show us how socialism can work in society without authoritarian government control. The workers can control the means of production without the government seizing anything. </p>

<p>Also consider the difference between banks and credit unions. Credit unions are owned by the members of the union, and the credit union serves the members&#39; interests. Traditional banks, however, are owned by shareholders and they serve the shareholder. This is also a kind of socialism. The government doesn&#39;t need to seize the private banks and create government-owned public banks to replace them, we just need to practice collectivism that benefits ourselves rather than wealthy investors who own stock. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the thoughtful post.  I&#39;m a member of a co-op and credit union and definitely believe institutions like that give people power.  But that&#39;s not socialism.  That&#39;s society.</p>

<p>I think the problem that many people who support socialism have is they actually don&#39;t understand capitalism and how it works.  Your problem should not be with those who own stock (that&#39;s a lot of people, not just scary white guys!) but with those who manipulate your money system and rig the stock exchange, create asset bubbles and basically just run a casino economy.  But at the same time we are still getting loans from these people, watching their programs, buying their products and consuming their media.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for collectives like co-ops but let&#39;s not pretend that is some substitution for the reality of the 21st century.  We&#39;re talking about super states and corps that have unheard of technology.  At its core socialism is about forcibly or coercively changing an individuals behavior for the benefit of the collective.  And I believe that to be against Nature&#39;s laws...</p>

<p>The problem is the oligarchical collectivism. Capitalism the way we practice it in a mixed economy isn&#39;t itself the problem. The problem is a lack of collectivism among the people, i.e., no democratic representation in government. You&#39;re right that workers need to unite and flex their collective political muscles, but that doesn&#39;t mean we have to throw away the mixed economy we have to purge the capitalism from the system. </p>

When we start to work together and express our intentions to create a society based upon love; our enemy will weaken and we will start to remember how powerful our thoughts and emotions truly are. This is a simulation that our hearts and minds control. Love will bring us into a higher collective vibration and cut off the enemies food supply.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Our eternal duty is to put them down, but we can’t fix it and should just watch carefully as they slaughter us? Your views are somewhat conflicting. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Try reading my comments again. They are not contradictory. This is an ongoing work. There is no silver bullet that will stop this pattern. We must remain aware and vigilant and remove the monsters from the power they so desire whenever they are encountered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These monsters feed upon fear and hate. They are so powerful right now because humanity offers them a all you can eat “hate buffet”. The world is cold and cruel only because we believe it is and we have been deceived about the true nature of reality. Our enemy is a parasite that must keep us in lower states of consciousness to survive. When we start to work together and express our intentions to create a society based upon love; our enemy will weaken and we will start to remember how powerful our thoughts and emotions truly are. This is a simulation that our hearts and minds control. Love will bring us into a higher collective vibration and cut off the enemies food supply. Love is the only way out, and we must believe it and stop the enemy from killing us and our planet. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the view here is horribly naive. The monsters preach to the common desires of man (peace, security, love) and deliver the exact opposite. Historical accounts show again and again that those who desire peace above everything else become the tools of inhumanity. Their overwhelming desire for love and peace make them perfect tools for damnation and brokenness. </p>

<p>From the perspective of someone evil you are little more than a mark who is easily manipulated and abused. Your proposition, while noble at heart is ultimately futile in the face of someone using game theory. </p>

<p>Again, all I can do is request that you read something like the gulag archipelago with an eye towards how virtues can readily be turned into evil when in the hands of bad men. </p>

<p>Q-speak is awesome precisely b/c it presents info in a way that stretches our usual communication patterns.  What seems &quot;WTF?&quot; at first glance actually works.  Whatever the name for the method Q is using (AVID?), its now part of the cultural zeitgeist and people who&#39;d normally never be exposed to Q&#39;s method are going to start adopting it in their daily discourse.  Q-speak has literally shifted, <strong>IS</strong> literally shifting, our entire culture.  And for the better, if Q-speak imroves communication.  All this while becoming a huge cultural touchstone.  <del>Q-speak is the new Yoda voice.</del>  Voice of Yoda, now the speak of Q is.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s even if i thought Q was a LARP.  </p>

<p>Members of the Rothschild reported hearing a “loud bang” and a plume of smoke could be seen above trees.
A member of the Rothschild family said the collision missed her by five minutes.
The woman, who did not want her full name published, said she heard a loud bang while she was driving her car to a dog grooming event, near Waddesdon, in Buckinghamshire.</p>

<p>So, yeah Rothschilds live there, and were at least tangentially involved in the accident. And you&#39;re here accusing people of misinformation when you didn&#39;t read a single article.</p>

<p>If that is truly the order of events, you are right, that is quite astonishing. I mean, usually if we are looking at something that might be a vaguely worded prediction, it’s up to interpretation and quite frankly a lot of times people keep those interpretations loose in order to fit the prediction. </p>

<p>But what are the odds with somebody making shit up, making shit up that maps specifically LdR to Lynn de Rothschild? It’s got to be pretty high. </p>

<p>You are right I think. Astonishing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you go all the way back to the beginning and look over all of the info, it&#39;s pretty mind-boggling. And we were told up front it wouldn&#39;t be 100% correct, but it&#39;s been pretty amazing anyway. Like the take down in Saudi Arabia and martial law being declared. At the time, many were thinking Q was referring to the U.S., but it was SA--Saudi Arabia--and a few days later the whole thing blows open. Who would know that was coming but an actual insider? And the warning about staying away from large venues in the Vegas/Henderson area before the massacre? All the little clues--including who owned the top floors of the Mandalay. The questions in the right order to educate people, the photo heading towards China? I didn&#39;t know what to think, and I realize that not everything can be predicted, but I&#39;ve pretty much bought into this at this point and I&#39;m paying attention. I don&#39;t know how it could be anyone but someone with pretty good intel on the inside, or perhaps a group of people who want us to know there are those working behind the scenes on our behalf. That we are not forgotten. I believe they want the truth out to the people, but  there are a lot who would kill to keep deep state secrets secret. Who else would know all of these things? I mean, really? Step back and look at the big picture. It&#39;s all pretty amazing. What are the odds? I&#39;ve never seen anything like this. And if there&#39;s anyone else out there who has, please elucidate. </p>

<p>As I said before, why do you feel the need to state this? I mean seriously. Who do you thinks needs reassurance about this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly if I hadn&#39;t gotten wind of it so early on, it would look like a huge jumbled mess and I frankly wouldn&#39;t have invested the time to try to get up to speed.  Hell I got into it like 5 days after it started and it took me like a day to catch up on everything.  Getting started now would be more a chore than anything else.  </p>

<p>And about the reassurance, I don&#39;t know.  I just mean it doesn&#39;t matter what anyone does I guess?  Even those anons feverishly working to figure it out.
  I have one toe in the pool, but mostly I&#39;m just watching the news seeing everything happening currently.  It&#39;s crazy.</p>

<p>How can you follow conspiracies your entire life and not see what Q has been doing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong, but how do you think this logically follows? I see what they&#39;re doing as attempting to encourage independent investigation into these conspiracies. That&#39;s great, but it doesn&#39;t prove that they&#39;re anyone important in government or anything. Other circumstantial stuff surrounding Q, like the &quot;+++&quot; shit or things like op is getting at, seems to suggest they could be some kind of insider as is rumored, but someone trying to redpill people on some government-related conspiracies by encouraging investigation could be any anon who is interested in the subject and wants to teach others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go here to get caught up. It is where Q posts now and all discussions on his/her breadcrumbs and things to work on. It&#39;s a lot of info and learning the chan language is tricky at first but, nigger usually is referencing cia as in Cianigger. </p>

<p>They use jews as a metaphor for zionists(I hope). So when they say Gas this Kike it&#39;s like saying, please ban this JIDF shill. Just realize alot of their language has coded meanings while some there are really of the neo-nazi flavor as well. It takes all kinds. Just don&#39;t take everything at face value because it&#39;s a huge group effort with a lot of normies jumping in.</p>

<p>Tips:</p>

<p>Hit catalog, it shows all threads in an easier to read fashion side by side instead of scrolling down and only seeing a few replies. </p>

<p>When viewing threads  people usually link to comments they are replying to and hovering over them will show you that comment. Even if it&#39;s in another thread.</p>

<p>Use open link in new tab a lot. Lots of links to open and read.</p>

<p>You&#39;re saying that it&#39;s a deliberate strategy and that, by and large, these dudes don&#39;t actually hold racist/antisemitic/homophobic beliefs; they&#39;re just trying to be as offensive as possible. So, the rhetoric is not authentic enough to be abhorrent.</p>

<p>The problem with that, for me, is that people who aren&#39;t racist/antisemitic/homophobic (or those who make some effort to try not to be) tend to shudder at the thought of using words like &quot;nigger&quot; and &quot;kike&quot; and &quot;fag&quot; because, well, that shit is disgusting garbage that we generally consider to be the trademark of dumb little idiots who make the world more of a goddamn nightmare than it has to be.</p>

<p>You&#39;re also saying they&#39;ve concocted this puzzling scheme in order to drive away &quot;normal people,&quot; meaning people who aren&#39;t racist/antisemitic/homophobic. So...basically...these people who aren&#39;t assholes act like assholes in order to repel people who also aren&#39;t assholes BECAUSE those people aren&#39;t assholes? </p>

<p>What you&#39;re describing sounds like this: I&#39;m a vegetarian, but I kill dead animals and strap them to myself in public because I really, really can&#39;t stand other vegetarians...In fact, the only vegetarians I like? Yep. You guessed it. Vegetarians who also strap dead animals to themselves because they can&#39;t stand other vegetarians.</p>

<p>Fuckin&#39; yikes, man. Yes, do tell me more about clandestine geopolitical strategies.</p>

<p>So, can you admit that we might both be right? That it is a deliberate strategy AND they&#39;re dumb disgusting assholes who we shouldn&#39;t be disseminating information for?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t personally hurt my feelings, no. At least not those particular words. But there are probably words that would or could hurt my feelings, sure. I pretty much learned to accept that when I was probably 6 or 7, like you did. </p>

<p>I think, or at least I have it on good authority, that those particular words do hurt some people&#39;s feelings though. And by some, I mean a lot of people, when you really think about just how many &quot;niggers&quot; and &quot;kikes&quot; and &quot;fags&quot; there are running around out there in the world. I&#39;d rather those people&#39;s feelings not be hurt if at all possible, basically just so they&#39;re free to sit around and smoke dope and play video games unmolested and uninsulted like I do every day.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Qanon, fbi Anon, Whitehouse Anon... What do they have in common?</p>

<p>They all make vague predictions that result in, generally, the downfall of the DNC and the Clinton&#39;s.</p>

<p>What else do they have in common?</p>

<p>They become active when big news stories about Trump are breaking.</p>

<p>I keep this list of fbi anons handy, it highlights the shotgun approach to the predictions and how months later none of the predictions come true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m no expert but I&#39;ll give it a go. I&#39;m sure someone will correct me if I&#39;m wrong...</p>

<p>Q Anon first appeared on 4chan warning people that were in Las Vegas to avoid crowds before the LV um &#39;incident&#39;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure he (she?) would have any credibility if this wasn&#39;t the case.</p>

<p>Following the &#39;incident&#39; they have been making a series of posts which invite the reader to consider various questions and to follow their dots / breadcrumbs, in addition to posting some weird semi-cryptic shit. It&#39;s all about world affairs, in a nutshell.</p>

<p>People seemed divided about the content - either reading stuff into it and answering the questions, or that the whole thing is bogus, and LARP. Some people believe it&#39;s actually Trump - &#39;Q&#39; is the highest level of security clearance in the US as I understand.</p>

<p>Notably he used the characters &#39;+++&#39; before Trump did in some tweet.</p>

<p>Speculation occurred that there might be more than one Q.</p>

<p>The latest thing to happen is that people have claimed to have deciphered parts of his &#39;code&#39;.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Thing is, 4chan used a similar meme regularly for a few years after someone said &quot;Some of you are cool, don&#39;t go to (name of school) tomorrow&quot;, then the next day, they conducted a mass shooting that resulted in several deaths.</p>

<p>4chan then used it as a meme/joke to use regularly, so it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if that line was similarly meant to be a joke, now they&#39;re getting attention from weird people and reading the net for any crazy theory to allude to for more attention.</p>

<p>A regicide can cause chaos after, but is followed by peace</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency is taking the power away from the banksters, transparency is the new movement, people around the world are becoming more conscious to who&#39;s running the show, and if you&#39;ve ever hung out on 4chan, there have been military folks on there talking about taking out Soros and the R0thschilds.</p>

The realization was striking, and a little bit scary. The way I see it, the options are:
1. Harmless LARPer spewing generalities and laughing at the commotion (most likely)
2. Q is as he says he is, and Trump is playing 5D chess to wipe out the rot and corruption from our country and the world (I highly doubt this, but hey, I&#39;m keeping an open mind)</p>

<p>and the most nefarious possibility, the one that actually scares me 3. Trump-Russia collusion is real, and Q is attempting to prepare the population for Martial Law, to accept it as a &quot;necessary evil&quot;, and to trust that it will end in a more free America. This is false, as this would be the period where we would lose everything, maybe with the help of Russian &quot;liberators&quot;.</p>

Multiple times. You can find this in the collection of Q posts. 
Credibility gained.
 Access to top white house officials. </p>

<p>He correctly predicts the news days in advance. </p>

<h1>FlyAlFly# - Al Franken &quot;leaves&quot; the senate among suspicious circumstances.</h1>

<p>LdR warning, which is stated multiple times in this thread. He mentions LdR in a post, and then two aircraft crash into each other, one pilot dies. That crash happened uncomfortably close to LdR above her own mansion. </p>

<p>Look at the Alex Jones interview on Joe Rogans podcast, he mentions three times throughout that entire video his informant is a shady figure named  &quot;Q&quot;. This is long before any Q happenings, and it should be mentioned that Alex Jones began to successfully &quot;predict&quot; almost everything that is happening right now as we speak. It&#39;s almost like he had some White House insider. </p>

<p>Q is definitely interesting, and worth examining if only to see from another perspective. You&#39;ll wake up if you dive deep enough, but to each his own</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think the Rothschilds care at all about what some random person is posting on . . . 4/chan . . . you&#39;ve seriously deluded yourself. No one, minus a tiny fringe minority, cares about anything said there or here. But it certainly makes one feel important to imagine that people with power and money and free time spend those things caring about the postings of people with no power, no money, and &quot;free time&quot; that is actually anything but free. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump absolutely was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtgMf8OGwUM">Rothschild creation</a>. They have been backing him for <a href="https://americanfreepress.net/who-towers-behind-trump/">years</a>:</p>

<p>Resorts International was established and controlled by front men for the Rockefeller and Rothschild families and their “enforcers” in the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and its allied intelligence agency, Israel’s Mossad...</p>

<p>many of these casino resorts run by the mob through a variety of front men have actually been engaged in a de facto partnership with behind-the-scenes mobsters who have assisted the CIA and the Mossad in massive laundering of drug and gambling profits that have been channeled into covert operations of the two allied
intelligence agencies. In return, the CIA and the Mossad, using their own influence, have provided “protection” for the illegally fixed gambling operations, preventing law enforcement authorities from cracking down on this corruption.&quot;</p>

<p>The thing is, Trump hasn&#39;t generaly been doing what the Rothschilds usually want their politicians to do. He&#39;s been rounding up pedophiles, fighting with the CIA, exposing the fraud that is the media, and so on. Besides supporting Israel and Saudi Arabia, he has done a downright poor job of being a Rothschild stooge.</p>

<p>Either the Rothschilds suddenly became a lot less corrupt or Trump isn&#39;t doing what they want him to do.</p>

Then the banner Happy Baphomet which is an occult diety.  then wearing antlers and owls on their heads. The Rothschilds hosts were painted gold, which is symbolic of something.  </p>

She was there in the room according to Q.  We were all venting our rage over all the horrible things this family has done and she may have been there.</p>

<p>Then someone posted Lynn, this is JB.  There is nothing left to hold on to.  Kill yourself.  Its the least you can do for us.  </p>

<p>Larper, Jeb Bush or other?<br/>
The Bushes are another family who have had control over the world at times but when HRC lost the election the last hope of power faded.  (according to Q, or my interpretation of him.)  What Q literally said was that there were 4 families that controlled the world but when HRC lost the election one was knocked out of power.  My guess is the Bushes.  Soros and Rothschilds are still in control.  Soros replaced the Rockefellers so that just leaves the Bushes.</p>

<p>Tips:</p>

<p>Hit catalog, it shows all threads in an easier to read fashion side by side instead of scrolling down and only seeing a few replies. </p>

<p>When viewing threads  people usually link to comments they are replying to and hovering over them will show you that comment. Even if it&#39;s in another thread.</p>

<p>Use open link in new tab a lot. Lots of links to open and read.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My laptop died with the blockchain on it and I haven&#39;t hard the heart to dig into that autistic mess :). I kind of believe it&#39;s a psyop because I just couldn&#39;t get anything fruitful to happen and the people trying to help just really wouldn&#39;t answer the hard questions. It became more about finding hidden bits of data within wallets and piecing together multiple wallets.</p>

<p>Then it was finding corrupted transactions and spitting out whatever good bits came out with a program and piecing those together. It just continued to get more convoluted and I couldn&#39;t understand why they couldn&#39;t be more direct. They could of easily figured out a simple method of dispensing the keys to the insurance files if they really wanted.</p>

<p>Maybe Assange was really kidnapped and they backed off once they realized they were serious about dropping the files. I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>They all make vague predictions that result in, generally, the downfall of the DNC and the Clinton&#39;s.</p>

<p>What else do they have in common?</p>

<p>They become active when big news stories about Trump are breaking.</p>

<p>I keep this list of fbi anons handy, it highlights the shotgun approach to the predictions and how months later none of the predictions come true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a very limited and superficial grasp of the situation if you ignore the occult aspects involved. </p>

<p>Showing a picture of three presidents hanging out, doesn’t prove anything. Things are different now, and it looks like the Zionist cabal is staging a coup. Mossad runs a gigantic pedo blackmail ring and they are taking down many of their “friends” </p>

<p>There is one enemy that has hated us since our creation and has worked for thousands of years to create the system we are seeing unfold at this moment. Jerusalem is about to knock down the dome of the rock and build the third and final temple. If you haven’t noticed they have a knack for making sure their ancient prophecy’s come true. These are the Jews who say they are Jews but are not. The synagogue of Satan.</p>

<p>But fear not, because we win this war </p>

<p>Pretend it&#39;s about standards, the actual impact is that you ban people for losing their tempers and trolls &quot;win&quot; the discussion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trolls win when you entertain them.  Did you ever hear the expression &quot;don&#39;t feed the trolls&quot;.  It means: <em>don&#39;t feed the trolls</em>.  That&#39;s what they want.</p>

<p>Not to mention that you automatically forfeit the argument when you resort to name-calling and personal attacks.  You think a third party reading through a discussion is going to be convinced by the guy slinging around insults and calling people retards?  I don&#39;t.</p>

<p>The rules are fairly straightforward in my opinion.  You should be able to make your point without personal attacks, and if you can&#39;t then this isn&#39;t the subreddit for you.</p>
