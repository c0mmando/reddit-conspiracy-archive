        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Imagine if Trump didn&#39;t run for office. Imagine if Hillary Clinton had won the Presidency, and was in office this very minute. Do you really think the #metoo movement would be where it is today? I don&#39;t think so.
Whatever you think about President P*ssy-grabber Donald Trump, and I know there is a lot of bad stuff about him to think about, he is the reason all of this is happening. That huge negative tidal wave of hate and accusations that were launched on him backfired, and came back to bite everyone who was against him and even people of his own party. 
I guess it took a man like that to show the world the hypocrisy of many.
I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s a Saint or anything like that, but he is the start of the truth movement. He promised to change things, and I believe he has. I do think he&#39;s still under control by the powers that be, but overall a welcome change to politics overall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So many Anti Trumpers spewing hatred/vitriol without seeing their hypocrisy. I agree, I&#39;m not Trump&#39;s biggest fan, but if anyone even for a moment tries to look at the situation neutrally, there&#39;d be a lot less back and forth shouting matches and more cooperation. What happened to, &quot;when they go low, we go high...&quot; Globalist and mass surveillance agenda was clear with Bush and Obama, I can&#39;t say the same for Trump, yet...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember during the campaign, I saw about 1 negative Trump ad every hour on the hour on either MSNBC or CNN&#39;s Facebook. I forgot where it was, but it was just a constant bombardment of, &quot;Trump says this. Trump said that. Trump hates minorities. Trump grabbed p*ssy.&quot; 
Honestly, it was so much that it made me want to vote for him even more, sadly. Anytime the press is against you like that, it&#39;s either one of two reasons. You&#39;re Hitler, or you are actually trying to change something.</p>

<p>I voted for Trump to prevent the TPP, and it died immediately. If he puts up a border wall, I&#39;ll be very impressed. It&#39;s not so much the immigrants I&#39;m worried about as much as the drug cartels and their products that they bring through. I don&#39;t do drugs at all, but I know that people usually don&#39;t have a hard time finding them. 
I&#39;m shocked that people are so against the wall. Even as a Hispanic myself, I see the need for this country to have one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s crazy to me is that Trump&#39;s actually going through with his campaign promises and people are declaring end of times... Whether his policies are beneficial or not for Americans is a different issue. Even though I&#39;m against big government, I voted Bernie in the primaries because his voting record fell in line with what he was trying to preach. I also voted for the Libertarian party for the presidency so that the party can get a 5% popular vote count to get an automatic ticket to the ballots without having to pay for it, essentially saving them millions in campaign finance. I don&#39;t think having tons of parties is the solution either, it&#39;s terrible in European countries. </p>

<p>I felt the same during the elections. How does it feel to be Hitler? because obviously you&#39;re Hitler since you voted for him, and God help you if you&#39;re white and voted Trump... /s I still remember when he was being attacked with every epithet they could think of, it really numbed me to what should be serious words like Hitler, racist, bigot, homophobe, sexist, etc. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if a wall is really what we need, since illegal border crossing is at a 17 year low and we haven&#39;t even built anything, so we can agree to disagree (maybe a fence with better patrol). With the tech that we have now you could be patrolling the entire border with minimal entry. But still, it was a campaign promise/agenda.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure where I stand with Trump yet mainly because of ridiculous headlines and bias reporting. One thing I do know is what you said in the OP, his election opened the flood gates of hypocrisy, self reflection, and sparked people&#39;s interest in politics. Unfortunately, it&#39;s also a time of misinformation, so I hope people would reserve their emotions and opt for deeper reading into all matters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure Rose McGowan had been speaking out for a long time. Corey Feldman as well. Courtney Love joked about not going to Weinstein&#39;s hotel room, and Seth McFarland did as well.
No one gave a crap about them until recently. Why? The political and social climate changed with Trump. He was this big evil that the media and DNC wanted to take down. It ended up making a lot of people wake up, and want to tell their stories. He was the spark of change, above all else. Keep in mind, Ronan Farrow&#39;s story was buried by NBC for years, because according to them there wasn&#39;t enough evidence. All that changed in this new era. The Trump era, for better or worse.</p>

<p>We&#39;d have the EXACT. SAME. SHIT. Do you not get how this works yet? They select their puppets in advance. </p>

<p>Not only is Trump not a saint, but he&#39;s quite literally a NWO puppet just like Obama, Bush, Clinton, ect before him. </p>

<p>This goofy ambiguous &quot;well at least he&#39;s not hillary and he&#39;s not a saint but he might be a good guy&quot; is pathetic. Quit extending this benefit of the doubt to elite billionaire puppet politicians like Trump, and man up and face what we&#39;re dealing with together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If youre into the stuff the KEK meme has grown into, you&#39;ll know that the god of chaos is also known as the bringer of light. Nothing great is ade without destruction of what was there before. Thats why the US has so far failed in being a free country, the powers that be were never destroyed. Trump is ushering in an age of chaos and destruction of the powers that be. If he were just a plant, he would have thrown the race to have Hillary win. The media would be on his side wnating us to trust him. </p>
