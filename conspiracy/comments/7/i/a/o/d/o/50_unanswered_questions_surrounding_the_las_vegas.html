<li><p>If we are to believe Stephen Paddock is the sole perpetrator of the deadliest mass shooting in American history, then why do we still, after over 2 months, have zero evidence, picture/video of Paddock inside the Mandalay Bay during his nearly a week stay there?</p></li>
<li><p>How was a 67 year old man able to single handedly knockout out 2 HURRICANE PROOF STORM WINDOWS with a hammer?</p></li>
<li><p>Why the need for two seperate broken windows, in two seperate adjoining rooms, when both windows have the same vantage point?</p></li>
<li><p>If we are to believe that Paddock was running back and forth between the two adjoining rooms, then why did the zebra 20 team, once inside 32-135, have to explosively breach the connecting door to gain entry into 32-134?</p></li>
<li><p>Who locked the adjoining door between 32-135 &amp; 32-134?  It could not have been Stephen Paddock, as it would have been locked from the other side, and the body was found in 32-135.</p></li>
<li><p>If there were no shots fired at the Bellagio, then who was the woman reported by control on the police scanner audio, to be inside Bellagio, whispering, and reporting that &quot;suspects are inside with her...&quot; and that she &quot;...can&#39;t talk&quot;?</p></li>
<li><p>Why were there so many guns for 1 gunman?</p></li>
<li><p>What type of guns were found?</p></li>
<li><p>What were the serial numbers of the guns?</p></li>
<li><p>Were bump stocks used or not?</p></li>
<li><p>How many expended brass casings were retrieved in 32-135 &amp; 32-134? </p></li>
<li><p>What is/are the Caliber/round types used? Specific weapons fired? </p></li>
<li><p>Why would Paddock go through so much trouble in planning and executing everything, bringing so many guns, ammo, armor, tools, computers, surveillance, explosives, etc., only to stop shooting way before the endgame, and commit suicide before even being confronted by authorities?</p></li>
<li><p>Why were there &quot;multiple cell phones&quot; found in 32-135?</p></li>
<li><p>Why were there &quot;multiple laptops&quot; found in 32-135?</p></li>
<li><p>What happened to the Hard Drive to one of the laptops?</p></li>
<li><p>Why would Stephen Paddock bring a laptop with no hard drive?</p></li>
<li><p>Why were there &quot;a lot of drills&quot; found in 32-135? What purpose would or did the drills serve?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did they find a cell phone charger that matched none of the other cell phones found in 32-135?</p></li>
<li><p>What was the $100,000 wired to the Philippines for?</p></li>
<li><p>Where did the leaked crime scene photos come from? </p></li>
<li><p>What is the glove or bag around the left hand of the body found in 32-135</p></li>
<li><p>Did Paddock use the service elevator or not?</p></li>
<li><p>Why is there no muzzle fire seen coming from 32-135 or 32-134 in any video?</p></li>
<li><p>What was Stephen Paddock planning on doing with the bomb found in his car?</p></li>
<li><p>Was Stephen Paddock planning on blowing up the fuel tanks at McCarren Airport?</p></li>
<li><p>Why Did Stephen Paddock bother to bring body armor to the room, then not even bother to wear it?</p></li>
<li><p>Why Did Stephen Paddock bother to bring body armor to the room, if he was just going to commit suicide?</p></li>
<li><p>Why was Jesus Campos allowed to leave the country?</p></li>
<li><p>Exactly what company does Jesus Campos work for?</p></li>
<li><p>Why exactly was Jesus Campos on the 32nd floor? Daily Routine? Alarm? Door Ajar?</p></li>
<li><p>Why does Jesus Campos sound so calm and casual for someone who was just shot in the leg, and dodged reportedly hundreds of bullets which came through the door of 32135, as he reports the shots being fired?</p></li>
<li><p>Why was Jesus Campos unlicensed at the time of the shooting?</p></li>
<li><p>David Hickey, President of Jesus Campos&#39; Union, states licensing wasn’t required, is this true?</p></li>
<li><p>When Zebra-20 made entry into Paddock’s room one officer was reported to have fired one round, what was the target?  </p></li>
<li><p>Why was this fact not initially reported to the public, and why did it take the media a month to report this when it was clearly audible in the police scanner audio on Oct 1?</p></li>
<li><p>Who was the &quot;WMA&quot; (White Male Adult) placed into custody from the RV in the Motel 8 lot?  </p></li>
<li><p>What were the contents of his bag(s) that were identified as &quot;suspicious&quot;?</p></li>
<li><p>Who was responsible for guarding residence(s) of Stephen Paddock in Nevada, Texas, California and elsewhere?</p></li>
<li><p>What was stolen from his home after it was burglarized?  Why was the residence in Nevada left unsecured?</p></li>
<li><p>Why the MAJOR discrepancy between initial statement regarding Security Officer Jesus Campos “disrupting” shooter, to the current description that he was shot/injured 6 full minutes prior to the attack on the concert region outside Mandalay Bay (Route 91 Harvest)?</p></li>
<li><p>Exactly which room(s) was Stephen Paddock checked into, and when did he check in those room(s)?</p></li>
<li><p>Was it paid for, or was it a comp’d room(s)?</p></li>
<li><p>Who was officially checked into room 32-134?  Brian Hodge states he was, although a hotel has been produced, showing he was actually in another room.  Was he just mistaken? Was he lying? Was he told to say this?</p></li>
<li><p>If Security, Maintenance AND off-duty LVMPD officers were present on the 32nd floor, prior to mass shooting, why the confusion as to what floor the shooting into the concert venue was coming from?</p></li>
<li><p>Why has the media not acknowledged the car bomb incident at Luxor yet? </p></li>
<li><p>Where did the reports of the shots fired from the 7th floor of the Mirage (2.8 miles away from Mandalay Bay) come from, well over an hour after the shooting at MB ceased?? </p></li>
<li><p>What information was extracted from Mary Lou Delaney? Is she still a suspect? Why have we STILL not heard anything about her side of the story?</p></li>
<li><p>Did anything come of the reported male with a gun in the bathroom at the Luxor, that can be heard on the police scanner audio?</p></li>
<li><p>Where did the report of the &quot;male walking into the employee entrance of the Bellagio with a rifle&quot; come from?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is nowhere near a complete list, please feel free to add your own.  After staring at the same information for 2 straight months, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve left some out.</p>

<p>That&#39;s simplistic.  Why did he want to kill people? </p>

<p>If your conjecture is simply that &quot;he was a nut&quot; then we can look at the history of mass shooters.  In every other mass shooting where the perpetrator had mental problems (Holmes, Lanza, Harris, etc) we knew about it within days, if not hours of the shooting. We had close relatives or friends come forward, and in some cases therapists. Even when the problem was not medically diagnosed, we had people who knew the shooter telling us &quot;this guy had problems.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Killing as many people as possible is not a motive. It is the crime. Motive is the reason behind the crime.“</p>

<p>Thank you. I’ve been saying something similar about evidence. LVPD/FBI saying “This is what happened” is not evidence. Evidence is the reason why they think this is what happened. </p>

<p>There is no evidence we’re privy to that Paddock did it other than his corpse is in the room. I think, or at least I hope we’ll get a report with at least some evidence in it. </p>

<p>Now cue random redditor replying to this with “LVPD/FBI/MGM don’t owe YOU shit you fucking idiot” and/or “you wouldn’t believe the evidence even if they showed it to you so why bother” and/or “there’s literally tons of evidence we discussed in the other thread which I’m not going to tell you which one because do your own work” in 3...2...1...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good list. I find by concentrating on just a few things that don&#39;t make sense here, you don&#39;t get muddled. Everything relating to Campos is weird. Zero footage of Paddock, except when he sued for slip and fall, is weird. You didn&#39;t mention, but, how are two room windows broken and no alarm at front desk or elsewhere is set off. Logical to think Campos was instructed to investigate the broken windows. But, as we know, he&#39;s never said that. I think Campos, the alleged only kind of sort of witness, is the key. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, what?</p>

<p>I missed that one. Also, who was paying Troy Boy to lurk outside the Campos residence for 2 weeks, while literally only Laura Loomer bothered to go there? Certainly not Campos. Or is he independently wealthy and just does Casino security as a rich man’s LARP?</p>

<p>Must have been boring as shit for ol’ Troy though. Sitting outside the Campos house while nobody was going to it and Campos was off in Mexico for some reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Troy Goff was wearing a red collared shirt with the logo of the &quot;company&quot; he was working for.  Firstly, the company lost its license in earlier this year, so as far as I and others can tell, it shouldn&#39;t be operating. Secondly every address listed for the &quot;company&quot; either is a empty building, doesn&#39;t exist, or is a &quot;virtual office&quot;.
The primary address for the business is:</p>

<p>On Scene Investigation &amp; Security Inc
5.0 Stars (1 review)<br/>
Private Investigator
5556 S. Fort Apache Rd
(702) 589-3315
Closed today</p>

<p>This address is literally an empty gutted office building a few miles from where I live.  Ill try and dig out the pics if anyone is interested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem like you live in or near Las Vegas, so I’ll just ask... Is this a normal business practice? In other words, could the On Scene investigation &amp; Security Inc company just be trying to save on overhead by not having an actual office?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t work in the security business, so I wouldn&#39;t be able to tell what is common practice in that industry.

    <div class="md"><p>I mean you would think a business would want potential customers to be able to contact them. The only thing I can think is that if maybe they do Security for royalty and celebs, their business model could conceivably be that you have to “know somebody” to be able to contact them. But then why go through the trouble to add details like a company logo, and have shirts made up...? Shady AF.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if he did end up doing the shooting by himself, <em>everything</em> else is consistent with this whole operation being planned for two shooters.  Maybe Guest #2 got cold feet.  </p>

<p>Or maybe Paddock and Guest #2 had planned to escape after the shooting, but Guest #2 knew that a nearly surefire way to get away with it would be to murder Paddock, carry out the attack, then flee solo.  Since everything was in Paddock&#39;s name.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well also, it could have been just a hooker, but my point is if they know who it is, how do they know? Surveillance footage? Then why can’t we see it? And if not, again why not? Because they deemed a second person who was in the room while paddock was literally trying to fill it with guns is not an important thing to look into?</p>

<p>Point is, even if the story given is 100% true, the inconsistencies could point to shoddy police work at a bare minimum. And if the police work is shoddy, then why do we think the story they are giving us is true?</p>

<p>But if the story is not true, it could mean there are people involved who are still at large, or that somebody else got away with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Number 3 is ventilation. </p>

<p>How about it you do a mag dump of 100 rounds that brass is going to be very hot. Like melting carpet. </p>

<p>So he was using a .223 with a bump fire stock. At 450 yards. Hold a single finger out at arms length, that is the amount of play that barrel has to stay on target. With a bump stock. And a flipping .223 projectile. At a approximate 30 degree angle downwards. And a 100 round mags weight. </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t they pave over the area that would have caught all the rounds?</p>

<p>To be killed by a .223 caliber bullet at those distances it would have to be a head or heart/lung shot </p>

<p>The ballistic aspects is what sticks out a bit to much. </p>

Why would he go to all the trouble to do that and just kill himself? A guy who was looking into police response would be smart enough to listen to the scanner (which we all know was being publicly broadcast). He&#39;d know they were still in the hallway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depending on the barrel length, projectile, etc. the bullets are going to have roughly 3-400 foot pounds of energy at 450 yards, which is about the equivalent of a 9mm. Actually, it would be really similar to a 22 magnum, because it&#39;s a lighter bullet but it&#39;s moving a lot faster.</p>

<p>As you said, without hitting a vital organ, that&#39;s not likely to kill someone except for a situation where they can&#39;t get medical attention for hours and hours. And yet, 60 people were killed and roughly ten times that many wounded, but there&#39;s no second shooter? Does not add up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you watch the entire events of the night, there were 12 bursts of fire.  Some of them are long, like 100 rounds, but more are shorter, something like 30 rounds.  So let&#39;s give him the benefit of doubt and say he was able to fire 1000 rounds all together (very high estimate in my opinion).  From 450 yards away using a bump stock (notoriously inaccurate even at close ranges) he was able to hit over 600 moving targets.  Are you kidding me?  If this really happened, Paddock would be the greatest shooter that ever lived.</p>

<p>Add to this that we know some of the bursts weren&#39;t directed towards the crowd but towards the fuel tanks at the airport.  Then, we&#39;re talking a hit ratio of at least 80% from 450 yards away.  My opinion is that this is the most absurd narrative ever given to the American public.</p>

<p>Obviously, I can&#39;t count individual shots, but the bursts were at max 100 rounds with 12 bursts in total.  Many of the bursts are a lot shorter, like 30 rounds.  See the video for yourself.  There&#39;s no way more than 1000 rounds were fired.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you except for the head/heart/lung part.  You can bleed out from any artery.  Also, the .223/5.56 has a tendency to ride bone.  You can get hit in the hip with a tumbling bullet and it can ride the bone and exit the knee, for instance. 
A lot of ground misses could have ended up ricocheting into people&#39;s groin/femoral area.  There&#39;s a possibility of bleeding out before you could make it to an exit.  Especially with adrenaline going.  </p>

<p>But the point of this whole thing is that we don&#39;t know.  We haven&#39;t been told shit.</p>

<p>From an experienced point of view, bump stocks don&#39;t work like what we heard. They are irregular. Boom boom boom shit boom boom boom boom boom shit boom shit</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A chunk of those are pretty much non-issues, outside of just being curious. Like who was guarding Campos home? Who cares? How is that even remotely relevant to the crime from earlier? A few of them we sort of know, even if some don&#39;t like the answers.<br/>
1 - Active investigation</p>

<p>2 - Does the build code in NV require &quot;Hurricane proof&quot; level windows? Why do people keep acting like the windows up there are the super bomb/shoot/smash proof triple laminate security blah blah blah stuff you see on like a bank door? You can clearly see from the break pattern they are not security laminated, at least not to any high level and clearly not tempered. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s just heavy plate, maybe slightly treated at best. Slam the edge or middle with a mini sledge, they are going to break. </p>

<p>4,5 - we don&#39;t know what locked even means in this regard. Either door could locked, he could of drilled locked, they might of just blown them to blow them and &quot;locked&quot; means closed. We just don&#39;t know. I mean they could of just gone in the main door too from the hall. </p>

<p>18 - I thought we had info about drilling of doors to seal them up? </p>

<p>24 -  Stand back in a bit in the room, limits of digital camera phones? I mean clearly the shots are coming from the MGM hotel, is that even up for debate? The fact we don&#39;t see camera flashes doesn&#39;t really change that. We have video from right near and under the room. So he was shooting blanks? Clearly shooting something. Even blanks would flash, maybe even more than real gun fire. </p>

<p>29 - please stop with Campos and being &quot;allowed to leave&quot;. If you&#39;re not under arrest/charged you are not limited to where you can or can&#39;t go. It&#39;s a straight bill of rights issue. </p>

<p>35 - odds are that&#39;s an accident discharge. When we thought it was all billy bad ass tactical I was a bit more taken back by it, now that (based off last tucker interview) we know (kind of) the tactical team was just one swat leader and then random officers. Accident discharge for high stress tactical breach from non-tactical officers? Yeah I can see that. </p>

<p>37 - random dude cleared by the police, not a big deal. So now the gen pop has to clear people too? If it was me, I would never, ever want my name released in a case of this nature given the issue of being harassed about it online. </p>

<p>40 - once home is processed, it&#39;s worthless. All crime relevant buildings etc revert back to the owner or return to business etc sooner or later. Even ones with full murders inside.  </p>

<p>48 - was the girl friend ever a true suspect? </p>

<p>Well yes and no, it&#39;s far from an active crime scene sort of location that needs to be combed for fibers, blood and so on. I&#39;m sure in that case they would of put a team on the door 24/7 until the scene was totally processed. It&#39;s was just a 2nd home in Reno (Paddock lived in Mesquite) that neighbors said he was at less than 6 months out of the year.

<p>FBI had already processed it over the course of a few days and they were done. It got busted into about a week later by I&#39;m guessing someone really stupid who had no idea the risk they were taking going anywhere near an active federal case. My own theory is murderbilla collector or kids getting a chance to act out poking around a criminal house like in Breaking Bad. </p>

<p>That said, how long does it take to process a 2nd home for information? Figure take any guns, all the paperwork/computers/media stuff and search around all the normal place but that&#39;s about it. You don&#39;t need to process his pants, his shoes, the carpet, the walls. It&#39;s more or less the FBI looting the place and then out. If he was not living there most of the time I doubt it had much inside. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would put money on the fact it was the second house would make it more important then the first. Can see Paddock using the place to plan out things away from family and save them from knowing and/or exposing his plans. Be a great place for Paddock to store things as there was no-one around (safer then a storage locker which have security cameras).</p>

<p>Plus police are looking for a hard drive - probably amongst other things we don&#39;t know of. If hard drive was a dead man&#39;s switch on an accomplice(s) then the second property would be a great place to hide it. Unknown to accomplice but the first place police would look. More I read about the case the less I believe Paddock acted alone. Think there was someone else, maybe not a shooter but someone who enabled him, helped with logistics, carried shit, and maybe was supposed to help with an escape route. Would explain Paddock&#39;s confidence he was going to be able to get away. </p>

<p>Know one thing for certain. Forensics screw up at times, and now they can&#39;t go back and redo tests (and this tragedy has been one of screw up after screw up with police have releasing a narrative only to have basic and serious flaws in it exposed, and then the police have released another narrative that is exposed to have more serious flaws - all without anyone&#39;s head rolling).</p>

<p>Ask Lindy Chamberlain. The prosecution forensic expert used slides of blood samples in court that weren&#39;t from the crime scene as the department destroyed the originals, with the result being she was convicted. It turned out the blood the forensic expert spoke of in cpurt was rust prohibitor from the cars construction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Would explain Paddock&#39;s confidence he was going to be able to get away.“</p>

<p>That is one of the most fascinating things in this whole thing for me. I remember they did at one point say he was confident he’d get away. But the thing I can’t get past is, that can’t possibly be true. Why would he think that? The room was in his girlfriend’s name, he had 23 guns in there at least some of which were said to have been registered to him. </p>

<p>I mean, how precisely, would he have gotten away once shots were fired? He would have thrown 1000 pounds of his very traceable guns on a luggage cart, ask for a zero balance receipt at checkout, and drive away amidst the chaos?</p>

<p>It just doesn’t make logical sense he would think that. He may have been a psychotic madman, but the rest of the details surrounding the case would suggest that he wasn’t that stupid. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying they are wimpy home sliding door level of glass but clearly they are not high security triple laminate along with fully tempered and so on. You can tell just from the break pattern. Being high level laminate glass just spider webs in place as a sheet and tempered glass just shatters. Normally tempered is required on a ground floor like say for sliding doors to get in a building. Just in case some dumb ass walks into the window/door and breaks it. </p>

<p>Yet people keep acting like it&#39;s impossible to break them out and keep saying &quot;Hurricane proof&quot; like that means anything. I doubt it&#39;s even a term in the entire NV building code being it&#39;s a land locked state on the west coast. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s stronger than normal glass but I&#39;ve seen demos 3M high level security glass posted as &quot;proof&quot; the windows can&#39;t break out in Vegas. When in no way is that the level of glass up there. </p>

<p>,</p>

<p>Why would Stephen Paddock bring a laptop with no hard drive?</p>

<p>I assume he ditched it already.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why were there &quot;a lot of drills&quot; found in 32-135? What purpose would or did the drills serve?</p>

<p>Probably to build booby traps or attach more cameras.</p>

<p>Why did they find a cell phone charger that matched none of the other cell phones found in 32-135?</p>

<p>all of the phones were matched to the right chargers. get your facts straight.</p>

<p>No idea. Must be a conspiracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is the glove or bag around the left hand of the body found in 32-135</p>

<p>Maybe a glove or a bag.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is there no muzzle fire seen coming from 32-135 or 32-134 in any video?</p>

<p>Who knows. Doesn&#39;t have much relevance.</p>

<p>Seems he was a bit of a nutter.</p>

<p>Why Did Stephen Paddock bother to bring body armor to the room, if he was just going to commit suicide?</p>

<p>Body armour doesn&#39;t protect you from a head full of bullet.</p>

<p>Because he&#39;s a free man?</p>

<p>People tend to act a little funny after such events.</p>

<p>Perhaps because it&#39;s only been two months.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So a simple 5 second video of Paddock inside the MB checking in needs over 2 months to be released to the public?  Why? 
&quot;Active investigation&quot; is no excuse for this.   A simple 5 second video of Paddock checking in would not compromise anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He used a hammer. Also, he was 64, get your facts straight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A hammer huh? 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mnCCP1H9uM">Hurricane Impact Window Test</a></p>

<p>So Paddock broke out the windows with this:
<a href="http://news.images.itv.com/image/file/1401852/stream_img.jpg">Top Left of image is the hammer</a></p>

<p>Also, thanks for the correction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why the need to murder innocent people?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a very good question, although unrelated to the original question, which was: </p>

<p>Why the need for two seperate broken windows, in two seperate adjoining rooms, when both windows have the same vantage point?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe he tried one and didn&#39;t like view because no, they don&#39;t offer the same vantage point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what exactly can not be seen from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skcuvo9Z9BY">here</a>, that is gained by breaking out another window in the another room?</p>

<p>The fuel tanks are clearly visible from 32-135.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because they didn&#39;t want to risk getting shot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You kind of missed the point of the question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stephen paddock did. He went out of the room set up the camera cart and then went back to 135.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Stephen Paddock knocked out the window in 32-134, locked the adjoining door to 32-135, and went out into the hallway to set up the cart. He then went back into the main door of 32-135 and shot down into the crowd.  When did he shoot at the fuel tanks? When did Campos arrive?  please clarify.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe a paranoid lady who saw some &quot;suspicious&quot; looking men and thought she was in deep shit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe, or maybe we can take the audio for face value and assume the lady was whispering to authorities inside a hotel that was already on lock down, that was already reported numerous times to have shots fired in or near.</p>

<p>I was going to respond to all of your insightful responses to my question, but I no longer have the energy to keep going.  </p>

<p>So instead:</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER EVIDENCE OF SHOTS FIRED AT THE BELLAGIO</strong></p>

<p>[control female voice] &quot;please be advised, now we&#39;re getting shots fired at Ceasar&#39;s and The Bellagio.&quot;</p>

<p>[control female voice] &quot;Please be advised, there&#39;s a male walking into the Bellagio…&quot;</p>

<p>[control female voice] &quot;Please be advised, at the Bellagio employee entrance, there&#39;s a male walking in with a rifle, Bellagio employee entrance&quot;</p>

<p>[control female voice] &quot;getting a 415A now, Bellagio, the PER(?) is hearing a lot of shots being fired&quot;</p>

<p>[control female voice] &quot;and now she&#39;s saying suspects are inside with her, and she&#39;s whispering, can not talk&quot;</p>

<p>Ongoing investigation.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right, it&#39;s not an excuse. It&#39;s the reason.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A simple 5 second video of Paddock checking in would not compromise anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A hammer huh? Hurricane Impact Window Test</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A hurricane? In Vegas? That&#39;s odd. Of course the images of the broken windows indicate nothing as such.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hurricane Impact Window Test</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You know this was the window used?</p>

<p>Oh that&#39;s right, you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Fail.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why the need for two seperate broken windows, in two seperate adjoining rooms, when both windows have the same vantage point?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I already answered this. Please pay attention. Seems like your fact checking is as bad as your ability to read responses.</p>

<p>The windows do not have the same vantage point.</p>

<p>Nor does that matter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So what exactly can not be seen from here, that is gained by breaking out another window in the another room?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s almost like  they have different views.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fuel tanks are clearly visible from 32-135.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You kind of missed the point of the question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrong, I answered it. You failed to comprehend. They breached the door because it&#39;s the safest way to enter an unsecured room.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So Stephen Paddock knocked out the window in 32-134, locked the adjoining door to 32-135, and went out into the hallway to set up the cart. He then went back into the main door of 32-135 and shot down into the crowd. When did he shoot at the fuel tanks? When did Campos arrive? please clarify.</p>

<p>You just did, thanks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bingo. Next.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>, or maybe </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or maybe it was reptiles.</p>

<p>Except no. That line of thinking is only for the deluded and paranoid.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we can take the audio for face value and assume the lady was scared,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Old ladies get scared of teenagers after dark. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>nd whispering to authorities inside a hotel that was already on lock down</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Would be a pretty tense situation that&#39;s for sure. Odd of you to take her exact words as infallible and literally no one else&#39;s. </p>

<p>Oh that&#39;s right, confirmation bias.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was going to respond to all of your insightful responses to my questions, but I no longer have the energy to keep going.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you can&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FURTHER EVIDENCE OF SHOTS FIRED AT THE BELLAGIO</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems you don&#39;t understand what evidence is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[control female voice] &quot;please be advised, now we&#39;re getting shots fired at Ceasar&#39;s and The Bellagio.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Confirmed by?</p>

<p>Oh wait. It wasn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[control female voice] &quot;Please be advised, there&#39;s a male walking into the Bellagio…&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A male??! Not roughly 50% of the population!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>] &quot;Please be advised, at the Bellagio employee entrance, there&#39;s a male walking in with a rifle, Bellagio employee entrance&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Confirmed by?</p>

<p>Oh wait, it wasn&#39;t. It was based on the words of a scared lady.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;getting a 415A now, Bellagio, the PER(?) is hearing a lot of shots being fired&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not a single piece of evidence for this. Zero.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;and now she&#39;s saying suspects are inside with her, and she&#39;s whispering, can not talk&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like a scared old lady.</p>

<p>&quot;The general manager of Guns &amp; Guitars, the Mesquite store where Stephen Paddock purchased a rifle as recently as Sept. 28, said there was nothing amiss when Paddock purchased a bolt-action rifle at his store the Thursday before carrying out the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The rifle purchased at Guns &amp; Guitars that afternoon was not found in the hotel room where Paddock carried out his attack in Las Vegas. &quot;</p>

<p>Such bullshit. Any speculation or discussion is allowed except for that which questions the actual extraordinary claims, which are still without any extraordinary (or even passable) evidence that anything or anyone was actually shot.</p>

<p>What a joke the front page of this subreddit is.</p>

<p>In every Las Vegas thread I pose this same point and no one can offer any visual confirmation or even strong suggestion whatsoever that anything was shot. And yet you can come up with fifty other questions that all take that premise for granted when there&#39;s literally no reason to.</p>

<p>Whereas, after a real shooting on this scale, there would be a truckload of abundant and convincing evidence. Your unbacked claims are utterly meaningless.</p>

Going off of memory, it is described as a Black Audi SUV. The license plate# is also read.  The occupants of the vehicle were described as 4 males.  If I remember correctly, it was 3 white males, and 1 asian male. The suspicious vehicle was described as having &quot;wires hanging out&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><h1>1 is pretty easy for me...</h1>

<p>MGM owns the footage and they sure as hell aren&#39;t going to release video of Paddock entering their hotel with weapons time after time...probably with their employees assisting him. Same with the elevator footage-- especially if he was allowed to use the service elevator. Lawyers will surely get their hands on this eventually, but MGM doesn&#39;t want to encourage further victims to come forward and sue. Everyone and their mother will come out of the woodwork. Footage of them serving him drinks, comps anything can be interpreted as liability on their part. Not only that, it&#39;s bad optics. It could certainly drive future and even current guests away.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if the LVPD can release it (probably). But, they can use the &quot;ongoing investigation&quot; line if they&#39;re being strong armed by MGM. </p>

<p>To me, this is the most logical reason we haven&#39;t seen any footage inside the hotel. Now... OUTSIDE the hotel is a different story. The city owns that footage and could give us any and all video of Paddock from the street, in his car, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe one of the officers that went in with the ONE SWAT guy (because, apparently the other 19 couldn&#39;t bother to show up) said on 60 min that there was a gun placed right at the door so he could just pick it up and start firing. Why would he go to all the trouble to do that and just kill himself? A guy who was looking into police response would be smart enough to listen to the scanner (which we all know was being publicly broadcast). He&#39;d know they were still in the hallway. </p>
