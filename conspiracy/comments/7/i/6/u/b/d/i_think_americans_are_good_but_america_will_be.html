       He also said this back in 2011...
      </p>
      <p>
       “Now listen, you people of Nato. You’re bombing a wall which stood in the way of African migration to Europe and in the way of al-Qaeda terrorists. This wall was Libya. You’re breaking it. You’re idiots, and you will burn in hell for thousands of migrants from Africa and for supporting al-Qaeda. It will be so. I never lie. And I do not lie now.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he was killed, Libya fell into chaos and, surprise surprise, millions of migrants are making their way into Europe as he predicted because there is no one stopping them at the Libyan border anymore. The leaders of Europe knew this. They used to make deals with Gaddafi to keep the migrants away. Now they get to cry about a "Muslim invasion" when they knew this is exactly what would happen. Gaddafi was definitely a more prophetic voice than any other world leaders are.

       Central bank doesn't equal freedom, probably the exact opposite in terms of finances.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Usery" is something that Islam doesn't believe in, basically Islam doesn't have "interest" charges.  Usery was created by the Jewish religion, Jews in the old days were predominantly bankers. You borrow a dollar from me today, and I'll pay you $1.50 tomorrow including interest.
      </p>

       Do you consider "debt" a freedom?

       Really? Because I think the ability to trust other people with my money is a big sign of freedom.

       This is specious. The concept of "owing" someone and paying them for the privilege is not related to Jews. They didn't invent it.

       I consider the
       <em>
        trust
       </em>
       associated with civil debt to be a big sign of freedom, yeah. In the past, the only people who could do such a thing, and leverage their wealth and capital, were the hyper wealthy. Now, anyone can do it because there's a secular, entirely blind system by which money is lent and owed.

       predatory lending has a long, sordid history. i'm not really sure what point in the past you're referring to, but if it ever existed, it must have been in remotest antiquity. aristotle condemned usury two and a third millenia ago.

       I just did. I believe that the internet is only possible because of this system. If you believe there is an alternate system that is better; present it. I can't prove a negative. It would require me to list every single possible socioeconomic system and explain why each is probably not better than this one (note, I'm not saying we can't improve this one, just that it's the best). That's not possible.

       The phrase "people of Libya" doesn't remotely mean an absolute like "everyone in Libya". It means a large enough group that any sort of armed repression that group would represent a crime against humanity. Sure, people supported him. That's not the point. Those people remain completely fine under the new regime, and the oppressed people are now free. It's a win-win. (I'm obviously glossing over a bunch of bad shit involved in this process, but the overall point stands).

       Qaddafi was still a dictator who killed his own people, but his presence is far more preferable to the chaos we have created in the power vacuum. Same with Saddam. These dictators kept the Islamist Radical factions in check and maintained stability- though they did this with an iron fist.

       Bathists that only had a chance to meet Baghdadi in an American Prison camp. Saddam being alive would have prevented most of the ME bullshit of the last 15 years.

      <p>
       Also, every single member of Saddam's government had to be a member of the party, even the paper pushers and mail men...and guess what? After we invaded...they
       <em>
        showed up

       , the very next day, for work. Bush and Rumsfeld intentionally destroyed Iraq by demanding all former party remembers be removed from office, however, meaning all the bureaucrats were removed, and the government ground to a halt. Then they had the brilliant idea to disband the million man army...who simply walked off base with their guns and began the insurgency. We destroyed Iraq intentionally.

       Exactly...democracy needs certain preconditions in place before it has any chance of taking root and working. Literacy, and an educated elite/middle class who believe in Democracy seem to be the most important. They form the first generation of leaders and set the precedent for democratic norms going forward.

       Republics are outgrowths of the Industrial Revolution. Before the Industrial Revolution, all the power resided with kings and emperors. Historian Carroll Quigley writes about this in "The Tragedy and the Hope". Basically, with mass production, the prices fall on goods and services (now that you can make them according to scale). This makes things like guns accessible to the normal people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though Quigley was on the liberal political spectrum, he made a compelling case for guns in the hands of the people forcing the government to be responsive to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       (In a place like America, the balance of power shifted from the State to the people, because the people were a larger standing army.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Quigley says that, because of this power-shift, Middle Classes arose for the first time in human history, and this led to republics.
      </p>
      <p>
       When George Washington was named the first President of the United States, every nation on Earth had either a king or an emperor. Within a generation, half the monarchies of Europe fell to be replaced by Presidents or Prime Ministers.
      </p>
      <p>
       H.G. Wells (in his book "Anticipations") also writes about the creation of the Middle Class (after the Industrial Revolution) and how this caused massive disruptions in the traditional power of the Aristocracy. Historically, the ultra rich were used to the mega-poor. They'd always had them. But what they weren't used to was a Middle Class.
      </p>
      <p>
       This new Middle Class cumulatively commanded more wealth than the 1-percenters. And this led directly to liberal democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       (It's why there's a war on the Middle Class today . . . with the billionaire class using the taxation system to erase the Middle Class.) The Middle Class is shrinking today--by design. H.G. Wells even made an appeal to the wealthy in 1899 to introduce a graduated income tax to silently siphon the wealth away from the Middle Class and transfer it back to the Aristocracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short: The Industrial Revolution is the main pre-requisite for liberal democracy. Most of the world, however (even as of 2017) has not only NOT undergone the Industrial Revolution; they haven't even entered the stage of the agricultural revolution (which Europe went through in the Middle Ages).
      </p>
      <p>
       A place like Malawi in Africa is half a millennium behind, say, the United States historically, developmentally, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       These places are not going to leapfrog centuries of development and evolve democracy because we will it to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       (It's delusional to think you could force them into it.)

       I agree with almost everything you said, except for the true origin of Republics. Representative Commonwealths have their origins in the Roman Republic, which though an Aristocratic body, was the beginning of the concept of representative government. The Founding Fathers were well aware of this, as the 3 that had College degrees were Classics majors, as that was the only accepted form of higher Ed in their day.
      </p>
      <p>
       The American Republic was formed as a mixture of the Roman Elitist Senate and the Athenian Radical Demos- with a popular vote elected House of Representatives, and a State Legislature, Elite dominated Senate. Other than that, I like the comment and appreciate it.

       No, what we prize in the modern West is a concept that was extremely foreign to Greece or Rome: popular democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       We think that women and ethnic minorities should vote. Hell, we think even the poor should vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       We tacitly even allow illegal aliens to cast ballots in certain regions.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this would have been unthinkable to Greek or Roman forums . . . which were composed of the illustrious citizens who were derived from the wealthiest houses.
      </p>
      <p>
       They did NOT believe in "popular democracy" where "everyone got a vote".
      </p>
      <p>
       To project our present onto the past would be an egregious act of historical revisionism.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened in America in 1776 would have scared the shit out of the senators in the Roman Republic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The common people with the weapons?
      </p>
      <p>
       That would have been the equivalent of the Romans endorsing Spartacus' slave rebellion, and saying, "Yeah, the poor people should have standing armies."
      </p>
      <p>
       No, the Romans were scared shitless by Spartacus and did everything they could to suppress the rebellion of "the unwashed masses".
      </p>
      <p>
       If Roman senators had been running 1776 America, NO ONE would have been allowed to have a gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Only the wealthy and powerful would have had them . . . which is reminiscent of rhetoric today from the billionaire class in America who want to disarm ordinary Americans--while retaining their own armed security details).

       Yes, it would have, but the Founding Fathers still actively emulated and were aware of the Roman Republic, and used it as precedent. That is undeniable and is based in their own writings.

       radical for its time, and scared the shit out of other Elites and even the later Romans like Cicero.

       Well, the Founding Fathers were impressed by Greece and Rome, you're right.
      </p>
      <p>
       They especially admired Greece.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Greek world, for instance, was decentralized. It had no king, and no capital. Just a bunch of separate, autonomous city-states.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of having no centralization, they had no central taxation authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Greeks got to keep a larger share of their wealth than people who lived under emperors (like the Persians).
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result of not having their money siphoned off, the Greeks developed the ancient world's first Middle Class.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were a nation of merchants and traders, sailing the Mediterranean and selling their goods.
      </p>
      <p>
       They amassed a lot of wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also had something more important: Leisure time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Greek word for "leisure" is where we derive our word for "school" [schola]. The Greeks associated leisure with self-betterment. Because of this additional leisure, they had the time to develop philosophy, botany, historiography, drama, architecture, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This all changed after Alexander the Great rose and instituted a Persian-style centralized government on the Greeks. For the first time, they had a unified leader, a capital and a central taxation authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Centralization, however, always leads to corruption, as a small number of powerful people create a bottleneck to which tax money flows. As they get richer, the average people are asked to work longer hours to pay ever-higher taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       As this played out, their leisure time disappeared. And their innovations dried up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, they collapsed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Founding Fathers in America took this lesson from history to heart--which is why they did everything they could to create a de-cebtralized system (with the various American states envisioned as autonomous Greek city-states). They wanted a weak central government to avoid the problems caused by the traditional historical set-ups that led to corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       So America was a hodgepodge, by design. It had inefficiencies built into it to make graft and corruption more difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Of course, that original set was largely destroyed with the Civil War, with a new "Federal America" created afterward, which was far more centralized--and inclined toward corruption). Washington, DC is a gravity-well for money and power like the Founding Fathers would have been mortified by.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, long story short, you're right: The Founders looked to Greece and Rome as a template. Greece (for its political organization) and Rome, in terms of Roman civil law.

       Classical background, eh?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you're probably aware that (if one is to follow historical trajectories) we're kind of committing cultural suicide. Like the Romans did when they allowed Germanic tribes into their empire (under the misguided notion that they'd be loyal to Rome). The whole "diversity is our strength" thing kind of didn't work out very well for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The German tribes weren't content with serving
       <em>
        under
       </em>
       the Romans. They didn't come to take part; they came to take over.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're watching the same phenomenon now in Europe (with Muslims) and in America, with a cult of self-hate overtaking our youth, where they're actively lobbying to demographically replace the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how societies collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are all these sociological pressures on us to consider these observations "thought-crimes" . . . to be censored with invocations of "hate" or "xenophobia".
      </p>
      <p>
       But the facts are the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cultures fall when the people in those societies no longer believe in defending or protecting those civilizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the citizens themselves are calling their own countries "illegitimate" and "built on a legacy of slavery," and when all the academic institutions are cheering on the demographic suicide of the populace . . . then you're gearing up for the Great Crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       I especially appreciated intellectual Camille Paglia's observations on celebrations of homosexuality and transgenderism which usually start to appear as a society starts to collapse. (She's a lesbian, by the way.)  And even she's documenting the patterns of decadence and collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we're teaching our boys about "toxic masculinity," heartier foreign tribes are waiting in the wings (inculcating in their youths the virtues of strength and masculinity) . . . like hungry young wolves waiting to come in at the first sign of vulnerability.

        Then you're probably aware that (if one is to follow historical trajectories) we're kind of on a downward trend. Like the Romans were when they debased their currency and invited Germanic tribes into their empire (under the misguided notion that they'd be loyal to Rome).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think our situation is analogous to both late Imperial Rome, but also to late Republican Rome. The currency debasement is definitely a striking Parallel, but I'm in the camp of "rot from within" rather than "Barbarians at the gates", so while settling the Germanic tribes within the Empire was definitely a huge issue, it was really just the result of even more structural problems
      </p>
      <p>
       These problems having arisen from the Crisis of the Third Century, and the depletion of internal man power within the Empire. Emperors started to feel no other choice than to import ever more Germanic mercenaries into the legions, because 50 years of civil wars had wrecked the Legions. And even more so the currency base. The Imperial Bureaucracy was unable to cope with the continuous changes and shocks, and Emperors from about Diocletian on created institutions and divided power, not with an eye towards keeping the Empire safe, but towards keeping themselves safe, even if it meant the Frontier was weak and regional Governors had far less power to handle threats.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I believe we are more analogous to the Late Republic. Political Infighting and Institutional Shocks have brought us to our current point of malaise. There is no solid leadership on the Horizon, as there wasn't in the years 129-55 BCE. Offices of the Republic are going unfilled, and every faction of the Republic has been divided into two groups- those seeking reform, and those who desire a return to precedent. Similar to the Roman Optimates and Populares.
      </p>

       Cicero was one who desired a return to precedent, but the problem with such a conservative position is that it fails to recognize the changes on the ground. Changes for us being 9/11 and the 2008 Recession, which have both fundamentally altered our position in the world and our economy at home. As in the Late Republic, we see factionalism increasing at an alarming rate, and to me the possibility of a full blown social collapse and the death of the Republic is not just likely at this point, but nearing or above 50% if certain structural changes are not implemented.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, I see the political situation more akin to the Late Republic, but the stakes being as high as the Late Empire, because unlike with the Republic, when there was no other great power that could compete, and the Romans could afford to fight among one another and take their time forging a new way forward, we in 21st century America are the weary, aging tiger, with competition and enemies at all sides, probing our weaknesses, and waiting for the proper moment to pounce.

       Indeed this is pure folly. But it is not the only academic view out there. I have met and discussed these things with many in Academia and not everyone is a crazy multi-culturalist, especially within the field of Classics. That said, it should be noted that multi-culturalism in and of itself isn't necessarily bad, Rome was very successful because they had a framework that could absorb and fit regional practices and differences into the Roman framework. But multi-culturalism at the expense of the Nation State and its native peoples will lead to nothing but destruction.

       Yes, but they also fall when the corruption and internal rot have reached such a point that even those who do desperately want to right the ship have no means to do so, because they are blocked at every turn by both bad actors and institutional collapse.

       In Zbigniew Brzezinski's 1977 book "Between Two Ages: America in the Technotronic Age," he discusses the developmental differences between the First World (i.e., Western countries that have moved back the Industrial Revolution into the
       <em>
        Post
       </em>
       -Industrial Age) and the Third World (composed of countries that haven't even entered the agricultural revolution yet).
      </p>
      <p>
       He goes into deep discussions of the geo-political tensions as technology allows these developing nations to see First World prosperity via television and movies (but without the developmental maturity in their own societies to achieve that level of prosperity).
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the interesting digressions in the book is his discussions of the difficulty in assimilating African-Americans . . . whom he characterizes as an "agrarian population" who never underwent the Industrial Revolution. So, once freed, they were tossed out into a post-Industrial population that was literally centuries ahead of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       He openly wondered if the massive resources being expended on trying to "bring them up to speed" (with recourse to costly social engineering programs and quota systems) would end up bankrupting and weakening the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was back in 1977, mind you, when America's biggest problem was its 12% black population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now throw on top of that a new 17% Mexican and Central American population, and you can imagine the sociological and economic pressures ramping up.
      </p>
      <p>
       (And just as with African-Americans, the people being imported now are agrarian populations from the jungles of Honduras and Guatemala. Inter-generationally poor, and centuries behind the First World population into which they've been thrust.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the thing: In the 1960s, Leftist professors came up with a plan to collapse the United States from within, called the Cloward-Piven strategy. It called for welfare and social services to be ramped up with the express intention of bankrupting the United States.

       No, the guns started flowing east BEFORE Communism came about. It started under the Czars.

       (Although, according to historian Antony Sutton, the Bolsheviks were funded from the West. Financier Schiff funneled millions to Lenin and the radicals at the very outset of the Communist revolution. According to Sutton, without this money they would have collapsed immediately.  Sutton became a pariah in academia for documenting the money-trails and front companies that held Communism aloft. The thing about him was that his scholarship and credentials were so rock-solid that it was hard to dismiss him.)

       Lol you have no idea what I do or do not know. I am well aware that States have often been implicated in the murder of their own people, but it's important to remember that men like Qaddafi were dictators, even if they were better for regional stability than the current situation.

       Why is it so hard for people to grasp the fact that Qaddafi was a dictator who killed his own people and
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       terrorists? He wasn't some benevolent and kind human. Like any dictator, he ruled by force and fear. If you had read my post, you would see that I still believe that was preferable to the current bullshit, and don't support what we did to him. But the world isn't just black and white...it's a lot more complicated. Sometimes bad men do good things and a bad situation is necessary and preferable to a far worse scenario, such as we see now.

       Okay. Assuming the Magnitsky situation is as bad as possible: corruption at many levels, government agents stealing money from the taxpayers, arresting a lawyer to cover it up... all that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see how that makes Russia worse than any other country. How is the average citizen doing? What's their quality of life? How pleased are Russians with their partially corrupt government? What's their relationship with law enforcement? Do they approve of their foreign policy? Are their remaining
Taxes that aren't stolen being put to good use? What's the murder rate? How's public education? What are the unemployment rates? Do people get along with each other? Is it messy?
      </p>
      <p>
       You bring up the worst thing you can think of about their government and it paints the picture of some third-world shithole where everyone is starving while the elites hoard their food.

        Zionists have infiltrated and influenced our government long before the state of Israel was even created.
       </a>
       This is not meant to minimize the negative impact of Israel on our government now, but only to illustrate that the Zionists have been dictating our government's pro-Zionists policies a lot longer than people may think.

       <em>
        Thus Mr. House, aged fifty, was a president-maker. Until I read his Private Papers I was much impressed by the “uncanny knowledge” displayed by a leading American Zionist, Rabbi Stephen Wise, who in 1910 told a New Jersey audience: “On Tuesday Mr. Woodrow Wilson will be elected governor of your State; he will not complete his term of office as governor; in November 1912 he will be elected President of the United States; he will be inaugurated for the second time as president.” This was fore-knowledge of the quality shown by the Protocols, Leon Pinsker and Max Nordau, but further research showed that Rabbi Wise had it from Colonel House!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Evidently Mr. Wilson had been closely studied by the group of secret men which then was coalescing, for neither Mr. House nor Rabbi Wise at that moment had met him! But Mr. House “became convinced that he had found his man, although he had never met him … ‘I turned to Woodrow Wilson … as being the only man … who in every way measured up to the office' “ (Mr. Howden). The standard measurement used is indicated by a later passage: “The trouble with getting a candidate for president is that the man that is best fitted for the place cannot be nominated and, if nominated, could not be elected. The People seldom take the best man fitted for the job; therefore it is necessary to work for the best man who can be nominated and elected, and just now Wilson seems to be that man.” (This description, again, is qualified by the allusion in Mr. House's novel to the methods used by a powerful group to elect “its creature” to the presidency).

       A Wall wouldnt keep out rabid fanactical Bernie Sanders Democrats. A Wall wouldnt keep out rapid Democrats who shoot up GOP baseball games. A Wall wouldt keep out rapid fanatical Deomncratic groups Like ANtifa from attacking and haraasing innocent people, a wall wouldnt keep out extremist BLM supporters who assasinate cops.

       A wakk would keep out of the millions of people that illegally cross the border every year. Though I not for a wall.
Advocating for a country without borders is Communism/ Marxism. this was the ultimate goal of Marx. 
 However.
If youd like know about the dangets of look at the Dalia Lama and his views on untamed and ram[ant immigration. hes against it. It destroed hos culture and country.

       Of course it wouldn't keep out any of those, they are already citizens in your country. I also haven't heard of any shootings at GOP baseball games (what makes it a GOP game, btw? The players are conservatives and it's organised by the GOP?). It's also spelled rabid. Rapid is something that's very fast. Rabid is something that's afflicted by rabies.

       And no, a country without borders is not communism. We have had that in Europe and it worked fine a long time. Inb4 but refugees. I said it

       It's not that Trump is racist, it's that Bannon's strategy involved appealing to white nationalists and pushing racial divides. There is also the pattern of hating on muslims because Israel says we should. There are 2 billion muslims on earth and the only ones that have ever attacked the US were US citizens or paid allies in terror (Saudis, mossad agents, etc.).

       Bannon are Trump are white nationalist friendly because it always comes back to race and religion for them. I'm not saying they are white nationalists, they are Zionists. It's a strategy of tension, of divide and conquer.

      <p>
       As evidence we Breitbart. Bannon's baby, Trump's baby, it wrote the plan and the narrative for taking the white house. Breitbart and racial tension:

       Multiracial/multicultural nation is an oxymoron. I'm talking about literal meaning of the words here. The word 'nation' means this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The word nation stems from the Latin natio, meaning "people, tribe, kin, genus, class, flock."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It includes common genome, common SINGULAR culture, same race. As many unifying interests as possible. The America first nationalism that you're talking about will only lead to ruin. See: Chicago, Detroit.

       Nah, the American nationalism I'm talking about is cutting off excessive foreign aid to Israel and the military industrial complex and shutting down corporatism and crony capitalism as much as possible. Reigning in the mafia's CIA, minting US currency, enacting term limits, trying to get money out of politics, etc. etc. Making America great again.

       for the sake of argument, we will assume that your chronology is correct.
       <em>
        if

       your claim is true, then his dislike for nationalism might be

       You're taking everyone's opinions for granted. Look at the evidence on what is actually happening and has happened. Use logic and reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump was a Russian bought foreign agent do you really think there would be no evidence of it for the entire year?
      </p>
      <p>
       Has Trump done anything Nazi-esque? Obviously not. Quite the opposite actually. Illegal immigration and refugee admittance to US was at an all-time high for the first half of 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about Israel/Jews/Zionists? Well, all of his adult children are either converts to Judaism, are married to Jews, or both. Trump's AIPAC speech was far beyond lip service for an ally. Recent declaration of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. This already happened on official capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we can look at Trump's cabinet and his picks. Its the most Jewish cabinet US has ever had. This is despite Jews being a &lt;2% minority.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can easily verify every single of these points that i've mentioned by Googling it. What does the verifiable evidence show you? What is Trump?

       "Usery" is something that Islam doesn't believe in, basically Islam doesn't have "interest" charges.  Usery was created by the Jewish religion, Jews in the old days were predominantly bankers. You borrow a dollar from me today, and I'll pay you $1.50 tomorrow including interest.

        Then you're probably aware that (if one is to follow historical trajectories) we're kind of on a downward trend. Like the Romans were when they debased their currency and invited Germanic tribes into their empire (under the misguided notion that they'd be loyal to Rome).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think our situation is analogous to both late Imperial Rome, but also to late Republican Rome. The currency debasement is definitely a striking Parallel, but I'm in the camp of "rot from within" rather than "Barbarians at the gates", so while settling the Germanic tribes within the Empire was definitely a huge issue, it was really just the result of even more structural problems
      </p>
      <p>
       These problems having arisen from the Crisis of the Third Century, and the depletion of internal man power within the Empire. Emperors started to feel no other choice than to import ever more Germanic mercenaries into the legions, because 50 years of civil wars had wrecked the Legions. And even more so the currency base. The Imperial Bureaucracy was unable to cope with the continuous changes and shocks, and Emperors from about Diocletian on created institutions and divided power, not with an eye towards keeping the Empire safe, but towards keeping themselves safe, even if it meant the Frontier was weak and regional Governors had far less power to handle threats.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I believe we are more analogous to the Late Republic. Political Infighting and Institutional Shocks have brought us to our current point of malaise. There is no solid leadership on the Horizon, as there wasn't in the years 129-55 BCE. Offices of the Republic are going unfilled, and every faction of the Republic has been divided into two groups- those seeking reform, and those who desire a return to precedent. Similar to the Roman Optimates and Populares.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cicero was one who desired a return to precedent, but the problem with such a conservative position is that it fails to recognize the changes on the ground. Changes for us being 9/11 and the 2008 Recession, which have both fundamentally altered our position in the world and our economy at home. As in the Late Republic, we see factionalism increasing at an alarming rate, and to me the possibility of a full blown social collapse and the death of the Republic is not just likely at this point, but nearing or above 50% if certain structural changes are not implemented.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, I see the political situation more akin to the Late Republic, but the stakes being as high as the Late Empire, because unlike with the Republic, when there was no other great power that could compete, and the Romans could afford to fight among one another and take their time forging a new way forward, we in 21st century America are the weary, aging tiger, with competition and enemies at all sides, probing our weaknesses, and waiting for the proper moment to pounce.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We're watching a bizarre sort of institutional self-hate being infused into our youth, where certain subsets of intellectuals are actively lobbying to demographically replace the nation
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Indeed this is pure folly. But it is not the only academic view out there. I have met and discussed these things with many in Academia and not everyone is a crazy multi-culturalist, especially within the field of Classics. That said, it should be noted that multi-culturalism in and of itself isn't necessarily bad, Rome was very successful because they had a framework that could absorb and fit regional practices and differences into the Roman framework. But multi-culturalism at the expense of the Nation State and its native peoples will lead to nothing but destruction.

       This is pumped into society via the idea of micro-transgressions and trigger warnings.

      <p>
       Yes, but they also fall when the corruption and internal rot have reached such a point that even those who do desperately want to right the ship have no means to do so, because they are blocked at every turn by both bad actors and institutional collapse.
