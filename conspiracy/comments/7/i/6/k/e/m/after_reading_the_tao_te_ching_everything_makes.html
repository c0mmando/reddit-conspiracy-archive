    <div class="md"><p>Thats kind of a fairy tale.</p>

<p>Inter-tribal warfare. Driving herds of buffalo off of cliffs. Burning entire sections of forest down uncontrolled. Box burning for hunting buffalo. Those were all destructive actions that could be viewed as out of touch with nature. </p>

<p>There may have been a religious respect for nature, but it did not at any point engender a mindfulness about protecting the existing resources. Indeed, many native religions felt that nature provided an inexhaustible supply, and thus it was impossible to overhunt. </p>

<p>There is no body of evidence that natives actually planned and maintained their environment intentionally. Its more true that the low population numbers in America and vast landmass made it increasingly hard to deal any discernible damage to the environment. If they used up their local resources they moved on. From everything I have read, there was no element of conservation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been practicing being the &quot;Witness&quot; for some time now... &quot;I am not my body... I am what is aware of it.  I am not my thoughts... I am what is aware of them.  I am not my emotions... I am what feels them&quot;</p>

<p>This has helped me immensely for some time now, but I know I haven&#39;t truly become free of my ego yet.  It&#39;s more like a safe room I can hang out in when things get really difficult.</p>

<p>What is new to me with this direct teaching (from the link) is the idea of watching the watcher.  Witnessing the witness.</p>

<p>I always used to say that you <em>can&#39;t</em> witness the witness.  That consciousness was the base floor of reality but it is impossible to be aware of consciousness itself.  Now I realize that I have been hemmed in by this limiting belief.  Now I realize that I <em>can</em> be aware of my awareness.  This is new to me.</p>

<p>Honestly... my ego is recoiling at the thought of giving up my video games and movies so that I can practice.  Right now, I need to develop my desire to be free until, as the author says, I want freedom as much as a drowning man wants air.</p>

<p>I always knew there was some kind of &quot;foreign&quot; thing in me that wants to keep me locked up in the cage of habit and mediocrity.  It&#39;s all EGO.  Why does the ego want us to fail?  Because to succeed is the death of the ego?  But why does the ego want to continue so much?</p>

<p>I guess the ego is Satan in a way.</p>

<p>Anyway, thank you!</p>

<p>been doing it for a while, and it is AWESOME! Your awareness learns to OBE and to expand the size of earth, or shrink the size of an atom. Awareness has light at the very center of it and also if you can get your awareness to drop into the heart, thats where oneness is</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Seek to attain an open mind (the summit of vacuity). Seek composure (the essence of tranquillity).
 
All things are in process, rising and returning. Plants come to blossom, but only to return to the root. Returning to the root is like seeking tranquillity; it is moving towards its destiny. To move toward destiny is like eternity. To know eternity is “enlightenment, and not to recognize eternity brings disorder and evil.
 
Knowing eternity makes one comprehensive; comprehension makes one broadminded; breadth of vision brings nobility; nobility is like heaven.
 
The heavenly is like Tao. Tao is the Eternal. The decay of the body is not to be feared.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me it seems we all come from this same nothing, and we all return to it upon death. Everything we see that is physical, is a part of this same root. </p>

<p>Therefore it seems that what really matters is the progression of the collective species. If we are all apart of the same thing, the only thing keeping us from working together to make sure we progress is getting tied up dogma, or resource disputes.</p>

<p>I came to terms with death, because in reality I did not exist before i was born. I recognize the world moves on with or without me, and that means I have to spend my time wisely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea of it being a blank void, no consciousness is a belief with zero evidence that negates subjective experience, while conversely there are thousands of people who have flatlined and returned to tell of experiences, including a woman whose brain was frozen during a procedure and had no electricity moving through it--clinical brain death. Some don&#39;t remember anything, some had hellish experiences. Also, there&#39;s a lot to learn from out-of-body experiences that anyone can learn to do with different techniques.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To our brains, anything that isn&#39;t physical seems like a void. Like in sleep. We don&#39;t dream the whole time. There are periods of deep sleep that we don&#39;t remember. I hypothesize it is because it is non-physical experience. Sort of like refreshing ourselves in the well of our being. It&#39;s all so amazing to me. Just existing. All the intricacies and variation in the physical world, and within myself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The tao te ching sounds like gibberish, though, until you&#39;ve experienced what it&#39;s talking about. Most people do this through psychedelics. It&#39;s kind of ironic, since society doesn&#39;t view hippies with the same regard or respect as the wise old monks, artists, and writers throughout history who talk about the literal exact. same. shit. Hippies just stumbled upon a shortcut. Some people can reach these states without psychedelics, but it&#39;s rare. I don&#39;t know if Jesus used them, but he didn&#39;t have to. It happens. And yet the literal calendar year is based on the mind trip of some random dude named Jesus who said the same shit as the hippies at every music festival in the country. I think he just marketed these ideas better, tbh. He must have been a great public speaker, too, because I certainly can&#39;t talk about this shit (meditation, nonduality, transient hypofrontality and flow...) with anyone without them thinking I&#39;m nuts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy to think that at first, but I talked with my psychiatrist about it and he said he doesn&#39;t prescribe medical marijuana because there haven&#39;t been enough credible studies and he doesn&#39;t have an opinion on psychedelics for the same reason. He acknowledges that there are good and bad effects, but since we don&#39;t know how to isolate the good and assure it happens every time, it&#39;s unsafe for the public and should stay illegal. That&#39;s what I believe, too. They can do some serious damage to a small percentage of people, and those people don&#39;t know that they&#39;re vulnerable until after the fact. The spiritual side of psychedelics, though, is definitely valuable even if most of the community takes it way too far into the realms of irrationality. I use spiritual to mean existentially whole, not having to do with a spirit world and souls. There is certainly some serious knowledge to be gained from altered states of consciousness, though. When I asked about float tanks, my psychiatrist said he doesn&#39;t want me to do one because I&#39;ve been through too much and it&#39;s too big of a risk to have myself that alone with my thoughts. Floating is like doing psychedelics, it seems. I don&#39;t know if meditation is 100% safe at this point, because I know it&#39;s very similar to those, too. Certainly transcendental meditation where you visit other planes of existence is psychotic bullshit, but that doesn&#39;t mean zen, for example, doesn&#39;t enhance your sensory experience of life dramatically.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone wants to keep us ignorant, though. I think all this is just too big of a beast for politicians to tackle. Even psychiatrists and neuroscientists don&#39;t know enough about it. Like I said, to most people the tao te ching is gibberish.</p>
