        How Kids are Raised Today
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s a comic I came across a few years ago that I find highly relevant (give it a second to load):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=teaching+comic+20+years+ago+vs+today&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;tbo=u&amp;amp;source=univ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXttTlkPnXAhUL9YMKHURxABIQsAQIKA&amp;amp;biw=1366&amp;amp;bih=652#imgrc=A89GplW-KEg5nM:">

      <p>
       If you don’t feel like clicking, the premise is essentially that when students messed up in the past, the students themselves were blamed. Now, if a student messes up, the teacher is blamed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before I begin writing this post, I want to note a few things:
      </p>
      <p>
       • I have a wonderful relationship with both parents and students
      </p>
      <p>
       • I have very,  very high ratings as a teacher in my state (I don’t care if you believe me, but I am actually being honored this month!)
      </p>
      <p>
       • I am NOT saying all students or parents are like this – I am concerned that there are some clear growing trends that people are avoiding
      </p>
      <p>
       • I work in a very low-income area, so my perceptions may be different than those working with students who come from higher socioeconomic backgrounds
      </p>
      <p>
       • I am not a parent myself
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to note those things because people will certainly avoid the main tenets of my post if I do not. Take my post as a generalization, and moreover, take it as a warning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, every generation complains about the upcoming generation, and I understand that will always be the case. But in this post, I want to propose that something different is happening. I feel the very structures of family and society are breaking (and technology is a huge culprit), but everything seems upside down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, I am not villainizing parents or even students; I am asking us all to reflect on larger society.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Parenting Styles
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Every parent has their own belief about the right way to raise their child, but I first want to argue that parents do not even have time, energy, or even the money to think about the best way to raise their child. Unfortunately, there are some studies that show parents spend just 34 minutes a day with their children:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/parents-spend-just-34-minutes-5518081">
        http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/parents-spend-just-34-minutes-5518081
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       While studies may slightly vary, you have probably heard that children spend more time with their teachers than their parents, and I feel there is something really wrong there. Schools should NOT be raising children. When schools raise children, consequently, two things can happen:
      </p>
      <p>
       1)  With parents spending so little time with their children, the last thing they may want to do is discipline them.
2)  Parents may leave the discipline (and other life essentials) up to teachers. Consequently, this can create a tense relationship between teachers and students, as they may be spending more time teaching Johnny how to behave than how to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Parents may be over-worked and the last thing they have the time or energy to do is discipline their kids. So, there we see a problem in society. It is no secret that people are simply over-worked:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=93604">
        http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=93604
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel for parents, but there are other issues at hand. On top of that, parenting styles have changed. While I do not advocate for extremes of the past, I also do not advocate for extremes of the present. Studies show that millennials are disciplining their children less:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8b2b/9c4c1b15ccec6a49edac32de14f485f3e7c9.pdf">
        https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8b2b/9c4c1b15ccec6a49edac32de14f485f3e7c9.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From the article,
      </p>
      <p>
       “So whether they're opting for the "traditional" or harsh methods that were used to discipline them, or opting for alternatives and reinforcing positives, millennial parents are simply approaching discipline like they do every other aspect of their lives: in their own way.”
      </p>
      <p>
       But that is where the problem lies. The lack of consistency in beliefs and morals in our society has created some chaos in the classroom. I can meet with 100 parents, and not one of them will agree on the “right” way to raise a child. To me, parents are doing what they think is best, but the problem is, nobody is actually trying to figure out what
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       best. For example, if disciplining “feels bad” or upsets the child, parents simply may not want to participate in it.  While there will always be disagreements on the best way to raise a child, research is clear, authoritative parenting is best for children:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.parentingscience.com/authoritative-parenting-style.html">
        https://www.parentingscience.com/authoritative-parenting-style.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       To quickly note:
      </p>
      <p>
       • Authoritarian parent: demand blind obedience from their children
      </p>
      <p>
       • Permissive parent: reluctant to impose rules and standards
      </p>
      <p>
       • Authoritative parent: warm, rational, high standards, negotiable
      </p>
      <p>
       Which sounds like the best parent? Which sounds like the best teacher? We all hated the teacher who was so strict you could barely learn because of a fearful environment, and we all may have liked the teacher who let us do what we want, but we never really learned anything (and it did not benefit us in the end). It is clear, there needs to be a balance, and that balance seems to be lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Family Matters
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Another huge issue is that more and more kids are being raised in single-parent homes, and while I am not here to villainize single parents, we need to be realistic. It’s simply just more difficult to raise kids on your own:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As a teacher, I am seeing more cases of neglect yearly, too:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, there is a serious problem in our society with lack of role models, especially male role models:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/jan/19/children-earlyyearseducation">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not care how controversial this is, but kids do better when they have both a mom and a dad. I am NOT saying that kids cannot fair well with just a mom and a dad, but statistically, they will do better. Studies show children fare better in traditional homes:
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the belief that gender roles do not exist or do not matter, there is something different that a child receives from a mother vs a father. I will tell you right now, that more than anything, my students do long for that ‘dad’ figure:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-long-reach-childhood/201106/the-importance-fathers">
        https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-long-reach-childhood/201106/the-importance-fathers
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From the article,
      </p>
      <p>
       “There is no question that fathers do play an important part in their children's lives; that the majority of studies affirm that an involved father can play a crucial role particularly in the cognitive, behavioral and general health and well-being areas of a child's life; that having a positive male role model helps an adolescent boy develop positive gender-role characteristics; that adolescent girls are more likely to form positive opinions of men and are better able to relate to them when fathered by an involved father; that it is generally accepted, under most circumstances, a father's presence and involvement can be as crucial to a child's healthy development as is the mother's; and that experiencing validation of their importance in the general parenting literature has made fathers much more conscious of their value and, in turn, leads to their greater desire to be involved.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, daily, in mainstream media, men and fathers are villainized. There is this belief that these single women can do it all on their own, and while maybe they CAN, I would like to argue they should NOT.
      </p>
      <p>
       As traditional family structures break down, our students lack a variety of role models, and they may seek those role models out in odd ways. Many children, for example, find celebrities to call ‘mom’ or ‘dad’.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2091316/friends-invented-calling-celebs-mom-dad/">
        http://www.mtv.com/news/2091316/friends-invented-calling-celebs-mom-dad/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of my students call me "mom" or "auntie", and while many of you may find that strange or abnormal, I understand it. Many go home and have a ‘mom’ but she may not be really there for them. Children seek mother and father figures, and they will seek guidance in those who even slightly resemble what should be their moms or dads. It breaks my heart.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Spoiled Kids
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There, I said it, but what the actual…this one infuriates me. Look, I absolutely believe in providing for your children and giving them special things occasionally. But things are getting out of control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Parents are spoiling their kids with ‘things’, not with love! Maybe in an effort to make up for being shoddy parents, many parents resort to materialism to get their kids to show their love. It’s not just material things, though, kids are literally ‘ruling the roost.’
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/02/spoiled-rotten">
        https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/02/spoiled-rotten
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From the article,
      </p>
      <p>
       “Druckerman talked to a lot of French mothers, all of them svelte and most apparently well rested. She learned that the French believe ignoring children is good for them. “French parents don’t worry that they’re going to damage their kids by frustrating them,” she writes. “To the contrary, they think their kids will be damaged if they can’t cope with frustration.” One mother, Martine, tells Druckerman that she always waited five minutes before picking up her infant daughter when she cried. While Druckerman and Martine are talking, in Martine’s suburban home, the daughter, now three, is baking cupcakes by herself. Bean is roughly the same age, “but it wouldn’t have occurred to me to let her do a complicated task like this all on her own,” Druckerman observes. “I’d be supervising, and she’d be resisting my supervision.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Also key, Druckerman discovered, is just saying non. In contrast to American parents, French parents, when they say it, actually mean it. They “view learning to cope with ‘no’ as a crucial step in a child’s evolution,” Druckerman writes. “It forces them to understand that there are other people in the world, with needs as powerful as their own.”
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen parents do everything they can to get their kids not to cry. Whatever happened to letting kids work through their emotions? They will get over it, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, I wish you could see what some parents expect in a classroom. There is now a legal form for nearly everything a kid might experience. While I am certainly happy there are legal protections for students who need them, this system is abused. There is one student I have who gets occasional headaches, and they can leave class whenever they want according to this form. It certainly isn’t surprising they leave when the work becomes a little tedious. Still, I won’t dismiss that maybe they really do have a condition and need a break (and I’m not against breaks!), but I wonder if parents have ever questioned if the student was lying. I don’t know at this point, and I don’t really care. I do my job, and I listen to the forms. Still, the future may be harder for these kids because the real world is NOT like that. When I get a headache at work, I have to keep working.
      </p>
      <p>
       These students start to believe that this is how the real world operates, and this sets them up for failure ultimately.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, kids are spoiled, but it isn’t their fault. Of course, parents want what is best for their children, so they believe that they must give into every whim for their child to be successful.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, in my experience, the most successful students have parents who call out their BS, even when they do not like it. This does NOT mean they are screaming at their kids or abusing them or anything like that.  They just are not going to play games.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Sensitivity or Self-Centeredness?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We have  ALL heard the words “safe space” and “triggers.” While I admire that this generation (and the upcoming one) may be more sensitive, I actually believe this sensitivity is simply a form of self-centeredness. Look, I am not saying that ‘triggers’ and ‘trauma’ do not exist (I am an abuse victim myself), and there is good reason for appropriate sensitivity:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/mar/10/student-protests-are-young-people-too-sensitive-these-days">
        https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/mar/10/student-protests-are-young-people-too-sensitive-these-days
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, there is a point where we are teaching students that the world is always going to cater to their individual needs, and to me that is dangerous. Even if these college campuses do this, the real world simply is not like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while students may be more centered on their own needs, they certainly are not worried about anybody else around them, and that is where the problem lies! Sensitivity is fine, but when one expects the world to revolve around them, and they do not even consider the world…well, that is the type of student we are raising.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is no surprise that students are less empathetic than ever:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-me-care/">
        https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-me-care/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From the article,
      </p>
      <p>
       “But the new finding that empathy is on the decline indicates that even when a trait is hardwired, social context can exert a profound effect, changing even our most basic emotional responses. Precisely what is sapping young people of their natural impulse to feel for others remains mysterious, however, because scientists cannot design a study to evaluate changes that occurred in the past. As Twenge puts it, “you can’t randomly assign people to a generation.”
      </p>
      <p>
       There are theories, however. Konrath cites the increase in social isolation, which has coincided with the drop in empathy.”

       So, sure, maybe kids are more aware of themselves than ever, but they certainly do not seem to care about anyone but themselves (unless it impacts them). They are drowning themselves in their own reflections. : )
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Technology
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only are we more isolated socially, but technology is creating the illusion that we more are connected:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I have written SO much about technology that I am going to summarize my main points about it here. I
      </p>
      <p>
       1)  Technology is just a tool. It is not inherently good or bad. It is how it used.
      </p>
      <p>
       2)  The problem is that 50% of teenagers feel they are addicted to their phones. Then, it is no longer a tool. It is a problem:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       3)  The problem is that I work with students who would rather be on their phones then play basketball, learn, or hang out with friends (sitting on phones in a room of people does NOT count as hanging out with friends).
      </p>
      <p>
       4)  Technology is increasing narcissism, which goes back to the sensitivity vs. self-centeredness point:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       5)  Technology is making people less empathetic:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And ultimately, technology is replacing parenting. Technology is the new “pacifier” that calms down children:
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I use technology daily in my classroom, and in many ways, it has opened up the world to my students. The problem is, at the end of the day, kids are NOT using technology to learn about things they are interested in. They are using it to be entertained.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many are now living their lives through a screen, where everything can be “filtered”, even reality. In fact, I feel that students are becoming more disconnected with reality because it is so easy to filter anything with technology. Living through a screen is not the same as living.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earlier I was talking to a friend, and he said, if he ever wanted to rule the world, he would simply use technology to create endless distractions and entertainment. I think he’s on to something…
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Anything Goes! Everybody is SPECIAL! You CAN BE ANYTHING!!!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       First and foremost, we live in a society where there truly is a degradation of standards or morals. Almost anything goes now, and this is viewed as “progressive.” If you think the guy who identifies as a “transracial Filipino” then YOU are a bigot, and there is something wrong with YOU, not society:
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And now, we literally are trusting a three to four year old child to make decisions about their gender identity that will permanently impact their lives:
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We are treating children as wise – not innocent. We, adults, are losing our wisdom.
      </p>
      <p>
       We tell kids that they can be anything and they will always be catered to, and we are lying to them! More and more college students are struggling to find jobs, but we keep telling kids the world is theirs:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I’m not saying we have to bring children down, but I feel like we are allowing them to live in a fantasy in order to cope with reality. On top of lack of discipline and standards and empathy, we are not letting our kids see reality for what it is. It’s not that we shouldn’t push kids toward their dreams. The problem is, I think we are letting kids live as if the world is a dream.

       <strong>
        What about Education?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Education in itself is a conspiracy, and I have written so much about this. Still, I wanted to summarize a few points about education that are contributing to severe problems in our society. I wanted to focus more on education related to parenting, than education itself (as that would require a doctorate thesis right now):
      </p>
      <p>
       1)  Kids are not allowed to be kids anymore. Playgrounds are gone. Parents are suing kids like crazy. Anything is a law suit, the ‘Red Rover’ law suit:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Santee-School-District-Settles-15K-Red-Rover-Lawsuit-with-Parents-230152241.html">
        https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Santee-School-District-Settles-15K-Red-Rover-Lawsuit-with-Parents-230152241.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       2)  Kids are coming too school knowing too much about things they cannot understand. Teachers are expected to engage kids who are interested in adult themes, yet may not even have reading skills. This creates a HUGE issue. For example, a kid may have a grade 3 reading level, but they may already be watching anything they want about any topic at home. Traditional books to teach them how to read just are not going to interest them. (I could write a whole other post about this). I mean, Curious George is not interesting when you are five years old and already know what sex is...
      </p>
      <p>
       3)  Parents and teachers have become enemies in many ways. Divide and conquer?:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2014/nov/20/private-school-parents-teachers">
        https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2014/nov/20/private-school-parents-teachers
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       4)  Kids do not know how to ‘be bored’ anymore. I tell my students, “Sometimes things are boring, and that’s okay.” Boredom can allow creativity and ideas, yet students may not even know how to cope with boredom:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://community.today.com/parentingteam/post/the-im-bored-generation-heres-why-our-kids-need-to-be-unplugged-and-restarted_1490029767">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       5)  In schools, children are treated as numbers. They are often no more than a test score. They are treated as robots who must perform. We all know the dangers of testing mania in our country. Are tests necessary? Absolutely! Is there a profit behind this all? Um…yeah:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/rainesford-alexandra/the-business-of-standardi_b_9785988.html">
        https://www.huffingtonpost.com/rainesford-alexandra/the-business-of-standardi_b_9785988.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Schools have become businesses, but they are NOT businesses (or they should not be).
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m willing to answer any questions about education that I have not addressed here.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Conclusion
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We are failing our kids. They look to us, adults, but all they see us doing is posting selfies and statuses on social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, it goes beyond that. The conspiracy is that this is ALL purposeful. I believe that our children are being dehumanized. They are living in a world of technology where they can become Gods themselves (or at least think they can).
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody is reflecting - except on the screen in front of them. The modern Narcissist from the classical myth would die in the blackness of his screen, maybe not in a pool of water.
      </p>
      <p>
       To end with my favorite quotes about parenting:
      </p>
      <p>
       “It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.” – Frederick Douglass
      </p>
      <p>
       “Don’t worry that children never listen to. Worry that they are always watching you.” – Robert Fulghum
      </p>
      <p>
       “Everybody knows how to raise children, except the people who have them.” - P.J. O'Rourke
      </p>
      <p>
       I ended with that quote because I know that raising children is NOT easy, and I do not have my own child. Still, years of teaching hundreds upon hundreds of students has given me some insight.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best parents, I have seen, expect the best for their children, within the confines of reality, and they prepare them for the real world, with warmth, love, and dignity.
      </p>

       Seems to me that most parents deep down know they are shitty parents, but they also know deep down they aren't going to change. This is why they either ignore or get defensive when people raise points like in the OP.

       I think about these issues frequently with great concern. Hypnotized parents, often overwhelmed or addicted or lazy won't interfere in the systems of control. Elsagate type material is oversexualizing children which I see as a mass grooming.

       My brother is in his final year of teaching, he says many parents view school as a daycare center for their kids. He was telling me last week a fight broke out and he wanted to separate the boys as one kid was getting the worst of it. So I asked him why he didn't and he said district policy is not to get between two fighting students. What kind of asinine rule is that?

       That is the rule. The school and the teacher can be sued for putting their hands on a student- even if it is to separate two students who are fighting. If a student gets hurt by a teacher (even if they were the one punching another student) - lawsuit. It has nothing to do with what is right and everything to do with avoiding more of the education budget getting sucked up by litigious parents looking for a big payout. Scum.

       Couldn't agree more.  Ultimately our social programmers are counting on the state schools to be the parents of our children.  I worry that our public schools are using outcome based education in a way that dehumanize children as if they were lab rats.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as our self centered culture continues to abdicate their responsibilities as parents, someone else will get the privilege of influencing their child's morals and values.

       It's just so odd. Parents I think are just even too tired to examine, and that's what they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       The parents are products as children are. We are all a result of our programming.

       The same collectivist oligarchs who spearheaded public education through the tax free foundations beginning in the Progressive Era.  Of course it is their ideological (in many cases family) legacies that now coordinate the subtle behavioral programming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, the big money behind all of this wants good workers, not thinkers.  Public education's emphasis is on behavior, not intellectual growth.

       Yep, they don't try try to help bring the potential out of people rather they try to bring people into a particular frame of mind. Or a habit of repetition. Most of what they teach in school has no real basis in life. At least at the public schools I attended.

       My wife is a teacher and this is definitely true.  The parents like to use email now to find out why their kid got a 0 on an assignment they didn't turn in.  It is always " they said they turned it in". Like they don't know their child is a liar.  It is strange.  You can't even discipline the kids with things like detention if they act out.  Classes are over crowded in a lot of places too.

       Well said...good post, and thanks for putting the time into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a parent, I think one of the things we don't do is let our kids fail. I have 2 kids with a big age difference. I helicoptered the first, and he had no intrinsic motivation to succeed by the time he got to high school. I realize many factors may be the reason, but I have a suspicion that he felt no worries, mom or dad would take care of it. (He came around in college thankfully, probably because we were out of the picture) The youngest, now 10, is completely different. While I may ask if he has homework, the burden is on him. If he doesn't plan the time for it, then he knows he has to go to his teacher and admit fault. And he knows I won't push him, if he fails to do it, he feels shame due to his actions. I'll let you know in a few years how it turns out...
      </p>
      <p>
       Just one side of the spectrum, I know this doesn't represent many other perspectives. But, they need to know the responsibility of getting tasks done, and what it feels like when they slack. Let em fail, when it won't ruin their life to do so.

       Wow thanks for the little tidbit about helicopter parenting. It definitely eliminates intrinsic motivation.

       Your reflection itself shows you're a good parent!

       It is easy to criticise parents for going along with the system when you are not a parent yourself. I know a lot of guys who hate how much TV and processed food their wives/girlfriends allow their kids to consume, but feel powerless. Every time it is brought up an argument ensures.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dysfunction begins with the relationship itself and then festers as kids come into the picture.

       If you get with somebody for sex, or to not feel lonely, don't be surprised when you find yourself fighting enemies in your own house.

       Great post, a really fascinating read and full of great sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wanted to comment and touch on the article about the child who fell and broke his leg playing Red Rover.  I think we should be careful using individual cases like that to prove your point, I don't even disagree with your overall point, play time is SERIOUSLY important and younger kids (like pre school and kindergarten) learn via playtime/guided playtime/structured playtime more than they'll learn by just sitting in their seats looking at math they can't understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the article you linked, it doesn't specify any real details, we can't judge how serious the injury was because neither party or their lawyers were speaking, all we know is the extend of the child's recovery, the cost of coverage the school paid out, and the age of the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       7th grade for a boy means he is starting to get BIG, Red Rover is a game that needs to be cut off before puberty ends because it basically involves throwing yourself at two people trying to resist your running force with their fingers and wrists.  Children in kindergarten or first grade will be fine, 7th graders, boys who have hit their growth spurt running into smaller boys or girls, can really hurt someone.  They probably shouldn't have been playing Red Rover, and then there is this line:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        playing a game of Red Rover during an unsupervised physical education class.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Unsupervised.  What was happening there?  I remember my time in middle school and I can't think of a time we weren't supervised.  Either the school had super relaxed gym class policies, or the teacher lapsed BIG TIME in their judgement, allowing a game of Red Rover to occur while no adult was present.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I'm saying is that this might not be a case of a school overreacting and banning playtime, but a case where a school was being way too relaxed and it allowed a child to get hurt.  In which case, a lawsuit is perfectly acceptable.

       Great post!

       What/how do you feel about the term "Millennial"? Working with at risk children myself, anytime they are refereed as one, they treat like a slur, like adults will never respect their opinion, is what they would tell me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have personal opinions on this as well, but I would rather focus on learning something from someone who really put some thought into this.

       I think some are more aware than others. I think most are losing the art of self reflection though. If my students took offense to the term (Which I don't think I'd ever even use around them), I would say 'prove the world wrong.'

       Thank you for your reply.  I bristle at someone saying the words millennial as a point to convince them to do something. It’s like people referring to me constantly ass black guy, or black guys do this.

       Please do no forget the chemical environment that today's children are raised in. Vaccine damage is a real thing and for every (latest figures, 1 in 36) autism child we can expect many children with similar but sub clinical neurological damage.

       Blaming parents is cool and everything but their is plenty of other plausible places to point he finger that aren't teachers or parents.

       Really enjoyed this post. Sometimes I need a little push to remember discipline is important! I always feel so guilty punishing my children.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there is a big issue with parents not wanting to challenge their children. My daughter was on her way to a diagnosis of autism. We worked intensely with her on emotional intelligence and empathy. Amazingly within 6 months of this we saw a big difference. Now over a year later she's a different child, incredibly empathetic and has amazing social skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we hadn't worked intensely to help her, she would probably be diagnosed as autistic and potentially not be in a mainstream school. People seem to mistake challenging as not accepting your child for who they are. But you can adore and accept the person your child is, while pushing them to reach their full potential

       I definitely feel for parents. I really think it's because the last thing a parent wants to do with the little time they have is fight with them.

       Great post. You've reminded me that I need to get back to working on better discipline -- stop being such a pushover/best friend dad. It's hard.

       I think the best parents are reflective parents. I think the fact that you even care if what really matters. Every parent is going to make mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       My parents think I have some sort of hatred of them because they made mistakes and I don't. I get more irritated that they can't admit that sometimes not everything they did was gold.

       I see people all the time that don’t spend time with their children. I believe the 34 min a day. Both my husband and I work from home and we are currently pregnant. Our friends have an infant and both work away from home while the baby goes to daycare. My husband commented the other day how our daughter will have more time with us in a week then they’ll get with their daughter in a month. They’re lovely people but it’ll be interesting to see the behavioral differences with a child sent to daycare from 6 weeks on and parents who don’t get to spend much time with their child vs. our kid who will have both of us 24 hrs a day until preschool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also no one teaches their kid to wait. I worked in France as a nanny years ago and they believe in teaching children to wait. You rarely if ever see children misbehaving over there and even out to dinner most 3 yr olds are able to entertain themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       People worship their children and think they can do no wrong and yet get surprised when they are depressed, out of control, and bad mannered.

       Yes we are giving into every child's whim! We are teaching them nothing like patience, independence, or "you can't always get what you want."

       Thank you for posting your thoughts, we must always question our way of being, as we are not always as "free" as we like to think we are. Indoctrination is a huge part of society, and there appears to be a world-governing body that is willing to execute plans over decades, centuries and millennia.
      </p>
      <p>
       user/polkadotgirl - can I ask if you formulated your thoughts above for this post, or is your past from a larger piece of work? Either way, you are well thought, logical while providing reference.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a parent, there is so much to get right, and a lot that could go wrong. The authority to take responsibility for my own actions and the actions of my children is essential. This power must remain in our possession and not assigned to another authority outside our domain. We do know that there are those who are interested in seizing our authority over our own children, and to that, there is an agenda as part of a decades long plan, across the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks again,
ETamongUS

        Thank you for posting your thoughts, we must always question our way of being, as we are not always as "free" as we like to think we are. Indoctrination is a huge part of society, and there appears to be a world-governing body that is willing to execute plans over decades, centuries and millennia.

       I absolutely agree!

        user/polkadotgirl - can I ask if you formulated your thoughts above for this post, or is your past from a larger piece of work? Either way, you are well thought, logical while providing reference.

        I wrote it on a word document after work. It took me like an hour! Haha. : )

        As a parent, there is so much to get right, and a lot that could go wrong. The authority to take responsibility for my own actions and the actions of my children is essential. This power must remain in our possession and not assigned to another authority outside our domain. We do know that there are those who are interested in seizing our authority over our own children, and to that, there is an agenda as part of a decades long plan, across the globe.

       Great post op. My dad has been a teacher for over 20 years and comments about this regularly. Ever since about 2009/10 he's been complaining about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In school I always grasped the material the first time I heard the teacher teaching it. I didn't need to study. I got A's on every test all throughout middle and high school. I just didn't do homework so my grades were always d or c . Didn't see the point of it since it's supposed to reenforced what taught if I already got the material I didn't think I should have to waste my out of school time on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My dad never once blamed my teachers. He always yelled at me about it and asked teachers what could be done (nothing) but it was always my faukt

       As someone from an divorced family. I feel the biggest issue with kids development is wether parents are there. My dad left. And that forced my mom to work more. So I really didn't have parents. Luckily for me I had my grandparents around.

       Great post Miss Dot. It's such a simple concept yet without it being pointed out in a concise way it falls on to the back burner of every parents mind. I think about these issues and my daughter all the time, shes nearly a pre-teen now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The job of the parents to educate their child about the world and how it really works is the most important job of your life and people seem to have forgotten that duty. However, not all of us have and will continue to fight for truth and the greater good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Children are being exposed to adult themes at an unprecedented level and it is worrying. We cannot allow them to sneak in invasive censorship laws under false pretenses though. They might be doing a multi-faceted approach of grooming children, while at the same time brainwashing and corrupting them. Then they will use the examples of the horrifying garbage they have allowed to be exposed to our children to censor our voice against it, and eventually the will to fight against it. (Too bad it wont work!)

       You say insightful things, but you do not have the personal experience to offer a realistic solution for these busy parents that are somehow the demise of society.

       Yep, they don't try try to help bring the potential out of people rather they try to bring people into a particular frame of mind. Or a habit of repetition. Most of what they teach in school has no real basis in life. At least at the public schools I attended.
