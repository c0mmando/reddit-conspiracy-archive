       I think the social engineers used this entire election as a way to "kickstart" their 4-8 year plan for bringing in the social collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB know that they are working under a tight deadline, and the world population is awakening to the nature of their organized criminal operation. Polarizing the world's populations through their phony rigged elections seems to be a great way to incite social tension and partisan chaos among the people. Obviously, any social engineer knows rule #1 is keep the population divided at all costs.
       <strong>
        Divide and conquer has been the basis of how this entity operates for hundreds of years.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       With that in mind, consider that the Trump vs Hillary election narrative was just an appealing and easy way to "trap" the nation into a big chaotic dumpster fire of political, social, sexual, and racial tension. TPTB stage every election, as they did with this one, and I think they are designing
       <strong>
        Trump's character to be a racist villain bad guy to the Liberals, but an anti estblishment hero to the Conservatives.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to wake the fuck up and realize the dude is actually just another installment of the elite. A puppet. We need to find a way to unify once again, because we're definitely going to see more racially motivated events, protests, feminist marches, police/black shootings, and the media will use ALLLLL of this to create more hostility and tension.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea is to stir the pot and get everyone all riled up and polarized in every way possible, so that when they bring in their staged economic collapse endgame, none of us will be able to unite and solve the problem together. That's the entire premise behind divide and conquer.

       There is plenty of thought on 'the left' which considers most politicians puppets installed by the elite. Its only the right wing, trump supporters and liberals which are still blinded by the status quo. The right ring seem to think trump is (((their guy))) when in reality he's just the latest in the long line of neo liberal, bourgeoise puppets.

       The right could say this same thing that you just said. People staying in their echo chambers is keeping this illusion alive. If the left-right would want to unite under the fact that our politicians are bought out and our government is riddled with corruption, we could actually change something. In my opinion, I think the right are more willing to compromise than the left. I would like to know if any on the left ever read any of the info at wikileaks? All of their media outlets/high traffic websites we're under direct orders from the DNC.

       I'll admit there are some on the right that see through the charade of western 'democracy', but their solution either seems to be more of the same (reactionary, conservatism, trump ect) or a further lurch towards fascism, something I think directly supports TPTB, who would love nothing more than being able to implement the totalitarian regimes that fascists support.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think at this point it is important to make a distinction between 'the left' in terms of people who support Hillary or 'Liberals' / the soft left, and further left ideology which seeks alternatives outside of the current status quo. Same can be said for for 'The Right', in terms of your average trump supporter and the Alt-Right / more far-right fascist elements.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that uniting people would be the best course of action, my point is that there is plenty of thought and action aimed at uniting the working class from the left, not so much the right who seem intent on doubling down on the division which plays into the whole point on divide and conquer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Insofar as Wikileaks, I've been following them for years personally and I bet even Julian Assange himself would be classed as a 'leftist'. There is plenty of recgonition of wikileaks on the left, and I don't think they support either side of the U.S two party state, rather splill dirt on both sides. They seem non-partisan.

       I'm more center right, but I do share progressive and socialistic ideals. I would bet that the majority of Trump supporters share those same ideals. In my personal experience, I have never seen any attempt at unity from the left. The only thing that I've seen is them forcing their politics onto people. If the right doesn't fall in line they're call nazis and physically assaulted.
