<p>This is what boggles my mind about people who call for censorship.</p>

<p>Someone is always on the negative end of censorship. This is why censorship of all kinds is considered universally bad by people with a lick of sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to disagree. There&#39;s an awful lot of news here that is absolutely, 100% connected to conspiracy. I check in daily and I see very little that is JUST news. I think if you&#39;re trying to, for instance, claim articles about mainstream media fake news or pretty much anything about politics is NOT conspiracy, you really don&#39;t understand what we&#39;re dealing with. There really isn&#39;t &#39;conspiracies&#39; anymore. Yes there&#39;s individual topics we could focus on, but largely we are dealing with a central global conspiracy in which we all live that has many, many arms. </p>

<p>I&#39;d actually have to also question your motives in, perhaps, incorrectly writing things off as &#39;news&#39; and having no connection to this global conspiracy. This seems like little more than censorship to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, we can allow your point. There is a lot of news that is connected to conspiracies... I never said there wasn&#39;t. I never even hinted that their wasn&#39;t. I just said that news that isn&#39;t connected to conspiracies should be removed, that mindless cross posting should be removed. It is pretty easy to tell the difference. Maybe CNN or FOX lying is connected to a greater conspiracy, maybe it isn&#39;t, but the majority of posts pushing those types of articles seem to have little to do with that larger discussion. </p>

<p>I gave those two examples as types of posts that we often see 2-5 of on a given day. We do not need all five. I also said &quot;There may be valid discussions to have about these topics&quot; given the context of this sub, but you seem to have ignored that in your final thought where you question my motives.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a problem with you questioning my motives, but I do have a problem with you crafting your own insinuations about what I am saying into a particular narrative that was not pushing and then questioning my motives based on the narrative you&#39;ve concocted. </p>
