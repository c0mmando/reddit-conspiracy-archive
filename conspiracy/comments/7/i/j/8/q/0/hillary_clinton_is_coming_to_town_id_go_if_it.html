       this is the description of her speaking event in my local weekly:
      </p>
      <p>
       Beloved former Secretary of State/current advocate for sanity and democracy Hillary Rodham Clinton is like the final girl of American politics. No matter what sexist garbage gets thrown at her, she comes out stronger, with her ambition and belief in the promise of America unscathed, and she’s having a gracious, fierce second act as the author of What Happened, a supporter of emerging activists, and a Teen Vogue (!) guest editor. Bear witness.

       are these people just unbelievably naive or, bought off?

       Don't forget that back row tickets to her events cost in the hundreds of dollars, and it's usually 2k+ for front row seats. These events are filled with 1%ers flocking to hear the Queen and her revisionist stories.

       actually, the tickets ranged between 132 dollars and 252 dollars.

       Interesting. I was basing it off of an event she held in NYC where the prices followed those I laid out. That'll teach me to over-generalize. I still stand by the rest of the statement, however.

       it's quite possible that the front row seats are more expensive.. i can't imagine they'd let just some peasant such as myself, get so close to her.

       Well, people have been sexist towards her, and investigated her for 20 years, and are still bitching and moaning about her.

       Maybe she should just go away like most other failed presidential contenders. But her hubris won't allow for that. Nor will her power hungry control of the DNC, nor her even more powerful donors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt she will run in 2020, but the fact that Kamala Harris met with HRC and her major donors in the Hampton's several times this summer, and has hired several of her former staff, should speak volumes about the place HRC still holds in the Corporatist Wing of the DNC. She does seem to be at odds with Obama's wing, however, which seems to be trying to coalesce around Deval Patrick.
      </p>
      <p>
       I welcome their infighting, it gives us real Progressives a chance to take the Party from the ground up and launch a serious insurgency again come 2020.

       If you read my comment you just replied to, you would see how that's just not the case. HRC hasn't gone away because she doesn't
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to, and still is playing politics within the DNC. That's why anyone concerned about a fair Primary, a Progressive Democratic Party, and cleaning house at the DNC is still concerned with HRC.

       I'm a "Democrat" only because my state forces me to do so in order to vote for Progressive candidates in semi-closed Primaries. I consider myself a Progressive in the same
vein as William Jennings Bryan and Bernie first and foremost, and don't vote along "party lines". I will write in or abstain if it's a corporatist vs. corporatist local election. But I want to see the part cleansed of big money and returned to its New Deal roots.

       Do they not have a progressive branch of libertarians? Because it needs to start somewhere. And the progressive branch vs the conservative branch (as a former burnie guy) i find quite agreeable.

       The clintons themselves are a longer running conspiracy theory than 9/11. They will go down much like rosewell in the world of curious secrets of amerika.

       The clintons have been at the top of the USSA longer than putin has been involved. Not the puppet in chief most of the time, but definately in power and making $$$$ way more than any public servant has justification for. :/

       That's what I don't get. They were literally buying pizzas for the nine people that lined up to buy the first edition, a week later she was bent about the Costco gig, then she started selling out high ticket venues.

       A friend of mine told me that she’s flying to Vancouver for a few days and I asked her why. She told me that she was going to a seminar given by Hillary Clinton. I laughed out loud and asked her why she would go and see her. She said that she was her hero and she has great respect for her. I looked at her and said well what about Benghazi?what about Libya? what about Haiti? What about her accosting Bills assault victims? She just looked at me and smiled and said I don’t care I really like her. Darrrrrr
