<p>Are we just going to sit here and watch these religious fucks run our civilization to the ground, destroy our chance of technological utopia and enslave us and our descendants in a perverse technocratic prison?</p>

<p>It depresses the hell out of me that this is even happening.</p>

<p>Surely there are people and groups out there actively working towards fighting this.
How could the people who work on advance technology even be so fucking gullible to fall for this or allow these cretin to take advantage of their work.</p>

<p>Honestly at this point I would rather humanity be completely annihilated by mass nuclear war than to suffer through the NWO&#39;s agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any ideology can be weaponized. My problem with this post is that it&#39;s placing all blame on religion, which is likely attractive to atheists but very simplistic.</p>

<p>Human evil always seems to find a way. Placing all the blame on a certain group of people (in this case theists) is just one of the many roads to tyranny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conservative religious groups need fear and prophecy gives them that. Eventually they have to either deliver directly or something close to what people are expecting. </p>

<p>Remember how Saddam was supposed to be the anti-christ to some back in the day and the war (first one, then second one both) was all about bible prophecy being fulfilled? Well, didn&#39;t happen and people have become complacent. Less people believing that crap and so they need something to shake em up.</p>

<p>What do televangelists, rw preachers and politicians all have in common? Preaching fear, morality, pushing propaganda, sucking up to and praising Israel, and pushing war as a solution (fight them over there so we don&#39;t have to over here - all the while restricting freedoms here because they never believed that shit anyway).</p>

<p>RW christians see trump as a fulfiller of prophecy and as appointed by god. You can&#39;t rationalize with such people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think these things sound exciting but will become nightmarish. With virtual reality, imagine a society of socially inept loners sitting around their homes living in a fantasy world. You will lose grasp of reality.

    <div class="md"><p>Well with VR they would have a platform to freely express themselves and grow socially, whether that be interacting with other humans in vr or A.I..
Not everyone wants to be part of this world, so give them a platform to freely live out their desired life.
Actually I think we should all live in VR, whether you want a private world or share one with the people of your birth planet.
In VR we could create a life for humans that reflects how we truly want to live, and through time dilation live indefinitely.</p>

<p>Immortality to a certain extent is possible and should be encouraged.
Why doom conscious beings to a short lived life, when they could exist how ever long they desire?
You could come up with philosophical reasons for why you think people should only live to a certain point, but really there is no reason for putting on a limit on human lifespans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think we can live in VR. It is unhealthy and unproductive to live in fantasy. The internet is bad enough and I think we are already seeing the dangers of things like social media. Eventually you need to log off and live real life. </p>

<p>As for immortality, you would need to become part machine. You wouldn’t even be human at that point and that’s a scary leap turning people, the rich, into gods. </p>

<p>Non-religious motives were responsible for the deaths of 200 million in the last century. Science created earth-destroying firepower, not the church or radical Islam. </p>
