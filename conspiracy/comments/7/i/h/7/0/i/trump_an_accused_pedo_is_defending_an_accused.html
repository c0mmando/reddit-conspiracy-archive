       Pizzagators here still supporting Trump are absolutely destroying the credibility of everything related to pedogate. He's literally
       <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/939149296389251072">
        spreading lies on Twitter to help elect a (probable) pedo
       </a>
       just because he needs the vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       How are people supposed to believe that the esoteric symbols and in-jokes that define Pizzagate are more credible than multiple victims coming forward to say they've been abused?
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not you believe the allegations against Trump and Moore are true, if you're trying to argue that Pizzagate is a thing while denying the voices of the people coming forward to say they've been abused, how are people supposed to take you seriously?
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop fucking with the credibility of people trying to expose abuse. Either acknowledge that powerful people (including Trump and Moore) are potential abusers, or stop pretending to care about the victims. You're making things harder for everyone trying to make this a serious conversation.

       Well it turns out this post got swarmed with downvotes by the lovers of the pedo establishment, so I guess that means I'm the silent majority now, and pedo pedes are the swamp?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, this post has been a great opportunity to tag people for their disinterest in pedophilia, so if I see any of these fuckheads whining about Pizzagate, at least I'll be able to show people how their bullshit and lies are about defending Republicans, not about protecting kids.

       It's getting downloaded because it's an idiotic post. DURRHURR TRUMP PEDO go spew that shit in the politics sub. Literally anyone can be an accused pedophile. I can accuse you of molesting little boys and that would make you an accused pedophile. The left will accuse anyone of anything if it means they'll get elected with their bullshit identity politics.

       If people applied your logic to Pizzagate, it wouldn't be a thing. If you agree that's a load of shit created to distract people from
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       paedophiles then it's a good point, but for those who disbelieve credible victims while engaging in incredulous Pizzagate fantasies, then you're doing a huge favor to establishment paedophiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, it's hard to believe you're actually interested in the truth when you spew partisan bullshit like:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The left will accuse anyone of anything
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I wasn't trying to make this a left vs right thing, because we're supposed to be above that. Unfortunately a lot of people don't see it that way. Of course, like you, I could have said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The right will invent bullshit nonsense about ridiculous pedo symbology to distract from the actual acts of child abuse being committed by those they support.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But this fucking subreddit is not supposed to be right vs left, it's supposed to be truth vs power. I want to know how people can support credibly accused sex pests Trump and Moore while saying they care about child abuse when it's convenient because their elaborate nonsense implicates democrats.

       You mean the lawsuit that alleges he raped a 13 year old that was anonymously sent in when he won the Republican nomination. The one that was then removed when no one showed up to the  court hearing. The same lawsuit that was  brought back a month before the general but then later self removed when no one could find the filer of the lawsuit? Seems legit.

       The one that it turned out was orchestrated by the former Jerry Springer producer with a history of fraudulent lawsuits and blackmail schemes? The one that The Guardian newspaper got to the bottom of and the former Jerry Springer producer threatened to kick their ass and put The Guardian out of business if they revealed his corruption? The one who had Lisa Bloom as her lawyer, the same Lisa Bloom who was the attorney for Harvey Weinstein?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that the 13-year old rape "victim" this clown is talking about, you think?

       My response to that (the one you've so conveniently forgotten about) is:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Did I sign an underage girls yearbook and have dozens of women accuse me of rape while at the same time have the track record of being a creep and needing to be separate from young women?

      <p>
       The main problem with pedo pedes is that they constantly pretend to play dumb, while actually being incredibly stupid and naive. It's like trying to have a reasoned argument with a porn spam bot that's programmed to insult everyone who calls it spam. Or a bot.

       You avoided the original commenter's question because you know that it proves that you're actually a pedo supporter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of answering the question, you pretended as if it didn't matter because of who asked it. You implied that only the OP of this submission could ask that question.
      </p>
      <p>
       I repeated the question you were dodging, and you continued to dodge it, either by playing dumb, or because you're genuinely too stupid to understand the conversation you were participating in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, I clarified everything for you, and your justification for deflecting this time is that I took too long to explain the obvious thing you were pretending/too stupid to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that you never intended to answer the question, but I thought I'd give you that opportunity to prove that you aren't just an establishment defending pedo supporter. As expected, you deflected and hid.

       I'm getting annoyed at the politicization of this whole topic. Why do we have to wait until an election is coming up to find out someone is a predatory pervert? The fact that people stay quiet until an election is near, then brings on accusations, is gross and reeks of political motivation. People have been preyed on and all anyone seems to care about is basically "this guys a pervert, now you'll vote for the other team right:)"

       1) everyone of the public should see right through these tactics unless they are retarded.

       2) NO one is screeching these accusations except the leftist media and their paid online trolls (HI Sharia Blue!) - they turn the volume to 11, but their audience figures crater day after day, tanking along with their public trust.

       Pretty much. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to gloss over actual victims. Sexual assault is disgusting and should never be tolerated in any form. But at the same time, I'm not stupid. Wild accusations with no backing are most likely to fly in the face of anyone with any sort of political power.

       The problem is that a lot of these people like Weinstein, spacey, singer, Conyers, etc have been dogged by stories for years, and the fact that they are abusers is basically an open secret.  These people travel in the same circles and are intimately connected to pizzagate figures, spacey and Weinstein have long been tight with the Clinton's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moore and trump don't seem to have q connection other than recent political alignment, and Moore's allegations somehow only came to light after the point in the election where he could no longer be replaced as a candidate.  Is it normal for abuse victims to coordinate with a political strategy?  There are many problems with the victim accounts and news stories as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump did fly with Epstein, so it's very possible he was with underage girls at the time.  So there's that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the #1 reason people are supporting trump is because without him, there is no hope that any of this information will be acted on.  A lot seems to be happening.  Without trump, they just close ranks and it all goes away.  People want to see prosecutions, so who else is going to provide the political cover for any of this to happen?

       any allegations of anything can be hurled at anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without evidence and due process, allegations are nothing more than a witch hunt. It doesnt make it any better just because the crimes are heinous (pedo) - without due process and evidence you cant destroy someones life.
      </p>
      <p>
       And posting as OP did that Trump is a pedo, defending a "probable   pedo" is sickening. Piling up the supposed victim count doesnt make the allegations suddenly not require evidence and due process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop being a leftist shill - I know the big narrative coming up here is "sexual predator" - as all the others have been dismal failures - but repeat slowly after me "DUE PROCESS and EVIDENCE".
