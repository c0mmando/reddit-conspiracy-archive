        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is there any evidence that he knew any of these women other than the Yearbook entry? Provided it&#39;s real and he did visit the diner she worked at and he did sign her yearbook. Where is the evidence that sexual misconduct happened in any of these cases other than word of mouth. Why did these women only come out and talk about this once Trump became president and once Moore ran for Senate? Moore had already been in the limelight as a State Chief Justice for 3 years, also in his second term. Let&#39;s not kid ourselves, what&#39;s the fucking deal here? Is this a political hit? Why would it be? Where were the allegations when he ran for CHIEF JUSTICE twice?  </p>

<p>I urge people to actually look at the facts. We should not consider testimony of a woman as fact because he has ran before and no one said anything. Only now Trump is president, and Roy is a Republican. I&#39;d like some honest opinions here but how hard would it really be to get 10 hillary-loving democrat girls that went to school, worked or lived near Roy to create these allegations? Better yet, what about finding 10 salty Roy exes that would kill to see him out of office? Think about this critically and respond, please don&#39;t just downvote my post.  </p>

<p>Seriously. Respond if you disagree, don&#39;t downvote. This is an important topic and you cannot let your political affiliation or stance on rape (hopefully we all share that one) cloud the facts. Because there actually aren&#39;t any facts about these allegations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they don&#39;t follow politics why did they get word he was running for Senator. Surely if they vote for their Senator there is a box below with voting for your Supreme Court Justices too, right? You cannot say these women did not follow politics because they obviously followed it enough to make these allegations before Roy was even voted into office. Also, the crowd was 4,000 at the state capitol. Do you really think taking the percentage out of the entire state is a fair comparison of the event? If one million people protested in LA would you not care because &quot;it&#39;s only like .04% of the California population&quot;</p>

<p>You don&#39;t know that. Just look at all the other allegations. Do you think that Bryan Singer is &quot;powerful enough to make you disappear&quot;? Or all these other second class Hollywood rapists which stepped down? No. Sometimes it takes time and other victims to come forward to make a difference.</p>

<p>I can also make the same argument against Roy Moore. He was a local politician which was &quot;powerful enough to make you disappear&quot;. Which is just bullshitting.</p>

<p>But for REAL - EIGHT women have come out against Roy Moore. six of which were under 18 when Roy Morre was in his 30&#39;s.  That&#39;s some robbing the cradle stuff, right there, probably true too.   </p>

<p>The timing? Before a senate race? Sure, that could be perceived as fishy, but you can not forget that these allegations are on the heels of the Weinstein Gate / hashtag meTOO gate. Without Twitter - it&#39;s entirely possible that these dirty men would still be in business.  </p>

Obviously I would not do that and I&#39;m generally for 18 being the age of consent but none of what Roy did was illegal or predatorial. The girls were never under 16, the which was the law. Him picking up young girls at the mall is equivalent to him picking up girls at a bar, only the age difference makes people equate him to a sexual predator, even though it was legal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Roy does like younger girls. That is legal under Alabama law, and it is commonplace there otherwise it&#39;d be changed. Let&#39;s say, for a moment, that Roy liked younger women but never touched them inappropriately or did anything bad to them. How hard would it be for him to defend against sexual allegations given that he likes younger women? Do you see where I&#39;m coming from. We NEED evidence of misconduct, we cannot just call him a criminal because he likes 16 year olds. Sure, that may violate people&#39;s moral laws of sexual age but it doesn&#39;t violate the morals of people in Alabama or legislators in Alabama.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, we are deep in the realm of purposeful misunderstanding. Or you just have little ability for reading comprehension. I don&#39;t deny the age of consent in AL. I know Roy Moore is denying the allegations of fucking a 14-year-old. And the allegations of forcing the 16-year-old to suck his dick. </p>

<p>The problem for Moore is that there&#39;s plenty of evidence against his denials and that support the accusers. Given the short time line of the election, we have to make due with the evidence available. And it doesn&#39;t look good for Moore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Real evidence?  Yes, there is plenty.   </p>

<p>Let’s take one accuser (probably the most heinous), Leigh Corfman.   Corfman claims she first met Roy Moore in 1979 in Etowah County courthouse.  Corfman has a witness, her mother, as well as public records documenting Leigh Corfman was in the Etowah County courthouse that day with her mother.  The room that Leigh and her mother went to that day was down the hall from Roy Moore’s Office.  </p>

<p>Moore claims they never met, yet it seems like an improbable coincidence that Leigh’s story was partially corroborated by court documents.  </p>

How hard would it be for him to defend against sexual allegations given that he likes younger women? Do you see where I&#39;m coming from. We NEED evidence of misconduct, we cannot just call him a criminal because he likes 16 year olds.
