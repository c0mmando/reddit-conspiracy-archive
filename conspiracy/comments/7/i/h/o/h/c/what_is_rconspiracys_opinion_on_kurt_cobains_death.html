It was the first to examine the murder angle and has lots of info that isn&#39;t even mentioned in Soaked In Bleach. So many suspicious angles and interesting firsthand testimony.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on where the shell case landed and his huge level of heroin (3x a normal person being able to shoot a gun) and the fake note, suicide seems unlikely.   Probability 70% Courtney hired someone, 20% Some Random Accident (a friend shot him maybe), 10% Suicide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, a good <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> questions cool!  Here&#39;s my take on it from a behavioral analysis perspective and from watching some of the documentary films available on the subject.  Kurt Cobain got put into a very difficult situation.  On the one hand he had the Heroine addiction, and Courtney Love, under the auspices of doing the right thing for their daughter and for Kurt, made a disastrous mistake.  She used visitation with their daughter as a tool to leverage Kurts recovery.  As you know Heroine recovery ranks highly on the scale of difficult things to recover from habitual use.  While Kurt attempted the rehab, the addiction proved too strong, AT THE TIME, succumbing to its power, recognizing the loss of his visitation prospective, probably drove him to it.  However, while I find this the most likely explanation, it remains speculative, and I hesitate to make conclusions without all of the research and evidence presented in a transparent and well-cited format.</p>
