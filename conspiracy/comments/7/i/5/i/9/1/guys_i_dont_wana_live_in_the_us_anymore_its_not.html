       Just completed my American policy course this week. Kinda over it. My family used to be upper middle class but thats growing farther and farther out of reach. Things are not good. Donezo.
      </p>
      <p>
       SO. What nation is the best to live in at the moment? What nation(s) are not involved in all the bullshit we spend all day discussing/watching Facebook videos about?
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, what nations are watching us, uninvolved, and laughing in our faces that we let things get this bad?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: To clarify, this was half dramatic/supposed to be half a joke... Unfortunately, I know I won't ever be leaving America. Still curious about alternatives though!

       It could be risky leaving the United States with that 2001 AUMF that permits bombing anywhere in the world. You're just gonna have to stay here and fight like the rest of us! As Lee Camp always says, "Keep Fighting!" :)

       my guess/speculation, germany like france are power kegs ready to explode from the refugee influx.  id wait a few years to see how things settle before deciding on there.

      <p>
       IMO the usa's future will depend on IF trump has a second term,  if he does, then you gotta worry about the 8th year in office.  That is when the most devastating shit goes down, but we as citizens dont feel the after effects till a few years later.  If anything the united states has 10 years left to make a decision.

       Well obviously the US isnt a safe place to live bc of the civil war. Same with Spain and Italy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also dont forget that the UK isnt safe too. Vikings are rading their shore every day atm. Neither is Norway. They got conquered 80 years ago so obviously they arent safe to live there.

       I'll put a good word in for Japan. Getting along fine here. The xenophobia is real but it's not like American, in your face, slash your tires, burn your house down type racism. They just make noise complaints and you have to do more paperwork than everyone else. Can't speak for the longevity of teaching English being valuable, but I'm certainly living comfortably and happily while surveying next steps.

       Yeah South America seems the place to be in certain respects. In case of Nuclear war, even a limited exchange between India and Pakistan for example, would wreck the Northern Hemisphere. The Southern Hemisphere has a nearly separate wind pattern and should do wonders keeping the global winter isolated to the northern hemisphere. The problem I see with most South American countries is fairly heavy corruption, usually but not always sponsored by US. But Uruguay seems ok-ish.

       It is very hard to emigrate as a working person. Anywhere. Generally you would need to have a skill that is in shortage in the target country. Emigration always requires some kind of visa from the target country.
      </p>
      <p>
       In general, there are some kinds of visas which are common to most countries and allow you to live there: Permanent residency visas, temporary residence visas, investors visas, and work visas. Work visas are usually very hard to acquire and usually the applicant needs a sponsoring employer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people think that marrying a foreigner and moving abroad that way is an easy route. Often it isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Residency visas, and particularly work visas, undergo constantly changing requirements almost everywhere. For example, we loosely intended to move to Ecuador and visited twice in 5 years time. During those 5 years the government changed the visa regulations every.single.year until this year when they overhauled their visa laws completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do some research on what places might interest you, you can find visa information on their embassy websites. Good luck.

       Huh? I've been living in Costa Rica for nearly 4 years on a tourist visa. Every 90 days I have to do a "visa run" to Nicaragua - I literally step out, step back in, and I'm good for another 90 days. There are thousands of ex-pats who do the same.

       This is normal here. There are people who have been doing it for &gt;10 years. There are "visa run" shuttle buses for $20. I own a house here, btw, so it's not like I'm living in a tent.

       You can get permanent residency if you like but many, like me, don't see the point.

      <p>
       I'm honestly confused. Maybe nobody told you?

       To OP's point: It's EASY to leave the US. Buy a ticket to [wherever] and go! Easier if you have a little money stored away, for sure, but it can be done on a shoestring. Hourly wages are crap here, so I suggest starting a business -- I've several friends here that are making and distributing food products, from hot sauce to kombucha.

       I've seen every kind of visa/border problem imaginable. I've seen people thrown out of countries, jailed in airports, commandeered in hospitals, ripped off, extorted, defrauded and mugged by the bureaucracy in multiple countries for not having the proper documents.

       What are you talking about?? No laws are being evaded, it's all totally legal, I've never even heard of somebody being locked up. Some people even get slack and just don't do the border runs - not recommended, but some people do.

       I normally avoid comment spats on reddit like the plague, but the disinformation you're propagating deserves to be addressed.

      <p>
       Sure, you can stay in Costa Rica for 90 days and it's legal. You cross the border into Nicaragua and then go back. Lather rinse and repeat, every 90 days. That's some fun right there making border runs every three months until . . . they change the visa laws (it happens!).
      </p>
      <p>
       WTF am I on about?? I already told you. Because every country
       <sup>
        TM
       </sup>
       is not Costa Rica, and serious bad shit goes down all the time with foreigners whose documents are not in order, I think I lined that out for you? Those are people I_have_known. It happened to them.

       Fear! Fear! Fear! Come on man. Not buyin the act. Life is fantastic outside the US. And generally way cheaper. I'm paying $450/month for a little house on the beach in paradise. I could easily cut that in half in Nicaragua or Thailand. I'm kicking myself for not doing it 10 years ago.

       And the freedom compared to the US? Priceless.

       Groceries are also super fuckin expensive, half the year is so dark outside it will make most people depressed, ummm there are a lot of perks too. Just be aware that it is a pretty expensive place to live and most foreigners can't handle the weather.

       Not disagreeing with the prettines here. 
However, those 0,6% (please keep in mind that ca 50% of the population lives within an hour distance of the protests) didn't accomplish anything at all in the long run. The same people are running things as before.

       Also worth noting that Reykjavìk has become one of the most expensive cities in Europe, if not the most expensive, while local income has basically stayed the same.

       I always thought Finland would be a good choice based on their political history, not to mention how beautiful! Also, lots of trees and fresh water. Don't quote, everything I know is a lie.

       Coming from deep South US I don't see an issue haha. Though I do hear they're huge in Alaska and I can speculate that may be similar for Finland.

       At least they'd be easier to spot and kill instead of hearing them buzz right in your ear as soon as you're drifting off to sleep, as you slap around blindly until it stops. Then you start to drift off, only to hear that high pitched craziness again and you end up smacking yourself in the head, and you STILL don't get them. Now you're wide awake, pissed, and on a mission to find and kill the source of the problem. You get up, turn on all the lights, and spend the next few hours searching high and low, shaking out clothes and curtains, shining flashlights in all the corners, before finally giving up, completely exhausted. You climb into bed once again with only three hours to sleep before your alarm goes off, and as you drift off to sleep, suddenly there's a high pitched buzzing sound in your ear.

       Hong Kong. Corp and individual tax is low. Renting is expensive and you should consider buying since the main industry is property so it is a good investment. Mostly conservative, a little boring but very safe and free. The locals seem rude but actually overall nice once you get to know them. People mostly leave you alone if that is what you want. You may think it is one big city but village life can be quiet. The color of the sea is lovely here.

       The sooner all the good people of this country embrace, accept and take that reality very seriously is when change will begin.

       The NWO is everywhere, and there is no escape. This entire world is corrupted and deteriorating rapidly. Our bodies are also frail, and our lifespans are short like flowers in the grass, but our souls are eternal, and we can spend eternity in Heaven with God, our creator, through faith in his only begotten son, Jesus Christ, who gave his life for our sins on the cross, was buried three days and then resurrected in glory.

       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

       Possibly consider finding something meaningful in your life and doing things in your spare time that you enjoy. Don't read the news everyday. Get out into nature. Go for walks. Learn a new language. Do things that make you realise we are all only hear for a few short decades then we die. Enjoy your time here buddy. Don't try to solve all the world problems. Choose the small things that matter to you and fix them

       People who are serious are in for a letdown.  It isn't exactly easy to leave your birth country unless you are: either rich, have a highly skilled background, or you marry someone from the country you want to be in.  There are ways, but none of them are easy.  Good luck.

       Not super into Trudeau either. Made me rethink my whole approach towards politics so I guess I owe him that. I no longer associate myself with a political party. I'll vote for an individual if I think he/she seems like a valuable leader, regardless of party affiliations.

       I dont think its gonna matter where you live. The world isnt really divided by imaginary country lines in the big scheme of things. Its not run by governments. Its run by money. So unless you wanna live in a rain forest in brazil and eat tribal food your entire life youre pretty much fucked. Unfortunately the best places to live also come with the most baggage.

       About the Netherlands... I live in a small village in the northwest. And idk but slowly things are changing. Crime rates are very high. We have a lot of eastern european workers who live here and they act like pikeys. We have travelers as well and ofcourse the other immigrants. Our police/ marines etc are without forces and money.
Our government is a joke for a really long time now. Our mentality is changing. Everybody is whining. It just sucks. 
And we have a lot of elite shit ( royals, shell, bankers) School system fails ( I put my daughter on a waldorfschool and that’s great, but also in the grope of our government)

       i feel you, getting fed up with corruption and whatnot. But when it comes to our freedoms/quality of life, we have it pretty good here in the US. if i ever got tired of it all, id just move to a very remote location in Nebraska or one of the Dakoda’s or something like that.

       The only place to escape the Rothschild Bank (the modern equivalent of the British East India Company) is to a country as yet not taken over. Ironically, to be recommended it also needs to not have an active war or slow campaign to ruin same, and there is only one country on that list at the movement, Iceland.

       You should leave the US, just so you can see how lucky you are to live here. As someone who lived abroad in a handful of countries for years, I have to say it is truly something you have to do in order to put life into perspective. There is a reason why so many try to immigrate to the United States. It's not because life is perfect here, but because it is in your hands to live a good life. In many countries, there are very few options. And you are mistaken if you think any of the issues on r/conspiracy are localized only here in America.

       America is a pretty big place. My vote would be off-the-grid somewhere in remote America. Respects to the other countries listed. However if you're born there, it's easiest to just stay there and try to filter out the BS by turning it off and concentrating on what's important for the family. Central Idaho seems nice.... if you're ok with prevailing winds from the volcanoes in Washington state.. (nothing is perfect)

       Bolivia. The whole world is bad.. What you have to look at, is a country's relationship to the UN, European Union, Bank for International Settlements, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, ect... The less relation to those entities, the better. There are very, very few places on Earth that are remotely removed from all that. China and Russia may be opposed to those entities but come on.. Those places are not free. This is an article explaining why Bolivia is the best:

       When I got home I saw that it would be easier to course correct what we have here than to be a carpetbagger bringing "enlightened change" to literally anywhere else. They don't want to hear it, especially from an American.
      </p>
      <p>
       My advice?  Visit as many places as you can.  Come back and see if you still feel the same way.

       America is still made up of primarily good wholesome people who only want what's best for themselves and their own. Just relax and stop buying into the fear mongering. I would argue that America is in just as good a place as it has been at pretty much any other time in history.

       Leaving isn't the answer. Completely being independent is. We have to not use their oil, electric, gas, utility water, money, etc. Once you strip away those chains from of us all. The elite I'll have no control, but as long as you use the oil, etc. You will always be there slaves.

       Turn off the news, the internet, social media, etc. and commune with yourself for awhile in your local environment. See if you think differently about moving somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wherever I go, there I am. Can't escape myself. How I experience the world is due to the beliefs I hold about it. But if I sit quietly in a park, and observe people just walking, dogs moving about and playing, ants doing their business, and immerse myself in the amazing reality of what is here and now, as it is, there is a serenity. All the problems of the world only exist when my thinking and beliefs about them return, and the loops start playing in my head. If I run, I'll find the same problems where I go. Because my beliefs go with me.

       The easiest, least stressful, and most likely move to succeed in terms of being readily accepted, finding a new job, and comfortably settling in for any Americans that are just plain old fed-up and tired of being Americans, would be right across the northern border in Canada which is second only to Switzerland in terms of being one of the very best countries to both live and work in, while the US is ranked 7th behind the UK, Germany, Japan, and Sweden, in that order.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard to actually pinpoint the differences that account for that beyond saying that Canada actually is far more like what most Americans would really like their own country to be in great many ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not without the problems that exist in any modern country they're just a whole lot less extreme and far smaller both in numbers and in scale on a per capita basis when compared to the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rich aren't quite as rich, extravagant, or arrogant and the poor aren't quite so poor, desperate or downtrodden and there is far less crime in any Canadian town or city compared to any American ones of a similar size and population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Canadians also don't take themselves or their politicians as seriously as Americans do, although they are very much aware and sympathetic about why that happens to be the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want a fuller run-down on some slightly more civilized places to possibly escape to and the various benefits that make them more civil and civilized this is a good place that sizes them all up on a wide range of features...
