        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From 2015-2016, fentanyl overdoses increased by 5 times. Fentanyl has existed since the 1960s and dealers and cartels have used it to cut heroin for a long time before 2015. About 80% of the non-pharmaceutical fentanyl in the U.S. comes from the Sinaloa cartel. It came out in 2012 that the DEA had a deal with the Sinaloas, to not prosecute and basically allow them to operate and sell to the US freely in exchange for information. There&#39;s no reason to think that the U.S. quit working with them. In response to the overdose epidemic, the government made it harder for doctors to prescribe pain pills, driving up the street value of pain pills and causing people addicted to pain pills to turn to heroin.
It&#39;s highly suspicious that as soon as marijuana started becoming legal in more states and people became more critical of the War On Drugs, all of a sudden our pet cartel started pushing Fentanyl. If heroin addicts are dying left and right, then it&#39;s much easier to propagandize about drugs and there&#39;s more justification for the drug war. Killing off &quot;undesirables&quot; is a bonus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe you&#39;re incorrect. I&#39;ve been an avid follower of the &quot;research chemicals&quot; scene for, at least, 18 years. At first it was novel psychedelics and stimulants. As of right now you can order a gram of fentanyl, pretty much legally, from a Chinese laboratory on the clearnet. </p>

<p>A kilo of heroin is 50k wholesale. You get your gram of a fentanyl analogue that&#39;s a thousand times as potent as morphine and mix it with 999 grams of inositol. You now have a kilo of &quot;China White&quot;- your cost is a couple hundred bucks and you can make a literal killing. </p>

<p>The profit potential is just too great for people not to take advantage of. Unfortunately, without high end lab gear you can&#39;t evenly mix the gram of fentanyl and there are bound to be hot spots and fatalities. </p>

<p>I had close friends who were heroin addicts about twelve years ago. One died. None came into contact with fentanyl, which was unheard of except that the Russians used it to incapacitate a crowd of hostages. </p>

<p>Can you talk more about this process? What makes it so difficult? Can it be avoided if the Fentanyl is weighed out dose by dose and pressed pills are made individually?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a pharmacueticals professional but big pharma companies can weigh things out to the microgram- which they do for fentanyl. Also if you eat a quarter bar of xanax you&#39;ll get .5mg, as the distribution is even. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A microgram scale isn&#39;t actually a &quot;high end pro&quot; piece of gear - in fact you can make one yourself. To weigh out each dose of Fent and make it pill press by pill press is possible, but logistically a nightmare (thousands of pills, dying from inhaling the substance, etc.)</p>

<p>I wonder what equipment is actually necessary to make an even blend of inositol and fentanyl, I really doubt it would be thousands of dollars and an institution. Probably more like hundreds and a chemistry degree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s obvious. I saw refurbished microgram scales on sale for like 10k. Erowid says you can make your own, but you&#39;re literally playing with life and death. I think the only safe way to dilute fentanyl for dosing would be liquid volumetric dosing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and with liquid volumetric dosing it would be simple to make accurately-dosed pressed pills. Take the dissolved solution (let&#39;s say at a concentration of 20ug/mL in water), mix the fentanyl/water solution with a pressed pill filler, evaporate the water, press the pill. This takes time and effort and isn&#39;t feasible for a drug dealer&#39;s operations, but is simple and effective. So I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s an issue that it&#39;s hard to do, I think it&#39;s an issue that drug traffickers don&#39;t care enough about the tens of thousands of OD deaths every year to go through the effort of making quality replicas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In theory. But the margin of error is so small and fatal, that I, personally, wouldn&#39;t fuck with it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure the guy who sold Prince the pressed vicodin pills with fentanyl in them was confident they wouldn&#39;t kill him. they did tho.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The person who sold the pressed vicodin to Prince was most assuredly not the same person who manufactured those pills. Chances are they changed hands several times before reaching the end consumer. Any level of trust or confidence in the product coming from the last in the trafficking line should always be taken with less than a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Where is the margin of error introduced in the recipe I suggested? I mean, thinking about it, if you&#39;re putting 20ug/mL, and putting just 1mL of the solution per pressed replica, even if your solution is off by a factor of 100%, one replica will still only have 40ug fentanyl in them, which is far from an overdose. The only serious error is if the end user consumes many pills at once, AND the solution is off by such a significant factor.</p>
