       It's come to my attention that many in this sub seem to think certain groups(Muslims/Blacks) are genetically inferior to the rest of the world. It's my personal belief that circumstances play a much bigger role in determining behaviors than predisposition. While the disparity in crime rates between blacks/whites in America are often cited as an argument for the former, as I've stated, I believe these numbers can be attributed to socio-economic factors and most importantly, an unaddressed case of intergenerational Trauma.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are to be intellectually honest, we must take into account that blacks have consistently been deprived, whether wittingly or unwittingly, of the necessary resources(education, opportunities) to thrive in our society without turning to a life of crime. Contrary to the belief that blacks are genetically predisposed to be more violent or mischievous, I believe there is sufficient data out there or at the least, enough so that a strong case can be made that these are cases of nurture rather than nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I will touch on intergenerational trauma and how it relates to blacks and their behaviors. Studies have consistently shown that an individual's experience can be encoded in their genes and be passed on to their progeny for multiple generations. This is verified in a  relatively new field called Epigenetics. Those who disagree with my aforementioned argument will often roll their eyes at the mention of slavery and the consequent oppression of blacks in American society(extending to the modern day IMO) but it is disingenuous to minimize the impact that such traumatic experiences can have on the collective psyche of any group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as we look empathetically for a psychological explanation when children exhibit behavioral problems at school, often wondering if they are not the victim of some form of abuse, we must apply the same logic when analyzing the high crime rates of blacks. Just as a troubled child ought to sit down with a therapist and given the opportunity to address and heal whatever trauma he may have experienced, the same must be applied to a population has been sitting in a daze after having been subjugated to a series of the most insidious, soul-crushing events.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I am not advocating for is the enabling of the troubled behaviors of blacks. I hope I can be clear about this. What I am arguing is that it is intellectually dishonest to ignore the aforementioned factors and jump to the conclusion that these behaviors must be evidence for genetic inferiority.

       Generally speaking, not a fan of “Let’s talk about [X]” posts but yours seems well composed. I’m more in the mood to read about conspiracy right now than social justice, unless it’s the argument that social justice is a conspiracy imposed on people or conversely trying to get people jaded on it or aliens invented social justice and brought it to Reddit via Ellen Pao.

       I honestly hate lumping all blacks (or any other group) together. I think each person is different. So the nature/nurture percentages would be different for each person.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do know (from having a son with autism) that the first 5 years are extremely important to a person's development. So nurture does play a big part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, nature plays a significant part too.

       I can some it up as follows, but, it's "controversial"... Can we admit there are certain breeds of dogs that are naturally dumber than others and vice versa? Can we admit that certain breeds of dogs are lazier than others and vice versa? Can we admit that when certain dogs inter-breed, a mix happens? Humans really are no different on this level.

       But how do you explain blacks who have been historically very advanced like Egypt, Ethiopia, the Moors etc?
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole black people are lazy thing IMO came post-slavery and it can be attributed to the intergenerational traumas that I wrote about.  My theory is that blacks have a collective case of PTSD/Depression and laziness is often a symptom(lack of energy/motivation) of these conditions.

       They may have been enslaved to some degree but when is the last time the Asian groups that immigrated to the US experienced something like that? I think the recency is a major factor among many others. Another would be that blacks are living within the same nation that had once enslaved them and that there have been white supremacist campaigns since their emancipation that has aimed to suppress any sort of progress for this group.

       Fair. But also consider that that's very different from chattel slavery where blacks were literally enslaved and dehumanized for generations, any morale they had being beaten out of them. After their emancipation, the oppression continued in other ways, lynchings, systemic racism, mass incarcerations, police brutality, all within the same nation. Not to mention, this is all fairly recent. Also consider that many of Asian immigrants that came to the US were presumably the ones who were a sub group, presumably having had some form of education or closure from the traumas they had experienced.

       This logic doesn't work, since breeds of dogs were created through many generations of inbreeding for select traits. Humans are not this way. We have a very healthy gene pool (in most cases).

       I'm sure there was some incest, and I'm sure a lot of black slaves gave birth to half white babies, so they definitely don't have any of that incestuous master race gene pool. Race doesn't exist because it's just DNA expression to help the human survive certain conditions. Black skin to survive heavily sunny weather, white skin to survive weather with little sunlight. Asians have yellowish skin because they have a thin layer of fat underneath their skin for whatever that was necessary for. It's just an outer expression of traits that were selected over hundreds of generations to survive to procreate. There is no master race, or intelligently superior race. There might be cultures that cultivate higher levels of thinking and expression of ideas, etc. But there's no innate stupidity.

       Dogs were bred deliberately, forcibly, by humans. Outside forces. The traits desired were being bred for human-centric needs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans choose mates for purely evolutionarily proscribed reasons. Fitness. Health. Attractiveness. There has never been a forcible breeding program that was engaged for enough generations within a set population to be evolutionarily significant, and even in cases where humans were being bred by slavemasters desiring certain traits, those traits were never “fits in purse” and “has certain hair color”. It was always pragmatic traits desired.

       Got any hard evidence for this? I've never felt that way. Kind of sounds like you embrace the mentality that you are superior, in some way...

       Nice ninja edit on your last reply by the way. What I need to tell myself is irrelevant. What is relevant is that there are people with educations that determine these things and they are almost unanimously in agreement that you're wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       99% of Muslims are born into Islam as a result of their geographic location and of no choice of their own. Of course an Asian person from China can convert to Islam. But when you look at the middle east for example, you have a race of Muslims, and countries that have laws suited to Islam. They are a muslim race and they have nationalities according to their countries. Some are also of the Arab race, or Persian race, or they are caucasian. Some might say their race is middle eastern. Just because you haven't been educated enough, that doesn't change scientific and historical consensus.

       I agree. The victim mindset is often the most convenient defense mechanism for actual victims - as it is much more comforting to wallow in self-pity than to conjure up the courage to face your fears and overcome them.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, sometimes the trauma is so severe(as I believe is in the case of blacks and slavery) that there is a certain amount of time and empathy that should be allowed for them to dust themselves off and get back up.

       I agree with your points. Although I don't believe it's really a conspiracy, it's more like poverty affecting the outcomes of people's lives. It can also be viewed more locally, I live in Scotland and most areas of the country have certain stereotypes associated with them, i.e. People from X location are uneducated and have 2 or 3 kids by the time they are 19. I feel like racism is just an escalation of these stereotypes, anyone can find out that plenty of people from whatever race or religion have done great things, but before they learn that, it's the initial stereotype that sticks in their minds. I suppose it all boils down to media and history.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as a side note, although I don't think this is a conspiracy, the post itself does no harm, and has good points. I always check the post history of the posters that I read, and I don't think it's right to dismiss someone from posting here, or attempt to redirect or attack a post that I don't agree with. The influx of shills and trolls should not turn us against each other, encourage interesting posts and think for yourself people!

       also cultural deprivation. A lot of indigenous communities in colonized western countries are a mess because their cultures were smashed by the europeans and now they are like troubled orphans but right-wing groups will blame it on genetics. Yeah, the family unit is important to creating healthy people but that extends back for generations.

       When you proclaim "but it is disingenuous to minimize the impact that such traumatic experiences can have on the collective psyche of any group.", that's implying that any collective traumatic experience of a race or ethnic group is devastating to the psyche of that group currently. Even when none of the population has experienced it. It would be to say as if all Europeans or people of European ancestry still can feel the experiences of Muslims that invaded Europe and took millions of Europeans as slaves, and that its ingraved into their genetics when most Europeans have never heard of these Muslim conquests. But onto some of your other points, I don't think any other races are inferior, but I do think particularly Sub-Saharan Africans, Peloponnesian groups and Caucasus Region peoples as well as other minor Afroeurasian regions and ethnic groups have inferior cultures and how people are raised. So I do think it is technically circumstancial, but the thing that makes them underperform in tests and such. You can't say cultures that are often rampant in things like cannibalism or ritualistic sacrifice is not an inferior culture. So I don't think its a race that makes certain people inferior to westerners. But very interesting viewpoint, you sound just like my sociology professor.

       I think time is also a factor. It hasn't been very long since the days of slavery and Jim Crowe. Also this group is much smaller and concentrated than "all Europeans."

       This is actually the first racist post or discussion I have seen on Reddit, pertaining to skin colour.
      </p>
      <p>
       From your post body, these two statements oppose each other greatly.
      </p>
      <p>
       [Contrary to the belief that blacks are genetically predisposed to be more violent or mischievous, I believe there is sufficient data out there or at the least, enough so that a strong case can be made this is a case of nurture rather than nature.]
      </p>
      <p>
       [Lastly, I will touch on intergenerational trauma and how it relates to blacks and their behaviors. 
Studies have consistently shown that an individual's experience can be encoded in their genes and be passed on to their progeny for multiple generations. This is verified in a relatively new field called Epigenetics.]
      </p>
      <p>
       Both statements are insidious.

       Democrats. It's easier for Dems to control Blacks voting habits when they give them free food and housing. No one votes against the hand that feeds them. Dems also want to hide the fact that they were the slaveholders and the creators of the KKK.

       I don't disagree with most of what you said. There is clearly a force out there that benefits from the enabling of blacks to not experience any sort of social growth. With that said, my post wasn't about blaming whites. It was to address the imo, false belief that blacks are in the predicament they are in as a result of inferior genes.

       There is a difference between empowering and enabling. The left often enables the shit out of them. They also aim to weaponize black indignation and turn it against the republicans. The right, discounting the white supremacists, do aim to empower but are often lacking in empathy. As in they fail to see just how deleterious the effects of slavery/post-slavery(Jim Crow, Police brutality, mass incarceration) was and is on the black's collective psyche. They are up against a lot and need more than just a "get over it, slavery was over a hundred years ago."

       I don't subscribe to the concept of race, but I do feel that there is merit to the idea of generational trauma being passed down bloodlines, in the same way physical or neurological disorders, traits or other maladies can.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I think it important to ask ourselves if pursuing this discussion is worth the effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       What value would data that was able to prove any sort of significant difference between one ethnicity versus the other actually have for our society? If you could statistically prove that people of primarily middle-eastern descent have a higher IQ than those whose ancestry is primarily native american, what good would that do anyone in a country that isn't ethnically segregated? Likewise, would this data be considered when it came to criminal sentencing? I'd hope not, because if we are willing to be lenient on people based on "race" people will start using that same argument to promote segregation and discrimination.

       I agree that epigenetics can be used for some nefarious agenda to classify one group as superior to another.
      </p>
      <p>
       But intergenerational trauma is used more as a healing tool, to address on a clinical level what a certain group may be going through and why.

       Again, the concept of intergenerational trauma as an explanation for behavior is intriguing, but I must question the pursuit itself. This would be a Pandora's Box scenario, where once something is established, putting it back in the box impossible. It wouldn't matter what positive intentions you may have had; supremacists of all kinds would pour out of the woodwork to claim their ethnic superiority, or how the data was flawed, or misrepresented the truth, etc. It would only further divide us, I'm afraid.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are already happy to make generalizations about ethnicities outside without needing scientific consensus. I don't want to imagine what people would try to do
       <em>
        with
       </em>
       it.

       I can some it up as follows, but, it's "controversial"... Can we admit there are certain breeds of dogs that are naturally dumber than others and vice versa? Can we admit that certain breeds of dogs are lazier than others and vice versa? Can we admit that when certain dogs inter-breed, a mix happens? Humans really are no different on this level.
