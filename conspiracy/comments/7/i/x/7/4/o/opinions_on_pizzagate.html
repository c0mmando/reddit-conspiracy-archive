    <div class="md"><p>You literally have not addressed my points at all. I&#39;m not jumping to any conclusions. Just pointing out your user name is the same name as Alefantis&#39; boyfriend who literally runs the business used to shape public opinion online. Everything I just said is verifiable and the organization even describes itself as such. Look up Correct the Record.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t watch the Ben Swan report, you&#39;re just living in ignorance. </p>

<p>The pizza shop was never the center of attention. The blatant use of CP symbolism, and blatant imagery on their instagram pages started the investigation. It&#39;s undeniable evidence. </p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing you haven&#39;t cared to look or investigate.</p>

<p>Ben Swan starts  his report by saying Comet Pizza wasn&#39;t the originally focus. It started with Podesta emails, which lead to Besta Pizza using a CP symbol in their logo, which they then changed. Besta Pizza still has CP symbolism up on google maps. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of it was overly speculative BS and overinterpreting innocuous emails, but that the overall concept of investigating elite-sponsored human trafficking brushed close enough to some disturbing truths that it triggered intense backlash. </p>

<p>The efforts that went into shutting Pizzagate down far exceeded what could credibly have occurred if it was all nonsense. Nonsense generally falls apart on its own, or at least fails to gain significant traction -- it doesn&#39;t need to be purged with such aggressive shaming and misrepresentation. Its strongest arguments can be debunked -- you don&#39;t need to cherrypick the most absurd ones and ignore the rest. </p>

<p>I think there was a deliberate effort to play up the silliest aspects of Pizzagate and then discredit them to keep the more solid elements of the investigation from gaining traction with the public -- like connections with convicted pedophile sex offender billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/01/27/haiti.earthquake.orphans/index.html">child trafficking in Haiti.</a></p>

<p>Excellent start</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Then it went downhill.</p>

<p>For those with eyes to see, ask yourself this: how does it help anybody to spend their spare time thinking about child abuse? </p>

<p>Take a deep breath, calm down, and ask yourself honestly: how does it help you to &#39;research pizzagate&#39;? You are spending your finite time thinking about a pretty horrible concept. And no, it doesn&#39;t &#39;bring anybody to justice&#39;, or any crap like that.</p>

<p>Those with eyes to see will notice where I am going with this. &#39;Pizzagate&#39; = mind poison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does is accomplish, exactly, to actively, aggressively discourage people from scrutinizing the elite and looking out for evidence of child trafficking to expose it? Child trafficking is a tragic reality -- that much is simple fact. Loads of people have been &quot;brought to justice&quot; for it, at times exposing the complicity of very powerful people. Take, for example, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/05/dutroux.featuresreview">Belgium&#39;s &quot;Dutroux affair&quot;</a>. Given the stakes, I think it&#39;s exactly the sort of thing we should be especially <em>vigilant</em> about -- not especially eager to sweep under the rug. I&#39;m automatically suspicious of anybody asserting it isn&#39;t something worth even <em>investigating</em> child trafficking when red flags appear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t underestimate the power of sharing information. Posting online solves nothing on its own, but it is a powerful means of communication and organization. In the case of the Dutroux affair, the whole story probably would have been successfully buried if not for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_March">White March</a>, where 300,000 Belgians took to the streets of Brussels in protest of their complicit justice system. </p>

<p>Or, for a more recent and more American example, take the #MeToo movement that spread across social media like wildfire and has led to the outing and censure of an ever-expanding list of powerful sex criminals, including pedophiles.</p>

<p>Although I think Pizzagaters missed the mark a few times (dominoes probably really meant dominoes, walnut sauce probably really meant walnut sauce, etc.), I think it&#39;s extremely worrying the way the conversation was shifted away from scrutinizing the powerful to ensure protection of the powerless from exploitation, and toward protecting the reputations of the powerful from any suspicion whatsoever, discouraging investigation of legitimate red flags (like Bill Clinton riding on Epstein&#39;s &quot;Lolita Express&quot; something like 26 times). Whether any given person was guilty or not, discouraging investigation of suspicious red flags is exactly how you protect the guilty from exposure. I&#39;d rather <em>investigate and exonerate</em> than simply trust the powerful not to exploit the powerless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most worrying part is how easy it&#39;s been for the <em>debunked</em> narrative to become an acceptable claim when journalists reference the story. Either journalists are obscenely lazy, or infinitely stupid/ignorant. </p>

<p>This early news presentation (Ben Swann) remains one of the best, sadly. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBSvUlkB61s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBSvUlkB61s</a></p>

<p>Subject deserves more resourceful investigators, and infiltration tactics for seeing the network from inside.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the fact that the vast majority of Pizzagaters don&#39;t give a shit about the VICTIMS who have come out and told their stories about Roy Moore while going on and on about the evidence and &#39;proof&#39; of the Podesta&#39;s art collection and bands playing at Comet Pizza and stupid jokes about dominos and gifts in emails says all you need to know about what Pizzagate is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You literally have not addressed my points at all. I&#39;m not jumping to any conclusions. Just pointing out your user name is the same name as Alefantis&#39; boyfriend who literally runs the business used to shape public opinion online. Everything I just said is verifiable and the organization even describes itself as such. Look up Correct the Record.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t watch the Ben Swan report, you&#39;re just living in ignorance. </p>

<p>The pizza shop was never the center of attention. The blatant use of CP symbolism, and blatant imagery on their instagram pages started the investigation. It&#39;s undeniable evidence. </p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing you haven&#39;t cared to look or investigate.</p>
