       The best I can pin it on is since these "smart" phones. They didn't used to be this "blah", before them. They seem like they're addicts who have to click it every spare moment they have. If they have to interact with somebody they try to avoid it by clicking the phone instead. They all do this too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if it's the phones, or the inflation and escalating house prices. Maybe they're discouraged because they can't save any money, it all goes to bills.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about the rare person who tries to have children. A lot of people I knew when growing up, you look at their kids, something odd with them. The girl could have been hot but even if she shagged a hot guy, the kids can be wonky or something. Is that this autism? This isn't an isolated incident either. Not too many people are making cute kids these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not much baby booming going on with generations since those days. What's their grand kids house prices going to be like. No way can they pay it off. It's like all the working goes to bills, vehicles, and there's no hope. Plus it's getting worse as time goes on. It's not getting any better and countries are not paying down debts. Your money buys less. Less job opportunities out there as time goes on. That won't be good for people's children. All of it seems rather bleak.
      </p>
      <p>
       These observations about how people seem blah in the workplace isn't just one isolated workplace. I've changed a few times in recent years and would also go into all kinds of workplaces when working for a temporary employment agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everybody seems kind of "blah" in recent years. Take a look at the look on their faces.. They aren't smiling and happy, most of them, most of the time. They seem like they're at a funeral all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you drive around, in rush hour, the road rage is pretty bad. Totally no patience.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best I can pin it on, is it seems to have got worse since those smart phones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before that, their moods seemed to decline since the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the internet, they weren't this blah. Might be accumulated sleep deprivation from all the things you can do after work nowadays.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of how many TV stations there are. Movies you can watch. Of course, the video games burning people right out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it's because since the internet, they look around and compare themselves to others. Observe that their life sucks and most people are more successful.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the previous decades, they'd maybe glance at it at the supermarket magazine checkout. See the celebs on TV. It wasn't rubbed in their face at how they fail compared to others.
      </p>
      <p>
       In rush hour, look at what kind of vehicle you have compared to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look around on facebook, a lot of people don't even bother logging in because and haven't been on in seasons. Lots of most recent photos are from years ago when they first go on there. If you log in, you feel like you're inadequate. It also shows others you're not doing well. What have you got to post photos of, you losing, going nowhere. So they just don't even log in and have to deal with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people I knew, they aren't around. But if you just browse friends of friends profiles of people you don't know, or anybody random, most people aren't on facebook recently any more.
      </p>
      <p>
       They feel like they aren't as good a provider as others, when they look around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have the online dating thing. If you're a guy, why would a woman choose you, so easy to find a better man.
      </p>
      <p>
       The women seem to never get off these dating systems, it's like they're perpetually trying to find a better man. Seems like both parties aren't doing well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know.. look around at work, observe the look on their faces.. it's seriously like they're all at a funeral. How about in rush hour, or people walking on the sidewalks.. they all look like they're at a funeral. Wasn't this bad in the 70's, 80's and 90's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the phones, what they do is keep clicking it and staring into that so they aren't reminded of their go-nowhere lives that have no hope. The phones get their mind off their bleak reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's causing this general depressed look on people's faces.. I think it's all these factors. Then you have who knows what kind of chemicals being put in the food ingredients. If you try to eat well with non GMO or organic, the cost goes way up and produce isn't as fresh.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're burned right out with not enough sleep so they drink more coffee. Anything that makes them feel better about themselves, like bad habits, they do more. The eating things that taste good even though they may gain weight. We know the public isn't doing too well with obesity in recent years.. I think that's at an all time high. Then once they're fat they go, screw it and eat as much as they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       The smoking seems to be down. Not sure about alcohol, I betcha that's down a bit. The pot smoking is up though. A lot of people seem to think that's a "good" thing but any smoking probably isn't healthy on your lungs.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is increasing is them taking pills. I used to work at a pharmaceutical warehouse for a decade. Where all the pharmacies in the city would get their prescriptions from. That's an industry which isn't declining. haha. Meanwhile, I notice no pharma company ever comes out with a cure. Did you notice that? haha. People like to go to a doctor and say, I'm depressed and they'll get anti-depressants. Those get handed out like candy. Meanwhile, look at all the negative side-effects, making you take other kinds of pills for those problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about that epidemic out there with who knows what kind of drugs the kids are on these days. The fentanyl and the even more deadly carfentanil. Where the hell are all these people getting this from? A doctor will only prescribe what one person needs. So this widespread usage you keep hearing about in the google news health section all the time.. it isn't some person who got it prescribed that is selling extras. You gotta wonder if it's the damn, who knows who, that is getting those drugs out to the public. You may have heard stories of how who knows what government agency was behind the illegal drug trade in previous decades.. well I'd have to wonder if all this Fentanyl you keep hearing about, how is that getting supplied to all these people.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about ecstasy and meth. Or, the good old crack. How about them bath salts. Can't forget about the heroin there. The good old war on drugs doesn't seem to be working too good. What ya gotta do with drugs, is like when a kid tries to smoke. You put 'em in the closet with a box of cigars. You want drugs, and kill yourself, supply them with as much as they want. So many vacant buildings with for lease signs downtown, I'm sure you can use some of those places to keep them off the streets. But naw, they'd rather do nothing about it and leave them stand on boulevards with signs. This is where they wind up when they get hooked on the drugs. A lot of them might have been normal before that. It all starts when they can't find a job. Do the drugs to feel better. Get hooked on the hard drugs. That's when they go down the hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       The women, I've known some when I used to work jobs doing the newspaper going around town. Hanging out in front of 7/11's. They do the sex trade to buy the crack. The government can't figure this mentality out. Outlaw the sex trade too. Meanwhile, none of it is workin out but this riff-raff is out on the streets that you have to deal with. It's all because of the drugs, which they do to feel better about their crappy lives. Look at how much the government spends on wars but won't spend a nickel on these homeless people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something's wrong out there with society. The government who's supposed to fix this mess doesn't and spends it on other stupid things. Meanwhile, the streets, overpasses, sewers, water pipes are crumbling. But, we'll spend trillions on wars. Any money they get from taxes, isn't enough. House prices keep going up and they control the laws but do nothing to stop this problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       You get these normal people you have to work with, who have to deal with this riff-raff when they go around outdoors. How about that crime rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this, adds up to why the look on your co-workers face is the same as people at a funeral. It's not good out there these days and probably only going to get worse.

       I feel confident that the post 2008 period will be characterized as a massive global depression in decades to come. Crafty PR and electronic benefits cards have covered up the breadlines and global cheap crap keeps people alive and out of rags, credit cards are a non-sustainable life line for many.  The solution (low interest rates) is not working for the affected, but enriching the owner class beyond wildest dreams. ZIRP is the conspiracy at work here.

       I don't feel we've ever recovered from 2008 and I don't think we ever will.

       If you aren't a doctor, engineer, boss or something in similar nature, you are gonna be in for a struggle for life. It's sad things are that way. In my opinion, even in Pittsburgh, you need at least $55k a year just to live a single life with some comfort. I don't see this changing and I only see it getting worse.

       I forgot to say a few months ago he rearended someone in a company vehicle which was totaled. He said he looked down at his GPS and didn't see the car stopped. 75 mph. No doubt in my mind he was reading Facebook while driving.

       In some unimaginable world where wise people govern, one might use the ancient origin and look to government for guidance. This clearly is not possible in the world today.

       When I was a kid growing up in the country outside the city, there was only a few TV stations. No internet. People used to seem to be more friendly with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where's does it go forward from here. The virtual goggles. Eventually the robots will be doing more jobs. We're already getting into the self driving cars and semi trucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if later there'll be new developments with medial stuff where they actually cure something for the first time ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all these new technologies, the people seem grumpier than before. I think a lot of them being miserable is how they have less sleep than previous decades. Then they wake up, get jacked-up on coffee.

       There's some video floating of a guy recording in a gas station in the 80's and everyone seems opposite of today, smiling and talking, laughing, nowadays people just ignore people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel old talking about tech this way being I'm just in my early 20's, but I do wish I could've experienced the world before the Internet/smartphones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soon as I was old enough to kinda need one (middle school) I've had a cell phone.  I can only imagine the kids growing up now with these devices being with them at birth, how does that wire their brains?

       It kinda stunk before the internet. You watch old TV shows or movies, you see them saying, have to get to a pay phone. Things like the movie with Bruce Willis, Die Hard, was all based on them not being able to phone because the land lines were cut.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any sort of information, how could you research it, was maybe the library. Wouldn't be able to hear about things. Stuff on TV would play once and they put all that work into it. People read magazines. Only way to know what's going on in the world was check the TV news or the newspaper the next day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Music, you'd check the radio or top charts to know what's new. Then go buy that album. Would have 1 hit song on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're trying to create music, only way to get it out there was to send to some record label. If you didn't fit into what they'd want, you wouldn't get signed. What could you send to a radio station, a c cassette. Later when you were able to burn CD's, computers and the internet were out. Sending CD's out only would get some attention in the very early days like the mid to later 90's. After that, everyone was burning them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nowadays if you make music, you can get it out there. Get into making a video too.. it's kinda neat. Don't need the record labels any more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Digital music, nice and clear. I grew up as a teen in the 80's with cassettes and vinyl was getting phased out. CD's didn't get going till the 90's. Tapes sounded muddy. That was the worst. In the early 2000's being able to get any song, later for free on youtube, that was kinda neat. Now they have monetization if you make it, would match 3rd party content if someone steals it and uploads it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in the 80's if you wanted to play around with experimental music, the recording equipment to cut tape was really expensive. Multi-track with analog sucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       They did have the brick cell phones back in the later 80's but was super expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       People weren't as rude though. In recent years with the flood of everything, they just ignore everybody unless they have money to gain from it, then they'll pay attention to you. If you're a celeb too, then they'll suck up to you. Otherwise, you just get ignored. Only way to make it work these days, is to become a celeb and also get big money. So, you can win these days but you have to figure out how to get their attention somehow. Have to think of new ways where they go "wow". They're bored with CGI in movies. Anyways.. I gotta go to the washroom. lol.

       The road rage. I'm glad I got off the road for my job. I was getting a bit flustered at times.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other day I saw it out my window that's beside a store. Was up at 3am, heard honking and shouting. A couple cars had pulled into the lot and one guy was standing by the other vehicle. Hollering, roll down your window. Things escalate fast and next thing you know, somebody winds up dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also this bottled up rage in the workplace.

       Alcohol abuse is definitely on the rise. Take a look at

        this sudy
       </a>
       just published in August. I'm not trying to cherry pick numbers but I'm pulling a few quotes from the article/study as they stand out. There are a lot of numbers in here so I'll let you look at if you want I'm just pointing out some that struck me.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The study tracks alcohol use by Americans since 1992. Here is one that surprised me. In 1992 a little over 40% of the population drank alcohol at any level. Fast forward to 2013 and that number is well over 70%.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>

         Both high-risk drinking and alcohol abuse/dependency (
         <em>
          two separate categories tracked
         </em>
         ) the numbers are getting close to 15% of the population and at this rate, it will probably surpass that. Think about that. That means if you walk into work and there are 100 people in your office about 15 of them are secret (
         <em>
          or maybe not so secret
         </em>
         ) alcoholics.

       People are depressed and alcohol is easy. It makes you forget, it is widely available and for the most part it is socially acceptable. Also, the dates kind of line up very closely to some of your theories. The advent of the Internet in the early 90's, the explosion of a million tv channels, people living in McMansion's they can't afford next to neighbors they never talk to and then smartphones coming along. Stagnant wages, shitty healthcare, massive debt, extreme levels of government corruption. Don't even get me started on how many people are taking a million different pills every day.

       So alcohol use is up, eh. Interesting. I thought it might be down. Would notice hard liquor ads on billboards around here, which they never used to do. I thought that was because numbers were down.

       I was thinking, maybe the kids are smartening up these days and don't drink as much. It is stupid behavior. Hard liquor tastes bad. Beer is less worse when you're drinking it. The hard liquor though, it's almost like poison. Not that much of a buzz and you sure get way more hungover. It's almost not worth it.

       The next day, you're on a downer. You go pick some more up to feel a bit better. It really seems like a bit of a bad drug with not that much of a good buzz. You'd think the kids these days would be into something where you catch more of a buzz and don't have to deal with the nasty hangover. I think that's why they're more into the pot or who knows what else other than booze.

       Interesting statistics ya got though. I noticed you said the word, "high-risk drinking", and was thinking high risk sexual behavior too, with no rubber. They don't care about later. Not worth the bit of it feeling better for a lifetime of an STD. Or how about paying for a kid you aren't prepared for. That doesn't sound worth it for the 15 minutes with no rubber. Forgot to talk about that behavior about the sex in this rambling on earlier. How about the free porn out there. The kids are all perverts these days, probably.
