        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">250</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-12-10 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/LoneStarMike59.html">LoneStarMike59</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are a lot of photos in this post.  If you have Reddit Enhancement Suie, don&#39;t click on the camera icon.  Just click on the blue hyperlink for the full-sized image.</p>

<p>So - Here is something I happened to notice on the <strong><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/las-vegas-route-91-harvest-festival-map.pdf/view">FBI&#39;s website</a></strong> </p>

<p>It&#39;s a map of sections of the Route 91 Harvest Festival Site for use in assisting victims of the October 1, 2017 shooting in Las Vegas in collecting their personal effects.  Look at the map closely.  Does anything in particular jump out at you?  Something that&#39;s never been discussed before? </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://archive.is/jHRn4/5a62beea375f88824a6f4f48881c0e4098c6ba93">Here&#39;s a big hint.</a></strong> </p>

<p>Apparently, there&#39;s an abandoned 33-room motel located within the concert venue.  I haven&#39;t seen The LVMPD, the FBI, or any mainstream media/independent journalists mention this. </p>

<p>The motel was built in 1959 and was called The White Sands Motel.</p>

<p>I had hoped to be able to share a great video in this post.  It was a Google Earth fly-over of the whole area. <strong>using actual satellite images from the day after the shooting.</strong>  Unfortunately, as you can see below, the channel that posted it has been taken down by Youtube. </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogWrp6_Uz84">Link to removed video</a></strong> </p>

<p>I did manage to capture some screen shots before the video was taken down and I archived them.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a screen shot from 0:47 and I went ahead and labeled certain places -  </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://archive.is/QuDYW/fbe1c0d62d8f96a62b590b78c36228fd06ef0385.png">Morning after overview of Las Vegas Village</a></strong></p>

<p>You can tell it&#39;s an actual satellite view from the day after the shooting because if you look at that Lawn Chair Seating Area, you can see all the lawn chairs and personal effects that people left behind as they fled the scene.  (those white specs.)  Also - remember that one police officer transmission that said shots were being fired from Gate 7?  I&#39;ve labeled Exit Gate 7, as well as Exit Gate 6 (where the cameraman of the Rare First Shots video exited the venue) and Exit Gate 5 (where he stopped to call his friends to find out where they were.) </p>

<p>Here&#39;s another screen shot from the same video showing a better view of the Motel.  </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://archive.is/y5xMK/3b2ecb0c31f2547d3ad60653eafdc2b9f996e693.png">3-dimensional view of abandoned motel</a></strong></p>

<p>Here is the only other screen shot I have from the now-deleted video.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://archive.is/DLaeg/1363889d60af6421f87b4901d1da81039cd31e40.png">Zoomed out view of the entire area</a></strong></p>

<p>In this view, you can see the motel, the dirt and paved parking lots on the other side of Giles Street, and the aviation fuel tanks. Notice the building where I&#39;ve drawn the orange line.  That is the business where the B&amp;W security camera parking lot footage that was shown on Tucker Carlson&#39;s show came from.  The person&#39;s channel that got with the business owner to obtain that footage was 5X5 News.  His channel featured the whole hour and a half video - not just the part that was shown on Tucker.  It is this same person who made the flyover video and it&#39;s his channel that has now been deleted.</p>

<p><strong>About the Motel</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://archive.is/R3RKy/e760e451f4605b58a86ca1baf2737a6a69b7fbea.jpg">White Sands Motel Circa 1978</a></strong> </p>

<p>According to the below article from the Las Vegas Sun, the motel closed in 1999. </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://vegasinc.lasvegassun.com/business/real-estate/2016/aug/22/how-much-is-a-dilapidated-strip-motel-worth-owners/">How Much is a Dilapidated Strip Motel Worth?</a></strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The shape of the White Sands property “adds to the complexity” of what could be developed there, Parks said. The rectangular site has little frontage along Las Vegas Boulevard and is surrounded on its other three sides by MGM Resorts International-owned festival grounds. Investors could “maybe” build retail space or try to “squeeze a hotel on there,” Parks said. As he sees it, MGM is the logical buyer but would not pay $25 million. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Las Vegas Sun article also has a slide show with different photographs of the motel.  I don&#39;t think that tall white entrance sign that has &quot;White Sands&quot; in red letters is big enough or wide enough for someone to be able to stand on and shoot from.  But what about the part of the sign that is closer to the ground?  You can see it behind the barbed wired in Image 3 of the slide show.  Not sure if the top part of that lower sign is wide enough for someone to stand on, either.   </p>

<p>When I looked at the address on Google Street view I could see a sign out front that said &quot;Available Parcel&quot; and gave an email address to contact.  The sign also had a rendering of a tall skinny tower as an example of something that could possibly built on the site.  I couldn&#39;t zoom in close enough to get a good picture of the actual tower rendering, but here&#39;s an <strong><a href="https://archive.is/W2ra0/d488cdc4c0b46ebc5ed39d90ba184cee53e0abb2.png">April 2017 Google Street View of the sign.</a></strong>  </p>

<p>Take note of the above photo because I&#39;ll be coming back to it later.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://archive.is/o7avn/a094e402a32a5e9bb0e29e5a1c6b6f8eec2031f9.png">Here&#39;s a photo of the motel at night when it was still in operation.</a></strong>  </p>

<p>Next is a photo taken from the interior driveway looking back towards Las Vegas Blvd.  North wing, check-in area and Excalibur Hotel are visible and labeled.  <strong><a href="https://archive.is/5UPJ5/a8df85f9142813ff4f3d1737f51f38f5834638ba.png">Image</a></strong> </p>

<p>Here&#39;s two views of the former entrance sign side by side.  One is looking towards the Mandalay Bay Hotel to the Southwest and the other is looking towards the Tropicana Hotel (East Tower - closest to Hooters) <strong><a href="https://archive.is/HYskC/8bc9edb3175bb6d589dcf3f1b77dcce66426dafa.png">Image</a></strong> </p>

<p>Also - another view of the pool area looking towards the NE.  MGM Grand, Tropicana East Tower and Hooters all visible as well as the base of the former entrance sign. <strong><a href="https://archive.is/tEvj1/3d07073e87f258b2774d7dd23fd88c89838ced18.png">Image</a></strong> </p>

<p>This <strong><a href="https://archive.is/HF1kt/16f0f8b658c618debd4420a5b7e14b1bacf1be58.png">next photo taken after the shooting</a></strong> shows enough of the motel above those teal seats on risers for you get a general idea of just how high the roof was.  It looks to be higher than those teal seats in front of it, but that may just be due to the angle the photo was taken from.</p>

<p><strong>The Night of the Shooting</strong></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a video I watched several weeks ago.  A woman tells her story about her and her boyfriend&#39;s escape from the venue. She doesn&#39;t have any footage from while the shooting was taking place, but she does have some footage of her and her friend walking around the venue before the shooting started.    </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epolv8a-W3M">HOW WE ESCAPED THE ROUTE 91 HARVEST FESTIVAL SHOOTING IN LAS VEGAS</a></strong></p>

<p>About 20 seconds into the video, her boyfriend has talked her into riding the Sky Flyer Ride that was on the north side of the venue - north of the Motel. I think this was about an hour or so before the shooting.  Here&#39;s a screen shot as they&#39;re starting to rise up into the air and you can see the <strong><a href="https://archive.is/XE0uL/b34e764665266e54ce38fa0e2f87fbb25f18b918.png">White Sands former entrance sign.</a></strong>  </p>

<p>In this second screen shot, they&#39;re starting to go higher up in the air and at one point they&#39;re pretty much directly over the motel.  I had to lighten the photo a bit to get the motel to show up better, but overall, the <strong><a href="https://archive.is/pLkRi/f8ff7d7950cfd334b53bf9423e63250c87527e90.png">place was not lit up very well.</a></strong> </p>

<p>In the third screen shot, the ride is almost over and they&#39;re starting to come 
down. -  <strong><a href="https://archive.is/bozJ2/0b346fd638f79f5b041567f1450eb404ff1b51a9.png">Image</a></strong> </p>

<p>Initially, I had wondered what all those unmarked white cars in front of the fence that separates Las Vegas Blvd. and the sidewalk from the motel on the other side of the fence were.  The cars are all parked backed in - facing out towards Las Vegas Blvd. Later, I was able to determine that they were just <strong><a href="https://archive.is/vc6xp/28d0a9560878cb4e16261969ab9e7abddbc84f26.png">police cars.</a></strong> </p>

<p>I also went back and watched that Raymond Page video.  </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wnn-GvRPh-w">RAW VIDEO: Escape from Las Vegas shooting</a></strong> </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://archive.is/elZHm/24191bd263d670ac8df85e90fee467a2b5168ad7.png">This screen shot is from the very last frame.</a></strong>     You can see one of the white cars in the driveway. In the inset, you can also see the same two signs I posted from Google street view earlier.</p>

<p>I also watched another Raymond Page video where he loaded wounded people into his Clark County truck and drove them to a nearby ambulance near Las Vegas Blvd. &amp; Tropicana Ave.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://archive.is/lVAnt/8c4d3b23f61585e61f542f0ccd8402d35b559899.png">Screen shot 1</a></strong>  </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://archive.is/bLVRN/4c25288c7a28980acd35e7363183a2ab3b2fa239.png">Screen Shot 2</a></strong></p>

<p>What about the roof of the motel?  The area closest to the pool seems to be a little higher than the roof area of the rest of  south wing the building. The check-in office closest to Las Vegas Blvd. seems to be higher than the rest of the roof on the north wing.  Could that roof area have been a possible place for someone to have been able to fire shots in the direction of the Excalibur or the Tropicana, accounting for some of the reports of shootings near other hotels?</p>

<p>Jason Goodman of Crowdsource the Truth did a live stream on 11/11/2017 and he walked right by the motel and even stopped to film an unmarked cop car.  I think 
he was so focused on the car he didn&#39;t even notice the motel.  </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://archive.is/nlCbU/f96a76b9ef8a5437f524bd0b0521abfed2c50128.png">Here&#39;s a screen shot</a></strong></p>

<p>I wonder if that&#39;s Las Vegas Police undercover or FBI?   </p>

<p>Another question - Who is responsible for making sure people could not get in that area?  I would think it would be the property owner (Colleli) and not MGM since they don&#39;t own that parcel.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know if the motel could have played some part in the shooting, but I did think it was odd that no one has said anything about it.  I just wanted to share what info I was able to find out.  Maybe some of you will pick up on something I missed.  Maybe some of you Las Vegans will be able to provide more information abut this motel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a little more information:</p>

<p>The address of Las Vegas Village (the concert venue) is 3901 S. Las Vegas Blvd. and is owned by MGM Resorts Festival Grounds LLC </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://archive.is/SEYlp">Property Records</a></strong> </p>

<p>But the abandoned motel has a separate address of 3889 S. Las Vegas Blvd and is located on a parcel of land within the concert venue.  It is owned by someone else named Spartaco Colleli.  </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://archive.is/POnFU">Property Records</a></strong> </p>

<p>Colleli purchased that parcel from the previous owners on October 1, 1986.  At the time of purchase, the motel was still in business.  According to ownership records, The Clarke County Treasurer Trustee seized the land on June 10, 2015 for delinquent property taxes.  Colleli paid the taxes and the parcel was returned to him on July 20, 2015. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://archive.is/m1iLn">Ownership records</a></strong></p>

<p>Was that entire square block searched by police/FBI, or just the part that was owned by MGM?  (I&#39;m thinking that MGM owned everything except where the motel is and where the Arco station and convenience store are.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really know how the guy got that footage.  I had linked to the video (to show it had been taken down) but here is the <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiId_gJiylHSp9FdikUJhrQ?app=desktop">link to his channel</a></strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think he even had that many videos.  One was this flyover video with some soft music in the background.  The Youtuber didn&#39;t make any comments.  One of the other videos was the B&amp;W security camera footage from that business over near the aviation fuel tanks.  Just straight footage with no sound.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how either of those videos could be labeled deceptive or misleading.  The whole thing just screams &quot;censorship&quot; to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes me wonder if it’s google AI doing the censoring based on rules that would naturally exclude non mainstream concepts. Are non-mainstream ideas “deceptive” by default? I really don’t know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I, too, appreciate you posting this. It must&#39;ve taken a lot of time and effort and I wanted to let you know I read the entire thing so it did not go to waste. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never been to Vegas but find it bizarre it&#39;s just sitting there in the middle of multi-million dollar properties. Especially for 18 years. Even 3 years seems too long. You&#39;d think someone would buy it just to eliminate the eye sore. </p>

<p>Off topic-- I have a weird fear of creepy abandoned hotels and that one is particularly shudder worthy. If I was asked to go in there at night for any reason I would straight up refuse.</p>
