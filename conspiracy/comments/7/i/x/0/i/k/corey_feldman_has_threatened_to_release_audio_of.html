       Doesn't even need to be a lawyer. If I were him, I'd have a deadman's switch set up. As I understand it, it's very easy to find ways for an individual to set up a deadman's switch that will automatically release information if a person fails to log in to their system every X number of days.

       Well that isn't the only way to do a deadman's switch, here's a portion of the software side of Wiki
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Software versions of dead man's switches are generally only used by people with technical expertise, and can serve several purposes; such as sending a notification to friends or deleting and encrypting data. The "non-event" triggering these can be almost anything, such as failing to log in for 7 consecutive days, not responding to an automated e-mail, ping, a GPS-enabled telephone not moving for a period of time, or merely failing to type a code within a few minutes of a computer's boot. An example of a software based dead man's switch is a Dead Man's Switch which starts when the computer boots up and can encrypt or delete user specified data if an unauthorised user should ever gain access to the protected computer. Google's Inactive Account Manager allows the account holder to nominate someone else to access their services if not used for an extended period (the default is three months).

       If you let the deadman's switch activate, the information you've set up to be sent out is sent out. That's how it works. You obviously have to be careful if you want to make use of a deadman's switch.

       I access the internet every day. Most of us living in the modern world do in some capacity and we can control our own access easily. Some people, like Julian Assange who is unlawfully detained, might need to make special arrangements to protect against the sorts of things you're talking about, but people who are not prisoners can usually ensure that they can access the Internet every X amount of days. And it's not like you have to do it every 8 hours or something. You could probably have it set to only require a log in once per month if you wanted. Obviously there are risks involved, but they're not so bad for most people who might want certain information revealed upon their death. I understand some people use this to share things like bank account details. It's not just people involved in espionage and journalism who might be interested in this technology, so I don't know why you seem so intent on poking holes in the idea. Plenty of people use services like I'm describing for completely mundane information.

       That is not the only way. There are levels of threshold you also take. The dead man switch is not just one system it is a layer. If done correctly you won't need to worry about those things.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example: There is a system that will allow one to expire and start a second, this will notify a few third party to look into you, the second one will keep track of your personal data and if it expires will then release medical and last know location to other parties. This can go on till you reach a threshold, where there are not more layer and the system will then activate the dead man switch at that point.  It can be as simple or as complex as you like it to be. It just a work flow builder

       To be fair to him, he reported the abuse  in 1993 but the police didn't want to know and even denied he reported it back then. They've since found his testimony, that's pretty convenient don't you think? What about all the children that Jimmy Savile abused? Do you think the police listened? No. They are all either corrupt or scared. Don't forget, 'everybody' knew about Savile and more recently, Wankstains (Weinstein). You just aren't in the club to know who's getting away with what. P.S. Corey Feldman could still rake in millions a year through the career that made him insanely famous, you know acting? I'm gonna let you guess why he doesn't get parts anymore.

       He's telling the truth about those abused him, but he's still a pimp looking for a quick buck and has strung everyone along thinking he's going to drop some big name. None of the code-names in his book (which readers have already figured out from the clues and so far corroborated) are big names‚Äîthey are all lesser names who are out of work, retired, or dead.

       His lawyers seem sharp as hell. By stating that he had given the names to the police recently Corey was put out of legal jeopardy and now has an excuse to say he wasnt fame seeking.
      </p>
      <p>
       All someone needed to do now is a FOI request and those names would have become public record. And surprise surprise, they found the recording missing for weeks after he spoke with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If those names match then Corey essentially has the abusers dead to rights. Because that tape was made when he was a minor and the accused have remained unchanged.

       What reason could a person possibly have for wanting to remain silent for longer...?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hmm, I dunno, maybe we should ask the THOUSANDS of other people who know the same things Feldman knows and are also sitting on the information? There might be some good reasons for fearing revealing everything like you and many other trolls claim to want.

       Feldman knows shit. And while I wish he would just name names and release evidence already, he needs to be careful. He went to the LAPD in 93, hey protected the power players instead. He exposed them again later, and Barbara Walters made him feel guilty about it. A lot of victims who have come out over the years have been threatened, smeared, ruined, or murdered. Read about all the "suicides" of young actors, back then and even now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the US gov protects the power players, read about jeffrey epstein, who got off light when the prosecutors illegally took a deal without getting the approval of the victims. Attorneys for 3 victims are bringing the case back to court as we speak, and the judge is saying he will not allow sexual talk in court. The whole case is about sexual assault of minors!
      </p>
      <p>
       He's being protected because had the original trial proceeded, a lot of other big players would have gone down as well. Same with Bryan Singer, I'm surprised something might finally stick to that sick f.

       Frankly, he's not much of a threat...even a hack like Barbara Walters or Matt Lauher can disarm him in studio.
      </p>

       He's playing a dangerous game, though, teasing the public...while "making the circuit with  a new band"
