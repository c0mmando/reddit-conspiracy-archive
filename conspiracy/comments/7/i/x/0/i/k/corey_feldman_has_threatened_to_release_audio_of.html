    <div class="md"><p>Well that isn&#39;t the only way to do a deadman&#39;s switch, here&#39;s a portion of the software side of Wiki</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Software versions of dead man&#39;s switches are generally only used by people with technical expertise, and can serve several purposes; such as sending a notification to friends or deleting and encrypting data. The &quot;non-event&quot; triggering these can be almost anything, such as failing to log in for 7 consecutive days, not responding to an automated e-mail, ping, a GPS-enabled telephone not moving for a period of time, or merely failing to type a code within a few minutes of a computer&#39;s boot. An example of a software based dead man&#39;s switch is a Dead Man&#39;s Switch which starts when the computer boots up and can encrypt or delete user specified data if an unauthorised user should ever gain access to the protected computer. Google&#39;s Inactive Account Manager allows the account holder to nominate someone else to access their services if not used for an extended period (the default is three months).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I access the internet every day. Most of us living in the modern world do in some capacity and we can control our own access easily. Some people, like Julian Assange who is unlawfully detained, might need to make special arrangements to protect against the sorts of things you&#39;re talking about, but people who are not prisoners can usually ensure that they can access the Internet every X amount of days. And it&#39;s not like you have to do it every 8 hours or something. You could probably have it set to only require a log in once per month if you wanted. Obviously there are risks involved, but they&#39;re not so bad for most people who might want certain information revealed upon their death. I understand some people use this to share things like bank account details. It&#39;s not just people involved in espionage and journalism who might be interested in this technology, so I don&#39;t know why you seem so intent on poking holes in the idea. Plenty of people use services like I&#39;m describing for completely mundane information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not the only way. There are levels of threshold you also take. The dead man switch is not just one system it is a layer. If done correctly you won&#39;t need to worry about those things.</p>

<p>For example: There is a system that will allow one to expire and start a second, this will notify a few third party to look into you, the second one will keep track of your personal data and if it expires will then release medical and last know location to other parties. This can go on till you reach a threshold, where there are not more layer and the system will then activate the dead man switch at that point.  It can be as simple or as complex as you like it to be. It just a work flow builder</p>

They&#39;ve since found his testimony, that&#39;s pretty convenient don&#39;t you think? What about all the children that Jimmy Savile abused? Do you think the police listened? No. They are all either corrupt or scared. Don&#39;t forget, &#39;everybody&#39; knew about Savile and more recently, Wankstains (Weinstein). You just aren&#39;t in the club to know who&#39;s getting away with what. P.S. Corey Feldman could still rake in millions a year through the career that made him insanely famous, you know acting?

<p>All someone needed to do now is a FOI request and those names would have become public record. And surprise surprise, they found the recording missing for weeks after he spoke with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Feldman knows shit. And while I wish he would just name names and release evidence already, he needs to be careful. He went to the LAPD in 93, hey protected the power players instead. He exposed them again later, and Barbara Walters made him feel guilty about it. A lot of victims who have come out over the years have been threatened, smeared, ruined, or murdered. Read about all the &quot;suicides&quot; of young actors, back then and even now.</p>

<p>Even the US gov protects the power players, read about jeffrey epstein, who got off light when the prosecutors illegally took a deal without getting the approval of the victims. Attorneys for 3 victims are bringing the case back to court as we speak, and the judge is saying he will not allow sexual talk in court. The whole case is about sexual assault of minors! </p>

<p>He&#39;s being protected because had the original trial proceeded, a lot of other big players would have gone down as well. Same with Bryan Singer, I&#39;m surprised something might finally stick to that sick f.</p>
