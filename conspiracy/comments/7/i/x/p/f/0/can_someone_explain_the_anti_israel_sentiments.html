       I by no means believe Israel is a force of good, but I believe when you compare them to the other countries in the region that beat women for wearing pants, behead people and cut off girl's clits, they aren't that bad. I dislike sending tax money to them, but I don't see why they are evil.

       How are they acquiring the additional land (outside of their borders... read: not theirs) for most of their new developments, that they're building? In order to expand all that awesomeness you speak of (Rothschild St. in particular is very ritzy)....?

       Why does your map only go back as far as the very end stages or the 1890's??
      </p>
      <p>
       What that entire plot of land just came into existence that year ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Very misleading about the history of the land and who controlled what going back x amount of years.

       Even the Jewish encyclopedia acknowledges that whole land mass as historic Palestine. If the twelve tribes return then they get a sliver each. The big mystery is how the fuck these “white” holocaust surviving larpers became entitled to the whole thing...

       I almost didn't include any imagery, for this very reason. Let's not pick over details, I think you can probably understand the message this particular graphic (chosen at random, one of many others like it, from many other sources) is trying to deliver.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, their religious beliefs dictate that they are the rightful owners of the land. The people that currently live their (literally, right now, in 2017) don't share those religious beliefs. They have all been thinking they lived in their own land. Probably because they were actually occupying the land.
      </p>
      <p>
       This slight dispute between ownership is one of many many ... uhhhhhh.... let's call them "disputes" that the allegiance of Israel and USA, and.... Just them? Ok, the US &amp; Israel see it one way, and the other folks see it differently.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think as citizens, most Americans have no actual opinion on the matter, because they have no idea what has been going on.

       It belonged to the Canaanites til "God" told the Israelites to murder every last one of them because "God" was giving the land to the Israelites.
      </p>
      <p>
       They murdered every last Canaanite…every last goat, ox…every woman and every child….because, according to a book
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       wrote the land belonged to them.

       Keep looking, you will get there. And maybe Israel isn't beheading people, but they are supposed to be a civilized western country, and they are literally hitleresque. Their apartheid regime should not be used as an example of democracy, it is a perfect example of fascism though.

       Make no mistake, I think radical islam needs to be ruthlessly put down like a rabid dog. But I think muslims are by far and away the biggest victims of Israeli influence. My pet theory is that Israel created and assisted arab radical ideologies to create the problem we have today.

       The CIA promoted radical Islamic ideologies during the 80's in order to frame the Afghan resistance to Russian occupiers as a holy war. By doing so, they inspired fighters to come from all over the Arab world, among them OBL.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course after the Russians were routed, the radical ideologies remained, and the CIA continued to nurture them in order to create a boogeyman to replace the now defunct Soviet Union. Not sure how Israel would have been involved exactly. At that time the US wasn't exactly Israel's attack dog like it is today.

       Because Israel owns the US government. Now, was that the case so much in the 80s? Not sure. I'm not sure when the takeover happened. But your absolutely correct otherwise

       US and Israel became allies after the six day war in 1967. For the next couple of decades Israel was viewed as a defense against the expansion of communism in the middle east, and more or less played the role of loyal attack dog.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the Soviet Union collapsed, they continued to be, at least in the eyes of the USG, a stabilizing influence in an inherently unstable region, and so the alliance continued. The alliance with Israel, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, ensured that the US could rest easy that its oil interests in the region would be secure, and an a 70's style embargo would never be repeated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect that while the collapse of the Soviet Union didn't change the way the US looked at Israel, I think it really changed the attitude of the Israelis. Probably they realized that now that the threat of global communism was gone, their cozy relations with the US could be in jeopardy unless they could outsize their influence in the USG, or other regional threats materialized (or both).
      </p>
      <p>
       George H. W. Bush might have lost his bid for a second term in 1992, due to the anger of Jewish-Americans over his objection to the expansion of settlements in the occupied territories. This might have been the first shot across the bow as it were, and future presidential prospects likely then realized the importance of not pissing off the Zionist lobby.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for the appearance of other regional threats, Islamic terrorism has handily taken the place of Soviet expansion, and once again secured Israel's place as a critical ally in the middle east. There's no doubt that when Netanyahu said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We are benefiting from one thing, and that is the attack on the Twin Towers and Pentagon
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       it was for that exact reason.

       It's rather interesting who is pushing these immigration policies in Europe and the states..... Hmm they are not Muslim interest groups, they seem to be majority Jewish interest groups with ties to their motherland. My friend it is the Jewish state that is exporting muslims. We also bomb the shit out of moderate countries leaving fundamental he'll holes in their place,  but it's not like we are even considering Israeli interest when invading or bombing countries in the middle East. No they are full freedom and shit.

       I've been on here for about 7 years now. Over the last 4 or 5 years as reddit began cracking down on all the white supremacy orientated hate groups, they all started coming over here to conspiracy. When this subreddit first began it was actually pro-Israel, under the mindset that so much of the world was geared against Israel. You'd get an immediate ban on this sub for even suggesting holocaust denial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Slowly but surely as the other radical subreddit got shut down they made their way over here. This is when r/isrconspiracyracist was founded. Eventually there was a big divide that led to r/conspiracyII and some of the other smaller subs. Unfortunately, being pro-Israel around here will paint a huge target on your back which is the real conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       A large portion of the posters on here are just shills, many are just parrots that spit the anti-Israel hate. Let me ask you this though OP, will you do the research and think for yourself?
      </p>
      <p>
       When you see how many downvotes this comment is going to receive and how many negative comments I'm going to get, eventually I'll have to delete my account. About once every 6 months or so I encourage someone to look into the other side of the Israel argument and I start getting death threats, brigade downvoted, etc. I usually have to make a new account every 6 months or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's not how it used to be. There's a lot of us still left on here that aren't such hateful people, but we're to afraid to speak up because slowly but surely this sub has been converted. Seek your own truth

       I don't like a lot of countries and the shit they do (Russia, China, Nigeria, Venezuela, Israel, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean I am anti those countries, it just means I criticize them just like I do the U.S. of A.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem I think some have is the large financial and military aid we give them and the power of lobbyists in this country for that country.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we were propping up other countries like this (and we do to some extent) I would/do have the same issues with them. When it comes to Israel though, criticizing them often brings with it charges of anti-semitism. It is similar to how if you criticize trump people say you are a shill - even if you have criticized every other president.

       There are some people who will rag on anything Israel does, and finds every Israeli a bloodthirsty Zionist. Similar to how I view Russia, even North Korea, I'm not "anti" entire other countries but I am very skeptical of leadership and political controllers. I think Netanyahu and cronies and settlers and their US sycophants (Trump and Kushner, for starters) are Making Israel Great Again by setting concepts of peace and coexistence with Palestine back decades. It's bullshit, and will simply continue the tension, bloodshed, and Holy War nonsense. Not that Hamas is innocent, both "sides" have plenty of blood on their hands...but one side clearly has all the power, and could fix things for the benefit of all literally tomorrow if they wanted to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comparing Israel to regional countries in the frame of brutality is absurd, by the way. Yeah, worse situations clearly exist, but it doesn't mean one should be satisfied with a less fucked status quo.

       You're ok with funding a holy war/apartheid? You're ok with access to every American's NSA file to Israel? You're ok with billions of dollars in aide and revenue? You're ok with violating the Torah and re-establishing what was destroyed by God? I don't believe in the OT/NT bible, but creating Israel was supposed to summon the Anti-Christ.
