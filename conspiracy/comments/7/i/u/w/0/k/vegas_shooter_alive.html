       I have seen (Stephen Paddock) dead.  Someone "leaked"it.   But I want to see him alive in the Mandalay Bay casino.  They have 1000 Cameras or more. Every inch of that casino has eyes on it.  Where are the photos of him checking in, riding the elevator, playing blackjack, walking into his room, making 5 trips up the stairs or elevator with tons of luggage, (all these guns and ammo this "one" guy had in his room), where are the ones of him entering his room.  Or even just a stream of his floor and room... all the activity that went on up there... (the cops coming up, him entering the room, any  other suspicious or not activity on that floor?)  all seems pretty suspicious. but there is 100% documented activity of that floor, that night, that hallway, those stairs, those elevators, security and police activity.  I want to see that. Not some staged (or not) picture of a dead guy....SHOW me the timeline because there is one....
      </p>
      <p>
       All these witnesses and survivors are dying, stephen paddocks brother got picked up for child porn (easily could have been planted)...and i guarantee he will go to prison, and someone will "beat him to death" for being a chomo.  its like patsy 101.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its pretty weird that one of the biggest mass shooting events of all time the media stopped talking about it....but they talked about cecil the lion for 2 years non stop.....further proof that the fake news cannot be trusted... Omission is an act of deception...

       Well if you google Vegas death certificates you can purchase them. But I’d be very surprised if the ambulance staff, nurses, doctors, morgue technicians and hospital management were being forced to pretend that bodies with bullet wounds turned up at their hospital that night. Surely at least one doctor would have spoken out and said actually we were quiet that night, nobody came to ER. It’s all a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some strange things about this massacre but people being shot probably isn’t one of them.

       If you think there are questionable aspects of the massacre you have to question the most basic, yet extraordinary claims, such as that people were shot when there is indeed no reason to think so. You mention all these nurses, doctors, etc. Who cares about that? Just show me pictures and videos of things being shot on camera, bullet-riddled objects, glass broken on the scene, rivers of blood, people receiving emergency medical treatment on the scene, etc. All of these things should be as abundant as they are graphic, and yet there is nothing of the sort.

       There’s no reason to think that people were shot?  Ok well if you consider eye witness testimonies, police and medical staff to be lying or fraudulent then surely the photographic or video evidence you require could also be faked?

       Sure it could be faked, just like some of the "eye witness" testimonies we have seen are incongruent, impossible, or coming from actual actors. You keep talking about police and medical staff that you assume are out there but cannot point to anything. It could be faked, but it doesn't even exist. Thousands of rounds were allegedly fired but no one can show a single shot hitting anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr Cronk here is certainly an amateurish bullshitter with a preposterous and impossible story. No need for bullshit actors and made-up nonsense in a real shooting.

       His "buddy" obviously could not have been shot 3x in the chest. So he is lying. It's not that much of a logical leap to then assume that the entire scenario is a drill or hoax type event, especially since as I said no one can show any imagery that strongly suggests shots were fired. When there should have been thousands of active recording devices on the scene.

       Many times they use a single child, or a kid with a brother/sister, and turn the single child into two people, one of them being an evil super-shooter or whatever the agenda is.

       Time and time again, these "siblings" never have images of themselves with their supposed  sibling.

       A link from one article from a local newspaper doesn't exactly support the argument that this hasn't been pushed to the back burner by MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second link has absolutely nothing to do with the facts of the case other than shooter's estate has been sued. Top notch reporting! Rest easy guys ABC is really digging in. Let's not investigate the countless inaccuracies in the official report or timeline.... But hey his estate is getting sued that will probably get some clicks.

       I only read the first article. I have no interest in what ABC has to say. However, this Doug Poppa guy is asking a lot of good questions. The Baltimore Post Examiner isn't exactly MSM. It's somewhere in the middle, IMO having lived in Baltimore. He's pretty much daring the LVPD to give an interview with a "confrontational" journalist (even if it isn't him). I've since read the article above, the rest and have watched all 50+ parts of End Times News Report on YouTube. At the very least, this guy isn't writing fluff pieces like ABC.

       I can’t think of a single reason why the casino would want to release any footage to anyone other than the police. Why would they waste time and money trying to satisfy a small community of conspiracy nuts?

      <p>
       How would that increase their revenue? It wouldn’t. Only thing it might do is alert potential criminals as to the whereabouts and capabilities of their CCTV systems. Again something that’s not on their interest.

       Honestly, this whole thing smells to me like: some old-fashioned players tried to pull a false-flag, and the whole thing fell apart. Like, old-timers who didn't understand the impact of technology on their plan (cell phone video, requests for hotel video, FOIA requests, people doing their own research, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, I think they just said "fuck it, shut it down" and gave up on the op. Next thing you know, there isn't a peep about it anywhere, and the news stopped covering it. It's like it never happened, now. I'm thinking it was just an op that went bad, and they just gave up on it. You can't just pull a false flag, like the olden days, with he-said/she-said anymore - you got everyone running around with cameras in their pockets and people now demanding video of the event!

       Likely if this is a test or false flag, then I imagine there would be a few things that aren't initially obvious behind what both the government, military and elite would want to know:
      </p>
      <p>
       How apethetic is tourism versus a recent "public slaughter" ?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        From what Ive read, Sales and tourism haven't declined the Vegas economy for more then a few hours.  Perhaps they are testing the waters for high fatality events.   Its sickening to imagine someone working out the numbers on how many people can be killed, and watching threshold numbers on how quickly average households are then immediately distracted by further "distractions" successfully.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       How able is the public to actually know what happened?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Based on the various accounts of events,  huge unanswered questions, and general dissatisfaction with the ammount available information of our community...
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Are unseen levels to this event, its possible that they are being removed from public view due to connections to these "sealed inditements"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are the poorly matching storylines/ evidence the result of misinformation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this about studying the public reaction to staged events post jfk releases?  Is Patton an oswalt?

       There’s no reason to think that people were shot?  Ok well if you consider eye witness testimonies, police and medical staff to be lying or fraudulent then surely the photographic or video evidence you require could also be faked?
