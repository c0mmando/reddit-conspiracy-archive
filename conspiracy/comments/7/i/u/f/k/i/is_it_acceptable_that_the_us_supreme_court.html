        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is it acceptable that the U.S. Supreme Court decides constitutional issues in the U.S.A? How can it be considered in any manner as being “constitutional” when this same Supreme Court is appointed by (not elected) and paid by the Federal U.S. Government? </p>

<p>The legal system (judiciary) of the U.S.A. is controlled by the CrownTemple from the independent and sovereign City of London. The private Federal Reserve System, which issues fiat U.S. Federal Reserve Notes, is financially owned and controlled by the Crown from Switzerland, the home and legal origin for the charters of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, and most importantly, the Bank of International Settlements. Even Hitler respected his Crown bankers by not bombing Switzerland. The Bank of International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland [Vatican bank] controls all the central banks of the G7 nations</p>

<p>At least five justices are Roman Catholics and three are Jewish; it is unclear whether Neil Gorsuch considers himself a Catholic or an Episcopalian, but really episcopalian can claim Catholic. That makes all of them Catholic, and Jewish. The top four longest in office curently at 29years, 26years,24years, and 23years. </p>

<p>The U.S.A. is dictated to by the Crown Temple through its bankers and attornies. The U.S.A. is controlled and manipulated by this private foreign power and our unlawful Federal U.S. Government is their pawnbroker. The bankers and Bar Attorneys in the U.S.A. are a franchise in oath and allegiance to the Crown at Chancery – the Crown Temple Church and its Chancel located at Chancery Lane – a manipulative body of elite bankers and attorners from the independent City of London who violate the law in America by imposing fraudulent “legal”– contracts on the American people. The banks Rule the Temple Church and their Attorneys carry out their Orders by controlling their victim’s judiciary.
The governments of the USA, Canada, Australia and more are subsidiaries of the Crown Temple and so is the US Central Bank the Federal Reserve, as are all Central Banks on the Planet and including the IMF` World Bank.</p>

<p>“The American people were hoodwinked into thinking they were declaring lawful independence from the Crown. Proof that the 13 colonies are still in Crown possession is the use of the word ‘State’ to signify a ‘legal estate of possession.’ Had this been a document of and by the people, both the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution would have been written using the word ‘States’. By the use of ‘State’, the significance of government of estate possessions was legally established. All of the North American States are Crown Templar possessions through their legal document, signed by their representation of both parties to the contract, known as the Constitution of the United States of America.</p>

<p>So we are owned by the “The Crown” but who controls the Crown?</p>

<p>On May 15th 1213, King John, puppet of the Knights Templar, effectively signed away the Kingdom of England and Ireland to Pope Innocent III and the Roman Church, witnessed by the Crown Templars. As King John said at the time:</p>

<p>&quot;I myself bearing witness in the house of the Knights Templars.”
The King John Charter said:
” We wish it to be known to all of you, through this our charter, furnished with our seal… not induced by force or compelled by fear, but of our own good and spontaneous will and by common councle of our Barons, do offer and freely concede to God and his Holy Apostles Peter and Paul and to our mother the holy Roman Church, and to our lord Pope Innocent and to his Catholic successors, the whole kingdom of England and the whole kingdom of Ireland, with all their rights and appurtenances… we perform and swear fealty for them to him are aforesaid lord pope Innocent, and his Catholic successors and the Roman Church… binding our successors and our heirs by our wife forever, in a similar manner to perform fealty and show homage to him who shall be chief pontiff at the time, and to the Roman church without demur. As a sign… we will and establish perpetual obligation and concession… from the proper and especial revenues of our aforesaid kingdoms…
The Roman church shall receive yearly a thousand marks sterling… saving to us and to our heirs our rights, liberties and regalia; all of which things, as they have been described above, we wish to have perpetually valid and firm; and we bind ourselves and our successors not to act counter to them. And if we or any of our successors shall presume to attempt this, whoever he be, unless being duly warned he come to his kingdom, and his senses, he shall lose his right to the kingdom, and this charter of our obligation and concession shall always remain firm.”</p>

<p>1776 is the year that will truly live in infamy for all Americans. It is the year that the Crown Colonies became legal Crown States. The Declaration of Independence was a legal, not lawful, document. It was signed on both sides by representatives of the Crown Temple. Legally, it announced the status quo of the Crown Colonies to that of the new legal name called ‘States’ as direct possessive estates of the Crown
The American people were hoodwinked into thinking they were declaring lawful independence from the Crown. Proof that the 13 colonies are still in Crown possession is the use of the word ‘State’ to signify a ‘legal estate of possession.’ Had this been a document of and by the people, both the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution would have been written using the word ‘States’. By the use of ‘State’, the significance of government of estate possessions was legally established.

<p>Isn&#39;t all of this just half-baked Sovereign Citizen stuff?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LEGAL. Latin legalis. Pertaining to the understanding, the exposition, the administration, the science and the practice of law: as, the legal profession, legal advice; legal blanks, newspaper. Implied or imputed in law. Opposed to actual. “Legal” looks more to the letter, and “Lawful” to the spirit, of the law. “Legal” is more appropriate for conformity to positive rules of law; “Lawful” for accord with ethical principle. “Legal” imports rather that the forms of law are observed, that the proceeding is correct in method, that rules prescribed have been obeyed; “Lawful” that the right is actful in substance, that moral quality is secured. “Legal” is the antithesis of “equitable”, and the equivalent of “constructive”. </p>

Who says they can’t? Just because it hasn’t been made available to the masses or even demonstrated doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. Wouldn’t logic dictate that if a $500 Nikon can do what it does that it’s a certainty that more expensive cameras that the government uses can do better?
