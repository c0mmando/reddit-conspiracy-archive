       What if "the left" is setting up there own for sexual misconduct, and forcing people like Franken to resign? That would give them the "moral high ground" and set a precedent for how it should be handled. In turn, Trump would have to respond. He most likely wouldn't resign the office, but it would leave him open to even more impeachment talks using Bill Clinton as an example of why he should be impeached.

       I have a lot of thoughts on how many cases of sexual assault or misconduct have been brought up lately. I would like to see actual evidence of some before people are just labled and tossed away. I'm not defending any of them, so please don't take this as a defense of anything, any one of them may have said or done. I would just like proof before I pass judegment.

       I know. But you could explain away those as gaffs and the edgy, low brow humor of a professional comic. I don’t think we should do that, really... but people could use that argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that Franken has resigned due to allegations and some very bad photos, but his allegations are way less immoral than the allegations leveled at Trump or Moore, and this social movement has yet to take either of them down.

       Fair enough, although "less immoral" is an interesting phrase. If we are going to expect these people to be representatives of us, and the majority hasn't sexually assaulted someone, repeatedly, they shouldn't be a representative. Franken, Moore, Trump, Clinton (both), and countless more. Why do we tolerate some, but not others? Because they're "less immoral?"

       I haven’t heard of Hillary sexually assaulting anybody, except in conservative fever dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
       I the reality is that nobody is going to be perfect, and we’ve now entered a generation where everybody’s mistakes will exist forever. We’re going to have to start making moral judgements on this issues because precious few people haven’t ever fucked up in some way like Franken’s photos. His other alleged butt squeezes aside, that’s a whole other level. We have to take the responsibility to not equivocate actual rape and molestation with less severe acts.

       Also, I agree, nobody is perfect. However, to put these allegations on a spectrum is doing a disservice to the victims, and the people. Bad is bad and should be punished. Let's make sure there is evidence, and then proceed. It seems that's not the way, though.

       Isn't bad and good all subjective, though? So we have laws in place to outline what is and isn't acceptable, right? There's a line that's now been drawn in the sand, by our representitives. Does it matter if the line was crossed by an inch, or by a mile? These people put the laws in to place, they helped shape our society. Shouldn't they be held to a higher standard? If they cross the line, which they drew, it shouldn't matter how far they crossed it. I hope that makes as much sense here as it does in my head.

       The GOP doesn't give a shit about the moral high ground, and neither does anyone who voted for trump.  So, Democrats claiming the moral high ground, while the right thing to do, was not done for that sake alone.  They are doing it because it's

       , not because they can use it -- since they can't.

       I'm not saying it's a bad thing at all. I am glad that these people are being exposed. As long as there is evidence to prove what they did. Louis CK, Al Franken, Roy Moore, good, leave. I just want to make sure that in a time when people are so willing to accept a sexual misconduct accusation, they're equally willing to accept evidence and make an educated judgement.

       Fair enough, like I said in a different response, it all seems like it's building to something bigger. I just don't know what. I figured I would toos this out there and see if there were any similar thoughts.

       Yeah I totally would think:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Donald held back Ivana’s arms and began to pull out fistfuls of hair from her scalp, as if to mirror the pain he felt from his own operation. He tore off her clothes and unzipped his pants.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Then he jams his penis inside her for the first time in more than sixteen months. Ivana is terrified… It is a violent assault,” Hurt writes. “According to versions she repeats to some of her closest confidantes, ‘he raped me.’”
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the incident, Ivana ran upstairs, hid behind a locked door, and remained there “crying for the rest of night.” When she returned to the master bedroom in the morning, he was there.

       unfortunately victims need to be credible if the only evidence there is their word. Getting a large pay out and not filing criminal charges does not make her story credible unfortunately. It's important that victims are not intimidated so they report when it happens. Her story is not convincing to me and I am very open to being convinced. They are going to need more accusations from alleged victims to Impeach trump. The public supports him.

       <p>
        “During a deposition given by me in connection with my matrimonial case, I stated that my husband had raped me,” Ivana Trump said in a statement at the time, as the Daily Beast reported. "[O]n one occasion during 1989, Mr. Trump and I had marital relations in which he behaved very differently toward me than he had during our marriage. As a woman, I felt violated, as the love and tenderness, which he normally exhibited towards me, was absent. I referred to this as a 'rape,' but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense."

       The left and the right are no different than Macho Man Randy Savage and Hulk Hogan.  They are there to divide and distract.  Everything we see in the news is a purposefully crafted narrative for the world stage.  My theory on this particular narrative is it's to demonize men in general and support more "women" in positions of power.  We already see this narrative being leveraged as such:
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I say "women" because this definition now to the world includes transgender sodomites (like Michelle Obama for instance).  Most "women" in positions of power were actually born men.  It's one of the deeper more disturbing conspiracies out there.

       It's all related to the Satanic cults the Elite are involved with.  They worship the likes of the androgynous Baphomet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ultimate truth they are trying to distract and hide is that of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  All one needs to do to be saved out of this present, evil world is repent and believe this:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

       No. I should clarify that I don't think it's a plan hatched somewhere in the democratic party, its more like the general backlash of Trump being president has brought sexual misconduct to the national spotlight. The democratics are cleaning up their act so it will be easier to win against or impeach Trump.

       That makes sense. More of a clean before the housekeeper gets there, kind of thing? I wonder how much of it is fabricated, both whats been accused, and what will be accused.

       If they're legitimate complaints (Charlie Rose, Harvey Weinsetin, etc.) good, ruin their careers. If someone makes a pass at a co-worker, gets rejected and moves on, thats not something worth losing everything for. I am just curious as to how much (more) this is going to be weaponized.

       Even if they are legitimate complaints, I have a problem with people who wait YEARS before speaking out. Like with Harvey Weinstein - all those actresses benefited from not speaking out. They knew what they were doing by not speaking out at the time. Now they are big stars.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is very scary and sad that it has gotten to this point. Some of the things that women are speaking out about are not sexual assault.

       I believe all this bullshit buttering up the masses with sexual predators that are celebrities is all leading to this Trump one. I don't believe any of these cases , it almost any of them are real. Why? To much national media attention. Usually means an agenda. I don't like Trump personally , but I don't think he is guilty, and none of these other celebrities either.

       Yes, although there are plenty of pedos, and sexual predators out there. The ones getting mass media attention are Psy ops. Perpetrated by exactly who? I don't know, but 99% of the time the entire mass media latches onto something it is a Psy Op.

       I find it interesting that there s all these outlandish claims, but no evidence to back it up, or at least nothing concrete. Yes, there are strange Instagram posts, and symbolism with Comet Ping Pong pizza, but the claims said they were abusing children in the basement. The building doesn't even have a basement. Where do these people get the accusations, or why is there no evidence? Are we being lied to on a major scale, or are we just sheep latching on to anything that we
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       we figured out.
