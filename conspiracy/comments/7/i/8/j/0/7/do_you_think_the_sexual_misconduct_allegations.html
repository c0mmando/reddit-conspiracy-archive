    <div class="md"><p>I know. But you could explain away those as gaffs and the edgy, low brow humor of a professional comic. I don’t think we should do that, really... but people could use that argument.</p>

<p>The point is that Franken has resigned due to allegations and some very bad photos, but his allegations are way less immoral than the allegations leveled at Trump or Moore, and this social movement has yet to take either of them down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, although &quot;less immoral&quot; is an interesting phrase. If we are going to expect these people to be representatives of us, and the majority hasn&#39;t sexually assaulted someone, repeatedly, they shouldn&#39;t be a representative. Franken, Moore, Trump, Clinton (both), and countless more. Why do we tolerate some, but not others? Because they&#39;re &quot;less immoral?&quot; </p>

<p>I the reality is that nobody is going to be perfect, and we’ve now entered a generation where everybody’s mistakes will exist forever. We’re going to have to start making moral judgements on this issues because precious few people haven’t ever fucked up in some way like Franken’s photos. His other alleged butt squeezes aside, that’s a whole other level. We have to take the responsibility to not equivocate actual rape and molestation with less severe acts.</p>

<p>No, no, <em>strong disagree</em>. Putting bad behavior on a spectrum is exactly what needs to be done. Black-and-white, binary thinking is the same dysfunction that causes basically all conflict in the world. Context is <em>always</em> important. Bad is bad is simplistic and solves no problems. The victims are no better or worse served. It doesn’t affect them unless justice isn’t done, and justice isn’t done when justice is simplistic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t bad and good all subjective, though? So we have laws in place to outline what is and isn&#39;t acceptable, right? There&#39;s a line that&#39;s now been drawn in the sand, by our representitives. Does it matter if the line was crossed by an inch, or by a mile? These people put the laws in to place, they helped shape our society. Shouldn&#39;t they be held to a higher standard? If they cross the line, which they drew, it shouldn&#39;t matter how far they crossed it. I hope that makes as much sense here as it does in my head. </p>

<p>Donald held back Ivana’s arms and began to pull out fistfuls of hair from her scalp, as if to mirror the pain he felt from his own operation. He tore off her clothes and unzipped his pants.</p>

<p>“Then he jams his penis inside her for the first time in more than sixteen months. Ivana is terrified… It is a violent assault,” Hurt writes. “According to versions she repeats to some of her closest confidantes, ‘he raped me.’”</p>

<p>Following the incident, Ivana ran upstairs, hid behind a locked door, and remained there “crying for the rest of night.” When she returned to the master bedroom in the morning, he was there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The left and the right are no different than Macho Man Randy Savage and Hulk Hogan.  They are there to divide and distract.  Everything we see in the news is a purposefully crafted narrative for the world stage.  My theory on this particular narrative is it&#39;s to demonize men in general and support more &quot;women&quot; in positions of power.  We already see this narrative being leveraged as such:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-women_us_5a24dd9ce4b03350e0b7a354">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-women_us_5a24dd9ce4b03350e0b7a354</a></p>

<p>I say &quot;women&quot; because this definition now to the world includes transgender sodomites (like Michelle Obama for instance).  Most &quot;women&quot; in positions of power were actually born men.  It&#39;s one of the deeper more disturbing conspiracies out there.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAgVKvt3syB7gV-hL9bMTYw/videos">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAgVKvt3syB7gV-hL9bMTYw/videos</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s all related to the Satanic cults the Elite are involved with.  They worship the likes of the androgynous Baphomet.</p>

<p>The ultimate truth they are trying to distract and hide is that of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  All one needs to do to be saved out of this present, evil world is repent and believe this:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if they are legitimate complaints, I have a problem with people who wait YEARS before speaking out. Like with Harvey Weinstein - all those actresses benefited from not speaking out. They knew what they were doing by not speaking out at the time. Now they are big stars.</p>

<p>It is very scary and sad that it has gotten to this point. Some of the things that women are speaking out about are not sexual assault.</p>
