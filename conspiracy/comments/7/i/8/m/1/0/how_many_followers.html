    <div class="md"><p>Yes that would constitute propaganda. It&#39;s deliberately misleading information designed to appeal to the reader&#39;s emotions in order to support a given cause. </p>

<p>That user would most certainly not be speaking German right now if it weren&#39;t for your grandfather. The US was funding both sides of the war. Henry Ford had a plant in Germany that manufactured engines for German armor. One could argue if Germany won, it would not have been possible without the US. </p>

<p>Yes, the US played a big part in the European theater, but it would have perhaps been more damaging if we never supported Germany from the very start. Nazi headquarters were on Park Avenue in Manhattan at the time for goodness sake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>its formality. not governing.</p>

<p>Royal Assent
Although bills are created by the House of Commons and the House of Lords, they can’t become law without receiving royal assent from the Queen. This is where Her Majesty makes a trip to the Lords Chamber and approves (or denies) a specific bill.</p>

<p>Still, at this point royal assent has become little more than a formality. The last time a monarch went against parliament was in 1708, when Queen Anne withheld her support for a bill to restore the Scottish militia.</p>

<p>Commander-In-Chief
All soldiers within the British Armed Forces are under the command of the Queen. In theory, this means that Her Majesty would be able to take a leading role in all military operations.</p>

<p>In practice, however, the Queen has little to do with how Britain defends herself at home or abroad. The royal prerogative allows her to offload this responsibility onto the prime minister and the Secretary of State for Defence, along with other officials.</p>

<p>And while she technically has the power to, say, order an air strike on the White House, in practice the UK government could (and would) prevent her from doing so.</p>

<p>Declaration of War
The Queen is the only person in the UK with the power to officially declare war on other countries. Of course, this ability comes with some caveats. Noticing a pattern yet?</p>

<p>This rule only applies to all-out warfare, and was last enacted by King George VI during World War II.</p>

<p>However, the British Armed Forces are allowed to engage ground troops on foreign soil for combat missions. The most notable recent example of this was the UK’s decision to invade Iraq in 2003. Though this was an armed conflict, the government didn’t need the Queen’s permission.</p>

<p>The Royals have a direct line to politicians the fact they have a say in the final thing is moot. They have far more say than people think and they should be abolished ASAP.</p>

The message would be that we are getting fucked over regardless of party.
