       I like to think Q is Trump himself. He knows the media blows up anytime he says anything. He is using Q as a way of makeing people ask questions that he cannot say publicly in fear of derailing investigations. While this is just my hopes. Q is probably someone that worked with the WH since bill. He has dirt from decades of corruption but because of the information he knows he could easily be ouated as a leaked if he gave details. So instead Q makes us fine the dirt by pointing us in the right direction. Q I belive is real and legit.

       But yeah really though man, you really drank the koolaid, didn't you? He's fucking 71. No, he doesn't know how to use a computer. Most people his age don't. He's mind boggling ignorant about them- something you should really be aware of. The man literally calls the internet 'they cyber'. Here are some quotes:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “You know, if you have something really important, write it out and have it delivered by courier, the old-fashioned way. Because I’ll tell you what: No computer is safe"
       </p>
       <p>
        "So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyberwarfare. It is—it is a huge problem. I have a son. He’s 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it’s unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it’s hardly doable."
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       There are pictures of him on airforce one reading printed out news articles and tons of reports of his staff bringing him articles printed out. If you really believe he would be able to go on 4chan and post that cryptic larp shit then you really need to think more critically.

adjective
relating to or characteristic of the culture of computers, information technology, and virtual reality.
"the cyber age"

       This quote makes sense if you know the definition of cyber.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the man likes to read shit on paper. There are plenty of people that prefer paper over a monitor. I believe you need to stop smoking the crack and enjoy the cool-aid.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying the man is a computer genius, but my 100 grandparents can use a pc and browse the internet just fine. Age is not an issue when learning about computers, it's the willingnes to learn that is the issue.

       You're bending over backwards to forgive that heinous mangling of the english language. No remotely knowledgeable person uses the word cyber (cyberspace, maybe but he didn't say that) in the place of 'internet'. You can make all the excuses you want but at the end of the day it's obvious the man doesn't know a damn thing about computers. He can send tweets and probably check e-mails from his phone. But the idea that he is posting cryptic shit on 4chan is the pipe dream of a 14 year old.

       You say most people at 71 don’t know how to use a computer. Most of those people were working 5 years ago at a time computers were in wide use. I had a computer at home in the mid 80’s. I think 30 years ago people were using computers at home or work.
      </p>
      <p>
       The percentage of adults that had never used a computer in their lives and suddenly, at 71 say “hey I think I’ll try that computer thing” must be absurdly low. Even then the learning curve is easy enough for a five year old.

       You misunderstand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've no doubt the majority of people know how to use a computer on a basic level. Aka check the news, read e-mail, maybe scan some photos. There's a huge disconnect between that and understanding it. Ask anyone who works in IT or any computer repair place. It's 99% nervous old people. I don't know the number of 71 year old who browse 4chan (particularly /b/ or /pol/) but I bet its pretty close to zero.
