        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s a little off topic I know, but I thought of that when hearing the news of that reboot.</p>

<p>You wanna watch the Twilight Zone, just turn on the fucking news. People are openly calling for president&#39;s to be assassinated and no one blinks. California&#39;s burning to the ground, boys are girls, you can now determine which race you are, anti-racist is the new racist and the government can see everyone&#39;s nude pics with a few clicks.</p>

<p>The most controversial thing I could put on TV right now is Leave it to Beaver. A white nuclear family who respects everyone, never brings up race or politics and tries to live a good clean life with love. No one swears. No one gets naked. No one shoots each other, etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a depressing shame what this country has come to, but thank God for Trump.</p>

<p>Also, since the show is based in LA/So-Cal, it makes sense that there&#39;s a lot of minorities, just sayin :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should watch it...doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s &quot;unbelievable&quot;...it&#39;s really not. The main family is white, the grandfather is married to a younger Latina woman, and he&#39;s wealthy, so it&#39;s not hard to see why she was interested in him in the first place. The mothers brother is gay and is married to his partner...and they&#39;re both white. Hell, the majority of the cast is white except Gloria, and the only non hetero-couple is her brother and his partner. </p>

<p>The show doesn&#39;t force their relationship on you either...in the sense that there is now awkward PDA&#39;s except for like a single kiss on their wedding in S5. And their dad has a lot of issues with his son being gay, the show handles it well and gives both views of the older generation, who disapproves but is trying to come to terms because it&#39;s his son and the younger ones that just don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really a great show...it&#39;s not serious at all and it&#39;s easy to just help forget the world for awhile, like LITB of Full House. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s cool man. Your prerogative. Just puttin it out there :) Most of the comedy comes from the 3 branches of the family and their goofy sub plots that somehow end up coming together. You should at least watch the first episode of S1 before you completely dismiss it...but I understand you likely wont, and that&#39;s totally OK. Just wanted to explain the show a bit since you said you had never seen it. </p>

<p>all the fags</p>

<p>What&#39;s wrong with 2 grown adults being allowed to love each other? Do you even know any gay people IRL? 2 of my best friends growing up, brothers, are both gay. They&#39;re amazing people, never done any wrong to anyone. One of the most brilliant men I&#39;ve ever met and had the chance to work under was a Professor who is gay, he&#39;s an amazing human being and a leader in his field. Nothing degenerate about that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>race mixing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LOL. There&#39;s only one race bud, the <em>human</em> race. There is nothing biologically wrong with people mating with whoever they want. Blacks, Whites, Latinos, doesn&#39;t fuckin matter. Their kids will be perfectly fine and healthy, because w&#39;re all the same species. You need to let go of that hate, and of your tribalism, and quit pretending that you or anyone else of any &quot;race&quot; is superior just because you happened to be born a certain color, that you did nothing to obtain. </p>

<p>Thoughts like yours hold this world back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. I just don&#39;t see the issue, considering that the differences in &quot;races&quot;, which are superficial to begin with, only occurred because of geographical separation of groups of people. As we come to see Earth as our home, and not mere parts of it, and as our world grows ever more connected, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any real way to stop people from being with those they love, just because their skin color is different. I think what is important, and what you are really getting at, is <em>cultural</em> differences, which I believe should be celebrated but not made the be all end all of our personal definitions of ourselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on your definition of “disorder”. If you have the neurological makeup of a man and the body of a woman, would you rather be given the body of a man or the neurological makeup of a woman? One is a drastic physical change in line with what your brain already is equipped to handle, the other is a drastic psychological change that would probably change every part of your personality.</p>

<p>This is the crux of the argument, and why it is so offensive to suggest trans people are just mentally ill. Your insistence is on a solution that 1) does not work and 2) would require vast changes in their own self-perception, when the cost to <em>you</em> to accept them as whatever sex they transition to is... zero. If you don’t know them personally, they will do everything they can to pass, and you will never even know. If you know them personally, you are essentially disparaging very fundamental parts of their self-identity and insisting they change... mostly for your own benefit.</p>

<p>Because, again, mental help for transgender people. Does. Not. Work. It doesn’t have anything to do with big pharma, and nobody who is trans is in denial that they are trans. They don’t honestly believe those breasts don’t exist. They don’t honestly believe chromosomal expression doesn’t exist. They do however, believe in a distinction between the body’s chromosomal expression and that of the brain. Which, again, supported by science and all that. A trans person who denies the existence of their genitalia is actually delusional. Experiencing a male brain in a female body is not delusional.</p>

<p>In order to “fix” the neurological side of this issue, we would need to have neuro-surgical capabilities so advanced as to be science fiction. Neuro-surgical capabilities to re-wire somebody’s personality, to fix schizophrenia and ADHD, to calm aggressive people and embolden skittish ones. In short, things that won’t exist for a very, very long time.</p>

<p>Transitioning physically is the best option by virtue of being the only present solution that works.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s ways I think everything would be improved if women stayed at home: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>There&#39;d be around 80+ million jobs now available. To fill those jobs, companies would have to increase their pay and the quality of their work place. No one can tell me this wouldn&#39;t be more helpful for the economy.</p></li>
<li><p>Mom&#39;s would be active in their kids lives, which would lead to many many good things.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly...you can&#39;t always.  I am a guy, and I physiologically cannot have children, I don&#39;t have a way around it.  I am lucky that my GF is OK with that.  If we get married and decide to have kids, we&#39;ll have to do it another way, either through adoption or through artificial insemination.  </p>

<p>I totally agree with you about NOT having kids if you have a couple that doesn&#39;t want them, I was referring to women in the workforce though.  If you exclude half of the population from working...what do they do if they aren&#39;t going to raise kids?</p>

<p>As far as studies that kids from homosexual families having issues at a higher rate...find a peer reviewed study that says that.  I&#39;m not saying that nobody wrote a study that promotes that...but there aren&#39;t any scientifically valid studies that back it up.  </p>

<p>If you&#39;re referring to the Kevin Andrews book...that has been thoroughly debunked as being based in his opinion, and none of the studies he cites in the book actually follow the scientific method for their analysis...basically they&#39;re someone&#39;s opinion that isn&#39;t based on facts.  Stability in relationships is beneficial to children, but the sex of the parents was a non contributory factor.  The major factor that does pop up is that families with more disposable income have a statistically better likelihood of raising successful children, and that is due to access to better education programs.  If you&#39;re referring to the Richard P. Fitzgibbons study, look at the sample sizes for the studies he cites.  Citing results from a study that followed 36 people...REALLY?  That&#39;s not a study, that&#39;s cherry picking from a small sample size.  Find me a study that has 20,000 participants and shows the same results...you can&#39;t...because they don&#39;t show them.  The American Psychological Association studied data from gay and lesbian couples with children that spanned decades, and their scientifically backed result was said &quot;Not a single study has found children of lesbian and gay parents to be disadvantaged in any significant respect relative to children of heterosexual parents&quot;</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t that their kids didn&#39;t have any issues, it was that them being gay had NO impact on the likelihood of those issues.  Other factors like socioeconomic circumstances and family stability were the major causes.  </p>

<p>As far as having life be better for everyone when people subscribe to a set of values based on people not being shitty to one another...I agree with you 1000% there.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gender dysphoria is the mental reult of the cognitive dissonance experienced by transgender people on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Gender dysphoria is treated by transitioning. Being transgender just is. Like being gay.</p>

<p>Being transgender is not a mental disorder. I already explained what it is. It is not treatable by psychological counseling. This is extensively documented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on your definition of “disorder”. If you have the neurological makeup of a man and the body of a woman, would you rather be given the body of a man or the neurological makeup of a woman? One is a drastic physical change in line with what your brain already is equipped to handle, the other is a drastic psychological change that would probably change every part of your personality.</p>

<p>This is the crux of the argument, and why it is so offensive to suggest trans people are just mentally ill. Your insistence is on a solution that 1) does not work and 2) would require vast changes in their own self-perception, when the cost to <em>you</em> to accept them as whatever sex they transition to is... zero. If you don’t know them personally, they will do everything they can to pass, and you will never even know. If you know them personally, you are essentially disparaging very fundamental parts of their self-identity and insisting they change... mostly for your own benefit.</p>

<p>Because, again, mental help for transgender people. Does. Not. Work. It doesn’t have anything to do with big pharma, and nobody who is trans is in denial that they are trans. They don’t honestly believe those breasts don’t exist. They don’t honestly believe chromosomal expression doesn’t exist. They do however, believe in a distinction between the body’s chromosomal expression and that of the brain. Which, again, supported by science and all that. A trans person who denies the existence of their genitalia is actually delusional. Experiencing a male brain in a female body is not delusional.</p>

<p>In order to “fix” the neurological side of this issue, we would need to have neuro-surgical capabilities so advanced as to be science fiction. Neuro-surgical capabilities to re-wire somebody’s personality, to fix schizophrenia and ADHD, to calm aggressive people and embolden skittish ones. In short, things that won’t exist for a very, very long time.</p>

<p>Transitioning physically is the best option by virtue of being the only present solution that works.</p>
