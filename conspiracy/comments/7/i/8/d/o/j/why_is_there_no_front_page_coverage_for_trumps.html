    <div class="md"><p>for decades, US congress and house (dems &amp; reps, left and right) have voted to officially recognize and move the embassy to Jerusalem. </p>

<p>This is not new.  It actually began in 1995. Since then, the Act, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Embassy_Act">Jerusalem Embassy Act</a>, has consistently been supported by the elected officials.  However, it was always shot down by a standing President. </p>

<p>FROM WIKI: 
Despite passage, the law remained unimplemented by Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama,[5] who viewed it as a Congressional infringement on the executive branch&#39;s constitutional authority over foreign policy; they consistently claimed the presidential waiver on national security interests. President Donald Trump signed the waiver in June 2017 before announcing the recognition of Jerusalem in December 2017 and beginning the relocation of the embassy.[6][7]</p>
