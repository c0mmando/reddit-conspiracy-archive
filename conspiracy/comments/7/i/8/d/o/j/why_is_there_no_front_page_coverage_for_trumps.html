       Its crazy because I'm from the UK and the consensus of pretty much all news outlets is that its disrupting one of the most delicate peace processes in the world, and there's just absolutely nothing on reddit. Didn't think America being pro-Israel for no reason was true until now when I've seen it with my own eyes.

       A lot of the support comes from a desire to bring about the biblical apocalypse if it makes you feel better. Don't know why they want to speed that up, but it's a thing.

       AIPAC spends millions, and has many offshoots that now control conversation online.  JIDF, Hasbara are only a couple.  They spend all of their time downvoting and flagging the truth, all over the internet.  Reddit is done.  I'm only here because I have some masochistic tendencies.

       for decades, US congress and house (dems &amp; reps, left and right) have voted to officially recognize and move the embassy to Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not new.  It actually began in 1995. Since then, the Act, known as
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Embassy_Act">
        Jerusalem Embassy Act
       </a>
       , has consistently been supported by the elected officials.  However, it was always shot down by a standing President.
      </p>
      <p>
       FROM WIKI: 
Despite passage, the law remained unimplemented by Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama,[5] who viewed it as a Congressional infringement on the executive branch's constitutional authority over foreign policy; they consistently claimed the presidential waiver on national security interests. President Donald Trump signed the waiver in June 2017 before announcing the recognition of Jerusalem in December 2017 and beginning the relocation of the embassy.[6][7]

       Maybe hasn'T so much to do with the US being pro Israel...
      </p>
      <p>
       This morning i heard an interview with ex-ambassador of Israel in Germany Schimon Stein and he wasn't happy with that decision as he also see's this more as an act of throwing oil in the fire and also said it might have to do with Trumps personality and his other acting, losely charcterized by: just do something and don't think too much about what it could cause.

       No it wasn't? Also checked the highest upvoted WorldNews thread, people don't even know why this matters. Is america really so uneducated on what many in the UK consider one of the most volatile wars at the moment? This is blowing my mind

       There's no way to spin it (or, at least, Q hasn't posted an incoherent rambling about how to spin it yet), so silence is the only possible response if you want to protect your image of Trump as hero.

        <p>
         The law passed in 1995.

        <p>
         Adelson told him to do it for his support.

       <li>
        <p>
         He said he was going to do it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Senate votes 90-0 in June 2017 to do it.

       <li>
        <p>
         So far all indications are that he's trying to keep each of his promises he made campaigning.

       <li>
        <p>
         Since the beginning of time, there has never been peace in the middle east. Even if Israel didn't exist the Muslims would still keep killing each other.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       No secrets or conspiracies that I see. Did you ever think Trump was going to change that somehow?

       Actually, the OP has a point and the reason is simply that the Shadow Government has an Apocalyptic Mindset and they don't like that Trump beat them to the punch cause they were saving that move for the person they decided to put on the throne of their New World Order so they don't want to give it the publicity it obviously deserves...

       Apparently, you missed the part of his article where he places links to several global news media outlets - he was not talking about his front page in Reddit - and exactly what does being a Zionist have to do with it - take your bigotry elsewhere genius - and, it better than being a skinhead...

       Can't we skip that zionist BS for a moment??? There are some  israeli politicans and ex-politicans that are not amused too about Trumps step. Most of them see this as contraproductive at this time, because it harms the peace process, at least the little chances that are there for piece. By your Definition maybe each Israeli or at least each actor in the past governments must be a Zionist correct?
