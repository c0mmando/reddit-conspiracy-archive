        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Picture this. 
-It&#39;s the year 1000 whatever BC. 
-wake up to the morning sunlight and sounds of birds and nature awakening with you. 
-take a nice gulp of fresh water from the clay jug your daughter made for you. 
-A little hungry so to take a few bites of smoked deer meat from the previous day&#39;s hunt. 
-What do you want for breakfast today? 
-You and your best friend sacagawhatever grab a net and stroll through the forrest to the local river. 
-You hop in for a little swim to wake up. 
-You dry in the warmth of the sun while your friend dips the net into the water. 
-Seconds later its filled with three beautiful fresh salmon. 
The river provides more fish than you could ever want, so fishing is that simple. 
You head back to the village to see that the tribes women have gathered a bounty of fresh berries and other wild vegetables from the forrest. 
-You all sit at the hand built feasting table and enjoy the first meal of the day while you discuss what you&#39;d like to do today. 
-You decide on a nice horseback ride with your wife. 
You two hop on your horses and ride off into the valley. 
Find a nice little spot for two and share some honey mead then fuck in the soft grass. 
-Head back for dinner or watch the sunset, The most difficult choice you&#39;ve had to make since many moons ago. 
-such is the life of backwards savages like yourself.</p>

<p>VS</p>

<p>The year 2000 whatever. 
-You awaken to the screech of your pocket computer telling you its 6am. 
-You don&#39;t want to get up so you scroll through r/news on whatever pocket computer you spent an entire months pay on. 
-&quot;10 thousand more politicians and celebrities have been caught raping kittens in their sex dungeons&quot;  &quot;Studies show that 99% of tap water is contaminated with micropenises&quot;  &quot;elderly man trampled to death while hoards of people stampede into walmart to buy cheap slave trinkets&quot;
-Bored with the same new stories you&#39;ve been reading for years you finally come up with enough energy to get out of bed. 
-Your hair looks okay enough to not have to shower that morning so you grab compacted piece of oats and sugar and a genetically engineered apple to eat on the car ride to work. 
-You get to work and what do you know, someone brought doughnuts in. 
-The best news you&#39;ve heard all week. You open the box only to find that there are two quarter pieces of doughnut left because janice feels less fat if you eats her doughnuts one quarter at a time before coming back for more. 
-You go sit inside a small cubicle and get to work. &quot;Good morning sir would you be interest in purchasing an overpriced portion of a tiny condo in miami?&quot;  &quot;Fuck off dude stop calling me!&quot; Next call. &quot;&quot;Good morning miss would you be interest in purchasing an overpriced portion of a tiny condo in miami?&quot; &quot;No fuck off dude&quot;
-After 4 hours of people telling you to fuck off, it&#39;s time for lunch. -You only have half an hour so you stop off at mcdicklicker for some ground animal meat compressed into shapes and dipped in boiling fat. 
-Theres a line at mcdicklickers so you end up taking 31 minutes at lunch. You boss yells at you for your incompetence. By the time you get off work, it&#39;s dark outside. You only see the sun for a few hours each week. 
-You sit on the couch and turn the TV on. It&#39;s CNN &quot;ARE YOUR CHILDREN BEING MOLESTED BY INSTAGRAM??? INSTALL THIS SPYING APP SO YOU CAN MAKE SURE THEY AREN&#39;T GETTING RAPED BY BITCOINS ON THE DARK NET!!!&quot;
-A commercial comes on &quot;have you eaten food in the past decade and now suffer from mesotheleoprah? You could be entitled to give us 90% of your settlement!&quot;  &quot;Do you constantly feel tired and ugly and stupid? 
-You&#39;re clearly suffering from depression, call your doctor and ask about prozuck the newest drug from facebook&quot;
-Hmm you do happen to feel tired and ugly and stupid. Maybe you should call your doctor. You do. He&#39;s delighted to hear that you&#39;re feeling tired and ugly and stupid. Good news for you though for just the low price of 40% of your income and also $2500 a month, the government has graciously agreed to provide you with free prescriptions. Assuming you weren&#39;t previously diagnosed as tired or ugly or stupid or pregnant. You get to the doctors office and he immediately starts writing a prescription for ProzuckTM. As you head out the door you hear &quot;sideeffectsmayincludefeelingevenmoretiredandanduglyandstupidorgettingfatorrandomymurderingyourchildren&quot;
-You get home and take the specified dose of ProzuckTM. 
-A few weeks later and you&#39;ve become so mind numb that you don&#39;t even think about how tired and ugly and stupid you are. Or care about getting told to fuck off all day by potential customers. Wow satisfaction IS guaranteed. 
-You proceed to repeat this for 40 years when you finally get to retire. Then you find out that your pension was a ponzi scheme and they can only pay you $100 a month worth of cat food coupons. -After months of living off nearly expired cat food, you feel ill and head back to the same doctor. He writes you a new prescription in seconds. 
-You head to the pharmacy to fill it but are told it is $500 a pill and they don&#39;t accept cat food coupons. A week later and feel a pain in your chest and collapse to the ground in your bedroom surrounded by piles of dirty cat food containers. </p>

<p>But try suggesting that all this wonderful future technology and way of living isn&#39;t the bees knees and people look at you like you&#39;re some crazy hippie weed smoking crazy person.</p>

<p>EDIT: To the comments that this isn&#39;t a realistic representation of life in the past or everyone&#39;s life currently. Yes I know, it was an exaggeration/satire. My point is that if people wanted to they could live the utopian 1000BC exaggeration right now. You can buy 50 acres of land in Idaho or some other place for the cost of a years average salary, and could live off the land and in nature while also enjoying the modern things that make life easier. But people would rather live in a 500SQ apartment in SF that costs $3500 a month and sit in a chair staring at a computer screen all day, just because their paycheck would be bigger or they would have a higher social status. Despite not actually being happy to the point where they take drugs every day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not saying the present doesn’t suck but your version of the past is a bit rose colored. You’re forgetting:</p>

<p>Unending tribal warfare
Crippling superstitions
The potential depletion and/or sudden loss of flora/fauna
Complete and utter dependence on the whims of Mother Nature 
Limited lifespan for any number of reasons 
Back breaking, unending labor just to survive whether it be having decent shelter or enough food. </p>

<p>There’s probably more...</p>

<p>In the end, there’s never been a perfect time in all of human existence but for me I’ll take the age that includes air conditioning and unending cat videos. </p>

<p>Ding ding ding.</p>

<p>I&#39;m remembering an old documentary (late 70s-early 80s-ish) about the goings on of humanity. In one segment we follow a nomadic people: and there&#39;s a girl who just keeps playing the same tune over and over on a flute, because it&#39;s the only one they know and no one can be bothered with creating anything new.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To add on to this, there is a reason why many modern nomadic people seem &quot;primitive&quot; to the civilized world. Is it because they are ignorant, stupid, lazy, and unimaginative?</p>

<p>ABSOLUTELY NOT, far from it.</p>

<p>Its just their lifestyle prevents them my channeling their abilities to other services and potential innovations. Its difficult to formulate new mathematical principles after 18 hours of hard back-breaking work that  with some exceptions is year round.</p>

<p>You could make a convincing argument that the fact we are facing multiple threats of extinction as a species is because we let guys like this get too far. We are definitely and irrevocably changing the climate and the chemistry of the ocean in the process of increasing CO2 and methane emissions into the atmosphere, thanks to those guys.</p>

<p>At least with the paleolithic or neolithic fantasy, there isn&#39;t global climate devastation caused by the application of science to industrial and commercial processes of production. Oh, and weapons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Picture this. -It&#39;s the year 1000 whatever BC. -wake up to the morning sunlight and sounds of birds and nature awakening with you. Or maybe you didn&#39;t wake up because you died at childbirth. Maybe you were lucky.</p>

<p>-take a nice gulp of fresh water from the clay jug your daughter made for you and hope to whatever gods you worship that you don&#39;t get &quot;the fever&quot; from that water (cholera) since your 32 year old grandma took a shit in it earlier that day.</p>

<p>-A little hungry so to take a few bites of smoked deer meat from the previous day&#39;s hunt. You don&#39;t realize you ingested tape worms that will slowly malnourish you over the next five years.</p>

<p>-You and your best friend sacagawhatever grab a net and stroll through the forrest to the local river, where you both become infected with giardia and have to shit in clay jugs for four days.</p>

<p>-Seconds later its filled with three beautiful fresh salmon. The river provides more fish than you could ever want, so fishing is that simple. You head back to the village to see that the tribes women have gathered a bounty of fresh berries and other wild vegetables from the forrest. Although one of the women fell and fractured her right ankle. She&#39;ll be dead within the week.</p>

<p>-You all sit at the hand built feasting table and enjoy the first meal of the day while you discuss what you&#39;d like to do today. After the six morning funerals, you decide to go ride horses--except there are no horses on the continent and won&#39;t be for another 1500 years.</p>

<p>-Find a nice little spot for two and share some honey mead then fuck in the soft grass. You&#39;ve now shared your public lice with her and got her pregnant. She&#39;ll be dead in nine months during childbirth.</p>

<p>-Head back for dinner or watch the sunset, The most difficult choice you&#39;ve had to make since many moons ago. But then you realize you didn&#39;t actually hunt today so you don&#39;t have any dinner. And that girl you impregnated was the chief&#39;s daughter, so he excommunicates you from the tribe. You&#39;re now forced to live on your own in the wet, cold American northwest. Finally, while slowly freezing to death and dying of malnourishment, Big Foot rapes your ass, kills you and eats your liver.</p>

<p>-such is the death of backwards savages like yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Picture this. -It&#39;s the year 1000 whatever BC.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wake up to the morning sunlight and sounds of birds and nature awakening with you. Your body is strong as are the bodies of most of your clan. There is no heart disease, arthritis, dental decay, or autoimmune diseases. While some children are born weak and die, those that are strong (which is most of them) survive and thrive. Women are strong and childhood diseases are few since cities squalor has not been invented yet. </p></li>
<li><p>take a nice gulp of fresh water THAT YOU HAVE BOILED FOR TEA OR SOME OTHER BREW. You do not get fever from drinking contaminated water because your clan did not raise idiots who poop in their water supply.</p></li>
<li><p>A little hungry so to take a few bites of smoked deer meat from the previous day&#39;s hunt  AFTER YOU HAVE FIRST COOKED IT in hot water or fat as most traditional cultures do. And if you do contract parasites, many common herbs are available nearby to purge yourself of the infection.</p></li>
<li><p>You and your best friend sacagawhatever grab a net and stroll through the forrest to the local river, but you make sure to avoid the contaminated pond where your elders have told you not to swim - because your clan did not raise idiots.</p></li>
<li><p>Seconds later its filled with three beautiful fresh salmon. The river provides more fish than you could ever want, so fishing is that simple. You head back to the village to see that the tribes women have gathered a bounty of fresh berries and other wild vegetables from the forest. Although one of the women fell and fractured her right ankle. But everything is OK. Using a poultice of medicinal plants and wild honey, infection is prevented, and the fracture heals. The woman does not experience any pain because the she eats the opium poppies that your grandmother has grown and dried.</p></li>
<li><p>You all sit at the hand built feasting table and enjoy the first meal of the day while you discuss what you&#39;d like to do today. It&#39;s a sacred day of the season, so you get on your horse to visit the burial mounds of your elders. You can get on a horse because the horse was domesticated about 6000 years ago on the plains of Asia. If you&#39;re in North America, you&#39;d just go out for a nice run which is both invigorating and fun.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a nice little spot for two and share some honey mead then fuck in the soft grass. Neither of you has pubic lice because depending on your culture, you&#39;ve picked them out manually, used a bone comb to pull them out, or shaved you nether regions. You do indeed get the girl pregnant, and this is a glorious thing. Some millennia later, humans may find this a &quot;problem&quot;, but calling the creation of new life a &quot;problem&quot; is truly madness. She is strong as was her mother and her grandmother, and nine months later her childbirth is uneventful and easy.</p></li>
<li><p>Head back for dinner or watch the sunset, The most difficult choice you&#39;ve had to make since many moons ago. But then you realize you didn&#39;t actually hunt today so you don&#39;t have any dinner. And then you realize that your whole clan has stored provisions when the harvest and hunts were bountiful. And you also realize that your now extended family has already prepared a feast for the clan on this sacred day. You decide to watch the sunset, but hurry home before dark, and meet your friends and family for the meal.</p></li>
<li><p>That night you dream a terrible dream: In the future, 2000 AD, men living desperate, poisoned lives. So sick that they can live with only medicines constantly flowing through them. Yet they do not know it, and claim themselves the greatest and happiest people in all of time. And when they speak of the past, they recall only fear, disease, and death, because those are ancient things, and in 2000 AD, men <em>must</em> be better than the primitive savages for how else could they be the greatest and happiest of all time if this were not so?</p></li>
<li><p>The dream troubles you, but you quickly shake it off, rolling over to your now pregnant wife who responds to your touch. And under moonlight and lingering smoke, you make love once again.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Why&#39;s it have to be year 1000bc? There&#39;s still plenty of indigenous, hunter-gatherer, tribes out there in the jungles and bushlands doing their thing.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t say it sounds all that idyllic, what with one supposedly <a href="https://www.samaritanspurse.org/article/an-airstrip-for-the-hewa-tribe/">boasting a child mortality rate at some 80%...</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just rolling with the 1000BC reference in the OP.</p>

<p>So something to keep in mind about these modern day &quot;stone age&quot; communities is that they&#39;re the rat tail of more robust and vibrant communities of the past. They&#39;re in a bad situation due to environmental damage, pollution, and encroachment.</p>

<p>If you were to look at Native American tribes during the mid to late 1800&#39;s, you&#39;d see widespread illness, famine, and communities on decline. This, however, was the direct result of European colonialism and the ensuing American conquest of North America. It&#39;s by no means a good reflection of how they did thrive when left to their own devices in an environment that was both plentiful and providing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So wait, you made a big post about how life was better in the old days, then reference Native Americans who have been notoriously ill treated for not being advanced enough? </p>

<p>So basically, life was better in the old days, before you where all killed and enslaved by people with more technology? </p>

<p>Actually, you&#39;re not very good at understanding my points.</p>

<p>You&#39;re confusing the time periods and my intentions. I thought I had been clear, but I&#39;ll try to be clearer.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying &quot;life in the old days&quot; was better. I was saying life in &quot;1000BC&quot;, aka in the <strong>pre-industrial</strong>, <strong>pre-urban</strong> world was not a hell hole that the previous post was making it out to be AND that modern day people look down on past ages in order to justify their own existence.</p>

<p>I AM NOT saying that low technology can defeat high technology. Furthermore, it is possible for a happy people with low technology to be defeated by an unhappy people with high technology. Whether or not a people are defeated has nothing to do with their actual happiness or health level.</p>

<p>My only point is that in the past, people had it good, and we shouldn&#39;t dismiss that old way of life by simply assuming that it was terrible in comparison to now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is absolutely absurd.  This idealistic viewpoint is just that; incredibly idealistic and out of touch with reality.  Life before modern technology and society was fucking <em>suffering</em> for a huge number of people.  Endless, constant suffering.  Raids and slaughter by neighboring tribes.  Cultural rituals to mutilate your body.  Complete non-understanding of the realities of the world, so that one was subjected to horrific diseases that they believed were due to the gods.  Sacrificed by your own parents for a good crop season.  Famine.  Sadness. </p>

<p>Want to know how people lived and died back in the day?  Look at animals living in the forests today.  Mauled by predators.  Burnt in forest fires.  Starvation.  Freezing to death.  Those were the realities of prehistoric humans.</p>

<p>Not to mention, if we wanted to go back to that lifestyle, the overpopulation and lack of survival skills that are no longer part of our culture would lead to endless war, cannibalism, tribalism, and a massive &quot;thinning&quot; of the population.. 75% of everyone you know and love would die.</p>

<p>You haven&#39;t put any thought into this.  Sorry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see a lot of people hating on you here but I agree with your sentiment and my impression of what you wrote is not that we would go back to “1000 BC” as it was, but maybe a modernized version of it. Why can’t it be a more wide spread or practiced way of living, while also incorporating some of the modern conveniences and technology that we have. Clearly we aren’t going to let ourselves be mauled by a pack of hungry bears or die by 30 due to exposure or due to being overworked and we are not going to have a modern day “tribe war.” Anyway I just thought some people were being too harsh and I enjoyed the read. Why can’t things just be a little simpler again is what I’m hearing... why can’t we just enjoy life and all it has to offer instead of chasing some green paper for 60 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was exaggerating. My point is that nature used to be so bountiful that people didn&#39;t have to worry about rent or feeding their family. Which are the main things people worry about constantly. We have advanced to the point where we could easily live that utopian dream i posted about. But we choose not to. 
ANd honestly is the past worse? Sure people die younger and life is &quot;harder&quot; in general. But is life really better when literally 30% of americans are on antidepressants? How can you say life is so much better when half of people are so unhappy they literally need to take drugs every day just to not kill themselves?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the Roman elite had it best. Even the non elite citizens before rome collapsed. They had amazing healthy food. Clean water and sewage systems. They all had their turn in the massive bath house swimming in pools, hot tubs, getting massaged. They considered wrestling and exercise very important. Had actual classes and personal tutors to teach life skills instead of just memorizing bullshit. Had dope ass gladiators and chariot races. Life is centered around socializing with your peers.
That time period seems great. As well as earlier tribal or even aztec/inca civilizations during the time where there was little conflict. Just socializing and focussing on improving society as a whole while having no stress about &quot;rent&quot; or where your next meal came from. 
Now it&#39;s just every man for themselves fuck mankind as a whole I&#39;ll starve a million kids to death just to sanction some oil rich arabs who don&#39;t do what I say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol I know what you&#39;re saying. It was mostly a satire post, ut I made an edit to address all those things. If we hadn&#39;t have poisoned the land and overfished and polluted our rivers and oceans, we could live like that today. With all out modern amenities. We could have bathrooms and showers and toilet paper and phones. While also not have to work at a cubicle all day or eat GMO food from a box. Or feel like shit all the time and need drugs to get by. But the few at the top have gotten so greedy that they would rather have themselves have anything they want at anytime, than out entire species live in peace and harmony for eternity. They would rather feel superior to everyone else, despite the fact that they are destroying humanity and the earth in the process, than be just as happy but equal to everyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your dream sounds like boring Bullshit no offense. We’re progressing, changing, and growing. Life sucks. It’s also amazing. And it sucks a lot less because of the generations before us that worked their asses off for the cushy existences we whine about in the present. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see why you seem to think that &quot;working your ass off&quot; like people did in the past sucks so much. People spend thousands of dollars sending their kids to summer camp where they live in cabins and ride horses and do archery and all that type of shit that you think sucks so much. It is rare these days that you don&#39;t find someone who isn&#39;t depressed or has ad anxiety or some other mental issues. Half of Americans are predicted to be obese in the very near future. Diabetes is skyrocketing. Most people eat out of boxes of dried shitty food filled with preservatives and other bullshit. 95% of our water has microplastic in it that is fucking with endocrine systems. If that is the nice cushy life generations before us worked so hard at creating than count me out. I&#39;d much rather have to fish for a meal and be outside all day even though is such &quot;hard&quot; work. People look forward to hunting and fishing during their vacations from work. Or take time off to go camping or hiking with their family. People literally work their asses off to afford vacation time so they can go and spend a week doing what you could literally do your entire life if you weren&#39;t working some shit 9-5 every day.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not advocating people live like cave men or the amish. We can still have phones and planes and all this wonderful technology while also living in harmony with nature and not subjecting ourselves to a lifetime of miserable 9-5 shit. The baby boomer generation has almost singlehandedly destroyed the entire word&#39;s ecology with that kind of life constantly working in order to buy material things. The path we are on will literally destroy billions of years of natural evolution on this planet if we continue on this path. It is already probably to late even if we do make drastic changes right now. </p>
