       Something is unfolding, that much is clear. Is anyone familiar enough with crime statistics to be able to compare the number of trafficking arrests during each of the recent few administrations?
      </p>
      <p>
       If there really is as much of a difference as Lady MegBeth clearly indicates, that comparison would make the claim of Trump being "just another puppet" practically void.

       Well, there is one:
       <a href="http://human.globalincidentmap.com">
        http://human.globalincidentmap.com
       </a>
       Click the green human trafficking button at the right. You can do a search on this database and narrow the search with start and end date. There's a lot of info on that site, all incidents are with a source. If you narrow the search to 2 years you will also see a big rise in US-cases.

       Wow, the east coast is a hotbed of trafficking stories. Thanks for the link.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess to actually compare the "success rate" in federal anti-trafficking operations between the last few presidencies I'd have to go through each incident recording the numbers manually. I'm afraid I can't spare that time at the moment, but if anyone can, it might prove to be a pertinent statistic to have on hand in times like these.

       Maybe I'll be able to go through a couple of years on the weekend.

       She implies that the society is not ready:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        " In hinsight, it was all shits and giggles just thinking the government fucked with our taxes, our economy, our laws, freedoms, rights, liberties, health, healthcare, educations and pursuits of happiness, right?! Now weâ€™re forced to realize theyâ€™ve literally trafficked, abused, fucked and murdered, our innocent children... all in our own country, under our own noses, for decades. Thatâ€™s not only a ridiculously tough, but very emotional, deeply personal pill of reality, for anyone to swallow... let alone EVERYONE to swallow, at the same time. Which in reality, is exactly what youâ€™d need to accomplish, to ever beat it, right? Youâ€™d need EVERYONE to not only know and accept the fact that itâ€™s not only happening on the levels and to the extent that it is, but youâ€™d also need them all to know and accept it, to that extreme extent, at exactly the same time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sure WE want to see it all drop, right now and watch them all burn to the ground for it, but thatâ€™s only because WE have already had time to slowly and progressively research, read, learn, absorb, mentally/emotionally/logically process it all and then factually accept and acknowledge the reality. WE are a very slim minority though and you need to remember that because realistically itâ€™s very important. "

       I think this 'society is not ready' thing is a load of crap. Yeah people will be shocked and upset and devastated and emotionally and psychologically scarred, but people are resilient and it is really needed for this to ever stop. Most people would much prefer to find out about this stuff and feel shocked and appalled and horrified and deceived than for it to cntinue happening in secret with these types of monsters getting away with it. It's wrong to keep this from the people as though they're all just too delicate and pathetic to face up to what's been going on - this is way more important than how bad people are going to feel about it, what about all the people and children who are being abused by this stuff, what about how they feel?!

       I think it has more to do with public confidence and concerns over economic collapse on a global scale, not just "feelings". I'm as anxious for full disclosure as anyone, but I understand being prudent in order to avoid a massive depression.

       Civilization as a whole is a very fragile phenomena. It depends on all the relevant pieces (infrastructure) to believe in and therefore faithfully fulfill their duties. If the false-pretense of democracy, freedom, and equal protection under the law fail, there are substantial consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       We saw it happen on a smaller scale w/Trump being elected. Enough people realized that the system was rigged, and they voted for the guy who vowed to save it and turn it around (Make America Great
       <strong>
        Again
       </strong>
       ), but at what point would people just say fuck it and completely disregard the old system for which the world has come to depend? Innocent young children being raped, tortured, murdered, and in some cases eaten, might just be that tipping point.

       I agree.  And for goodness sake, if these stories are true, little children are being violently abused with no chance for help.  I can not handle the thought of THAT much more than I can not handle the fact that it happened.  That people know and are not putting an end to it and making everyone known makes them complicit.

       People believe the government looks out for them. What happens if they lose that mindset? They go through stages of grief, like with any loss. What's the first stage? Denial.

      <p>
       Say they release the blackmail tapes and life insurance file. What will the media say? "Fake news." "Look how good CGI has gotten." People will believe the media because they don't want to believe it's true.

      <p>
       Why did Trump recently say he thinks the Access Hollywood tape is fake, after he already confirmed it? What did the media say in response? What did Billy Bush (cousin of George Bush) say in response? What precedent is now set when a political sex video leaks?

       Got a comment here...listening to the current Tom Clancy franchise book called Power and Empire (shut up - long drive - got sucked in on a road trip) and one of the sub-plot involves the FBI's child exploitation department and child sex trafficking.  Specifically, selling children, latino brothels, child snuff films, all the horrible shit you've heard about.  All of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       A LOT of people will read this book this month -
       <strong>
        millions
       </strong>
       .  So, more of them will be ready (though no doubt sickened) to accept these monsters exist.

       Good point well made, it's going to be interesting to see how this rolls out mainstream, this could be the spark that sets it off, of all the things that people will let slide, as you mentioned this has to be the thing that the majority of people will surely have a real emotional response too and hopefully bring about the right kind of change.

       True words. I seem to remember that HLI made a similar point about the potentially destructive force these kinds of truths can bring with them if they aren't handled with the utmost care.
      </p>
      <p>
       I need only look at my own experience. I know these things to be going on without the shadow of a doubt at this point, as most of us do on this board, but I can't say I've fully grasped the reality yet of what that truly means. Megs describes it well. We all knew this shit for way too long without allowing ourselves to fully understand the fucking terror which has been cast onto this world by a handful of powerful, degenerate fucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that the veil would appear to be closer to being lifted than ever before in our history, it seems like a good time to come to grips with what we know so we can help our friends and families cope with this ever-increasing madness we find underneath.

You're never going to see Hillary and 30% of congress (on both sides of the aisle) going down for pizza. Not because YOU (and the rest of /pol/ type people) couldn't handle it, but because THE MASSES COULDNT HANDLE IT. It was literally JFK and Reagan's biggest concerns and it's specifically why they BOTH AND MANY OTHERS, have held back a lot. It's also our next best shot (Trump's) biggest concern. Do you realize on a completely rational level what would happen if a president or anyone with as much comparable clout, authority or national recognition, dumped this kind of shit without planning and preparation?! I mean aren't you and a majority of the people HERE ON /pol/ because you CAN'T talk about this shit to an overwhelming majority of everyone you know, the way it SHOULD be talked about?! You're just YOU. Imagine being a fucking "truther" president of the UNITED STATES OF FUCKING AMERICA... which is basically like being the leader of the world considering how much the rest of the world, depends on us. Think about it. "

       Yeah, the "public" is used to dribs and drabs of Florida men raping a baby dead, high on opioids, but I can't' imagine if a cabal of pedophiles, in high elected offices, were exposed as child traffickers and users, and blackmailers, etc. All the "charities", all the corrupt political foundations, all the bankers tied to this shit, all the misjustice from the courts, the cover-ups by agencies.

       Lately there has been a spate of arrests in the US, but over in the UK we seem to suppress them under the guise of national security, which says to me these are high ranking members of society. I hope the arrests continue, but we will never get them all, if this continues maybe it will send a message to paedophiles that they are not safe in society. I really want to see the ones at the top fall

       Pizzagate is not unilaterally republican. Sure it sprung up from podesta but the vast majority of people want all these sick fucks put away. There's no party line when it comes to hurting children.

       Considering there's a huge overlap of T_D users who support Moore and would vote for him over a Democrat any day then it does have to do with it. Look at people who post about pizzagate, T_D posters.

       They are so quick to care about kids that they'll ignore the fact that the president is accused of being a pedophile on record. Now they support an open alleged pedophile with multiple accusers.

       if they were the same about both sides, as they should be, then it wouldn't be an issue.

       Roy Moore is in Alabama. and people there are voting for not because theyâ€™d rather have a pedophile than a democrat. THEY WONT TRUST THE DEMOCRATS. PERIOD. ON ANYTHING.
      </p>
      <p>
       if someone had said to you, in 2016 weâ€™d have a party that sold nuclear materials to russia, paid Iran trillions of dollars, sold guns to marco terrorist in mexico, met with social media execs once a month for 8 years about god knows what, expanded torture, expanded printing money expanded debt, expanded war, allowed a embassy to come under play tack ( idle failed to provide aid) and then tried to blame it i a jewish filmmaker, rigged an election, infiltrated the media and the Catholic church. and tried to get us into a war with Russian after they lost the election, a bee white president being blamed for policing that was deemed racist and that started under a black president, or that a presidential candidate would have a rapist as a husband and then the nerve to cry sexual harassment to her opponent, well..... people would  tell you your crazy. but it happened, and no one seems to care. except  Republicans. who are so sick of the corruption on the left , they canâ€™t or wonâ€™t even trust them about ANYTHING anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       and since Gloria Allred has zero credibility and wonâ€™t turn over evidence and the step son of the accuser has said that the accuser has taken money to make these claims , well you have to wonder who is right and who is lying.  it sure who. but i know has lied more than anyone else. and it ainâ€™t Roy Moore.
      </p>
      <p>
       though if he did do it, iâ€™d hope everyone could come together put him in jail.

       It stained the collective mind long enough. Its fun watching maher trying to get outraged about republican sex scandals but say nothing about pizzagate. Mentioned it once like 11 months ago and zilch.

       Are you triggered? Sorry for getting into your safespace and interrupting your little circular masturbation session

       I'm sorry for "invading
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       subreddit", i actually like the discussions about conspiracy theories, it's just that it's ao blatantly obvious that this "pizzagate" thing is a partisan false flag to get people riled up that it makes me sad

       This is my thoughts too. Here in the states they are rounding some people up, but I'm wondering if it's just people being thrown under the bus from up top...
