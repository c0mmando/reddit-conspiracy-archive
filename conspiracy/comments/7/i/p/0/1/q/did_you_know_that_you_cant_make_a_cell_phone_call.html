<p>People say that building 7 is the easiest way to show someone that there&#39;s fuckery a foot when it comes to 9/11. I have to disagree. The supposed cell phone calls made by passengers on 9/11 could not have happened. It&#39;s impossible. There isn&#39;t a rational person out there who could hear that and not question the official narrative. </p>

<p>You be the judge, here&#39;s the official logs for flight altitude of flight 93</p>

<p><a href="https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ua93altitude.jpg">https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ua93altitude.jpg</a></p>

<p>As you can see there&#39;s only a small window under 10,000 feet at take off and towards the end near the crash. </p>

<p>And here&#39;s a time line of the phone calls</p>

<p><a href="http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?day_of_9/11=complete_911_timeline_alleged_passenger_phone_calls&amp;amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline">http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?day_of_9/11=complete_911_timeline_alleged_passenger_phone_calls&amp;amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline</a></p>

<p>And hear we see multiple lengthy cell phone calls made from flight 93 while they were well out of range of any cell tower. </p>

<p>As I said you be the judge. </p>

<p>I know you&#39;ll vote me down.</p>

<p>But, I personally, the person typing this out, made a cell phone call from a plane while at cruising altitude.</p>

<p>This happened several years ago.  We were flying, and my wife handed me her cell phone.  It was on.  She had forgotten to turn it off.  Her phone is older (still digital, but not a smart phone).  To turn off the phone, you press and hold the END button.  I was trying to turn it off, and I pressed the Send button instead of the end button. When I released the Send button, it said &quot;calling home&quot;.  Amused, I placed the phone to my ear, expecting nothing.  To my surprised, I heard ringing, then I heard our answering machine start.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve left my work phone turned on in my laptop bag by mistake many times in the past few years. The only thing that alerted me to it being turned on is that it was vibrations coming from the bag, because I was receiving back to back calls about 40 minutes into flight. Once I noticed this I quickly turned my phone off out of fear that the plane would magically fall out of the sky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely false. They’re have been a few studies on this using different phones and carriers and the highest altitude that you can still use a cell phone was 13,000 feet.</p>

<p>The biggest problem for the 9/11 calls was not only the altitude but the speed. The planes were traveling at 500+ mph. There is no way someone would be able to maintain a connection between towers without dropping the call.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is correct. I&#39;m an electrical engineer and designed a system to send SMS messages containing gps data. We hook this device onto high altitude balloons to track their progress. This module is only useful as a back-up tracking method because it won&#39;t be able to transmit data starting at 6000 feet and above.  We have to use APRS data if we want to track a higher altitude balloon</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Hi mom? Mom it&#39;s me, &lt;name&gt;. Do you believe me?&quot; </p>

<p>How did anyone buy that one? Who has to tell their mom who they are when they call, much less ask if they believe it&#39;s them? On top of that, who would take the time for all that when your plane just got hijacked? </p>

<p>Cell phones didn&#39;t work on planes in 2001 though. Not even close. It was years later before they added amplifiers to planes so that you could get any signal at all. </p>
