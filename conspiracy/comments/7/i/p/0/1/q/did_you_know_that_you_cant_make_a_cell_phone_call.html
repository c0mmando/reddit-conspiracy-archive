       Not in the sense that it's banned (Which it is by the FAA), I mean that once the plane is out of range of a cell tower (which is guaranteed once you surpass 10,000 feet) you phone will not can cannot connect to any cellular network. You can't make cell phone calls period.

       People say that building 7 is the easiest way to show someone that there's fuckery a foot when it comes to 9/11. I have to disagree. The supposed cell phone calls made by passengers on 9/11 could not have happened. It's impossible. There isn't a rational person out there who could hear that and not question the official narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       You be the judge, here's the official logs for flight altitude of flight 93
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       As you can see there's only a small window under 10,000 feet at take off and towards the end near the crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       And here's a time line of the phone calls
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?day_of_9/11=complete_911_timeline_alleged_passenger_phone_calls&amp;amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline">

      </p>
      <p>
       And hear we see multiple lengthy cell phone calls made from flight 93 while they were well out of range of any cell tower.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said you be the judge.

       Nah, some of the family members said the caller ID showed it was from cellphone numbers they recognized. I'm pretty sure that is even in the 9/11 Commission Report.

       There's a distinction between the two. There are multiple plan phone calls, but also desperate calls from passengers personal cell phones. If you read the call logs and links provided you'll see that.

       But, I personally, the person typing this out, made a cell phone call from a plane while at cruising altitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       This happened several years ago.  We were flying, and my wife handed me her cell phone.  It was on.  She had forgotten to turn it off.  Her phone is older (still digital, but not a smart phone).  To turn off the phone, you press and hold the END button.  I was trying to turn it off, and I pressed the Send button instead of the end button. When I released the Send button, it said "calling home".  Amused, I placed the phone to my ear, expecting nothing.  To my surprised, I heard ringing, then I heard our answering machine start.

       We used to have the technology to make cel phone calls from airplanes. It didn’t matter how high or how fast the plane was going either, the reception sounded like you were in the next room. Even when the plane was doing multiple G climbs and dives, the call sounded calm and quiet.

       Unfortunately it only worked on 9/11.

       AND....All these years later we still believe whatever they feed us. For example, who really knows whether the narrative of the NOKO situation is correct. In regular life when someone bullshits you, generally you believe them less. The magic of changing, personnel every four to eight years does a splendid job of making us forget it's not the front men that are lying to us.

       If this was the case people making calls on planes wouldnt be the hot button issue that it was over the last year. While traditional towers might not be omnidirectional their 20-50mile range couple with bleed off and the curvature of the earth means youll get a shit signal at cruising altitude in just about any where that isnt Bumfuck, Egypt.

       Really! Maybe you should try it, it's not entirely safe to do so but give it a go.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've left my work phone turned on in my laptop bag by mistake many times in the past few years. The only thing that alerted me to it being turned on is that it was vibrations coming from the bag, because I was receiving back to back calls about 40 minutes into flight. Once I noticed this I quickly turned my phone off out of fear that the plane would magically fall out of the sky.

       Thats just the on paper range.    It's not an absolute.

       In real use phones work pretty high up depending on the area and coverage and tons of other things.

       30-40k horz is quite normal.   heck the old gsm would do 22 miles as the standard.   (35k)

       I'm not sure going back what that would have been in use in ny area.
      </p>
      <p>
       But most of the tech could work (unreliably) at 40k feet up.

      <p>
       Maybe being nyc area would help too.  tons of antennas with a large degree of vertical seperation.

       damm good odds the signal goes thru.

       Absolutely false. They’re have been a few studies on this using different phones and carriers and the highest altitude that you can still use a cell phone was 13,000 feet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest problem for the 9/11 calls was not only the altitude but the speed. The planes were traveling at 500+ mph. There is no way someone would be able to maintain a connection between towers without dropping the call.

       I was on the plane’s WiFi and had Verizon “WiFi assist” turned on, so that might have been why it was possible.

       This is correct. I'm an electrical engineer and designed a system to send SMS messages containing gps data. We hook this device onto high altitude balloons to track their progress. This module is only useful as a back-up tracking method because it won't be able to transmit data starting at 6000 feet and above.  We have to use APRS data if we want to track a higher altitude balloon

       How did anyone buy that one? Who has to tell their mom who they are when they call, much less ask if they believe it's them? On top of that, who would take the time for all that when your plane just got hijacked?
      </p>
      <p>
       Cell phones didn't work on planes in 2001 though. Not even close. It was years later before they added amplifiers to planes so that you could get any signal at all.
